143,Fantastic Afternoon Tea Experience,Crystal Moon was such a delightful place to celebrate our golden wedding anniversary. From the moment we stopped in the hotel every member of staff we met was extremely pleasant and helpful nothing we asked for was too much trouble.  Afternoon tea was a delight very tasty sandwiches scones and cakes.,5,2024,10,19
143,Happy to recommend this hotel,"We had a wonderful stay at one of our favourite hotels in London. We were very well looked after by all the staff.  The rooms are very spacious including a walk in closet and roomy bathroom.
Its centrally located so easy to get to restaurants, theatres etc
Happy to recommend anyone staying here when in London.",5,2024,10,17
143,London’s Best All Around Hotel Experience,"The Corinthia London opened in 2011, so one could rightly note that the rooms could use just the tiniest bit of refresh. Fortunately, they are also spacious, quiet and perfectly maintained. 

In almost every other way, this is a superlative property. Normally, we prefer smaller hotels because the service is superior: the Corinthia is the exception. We were greeting by Camilla at reception when we checked in. She took the time to show us all of the restaurants and public spaces, before personally escorting us to our room, and then turning us over to the spa team for a tour of the five-story facility. Meanwhile, she had housekeeping pick up our dry cleaning for express service returned the next day. These may sound like small gestures but after a long day of traveling, they were most appreciated. 

Equally, the concierge team is superlative. They made reservations for us in advance of our arrival, and then cancelled them when we changed our mind. In the end, they got us into Berenjak Borough for Persian food. We had not previously heard of the place, but walked away having eaten the best lamb kebabs of our lives. 

Finally, there is the F&B operation. There is a lovely outdoor space – amply heated – that serves what might be best called comfort Italian food. The bartender also makes a fiercely good gimlet. It was a perfect conclusion to a day of travel. And for those who cannot conceive of London without tea, the Corinthia offers a beautiful looking high tea and an informal cream tea. We tried the latter, which was marvelous and just enough to hold us over to our next trip. Thank you Benoit for making it such a pleasant experience.

Our only other potential concern was the location. Whitehall isn’t exactly the center of the action. So if you prefer the Mayfair or Knightsbridge, this is not going to work for you. But if you’re in London for theatre or culture, the location is superb. It’s 8 minutes to the National Gallery, 15 minutes or less to most of the West End theaters, and 15 minutes walking to the Tate Modern. That’s not bad at all for a city the size of London. 

We’ve stayed in London on many previous occasions, but the Corinthia London has delivered our best all around hotel experience.",5,2024,10,15
143,Luxury in the heart of London,"We originally stayed at this hotel the night before and on our wedding, and thought it'd be great to come back for an anniversary. Well what can I really say when a hotel never fails to impress? The service, as always, is impeccable and the spa, as always, is pure indulgence. We were pleasantly surprised to get our room upgraded to a deluxe junior suite, and oh boy was this a treat! Everything about our stay was seamless, professional, comfortable, simply perfect. 

Thank you to all the staff at Corinthia London, for making our stay so memorable. We will see you again soon!",5,2024,10,09
143,Home away from home !!,"The warmest welcome from the concierge, and a welcome home type of check in is exactly what the team delivered. All F&B avenues exceeded my expectations and every single one of the team were willing and eager to make my stay special. 

The new house champagne is a must try - LP heritage !!",5,2024,10,02
143,Waste of $1000 per night,Large bathroom and bedroom but no vanity for a woman to blow dry and style hair!  Housekeeping gave excuse that due to high demand they could not even provide me with a portable makeup mirror. So mine was not the only one inadequately fitted. Nowhere in the room was there adequate lighting or a mirror. Unacceptable!,1,2024,09,26
143,Special experience,"I wouldn’t normally frequent somewhere like this and am so glad I got the opportunity to. I spent the day at an event and had lunch. The service, from the moment I stepped up to the door to the moment I left, was impeccable, attentive but not intrusive. The food was a delight, cooked to perfection and ideal portion size. The bathrooms were all clean and well stocked with lovely cream and soap. Thank you.",5,2024,09,20
143,Wonderful experience,"Fantastic location, room, amenities and staff. What made it so memorable was Aaron, one of the doormen. He was so welcoming and engaging. Most appreciated were the stories and history of several “off the beaten path” hidden treasures he suggested we look for in London. This really enhanced the enjoyment of our visit. Thank you, Aaron!",5,2024,09,19
143,I will be back!!,"One of the best accommodations I’ve ever been. The room was spacious with a small balcony, great and quality amenities and excellent service. The breakfast was delicious, too.
Also, I have to mention that their spa is a little gem! Great overall experience",5,2024,09,14
143,Professional staff,"What make our stay at the Corinthia special was the staff, how helpful and pleasant they were.

The rooms are immaculate.

Prices are expensive,  the location is good. 

I liked the Spa, except at family time when it can be hard to relax.

The fresh flowers everywhere make the hotel even more special.",5,2024,09,14
143,So good that I'm deducting a star out of sheer pettiness,"I've previously stayed at, and been greatly impressed by Corinthia's Budapest and Lisbon locations. I'm pleased to say the London outpost lives up to their very high standards. 

Almost everything is done exceptionally well, but it's always the staff who set Corinthia apart. That they get it so consistently right across the countless, individually insignificant interactions over the duration of a stay is a phenomenal achievement at this scale. 

So why 4 stars, not 5? Because I know how good they are, I hold them to standards which would be unreasonable almost anywhere else. And it pains me to report that the cooked breakfast was mildly disappointing. Less than perfectly cooked and — with the exception of some… well, exceptional black pudding — unremarkable ingredients. 

That's it. Everything else was every bit as good as the thousands of 5 star reviews lead you to believe it should be.",4,2024,09,03
143,Superb!,"Absolute perfection. From the incredible rooms, delicious food, accommodating staff and beautiful decor, the Corinthia provides for the perfect stay in London. It has a convenient location. It is elegant and I can't think of a more perfect place to stay in London. Don't forget the spa! I travel often and try a massage everywhere that I go. I can say this was one of the best massages that I've ever received.",5,2024,09,02
143,Great hotel in a great area,"This is a great hotel in a great location. 

The rooms are very large   They have a separate closet and bathroom. 

The beds, sheets and pillows are all very nice. They have good bath products as well. The bathroom has a tub and a shower. 

The ac which is in the room portion works very well. Especially if you close the doors leading to the bedroom. That will keep it much cooler. 

They give you new water every day. And at turn down they give you a lavender sachet. That is a nice touch. 

The rooms are dated. They really need a refurbishment to keep up with the value they put in the rooms. The carpet is worn and none of the shades in the 4 windows worked and  could not be raised. 

The spa area was nice and relaxing as long as you don’t go during family time. 
The robes are enormous and weigh more than any robe we have ever used.",4,2024,08,31
143,London Best,"The hotel offers, great ambience, incredible rooms, every detail taken care of. 

The staff, restaurants/bars, including Velvet Alfresco! Are all nothing short of fabulous.   This definitely should be your place to visit while in town and if you get the chance to stay, it will be memorable.",5,2024,08,27
143,London's finest,"From arrival to departure, this hotel is welcoming luxury at its finest.  Rooms are spacious and well-appointed and the Food and Beverage experiences were all exceptional.  The real ""crown jewel"" of Corinthia London is the team - every team member that we encountered had a true passion for hospitality, and it showed effortlessly.  
Don't miss the opportunity to enjoy high tea is the picturesque lobby - it was a true highlight of our stay!",5,2024,08,26
143,Luxury at its finest,"Stayed here for a week with family - simply blown away by the property, the timeless elegance, the service, and the experience of old school British luxury.
Staff is simply amazing - very courteous and prompt with any requests - from housekeeping to reception to wait staff at the restaurants. 
Breakfast at the restaurant was awesome. Freshly made granola and freshly squeezed juices were the highlight for us. Beautiful lighting in the restaurant, so remember to take some pictures!
The hotel smells amazing. Fresh flower arrangements through the interior and exterior of the property.
Fitness center - top marks. Well equipped with Technogym treadmills, entire weight machine collection, and 2 Peloton bikes. I just wish they had a lap pool, their current pool is way too small. 
Overall an exemplary experience! Will absolutely positively be staying here again!",5,2024,08,26
143,A must stay for everyone!!,"We have stayed in some amazing hotels, the Corinthia London has to be one of the ultimate!
The opulence, style and sheer attention to detail is second to none.. It is sometimes said that quality is in the eye of the beholder, yes, true, however, you can definitely see that the hard work and expertise of all the staff make this hotel a real must see/stay in anyone’s bucket list.",5,2024,08,26
143,A sublime experience which is very hard to fault…,"We had a fantastic stay at the Corinthia for a birthday celebration. 

In summary:

HOTEL - Lovely spaces, fresh flowers everywhere from the ground floor open plan florists. The decor is stylishly done but in my opinion, not glitzy or overly flash.

LOCATION - very central, but just off the beaten track so was mostly quiet. Most major sights are easily walkable.

ROOM - comfy, big bed, an old school charm to the fit out. Loved that the TV had all the sports channel subscriptions.

SERVICE- impeccable, nothing was too much trouble and any request was dealt with immediately and in a friendly way.  I Loved the little touches like when checking in you are greeted in the foyer, brought to the desk, checked in and then given a tour of the hotel and then taken to your room, all by the same person. At breakfast you might be served by multiple people, but they all address you by your name.

SPA - Unbelievable really, it’s spread across 4 floors…it must have cost multiple millions to fit out. Highlights were the stainless steel infinity pool, the glazed box sauna with ice fountain outside. The male changing rooms have multiple places to sit and relax, its own sauna etc.  Gym was large and super high spec.

FOOD. Kerridge’s was really good, we had a quick pre theatre plat du jour menu, which was very tasty, quickly served as we only had an hour and good value. Breakfasts in the Northall restaurant was flawlessly really, nice touch that you walk through to the main part of the dining room through a vestibule which has an open kitchen area so you can see everything being cooked.

We had a fantastic stay, this hotel just delivers a sublime experience, highly recommended.",5,2024,08,25
143,Awesome experience for our whole family,"The entire staff at the Corinthia was incredibly attentive.  They go out of their way to be helpful without being unobtrusive.  From the minute we checked in to the second we checked out, every need was attended -- even ones we didn't realize we had.  The hotel is so conveniently located in the Embankment area -- just steps from the pier to grab the Uber Boat, or the underground.  We were within walking distance of the Churchill War Rooms, Picadilly Circus, the London Eye, etc.  Our kids are begging to stay here again the next time we go to London!  But they insist, next time, they would like to do afternoon tea here as part of their stay.",5,2024,08,25
143,Absolutely Wonderful,"Went to the hotel to celebrate my birthday with friends. We all had afternoon tea in the Crystal Moon Lounge then we stayed the night at the hotel.

We checked in at 3.00pm  which I know is the busiest time, but had no queue and we were shown straight to our room.

The tea was fantastic, everyone really enjoyed it and thought the service was exceptional.

All the staff we came into contact with were so professional, but also friendly.

Glad I came to the hotel for my celebration, great job, thank you.",5,2024,08,20
143,Fabulous stay at the Corinthia,"Had the most fantastic time staying at the Corinthia in London.  Hemali greeted us at the front desk and she went above and beyond to make us feel welcome during our stay.  The rooms were clean, service was excellent and the location was perfect,  I would highly recommend choosing this hotel when you come to visit London!",5,2024,08,17
143,An unforgettable birthday celebration at the Garden,The enchanting alfresco floral garden is a greenery filled oasis with tranquil and cozy vibe. Food was beautifully presented and two dishes we died for: Puglia Burrata and Cacio e Pepe. The highlight of the evening was Carlo’s warm and attentive service which made us feel incredibly special. A truly memorable evening.,5,2024,08,16
143,Delicious afternoon tea,"We went for a champagne afternoon tea. The surroundings are so opulent, loved that. Also an excellent choice of sandwiches scones and cakes with a wide range of teas to choose from. We were very ably served by Anna who was very charming and knowledgeable about the menu choices.",5,2024,08,13
143,Low Value for Money,"Hotel restaurants  were fully booked for outside hotel guests and they were given priority over hotel guests due to changes on their F&B resent policy. Al though I am a regular hotel customer and I hold red level GHA Discovery, these didn’t help as hotel guests were only allowed to use back of the hotel restaurant when both the lobby and garden restaurants were fully booked for outside guests.  First time to experience such a logic!!",1,2024,08,13
143,Fab hotel in Fab location!,"I love this hotel.  I've been here for work and pleasure and it has never disappointed. Polite and respectful staff, clean beautiful rooms, great gym, and gorgeous lobby with ever changing flowers.  This hotel is an oasis in a great location.  5 Stars.  The only issue i can think of is there is not a bar open past 11pm on many nights.",5,2024,08,12
143,"Beautiful hotel, great location, room for improvement.","Overall stunning hotel in amazing location. The spa is unbelievable four floors of heaven and that hot tub is huge. To have the facilities they have in central London is fabulous.

The room was lovely. Very clean. A little tired in places which was disappointing considering the cost per night. They accommodated our party of 3 and added an extra bed to the room for a small price which was great. 

The staff were all attentive and helpful. There was a mishap with charges but they rectified it quickly. I am however still waiting for my bill to be emailed to me. 

There is ample choice of bars and eating spaces. We decided to utilise the spa and have room service. The room service was not very nice at. We were so disappointed in the quality of the food. We don’t mind paying a premium for food if it’s tasty. I could have made better at home. 

The breakfast was a tail of two halves. Continental great and the cooked was average at best. We all (3 of us) had cooked breakfast of different types and all very not very nice at all. We sent some items back and they came back replaced still not tasty and unreasoned. Rubbery sausages and tasteless hash browns. 

Overall a good experience but would not rush back.",4,2024,08,12
143,Loved everything about the Corinthia,"A friend recommended to book High Tea at this hotel for our stay in London. As I reviewed the website, I decided to book High Tea and two adjoining rooms for our family of four. We were impressed by everything - excellent location, beautiful rooms, best gym we've ever used in a hotel, ability to shower in the spa upon early arrival after a red-eye flight, and the most lovely High Tea experience. The concierges were extremely responsive and helpful to all of our questions, and all the staff were very welcoming. Would stay here again in a heartbeat and highly recommend.",5,2024,08,09
143,Dreams come true in The Garden at Corinthia,"I was already excited about this place since my booking was confirmed but the moment I stepped in I realised that my unforgettable experience started now. From the doorman who showed me the way to the restaurant, by amazing waitress Elka who was looking after my table perfectly to the managers Cas and Marco who explained not only the menu but story of the bars and restaurants in the hotel. Being there you have only one feeling, to stay there forever. Everything was just perfect. And food, delicious. And of course my negroni, one from the best I ever had! Can't wait to be back and I recommend to everyone to visit this place, maybe you will fall in love like me, who knows..",5,2024,08,08
143,Outstanding!,"I’ve long been a fan of the SoHo and Ham Yard but Corinthia is my new favorite in London (similar price point). The room was spacious, had high ceilings, a beautiful bathroom, first class amenities and lacked for nothing. 

The spa is apparently the biggest in London, spanning 4 floors. To say it’s absolutely stunning is an understatement. My partner had 2 massages during our visit and the Wellness Massage in her words was ‘the best I’ve ever had’. We travel extensively and she chooses   massages as her metric, so this is a huge compliment to Corinthia.

The staff were welcoming, friendly, engaging and not at all pretentious. Absolutely nothing was any trouble at all. I’ve read the negative comments here and have to say we had such a different experience. 

I wouldn’t rate the Kerridge’s Grill nor The Garden at more than 4 stars, but both were nonetheless high quality, and perhaps  lackluster given the amazing dining choices London has to offer, but nonetheless delicious and in wonderful environments.

Corinthia was an absolute pleasure to stay at, we were treated as royalty and I would not hesitate to recommend them. We will certainly choose to stay here again on our next visit to London, and hopefully New York next year!",5,2024,08,06
143,Beautiful stay,"An incredibly warm welcome upon arrival and a perfect check in experience from Bruna, who we understand has only been with the hotel for a short period of time. 

This was a stay for my mother’s 60th birthday and will now remain a firm family favourite. The Corinthia went above and beyond. 

Exceeded our expectations and more- thank you.",5,2024,08,05
143,Absolutely breathtaking wedding venue,"Just breathtaking! From the bottom of our hearts we can not thank the Corinthia enough for making our wedding day so incredibly special.  

Everything was impeccable, the venue, ambiance, food, service, accommodation, and the staff are so attentive.

Jenny Sunuwar was the most amazing events manager we could of asked for and our day would not of been possible with outwith Jenny-  so professional, talented, courteous and the kindest soul. 

Jochem was also the most welcoming, gracious and kindest Hotel Manager going out of his way to welcome us and ensure our entire time at the Corinthia was perfect.

 They really do have something very special at the Corinthia, so unique and  the masters of the extra little touches going above and beyond, making everything so memorable. 

The wedding was everything we hoped for and more. We are so pleased we chose this fabulous venue and will cherish and remember this truly magnificent place forever. 

Paige & Matthew - 27.07.2024",5,2024,08,03
143,My number 1 in London,"We had recently an excellent stay with my family at Corinthia (6 nights). The expectations were high as my family was with me this time and we had also a special occasion to celebrate.

Corinthia was the perfect choice for our stay.

The location of the hotel could not be better: close proximity to the river Thames, St. James Park and Trafalgar Square. Theatre district is in walking distance. Westminster Abbey and Big Ben are just a short walk away.

The rooms are spacious and have a good layout and offer maximum of privacy. Same with the bathrooms with separate toilet and shower. The shower has a good pressure. Some bathrooms have even daylight.

The SPA with heated pool is pure luxury. There are times only for adults, which is a big plus. There is a jacuzzi and sauna, too.

The service and friendliness of the staff is beyond amazing, you do not experience that quite often. They are very professional. I never experienced it before that hotel staff worked so hard to fulfill every special wish.

Although many 5 star hotels in London seem to be on a high level, Corinthia remains my choice number 1 and now it even has a special place in my heart. I feel here at home away from home from the second I arrive.

What a feeling it is to get up early on a summer morning, to hear the sound of Big Ben through the open window, to take a walk to the St. James park and see the city awakening. Then to take a dip in the pool before ordering breakfast to the room - a perfect start of the day.

Thank you for that amazing time which we will keep in our minds for a long time.",5,2024,07,29
143,Wow wow wow!,"I booked a two night stay at the Corinthia to celebrate my wedding anniversary with my wife. 
My expectation was very high based on all the positive feedback I had been told by work colleagues, they did not disappoint, in fact they exceeded! 

We started with Afternoon Tea at the Crystal Moon Lounge, the service and food was perfect. 
The lounge has a musician playing the piano while you dine, he approached everyone making them feel comfortable and asking what was the occasion/celebration. We shared we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and he asked what our 1st dance song was, we shared and thought nothing of it…..10 minutes later he was playing it live on piano, breath taking! 

Unfortunately we did not dine at the restaurant but visited the new roof top bar and had breakfast everyday, again absolutely perfect. We also visited the main bar, the cocktails are fascinatingly different but you can also order the usual suspects along with live music. 

The spa…..wow! You have to visit it to believe it. We checked in and thought we would just have a quick look, we arrived unannounced to have a look and was given a 30 minute personal tour, the service again, perfect. 

This hotel is easily the best hotel in the UK, your stay will be perfect. I cannot wait to visit again!

Thank you Corinthia 💙",5,2024,07,18
143,Corinthia Hotel and The Crystal Moon Lounge,"I have been to The Corinthia London a few time but I must say this is by far the best experince I have had.. The Crystal Moon Lounge is a destination in it's self with the perfectly prestented afternoon tea, what a beautiful setting to enjoy your afternoon.
I was with guests from Turkey and this made it all that more special as it was their first time having Afternoon Tea in London.
I could not have asked for anything more from the staff especially Anna who served us  and the wonderful Mr Marco who was a delight.. explaining everything to us in detail and making us feel very welcome.
Thank you Corinthia London",5,2024,07,16
143,Magical New Years Eve,"We have spent our New Year’s Eve with the Corinthia London twice now, both times utterly magical both times. Welcomed back with a bottle of champagne added the perfect touch to our room. One of the best spa’s we have been too, every single inch of the hotel is spotless, every fine detail of thought of and the staff are charming polite and always have time for you, offering to take photos or and always happy to answer any questions. Every single aspect of this hotel is perfect and both my partner and I agree this is the best of the very best. Our new year eves here are perfect to enjoy the fireworks with a 2 minute walk and no crowds. The best experiences iv had with a hotel, it’s the definition of perfection. WELL DONE CORINTHIA TEAM, I can’t wait to return!",5,2024,07,08
143,"Great Hotel, However personal items stolen, seems a common issue here.","Absolutely beautiful hotel & incredible experience with some of the best amenities in a London hotel I've had, however my stay was tainted as I spent 2 nights in the hotel & checked out as normal, upon leaving I realised I left 3 rings & a bracelet of very high value out on the side, I wouldn't usually do this as they're jewellery Items i never take off, but i'd undergone surgery and had to remove them. I contacted the hotel to ask them about it, the hotel had nothing on file and said none of my belongings were found.  I checked other reviews on here & it seems a very common situation that items have been stolen here. 
It's put me off staying again & I can only advise anybody who is planning on staying to keep your belongings in a safe at all times or better yet, to avoid this hotel as it is SO expensive & you honestly expect better care & service for the price you pay to stay here.",3,2024,07,08
143,Lovely Stay for a Family of 5,"Lovely hotel. We have a family of 5 and we had two adjoining rooms. Beautifully decorated hotel and friendly staff. Breakfast was excellent.

Beds: a little too soft and would have been nice to have a pillow menu provided. 

Housekeeping: was wonderful. I like the touch of providing ice each night.

Breakfast: was provided each morning in the North hall and had a large selection to satisfy anyone, including children.",5,2024,07,07
143,Undecided on whether we would stay here again,"We just returned home after a week stay at the Corinthia London.  We’ve stayed in several comparably priced luxury hotels in London and found the Corinthia to be average. The best part of the Corinthia was the breakfast staff at Northhall. They learned our names and took a genuine interest. They were fabulous!  The rest of the staff we encountered were disinterested verging on rude. 

When I originally made the booking I received a message from the hotel asking for our arrival time and if it was a special occasion. I let the hotel know that we would be arriving very early after a very long flight and that we were celebrating my daughter’s birthday. The hotel sent a message saying they would have the room ready for our early arrival and were happy to celebrate my daughter.  Had they not sent me this message my expectations would not have been set for early check in and some acknowledgement of the birthday celebration.  When we arrived at the hotel we were told rudely that they were fully booked and check in time is 3pm and we should leave our bags with the bellman and would receive a text message when our room was ready after 3pm. We never received a text and had to ask a couple times after 3pm if the room was ready. They finally handed us the key and said they upgraded us (we were not walked to our room as it appears others were). We were told all our luggage was sent to our room but one bag was missing and we had to describe it in detail to the bellman before they would bring it to us. 

The room itself was clean and large for London (standard size for a US king bed hotel room).   The beds were very comfortable and the AC worked well. There was a Nespresso, and (not complementary) minibar. The bathroom had a bathtub and waterfall shower. The shower was fantastic except it leaked water into the rest of the bathroom so that we had to mop up water from around the toilet and sink after each shower. Our phones had only one bar/spotty cell service in our room but excellent service everywhere else. There is complementary WiFi. 

There was no welcome gift nor acknowledgement of my daughter’s birthday. There was no fruit, baked item nor champagne as others say they received. We paid over £900 per night and were very surprised there was nothing. At turn down service we received lavender sachets on our pillows and a breakfast preorder menu.  I asked about the lack of a welcome gift and was told it was because we put the do not disturb sign on after check in (so we could take a nap) and the waiter tried to deliver something to us. We turned the do not disturb off during turn down service time but apparently the waiter had already attempted delivery. I was made to feel like we were at fault for using the do not disturb. 

Housekeeping also lectured us about using the do not disturb. We started turning it on (it’s a red light) while we slept because on our first morning housekeeping woke us up by walking into the room at 0830.  She woke us up and asked for the exact time we would be leaving the room so she could come in and clean it. I was laying in bed still half asleep. From that point on we turned on the do not disturb until we actually left the room for breakfast. We were awoken each morning at 8am to doors being slammed in the hallway. The hotel room is extremely quiet at other times which made the slamming doors very noticeable. A not so subtle way for housekeeping to wake up guests. On our third day the housekeeping supervisor stopped me in the hallway to “teach” me that the red button means do not disturb and the green button means housekeeping. I told her that we know what they mean and we are on holiday and would be sleeping until 9am each morning.

The room they gave us happened to be next to four stairs and had an electrical outlet directly next to our room door. Therefore, we had hotel staff constantly leaving housekeeping and food carts out in front of our door because they could not take them up and down the stairs. We also had humidifiers and vacuums and scent machines being plugged into the outlet directly next to our door that we had to walk around. 

The ESPA at the Corinthia is terrific and as a hotel guest we could access the thermal floor. We spent quality time relaxing in the vitality pool and sauna. They post specific times when children are allowed for good reason. The spa is very relaxing except for when children are allowed. During those times it is very loud and crowded. 

We ate at the Garden twice. The first time service was horrible, but they recognized it was bad and invited us back. The second time the service was much better. The food was delicious. We had drinks at the Velvet rooftop Campari bar and the service and drinks were exceptional. The indoor velvet bar was not open while we were there. 

The location of the hotel was one of the primary reasons we picked the Corinthia. It is in an excellent location with easy walk to the West End shows. 

In summary, did the Corinthia meet the expectations they set? No they did not. Did we enjoy our stay? We enjoyed the spa, breakfast, and location. Would we stay here again? Undecided",3,2024,07,05
143,Perfect afternoon tea,Fabulous from the minute we walked in. The Afternoon Tea service is exceptional. The service is amazing and the food was perfect. We did the champagne tea -pricey but worth every cent. The pianist was so sweet and played beautifully. I recommend to anyone looking for the ultimate afternoon tea.,5,2024,06,29
143,Brilliant hotel.,"I absolutely love this hotel 😬😬😬. I go to a new hotel every month and this hotel has seen me visit them 3 times😅!!! It's got a lovely, uniquely designed spa 😶‍🌫️ that will leave you feeling super relaxed. The service is amazing! the rooms are fit for purpose, always clean and the water flow in the showers (which is super important to me) is phenomenal. I usually have to look up to see if I'm standing in a waterfall as opposed to an actual shower. Can't recommend enough. I've attached photos of the ""Superior King room"" Deluxe room"" & ""Executive room"". I've also included some shots of food!

We've ordered a lot off the menu and it's been mostly spectacular with the exception of one item. Unfortunately, the crepes we ordered off the room service menu were a bit over done, but besides that everything else has been superb! The club sandwich is to die for! Their chocolate crème brûlée is out of this world and the chicken Shawarma wrap is mouth watering. Well worth it in my opinion.",5,2024,06,28
143,Great experience,"Luxurious experience in central London.

The atmosphere in the hotel is cosy, staff are approachable and polite.

Furniture is beautiful and very clean.

The location of the hotel  is very convenient ,unfortunately streets surrounding the hotel are not very clean but that is the way London is.
Avoid Trafalgar Square particularly.

143,A lovely hotel in Central London,"I stayed with my son for a night at this lovely hotel. I had booked a family room so we would get two queen sized beds but the hotel called in advance to offer an upgrade on the room. Although the beds wouldn’t be doubles, the room itself would afford more space. On check in, we were taken to our room. We were delighted to discover that it was a deluxe junior suite. The room was well appointed and spacious, but I noticed that there was only one bed. I telephoned reception immediately but there was no reply after 5 minutes so I just went down to ask. I was assured that there was a note that we were to have 2 beds and that they would be made up during the turn down service between 5 and 9pm. 
We used the spa facilities which were lovely and relaxing. We had a fabulous meal at Kerridges and cocktails before and after in the Northall and Velvet bars. 
On getting back to our room at 9pm, although the turndown service had been done, there was still only one bed. I went back to reception and received an apology and assurance that it would be done immediately so we went out for a walk. On our return, the bed had indeed been split into two.
On check out, a discretionary charge was applied and we were happy to pay this. The gentleman made it clear that it was discretionary. We left our luggage with the bell hop and received a ticket for two bags. On our return a few hours later, they could not locate my son’s bag. It took around a quarter of an hour but they eventually found it. 
There were fresh flowers everywhere, including the room which was nice. The staff were all friendly and polite.
The location was great and convenient for walking to the main central attractions.
Apart from the two little hiccups with the beds and luggage, it was a wonderful stay and our experience was not marred.",5,2024,06,24
143,Elegance at its finest! A special birthday celebration.,Elegance at its finest! I celebrated my birthday at Corinthia London because I want it to be special. They did not disappoint me. Warm welcome from very professional and polite staff. 👍🏻👍🏻 Five star experience and VIP treatment (as always!)  from Mr. Marco De Simone who is the Deputy Restaurant Director of Crystal Moon Lounge and The Garden Restaurant. Very attentive. Grazie mille Marco! ❤️ Really appreciated. Special mention to the kind and courteous waitresses Eloise and Inesa. The champagne and the food are lovely! Corinthia London is one of my favourite place in the city. See you again soon! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,5,2024,06,23
143,Disappointing,"Was always curious about staying, bubble was burst by staying there last night. From check in problems, finding someone's luggage in my room on check in multiple card entry problems to just the feeling of staff not really interested in the guests. In the evening on return from a dinner meeting I tried to visit the hotel bar only to be told twice it was busy. Called the concierge from my room and he suggested to wait till 11:10pm no guarantee so went in got a small table. The drinks are way over priced with massive blocks of ice in the middle to disguise the small amounts of spirits provided. Also I was continously rushed to buy the next drink. Same thing happened early pre dinner when I visited the Campari sponsored bar upstairs. Although the hotel gave me an upgrade room on check in due to the company I work for I was there on a personal trip and thought I would treat myself by staying there.
Overall it just felt like one big machine trying to maximise profits from tourist style guests, didn't feel the love.",1,2024,06,23
143,Unassuming luxury and great service,"This is simply the best hotel in London and worth every penny. The hotel is immaculate and the staff are attentive and can't do enough to make your stay as pleasant and enjoyable as possible. The standard of accomodation and food is exemplary throughout. 

There are many high end 5 star hotels in London, but this sets the benchmark by a long way.",5,2024,06,21
143,A First Class Delight,"The Corinthia Hotel is a top notch hotel in all ways.
When you walk in, the doorman are exceptionally friendly and helpful.  Visually, the entry and all public rooms are beautifully appointed, with gorgeous marble, and fresh flowers everywhere.  The staff is always quick with a smile, and fulfill their roles with precision.
Our room was very nice, the hardwood floors and cabinetry was beautiful.  The bedding was plush and comfortable.
We had breakfast there every day.   They had a good variety of options, and everything was delicious.  We had a Caesar salad snack one afternoon, and it was done right and on point.
We also had the occasion to make use of the hotel's driver and BMW 7 Series.  Gianni Ferrari was the driver, he was funny and pleasant and took us on a couple of occasions to our evening dining destination. 
We loved the Corinthia Hotel.  We felt spoiled.  It was one of our best hotel experiences in a long time.  Keep up the good work!",5,2024,06,20
143,Best of London! Must stay!,"This is one of the best hotels we have stayed at. The entire staff is incredibly nice and accommodating. The room, service, everything was top notch. Spa is best spa in London, food is amazing at all restaurants, afternoon tea is exquisite. The location of Corinthia  is perfect walking distance to all areas and sights. We will be staying here every time we come to London.",5,2024,06,20
143,Five star luxury and perfection in London,"Absolute perfection. Rooms are modern, beautiful and luxurious. Food and drink is excellent. And service is over the top amazing in every way, from the doormen who are so friendly, to Rodrigo the concierge who personally walked over to a restaurant at 11pm at night to try to retrieve my lost credit card, to the most amazing butlers (Maje and Masha) who took care of every need with the highest level of service.",5,2024,06,19
143,Beyond Perfect!!,"We chose this hotel, after watching the T.V. programme last year to celebrate our special birthdays. We were not disappointed. It certainly lived up to and beyond our expectations.
From walking through the  hotel doors  you were met with opulence and tasteful decor, throughout with beautiful arrangements of flowers.
From arriving through to our departure we  cannot praise highly enough the welcome and attention given to us throughout from all staff members, whether that be the concierge , reception, restaurant or housekeeping staff.
Our room was like a mini-suite, a lovely surprise with a hall way and walk in closet . The bathroom was very spacious and beautifully designed with a marble surround to the bath with wall mounted tv, double sinks, always useful, a magnificent  display of lovely complimentary toiletries, bathrobe and slippers. Along the hall way you entered the bedroom through double doors, again beautifully designed with everything you could need during your stay. What was very special was that there was a complimentary bottle of champagne as well as a beautiful birthday cake. What a wonderful surprise!!
On entering the Breakfast room the following morning, we were astounded by the wonderful sight and beautiful aroma of fruit and freshly cooked food. The  wide display of foods available was beautifully displayed, plus it was lovely to see a block of honey comb on display also.
The cooked breakfast was cooked to order and was lovely, hot and made with the freshest of ingredients.
Due to our commitments, we were not free to use the Spa facilities but on inspection they looked out of this world and this would certainly be another factor to draw us back for another visit .
Overall, we loved our stay here and only wish it could have been longer. The attention we received made us feel very special. Thank to you all",5,2024,06,14
143,Marvelous,"For sure one of the best hotel I met in my life and I’m traveling a lot. Everything was fine. Rooms are big and sound proof, breakfast buffet is so nice. Staff is more than dedicated and on the top the SPA is just incredible. You have to taste it if you get a chance. Price is high, but everything was fine.",5,2024,06,14
143,5 stars and more!,"An exquisite hotel with all the charm you could wish for. Truly 5 star experience from start to finish. Staff are wonderful, we travel quite a bit for business and leisure and would frequent this hotel during our trips to London.

Bathrooms are beautifully decorated with plenty of space to store items. Bedrooms are spotless and spacious.

Food is exceptional as are the staff, we very much look forward to our future stays",5,2024,06,02
143,Perfect luxurious hotel that's well located,"Having stayed at more than 10 hotels in London after travelling there multiple times, I thought I found the perfect one in another hotel only to be disappointed during my return visit. Hence, we went in search again for THE one to stay as we often travel to this city.

It was our first time staying in Corinthia London for a few nights and it was a great experience throughout. We arrived in the evening and check-in staff was friendly and helpful. There was even a candy cart at the reception area which one could help to the various sweets there, perfect for kids and adults.

Upon entering the room, we were pleasantly surprised. It was spacious for London with the walk-in closet in front, bedroom on the left and a large bathroom on the right. There were even more candies in the room provided for complimentary and the room looked luxurious. Bed was comfortable and pillows were soft (though not my favourite, I prefer firm ones). Switches and sockets were well placed. 

The bathroom was very spacious with 2 sinks (perfect) and a large bathtub with a tv in front. There was also a separate toilet and shower area. The water pressure was good and the shower area was well designed so that water will not flow out to the main bathroom area (unlike many 5-star hotels we've stayed which still has this issue). The robes and slippers provided were so plush and comfy.

The breakfast room was grand and had a wide spread. You could order the hot mains which were freshly prepared by the chef. The types of juices, kombucha, coffee and tea available were splendid too.

The staff raved about the spa in the hotel which was complimentary for guests, hence we decided to try it on our last day before check out. We were not spa type people but this blew our mind. The award-winning ESPA in the hotel was 4-storeys and lavish in every way. The staff were so helpful to bring us around first before we went back to the room for a change. There was a jacuzzi pool, a normal pool, sauna, steam room, relaxation pods for sleeping, stone beds in front of a fireplace and more! It was simply awe-inspiring and we spent a great 1.5 hours there as we had to check out soon to catch our flight. I think we might come back and stay just for the spa. No pictures were allowed inside for the privacy of the guests which I respect and appreciate. If you ever stay in Corinthia, I would recommend you to try the spa at least once even if you're not a spa person like us.

Location of the hotel was very centralised in Zone 1 and near Charing Cross and Embankment station. It also has a view of the London eye with many eateries nearby and walkable to multiple sights. While it's not our first time there and we're not fussy about being near tourist sights, we appreciated the convenience.

Everyone in the hotel were friendly and helpful, hence it may be the hotel that we come back to when we return to London. We highly recommend this place!",5,2024,06,02
143,Everything you could wish for and more,"We spent a wonderful weekend in London and had the most fabulous stay at the Corinthia. The hotel is exceptional in every way, from the moment we arrived we were made to feel incredibly special. The staff were attentive and couldn’t do enough to make our stay any better. The hotel is beautiful inside and out, our suite was huge with two Juliette balconies. The stunning marble bathroom and a lovely dressing area. The chef pastries, champagne, sweet jar and rose petals were a lovely touch and most appreciated. Breakfast was delicious, unfortunately we were unable to secure a booking at Kerridges. Thank you Corinthia London.",5,2024,06,01
143,21st Visit to the Hotel,"We have visited The Corinthia 21 times for Afternoon Tea at various dates during the last few years. On each occasion the theme changes but the quality of both the food and service never fails to impress us. We enter as guest who the staff know and always leave feeling like royalty. Our experience is no different to other guests I’m sure. All staff that we have met in the hotel have always been very accommodating from the manager, doormen and in the Northall cocktail lounge. We have never been fortunate to stay in the hotel but this is on our bucket list.

Our latest visit for afternoon was managed by Marco with Sasha our server who was attentive, professional and efficient throughout our stay.

The cakes had a flower theme with Yago the chef and his team creating some delicate cakes that were delicious. The Corinthia never fails to impress us. 

Our next visit planned for July and where else would we visit?",5,2024,05,29
143,Perfect stay,"Excellent stay, 5 star hotel and Marco was a great host making the stay at the hotel as special as possible.

143,"Excellent Stay, Epic Customer Service","Our first time staying at The Corinthia, a five star hotel with 5 star customer service. Our room was well appointed, very clean, very comfortable. From the minute we arrived to the minute we left the staff were truly excellent. Explored the bar for lunch great selections of wines and the bar food was good. Pre dinner cocktails in the cocktail bar, great ambience. The hotel throughout gives a great ambiance and the wonderful scents of the flowers a relaxing space, where you are made to feel special.

You get what you pay for, is it expensive? Yes, is it worth paying that extra over other hotels? oh Yes!

Will be back",5,2024,05,26
143,Another outstanding Corinthia experience,"This is our second stay at the Corinthia this year. I’m a frequent traveler to London for business and tend to stay in The City. However when it’s family pleasure our go to hotel is now the Corinthia.
From the cocktail bar to the Spa, understated elegance and Olympian levels of courtesy, subtle interpersonal connectivity and an authentic desire to ensure a positively memorable stay differentiate the Corinthia from any other hotel I’ve stayed at in London.",4,2024,05,20

143,"A Mother's Day to Remember at The Northall, Corinthia Hotel","Mother's Day is a time to honor and cherish the incredible women in our lives, and this year, I decided to treat my mum to an unforgettable dining experience at The Northall, located in the luxurious Corinthia Hotel , I must admit previously hadn't been familiar with this particular restaurant The day turned out to be a great celebration filled with exceptional food, impeccable service, and an ambiance that exuded elegance and sophistication.

From the moment we arrived at The Corinthia, we were enveloped in an aura of opulence seen on TV . The grandeur of the hotel's architecture, with its stunning chandeliers and intricate decor, set the stage for what would be a remarkable dining experience.   As we entered The Northall, the restaurant's  elegance immediately struck us. The high ceilings, adorned with beautiful moldings created an inviting and warm atmosphere.

Our dining journey began with a warm greeting from the host despite turning up early, who escorted us to our table. The staff's attentiveness was evident from the start. It felt as if there was a 5-to-1 ratio of staff to guests, ensuring that every need and desire was promptly met. This high level of service made us feel exceptionally special and well-cared-for throughout our meal.

The Northall is renowned for its commitment to using the finest seasonal ingredients, and this dedication was apparent in every dish we sampled. We started with a selection of appetizers that were both visually stunning and delectable. The smoked salmon,was a testament to the restaurant's ability to elevate simple ingredients to extraordinary heights. Each bite was a harmonious blend of flavors and textures, leaving us eager for more.

For the main course, my mum chose the roasted lamb, while I opted for the pan-seared sea bass. The lamb was cooked to perfection, tender and juicy, with a rich, flavorful jus that complemented the meat beautifully. The accompanying root vegetables were roasted to perfection, adding a delightful sweetness to the dish. The  Fish was equally impressive, with its crispy skin and moist, flaky flesh. It was served atop a bed of creamy mashed potatoes and sautéed greens, which provided a perfect balance of flavors.

As we savored our main courses, we couldn't help but notice the pianist playing softly in the background. This subtle yet enchanting touch added to the overall ambiance, creating a serene and relaxing environment. The gentle melodies of the piano provided a soothing backdrop to our conversation, enhancing the dining experience without overpowering it.

Dessert was a decadent affair, with a menu that offered a variety of tempting options.  The chocolate selection from there dessert table, was a masterpiece, with a molten center that oozed rich, dark chocolate with each spoonful. The tartness of the accompanying raspberry sorbet provided a perfect counterbalance, making each bite a delightful contrast of flavors. 

Throughout our dining experience, the staff at The Northall remained attentive and professional, ensuring that our glasses were never empty and that every detail was taken care of. Their genuine warmth and hospitality added to the overall sense of luxury and made us feel like cherished guests.

In addition to the outstanding food and service, the restaurant itself is a visual feast. The tasteful decor, with its plush seating and elegant table settings, reflects a commitment to creating a dining environment that is both comfortable and sophisticated. The Northall manages to strike a perfect balance between grandeur and intimacy, making it an ideal setting for a special occasion like Mother's Day.

As we left The Northall, my mum and I couldn't stop talking about what an extraordinary experience we had just enjoyed. The combination of superb, hearty cuisine, attentive service, and a splendid setting made it a Mother's Day celebration that we will remember for years to come. The Northall at The Corinthia Hotel is truly a gem in , offering a dining experience that is nothing short of spectacular. Whether you are celebrating a special occasion or simply seeking an exceptional meal.

143,Stylish and elegant,"A prime London spot, located in the heart of the city, with charming and attentive staff, Corinthia London is spotless, stylish and serene. 
I loved the location, the tastefully selected flowers (lots of them). Reception staff is great. 
Probably the best breakfast  I've had, absolutely top quality. Probably the most expensive hotel out of the Corinthia list, but yes it is worth it.",5,2024,05,14
143,A delightful al fresco dining experience,"We recently visited The Garden for lunch, a beautiful floral oasis at The Corinthia. The menu changes seasonally, the current menu featuring Mediterranean style dishes which are perfect for the warmer months ahead. We enjoyed a some delicious dishes including the Atlantic octopus potato salad, pan seared Scottish halibut, and vitello tonnato. I loved the concept of the tiramisu being prepared tableside; ours was professionally prepared by the lovely manager Carlo. 
The Garden is also dog friendly which is always a plus for me. 
A word of thanks to all the  staff for a delightful lunch experience. I look forward to returning soon.",5,2024,05,14
143,Wish I was there now,"An amazing relaxing stay, its our 5th stay at The Corinthia it is an experience that leaves us happy long after it's over.
The breakfasts are outstanding so much choice of amazing quality ingredients in a beautiful room great attentive staff that set you up for the day. With an amazing spa, bars and restaurants it's difficult to leave and actually see London.  The flowerbox is a heavenly room to see and smell the hotel is exquisitely decorated with beautiful flowers.
What makes the hotel extra special are the staff it really shows how hard they work to make your stay stress free and pampered.",5,2024,05,13
143,A fantastic experience,"From check-in to check-out...what a wonderful experience!  The lobby decor and the beautiful chandelier are amazing.  We dined at each of the restaurants, as well as afternoon tea in the Crystal Moon Lounge.  What a beautiful location.  All were exceptional experiences.  The rooms were beautifully appointed on every detail.  The beds were extremely comfortable with beautiful soft linens.  The staff were amazing with a combination of professionalism and charm.  We will definitely return!",5,2024,05,12
143,Quiet luxury for a restful break,"We stayed for a weekend in January to celebrate my husband’s birthday and to scope out an option for our indulgent weekends in the city. The staff were charming, absolutely couldn’t do more to make us happy and gladly provided an upgrade and all sorts of additional extras. The spa is very pleasant and they’re hot on telling people to not use their phones (fantastic to get rid of Instagram crowd). The room service was a bit lacking (things forgotten/wrong) and we found the afternoon tea outfits for the women really bizarre and uncomfortable looking vs the men’s version (time for a redesign??). We’ll definitely return. Wonderful breakfast also.",5,2024,05,05
143,Great experience,"You pay for what you get , it is a  nice central location, 
The service is personalised and rooms are beautifully decorated.

Shame there is no park or green space surrounding the hotel.

I would recommend the hotel for a nice weekend.

The decor is romantic 💕",5,2024,05,05
143,Favourite London Sleepspot,"My fave hotel in London, always stay here, it’s perfect when travelling to the capital. The service, beautiful rooms with marble bathrooms and dn the most comfortable beds, the restaurants and the lunchtime dining in the bar, all topped off by the spa make for enjoyable stay every time",5,2024,05,04
143,A Wonderful Champagne Afternoon Tea in London !!,"We came today for Champgne Afternoon Tea , our servers Inesa and Marco were terrific, they made the whole experience for us . The food and atmosphere were out of this world. Overall a must if you are visiting London , you should definitely try the Corinthia Hotel !",5,2024,05,01
143,Extraordinary setting and location providing outstanding living and dining experience supported by an excellent staff.,"I’ve been staying at the Corinthia for at least the past decade. Over the years, the facilities have been well-maintained, updated and kept at the highest standards. All of the restaurants are top notch and provide a variety of choices for ambience and gastronomic experience.

Despite changes in staff, everyone - new and old - has been consistently cordial (always extending a greeting by name and with a smile) and super attentive to your needs and special requests. For frequent guests, they even provide amenities that suggests that they know your profile quite well.

It feels like a second home to me that -  because of my frequent travels - matter hugely. Attention to details, catering to the guests needs promptly and in a cheerful manner places the Corinthia at a level that is difficult to find elsewhere in the same league consistently in a highly competitive world city like London.

It has been always my top choice in London whether for business or pleasure.",5,2024,04,28
143,Fantastic staff & service! ,"Our second time here and still one of the best 5* in London!
Perfect location to get to Trafalgar Square or further up China town and city centre and all the theatre spots.
Amazing rooms with high ceilings, great breakfast buffet & bar, and a beautiful spa and well equipped gym/studio. They did indicate no mobile phones and tablets in the spa area, but I had to sneak a photo of their jacuzzi and sauna, which were absolutely delightful. I do apologise :)
Highlight of course are their very accommodating staff members, especially Marco at front desk went over and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our stay thoroughly.
Thumbs up, highly recommended and will return!",5,2024,04,28
143,Flawless service,"The hotel does show its age in some areas, particularly in the rooms. The bed and most of the furniture could use a little refresh.

But the service received everywhere around the hotel was just outstanding and everything a true ultra luxury hotel should aim for.

From the check-in to check-out I felt well taken care for, and nothing was too much trouble for the excellent staff.

The hotel scene in London has welcomed many 5 star properties in the recent past, but it is always good to know that this property has maintained its strongest suit.

I would most certainly return to this property whenever I am in London.",5,2024,04,20
143,Spa and massage,"I visited the Spa of Corinthia Hotel to have a massage and experience the facilities. Front desk was very professional and welcoming! 90 mins with Andrea was a beautiful and relaxing experience, topped off with magical moments in the spa facilities afterwards. 
Overall a very luxurious, indulging experience! 
Worth every penny!",5,2024,04,20
143,AMAZING HOSPITALITY,"I have traveled all over the world and stayed at many hotels. I was in London by chance and booked at The Corinthia last minute. I have never seen a group of employees who truly seemed to enjoy what they were doing. In most situations in the hospitality you see good and bad employee attitudes and performance. I never happened upon any group of employees where thay were not happy to greet each other, Never heard a group of employees complaining about ANYTHING. Every time I encountered an individual employee or group they stopped what they were doing and attended to every guest they encountered. Even standing outside smoking and observing, EVERY employee seemed genuinely happy and positive. That is so refreshing in this environment. I am in the hospitality business and understand that sometimes everyone has a bad day but you never want that to reflect to guests and you have accomplished that!",5,2024,04,15
143,Truly magical - thank you.,"This is a well-overdue review, but as we run a small hotel ourselves, as soon as we returned from our trip to Corinthia, we were straight back to work. 

Having kept our own hotel open to welcome guests for Christmas's over the last several years, in 2023 we decided to take a Christmas break. This was more important to us than we could put into words and all we wanted to do was to ensure our young daughter had the most magical Christmas ever. And she did. 

We chose Corinthia to spend our Christmas and what an utterly amazing and flawless experience we had as a family. It was mind-blowingly magical. Our daughter was made to feel incredibly special, which was the main purpose of our Christmas away and we delighted in a relaxing time with excellent food, super attentive service in wonderful surroundings. One thing we love about Corinthia is it is friendly, not stuffy, professional but also informal - if you want it to be. We love chatting to staff and they were really happy to spend time with us. I also imagine if you prefer a more formal level of service, the staff all know how to read these cues and respond accordingly. Everyone we met were exemplary hospitality professionals in our eyes. 

Of course, the hotel is comfortable, beautiful and had a great vibe, with a contemporary and considered feel to it. The spa is cleverly done and we very much enjoyed time spent there, even with our daughter at designated family times, which seemed fair. 

Our Christmas dinner at Kerridge’s was spectacular and breakfasts are to die for. 

We loved everything so much we plan to go back for Christmas 2025. 

We just wanted to say, albeit very belatedly (sorry!), thank you for having us and thank you so much to every single member of the team who worked so hard and gave up their Christmas so we could enjoy ours. It was so special, thank you. Hope to see you all next year.",5,2024,04,15
143,"Champagne afternoon tea, a lovely treat.","Afternoon tea at the Corinthia was fabulous.  My daughter took me as a treat for my birthday on a Saturday afternoon in April.  We had a fabulous time and couldn't fault it.  The food was delicious, the champagne exquisite and the service outstanding.  We were beautifully looked after by all the staff and in particular by Anna who served us with warmth and fun.  I would also like to mention Marco who paid attention to little details and made us feel very relaxed.  I would highly recommend it and will definitely go again.  Thank you Corinthia, you helped make my birthday very special.",5,2024,04,09
143,The most magical night,"There are not enough words to describe how wonderful The Corinthia is! It is the most beautiful hotel! Every little detail in the interior is stunning! The staff are the warmest, kindest most professional people, nothing is too much trouble and they add extra special touches at every given moment! The food is just magnificent! The spa is a dream! The cocktails in Velvet were amazing, and the live music was just perfect. The rooms are unbelievable. And to top it all off it is in the perfect location close to all the tourist attractions in London. By far my favourite London Hotel. Thank you so so much!",5,2024,04,08
143,Fabulous Afternoon Tea,"Afternoon Tea in the Crystal Moon room was absolutely delightful.  The service was exceptional as was the food and ambiance.  There was no time pressure and we felt completely looked after! I would most definitely return, and totally recommend.",5,2024,04,05
143,"Exceptional, Highly Recommended Afternoon Tea","This was a discovery and a half. The Afternoon Tea at the Crystal Moon Lounge deserves the word of mouth accolades -- a tightly curated tea list (including bespoke blends -- the light Aromatic blend, recommended by the amiable Restaurant Director Marco, is a good way to start), a menu of fresh finger sandwiches, refilled on request from a silver tray, newly baked scones tucked in a box, and cakes and cookies almost too pretty to eat. We would have had the champagne tea if only to drink from the solid Baccarat crystal, but contented ourselves with the stunning chandelier overhead. Service was warm, friendly and polished, which sums up the experience. I stepped out onto busy Northumberland Avenue feeling happy and serene. A new favourite!",5,2024,04,02
143,A fabulous stay.,"Our stay at the Corinthia London was a truly unique and utterly relaxing experience. The team did their utmost to make our stay the best it could possibly be. With ample amenities, a variety of dining options to choose from, and a fabulous thermal spa, the “unnecessary necessities” were the cherry on the cake. The central location was great as everywhere we wanted to go was walkable, and the comfortable beds left none of us fatigued the next morning. We stayed in the spring and the atmosphere was lovely in the hotel.  Colourful floral displays complimented the airy and bright spaces in the hotel enhanced by windows and the outdoor dining area. All of the hotel staff were brilliant and very helpful. I would highly recommend a stay in the Corinthia.",5,2024,04,02
143,Perfection - From start to finish!,"Perfection - From start to finish! 

My husband booked an overnight stay for us at the Corinthia as a surprise for my birthday last week. From the moment we arrived it was evident what a stunning and special place this was. Making changes to allow us to check in earlier on arrival and later on check out was such a lovely bonus. Many thanks to Harry on front desk for that!

The service from absolutely ALL the staff we encountered was not just faultless but also charming as they took particular time to greet us and chat which made our stay feel very personal. Having a doorman greet us respectfully in Punjabi when we returned from a walk was very unexpected and delightful.

Our room was impeccable as was the very impressive spa. The spa is a must to visit.

Dinner in Kerridges Bar & Grill and Afternoon tea in the Crystal Moon Lounge were particular highlights. Great tables, delicious food beautifully presented with the best service.

A lovely alfresco lunch in The Garden was not spoilt in any way by the rain! Breakfast was personalised to a tee.
Cocktails in Velvet were so good we went back again after dinner! The ""grid"" to help you decide your cocktail was very unique and a great guide.

Thank you to all at The Corinthia for making my birthday stay so special and for all the birthday cakes and Easter chocolates!

 We look forward to coming to eat, drink and stay again soon.

We visited fro our baby moon and they had a cake in our room that said congratulations for us upon arrival along with a maternity pillow which made the stay much more comfortable! Theres so much to do on property that we found ourselves spending a lot of time there an the rooms were very spacious. It's also an easy walking distance to so many fun areas in London including The London Eye, Big Ben, SOHO, Chinatown, Coventry Garden are more! We will definitely go back and cant recommend this property enough!",5,2024,04,01
143,A LUXURY HOTEL YOU MUST STAY AT!,"Our stay was absolutely lovely and our expectations were exceeded from the beginning of our stay to the end!  Our suite was very spacious and comfortable for our family of 3.  This beautiful hotel is centrally located (between Trafalgar Square and the Golden Jubilee Bridge) and the staff were extremely attentive and left us wanting for nothing!  The food and drink options at all of the restaurants were sooo delicious and offered something for everyone.  The breakfast at The Northall was a great way to start each day.  You have to try the loaded fries at Kerridge's Bar & Grill!  Do not miss visiting Velvet, a champagne and cocktail bar that offers a laid back yet unique experience with tasty cocktails and live music in the evening.  I took advantage of ESPA’s thermal floor and it was so relaxing (I’ll have to book a massage next time).  Our visit was absolutely perfect and this hotel felt like a home away from home!  If you are thinking about staying here (whether it’s your first time in London or your 5th), do not hesitate!  Book it now!",5,2024,03,31
143,"Unpretentious, perfect luxury","We won this one night stay in a competition, including spa treatments, so it was very much a once in a lifetime experience! Not the usual hotel we stay at. It was everything you dream of in a hotel - staff incredibly friendly and helpful, not a single thing out of line, and a very homey and welcoming feel regardless of the level of luxury. 

Everywhere you went: your room, the spa, the gym, the restaurants, it was all always perfectly stocked as if you were the only person around. Little treats all around - Easter chocolates, champagne delivered to our room (perhaps because it was our ten year anniversary), eucalyptus towels and coconut water in the gym. The bed was the comfiest we’d ever felt, and the breakfast was truly a delicious feast. The spa was unlike anywhere I’d ever been before - totally blissful (thank you Arta for my treatment!). 

I worked in hospitality for many years and it is clear the hotel is made special by the staff and their hard work. 

Thank you so much to the Corinthia!! I wish I could relive it all over again.",5,2024,03,26
143,Our Favourite London Hotel,We have been to The Corinthia many times over the years and it never disappoints.  Your experience starts the moment the doorman welcomes you and the Reception staff check you in.  Nothing is too much trouble and you are made to feel like you're part of something really special.  The beds are so comfortable and the pillows are the best I've ever slept on.  Breakfast is also a pleasure with an extensive buffet on offer as well as an a la carte choice.  We were seated immediately and had great service throughout as always.  Can't wait to go back.,5,2024,03,25
143,One of the best hotels in or outside London!  A true relaxing retreat!!!,This hotel is very special.  Service is amazing and room well appointed with a fantastic London old school vibe.  Took advantage of the wide ranging dining options including a great buffet breakfast.  Add the spa and it will be a very long lasting special memory.  Will definitely return soon.,5,2024,03,24
143,Amazing afternoon tea,"I had afternoon tea with my husband at Corinthia and we were both amazed at how good this place is. As soon as you step into the hotel you are made to feel welcome, the decorations are amazing and in particular fresh flowers leave a wonderful scent all around. The afternoon tea room is elegant with a beautiful chandelier, tables are well looked after and the staff is fantastic. Sandwiches are delicious and desserts are lovely too. Thanks to everyone but especially director Marco who told us a lot about the hotel and made us enjoy our experience even more.",5,2024,03,24
143,Wonderful afternoon tea,"Fantastic afternoon tea with a great selection of sandwiches, delicious desserts and fresh scones. Service is top notch and the ambiance is amazing. This is one of my top favourite places in London to have afternoon tea. The staff is fantastic, the service of all the staff was amazing. In particular thanks to director Marco who is brilliant, professional, caring and makes you feel appreciated and welcome. Anyone who wants to go for a wonderful afternoon tea experience won’t regret choosing Corinthia. Highly recommended",5,2024,03,24
143,Sheer luxury,"Stayed 3 nights. First pleasant surprise was a lovely upgrade from Garden to River Suite
This suite is a sumptuous large lounge with guest bathroom as well as luxury bathroom 
Breakfast was sheer luxury hooray rhe lovely buffet is back loved the Velvet champagne bar and most of all the dedication and professional but caring staff
Definitely my number 1 go to hotel in London at the moment ",5,2024,03,24
143,Incredible service,"Brilliant location and brilliant staff too. 
From the moment we arrived until the moment we left they couldn’t have done any more for us.
Great bars and restaurants, along with the added benefit of having Tom Kerridge’s amazing restaurant in there too.

Can’t wait for our next trip back here.",5,2024,03,20
143,You have to try the afternoon tea here!,Such a fantastic place to experience authentic afternoon tea. The live pianist also added to the lovely ambiance. Every course was delicious and an incredible range of teas to try. We left happy and full ready for an evening exploring Westminster,5,2024,03,19
143,Outsanding hotel and spa,"Wonderful, from the moment we arrived. Something very special about the atmosphere and general ambiance of the hotel. 

Breakfast was great as was the meal in Kerridge's. 

All the staff were so welcoming, fabulous room and the best spa I have ever been to. 

Looking forward to a return visit.",5,2024,03,06
143,Corinthia forever,"Perfection in every way. From the moment I stepped off the sidewalk and into the hotel. Every single person was beyond lovely. Check-in. The room staff. Room service (the operator taking the order, the food itself, the person delivering the food). The doormen. The wait staff in the restaurant. All perfect. The ROOM!!  Gorgeous. Quiet. Beautifully appointed. Spotless. Great bed. Every single aspect was exquisite. I can’t wait to come again.",5,2024,03,03
143,Afternoon Tea experience,"Celebrated birthday with an Afternoon Tea experience.  Attentive and polite staff.  Well prepared sandwiches, scones and cakes.  Great selection of teas.  Extra sandwiches offered several times.  Took into account allergy preference.  Live piano playing throughout the 1.75 hours allocated to your table.  Beautiful room with enough space between each party.  
The only 'negative' is the atrocious 'uniform' worn by the waiting staff.  Colour, style, cut, fit is really dreadful.  Surely, you could come up with something that is actually well sewn and fits each individual.
Definitely worth the experience and highly recommended.",4,2024,03,02
143,Exemplary - a must for a quick getaway,"My wife and I stayed here for a special birthday and it was just fantastic. The rooms were excellent, far better than The Savoy. Checkin and reception staff were fantastic, welcoming and polite. Lunch at Kerridge’s was exemplary, the Spa is just out of this world and worth staying here just for that. The Northall for breakfast was equally, stunning. The only minor blip was the service in The Velvet Bar yesterday evening - the host was somewhat friendly but quite blunt that we could not sit where we wanted (we were a party of two, wanted a booth that was designed for four) fair enough if busy, but a) it was dead b) he was just a bit curt with it. The lady serving our tables was functional (delivered drinks) but didn’t particularly make us feel welcome. But as I said - a minor blip, the rest of the experience was incredible.",5,2024,02,21
143,NYE In One of Londons Best,"Had to experience London at NYE. and what a spledid place to be for it. From the time we walked in (and it was busy) you were treated with grace and style and welcomed back warmly. It is an expensive hotel, but everyone knows this right...? But what you get back in bucket loads and see where your money goes as its faultless.
NYE was handled with consumate ease and was fantastic. We WILL be doing this again!",5,2024,02,20
143,Beautiful Hotel,Beautiful hotel with a great staff..Service was excellent with a suprising gift. Great restaurants  beautiful spa with pool and very unique sauna. Centrally located and enjoyed London because of this Hotel. Looked at a dozen others and this won me over on all points..,5,2024,02,19
143,Stunning SPA and Massage!,"I have spent couple of days in Corinthia with my friends and have to say that it is one of the best hotels I have been to. The facilities, food and location were amazing however what have exceeded my expectations is their SPA, not only for the facilities and design but more importantly forP the hospitality and professionalism of people working there. I had a Swedish massage done by
Anna K which was an exuisite experience - both atmosphere and the knowledge of the massagist made an impression.
I recommend the place and will surely visit Corinthia and their SPA again.",5,2024,02,18
143,Very good and welcoming,"Stayed for 2 nights and fully enjoyed it with our family of 5. Privileged to have stayed at the most beautiful hotels all over the world so it’s almost embarrassing to talk about negative things. Here there were few, if worth mentioning at all.
Great location, excellent size rooms, the best beds. Pretty wellness and wonderful concierge service! An excellent breakfast with buffet and a la carte. That’s what we like, all a la carte maybe looks luxury but not for us. All friendly staff who all seem to enjoy their work apart from one grumpy older waiter at breakfast who    showed it too much.
The only thing which surprised us was that there where no usb sockets for charging phones. But if we would have asked for a converter or plug i’m sure they would have provided it, that’s the level of service we experienced.
Corinthia is right there at the top in London.
Thanks for having us.",5,2024,02,15
143,An oasis from where to explore London.,"Excellent venue, facilities, staff and experience.
People remember you, your name and your preferences here.
Special mention to Kate Mazaika (Salon), Yasmin (Spa), Torre (Manager) and Radu (Porter) for being friendly, knowledgeable and very helpful throughout our stay.
Has that old fashioned luxury hotel glow, coupled with modern equipment.
An oasis from where to explore London and nurture relationships. Will definitely return.",5,2024,02,05
143,Another fabulous afternoon tea experience ,"We returned this year for the champagne afternoon tea.  We got there a little early so enjoyed a wine or two in the bar and wish we had arrived earlier.  The wine and service was sublime.  Again this year, the afternoon tea was absolutely delicious, the service spot on and attention to detail a credit to the man himself, Thomas Kocks (who I still didn't get to meet) but it is so obvious how much his staff adore him and obviously this passion transcends to the customers.  ",5,2024,02,04
143,Top tea!,"Just returned from afternoon tea at the Corinthia, what a treat!
Have tasted tea at most of the top London hotels over the years but this is up there with the best. Food absolutely delicious, staff and service tip top and professional yet warm and friendly, including the service and staff in the bar prior to the tea. Will definitely be visiting again soon - a delightful experience all round!",4,2024,01,29
143,Afternoon Tea at Corinthia,Nothing but good things to say about the afternoon tea at Corinthia. I requested for a good spot on the call prior to the booking which was gladly fulfilled by the team. The ambience was on point and just right for social with friends and family. The sweet and savoury afternoon tea experience was enhanced by the smiles and attentiveness of the team. It's worth the price and worth another visit. 10/10 would recommend.,5,2024,01,28
143,Dinner at the Garden Restaurant,"Marco de Simone, Deputy Restaurant Director, went out of his way to look after me and my guest, the service was impeccable and the food outstanding.
We enjoyed the Hotel atmosphere and look forward to return and try other food outlets the Corinthia hotel offers.",5,2024,01,27
143,Best hotel in London,"I stayed here on 31st Dec for New Year celebration.
I love everything about this hotel.. start from the helpful and friendly staff, excellent service and the food as well.. dont forget try High Tea in lobby lounge.
The room is perfect for me, feel like home my homey room… complimentary champagne for Titanium member.. 
Very close to London eye where i want to see the spectacular fire works..
I might back to stay here again when i visit London",5,2024,01,20
143,A delightful 3 days in London,"From the moment we arrived to be greeted by aaron and geoff to the moment we left we felt like this hotel was giving us a hug 
we had dinner in The Northall Restaurant yesterday evening and the service by a young lady didn’t catch her name was faultless 
All in all the from the beautiful room, the breakfast service and the afternoon tea  we have had a fantastic 3day stay made all the more pleasant by the fabulous staff 
Just a couple of highlights were the fish and chips in the Tom Kerridge restaurant which we both thought were amazing and the croque monsieur we had on the return from the theatre 
Thanks again to all the staff",5,2024,01,18
143,Top notch hotel,"Location: close to Embarkment tube station, Charing cross and parliament.

Atmosphere: 5-star hotel with very nice modern interior – world class decoration and service.

Service: not many hotels in the world will offer this kind proactive service in all departments ranging from reception, room service and restaurants. I never had to ask for any service as they had been provided before asking for anything.

Facilities: restaurants, free wifi, high-end spa

Rooms: offer nice view over London, well designed modern rooms. You get what you pay for.

Restaurants: Northall, Garden. Both restaurants are very special and offer great food and service. The garden restaurant offered a lot of German type food and considering that it is end of January it was cold to sit outside. Infra-red and an open fire helped to combat the cold in combination with sheep skin. These guys know how to make a customer happy.

Overall verdict: I rarely dish out a 5 star rating but in this case it is an easy decision.",5,2024,01,15
143,Christmas 2023!,"We stayed here for my 40th birthday a few years back and didn't think twice about staying here for the Christmas period 2023, but never did we expect anything like we experienced. My 40th birthday was special but staying here for 2 nights at Christmas is on a different level. 

Firstly we were fortunate enough to be upgraded to the Trafalgar Suite, this was by far the best suite we have ever stayed in and we have stayed in some beautiful hotels. The living room was so perfect, as we were able to have Christmas morning together as a family, having our champagne breakfast and opening our presents. The main bedroom was exquisite, everything and I mean everything was done to perfection. We use to just dance our way along to each others bedrooms as the hallway was soo long it was truly magical. 

The staff at Christmas time is like no other time in the year. I even noticed the maintenance guys in the lift wishing us a merry Christmas and this wasn't just because they had been told to (I can always tell!) they were genuinely happy and wanted to make your stay special. Absolutely every member of staff would wish you a merry Christmas. 

Front of House team - what an improvement from last time we stayed. The gentleman was outstanding who very kindly upgraded us, not just because of this but the way he came across, what a fantastic member of staff you have there.  He had a colleague training with him and he was also great, came across very professional and confident for a trainee. We absolutely loved the customer service this time and like they say there is no other place to stay at Christmas and god is this true. Ah I had forgotten the gentlemen's name but remembered he kindly sent us a message when your room was ready. His name was Gianfranco. Thank you Gianfranco for looking after us.  

The Velvet bar is fantastic, loved the fact it was an after dinner bar the live jazz band on Christmas eve were wonderful. They really set the mood and it was lovely to hear some Christmas songs. Kerridges for Christmas lunch, we didn't want to have an early sitting so was a little worried about booking the last sitting at 3:30pm but how wrong were we, there were lots of other diners at the same time. Absolutely loved the atmosphere, everyone was dressed so beautifully and really made an effort. Ok it was Christmas I know but you would be surprised how many top restaurants you go to and people are casually dressed. It was just perfect in every way and then to disappear into our suite after dinner (well after making a visit to the Garden) to watch TV was the perfect end to our stay. 

Not forgotten the ESPA Life spa we spent the morning here on Christmas day.

We can't thank you enough Corinthia, thank you for making our Christmas the best yet. It was exceptional on every level.",5,2024,01,09
143,Perfect stay for my family,"Excellent in every way possible.
Rooms were amazing and we were upgraded as we checked in.
Staff very polite and attentive.
Breakfast was stunning.
We will absolutely choose the Corinthia when we stay in London.
Overall a 5 star experience.",5,2024,01,09
143,Absolute perfection - delivered with warmth and kindness,"I chose the Corinthia to celebrate my husband’s 50th Birthday and I’m so glad I did! This is a truly special place, with a staff who don’t possess an ounce of stuffiness or superiority. The welcome was warm and efficient, and we had a tour from the lovely Lavinia. We received generous acknowledgment of the special occasion. Our suite was beautiful, with a very comfortable bed for our daughter in the lounge.

The Corinthia smells amazing - and fresh flowers are everywhere. 

During our stay we had breakfast at The Northall which was fantastic, especially the coffee. We also had a meal at Kerridge’s which was faultless. I was particularly impressed by the children’s menu and meal - a slightly smaller version of the adult’s fish and chips. 
We also used the spa - visiting the pool during family hours, and I also individually to use the facilities. It is unsurprising this spa has received so many accolades and awards. It is spectacular. The Espa Resilience treatment with Marnie was bliss. She was very skilled and intuitive, I felt amazing afterwards.

I would return to this hotel in an instant. The surroundings, public spaces, and rooms are stunning and timeless. The location is fantastic and very convenient. It was also quiet .. something I’ve never experienced in a London hotel! If you are considering booking, don’t hesitate.",5,2024,01,08
143,First time experience,"Afternoon TEA
I went for a beautiful afternoon tea, I spoke to a lovely receptionist who managed to get my a table for afternoon tea I had a lovely experience at the Corinthia I was very happy with the service and the knowledge that the staff offered me when I was there it was my first time here and it will be a experience I will never forget. I would truly recommend this as a experience u must try while in London plus there offered me more sandwiches and there keep my tea following",5,2024,01,07
143,BEST HOTEL IN LONDON,"Another amazing experience, I absolutely love this hotel its the best!

From the minute you arrive until the sad time we have to leave everything is always made special by the team, and dog friendly in every part of the hotel too! 

We had afternoon tea which was superb, the pastry chef is superrr! champagne, sandwiches, desserts and pastries. Dinner twice in kerridges. They have the best quality steak which is cooked and rested to perfection and a wine list to compliment any preference. LOVE IT! and when rest is needed visit the best spa in town! 

If you are thinking about staying, DO IT! 

Danielle quattromini and the whole team should be proud you are all amazing and thank you so much for yet another incredible stay!

See you soon!x",5,2024,01,05
143,Absolutely Amazing.,"Absolutely faultless. Have stayed here a few times in the past and this has always been my go to for a treat. This visit over the Christmas period was amazing, it really could not have been better. From the welcome through to housekeeping and room service everyone was genuinely happy to see you and help. The best in London as far as I am concerned. Thank you.",5,2023,12,26
143,Christmas treat,"The hotel is very well kept and the staff in all areas excellent. We ate at all the restaurants and they are all top quality
We loved our stay and would highly recommend 
We stayed in a junior deluxe suite that was quiet, had a Courtyard view and a most comfortable bed",5,2023,12,24
143,"Great location, food and service.","One of my favourite hotels in London. Stayed there a few times over the last year or two. Room is very nice, spacious and clean.  Location is great - walking distance to Picadilly, New Bond St, Oxford St etc.  Service was amazing and Food was incredible for breakfast and dinner.  (Didn't try lunch in the hotel).",5,2023,12,17
143,Beautiful hotel with wonderful staff,"We walked into this hotel with the view to visiting the bar and we weren’t disappointed! 
We approached a member of staff to ask the direction of the bar and the hospitality couldn’t have been more welcoming. Mahder asked us what we were looking for and took us to both of the bars to have a look. When we made our choice she spoke to the man at the desk of the bar and told him we would like and drink and would preferably like to sit up on the stools - which he arranged.
The service at the bar was great - friendly staff and a good range of drinks (I can recommend the Crystal Chandelier).
I would definitely go back to this hotel for drinks or a stay! The welcome and service from Mahder gave the most wonderful impression that was backed up by her colleagues!",5,2023,12,17
143,Easily one of the top hotel choices in London. Thoroughly recommend it.,"Brought the family for a family Christmas trip to London. The hotel were excellent at setting up dinner reservations etc and provided a fantastic experience. The rooms are some of the best in London and the restaurants are great, especially the Winter Garden which is magical at this time of year.",5,2023,12,16
143,Fantastic Festive Afternoon Tea,"Having been a regular visitor to The Corinthia hotel for afternoon tea we always look forward to our visits especially for the Festive Afternoon Tea. 2023 proved to be no different.
From the courteous and friendly welcome from the doorman on entering the hotel foyer. Whilst viewing the decorations in the foyer we could hear the beautiful sound of the piano being expertly played by Kevin the pianist. We knew we had arrived and looked forward with excitement to the offerings.
Cas and his team really know how to serve treating every guest as special. The quality of the sandwiches, scones and cakes always never fail to deliver. Yago the patisserie chef is a master. 
What makes the Crystal Moon Lounge so special is the combination of professional friendly service of the staff and the quality food. We have tried other establishments in London and always return to The Corinthia.
Thank you to all concerned. Our next is in January 2024, we can’t wait.
Mr & Mrs Brown",5,2023,12,16
143,Festive Afternoon Tea - Divine !,"We had the pleasure of an amazing Festive Afternoon Tea at the Corinthia Hotel to celebrate a special occasion.  From the moment we arrived the service from all the staff was exemplary and the food quite simply divine.  It actually made me feel quite emotional as it was such a wonderful afternoon with memories to treasure.  Our special thanks to the pianist Kevin who took time out to talk to us and make us feel special and our lovely waitress (sadly we didn’t catch her name, but she was from Cambridge!).  Corinthia London we’ll be back !",5,2023,12,15
143,Stunningly beautiful Northall bar!,"We were Christmas shopping in London and as we often do, we stopped for drinks at Kerridges who unfortunately didn’t have a table for us so we were directed to the Northall bar who could accommodate us….and wow! We haven’t been before so it was a new treat and what a gorgeous place! The staff were fabulous and very attentive and the drinks were delicious. Gorgeous setting for our last stop before getting the train home (albeit a little tiddly!) and we’ve walked through the hotel many times when visiting Kerridges and it’s always a beautiful place to be. Thank you all for lovely pre Christmas drinks! Now we know where you are, we’ll be back another time!",5,2023,12,14
143,Amazing Hotel,My husband and I just love this hotel. We have stayed and sometimes just pop in for a glass of bubbly when in London and no matter the occasion the staff are just so friendly and helpful. They always make us feel so welcome. I can’t wait to stay again in February. ,5,2023,12,13
143,First class afternoon tea,Fantastic afternoon tea experience with great service from Marco and his lovely team.  Well done everyone!  It’s very friendly and relaxed here and the food was delicious.  Great location and less stuffy than some London venues without losing out on quality service.,5,2023,12,12
143,Corinthia Staff 5 Stars,"Best 10 days ever!  Everything about this hotel was great, from the moment we checked in, to the time we checked out.  There was a small glitch in our room that was immediately responded to. 
The location was perfect. this was our first time in London and we are so glad we stayed here.  
What really made this stay exceptional was the staff.  they could not have been nicer.  5 star hotels are more than just a pretty lobby, it is the team that makes it work and the Corinthia has made that happen...We truly enjoyed our 10 days there!  Can not wait to come back.",5,2023,12,09
143,Wedding Celebrations ,Thank you to Jenny and the incredible team for making our special day unforgettable! Your hard work and dedication are truly appreciated. Everything was wonderful from start to finish. Wishing you all the best from Zoe & Chris. ,5,2023,12,09
143,Highly recommend ,This is my second stay at the Corinthia. The hotel is conveniently located near the tube and Trafalgar Square. There is an amazing gym and spa. The service is excellent. The rooms are large and modern by European standards. Highly recommend.,5,2023,12,03
143,Birthday afternoon tea,"We were at the hotel for afternoon tea, it was incredible, service from Marco & Marina was superb, and as it was for my birthday they made it very special for me & my friend.
Will definitely be returning in the future.

143,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE","just had a beautiful Festive afternoon tea where every aspect of the food was delicious and well presented with a blend of traditional and Xmas 🎄 setting as always is top class and staff friendly and efficient. Marco was brilliant and will be an asset to the hotel , good humour and lots of knowledge considering it was his first week! Loved the attention to detail and little extra touches eg takeaway boxes, plum jam and happy birthday played on the piano with the little birthday cake, thank you",5,2023,11,30
143,Wonderful Experience,Beautiful hotel. Stunning. The hotel staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. Tons of food options via the multiple onsite restaurants. The spa is incredible. 4 floors of luxury spa treatments and services. We can't wait until our next visit!,5,2023,11,28
143,A disaster,"This hotel is a total disaster! we went here for a weekend away on the first night everything was going well until we tryed to enter the red velvet bar and the guy on the door said to my wife she wasn’t dressed appropriate for the bar which was total nonsense and not the case at all, when this happend we were really upset about this spoke to the hotel mangers. they promised us the moon and stars which non of this happened so we decided to check out a day earlier then we were suppost to. upon on us leaving the hotel my wife left a Christian Dior hand bag in the wardrobe we didn’t notice this gone until we were half way home on the train so we rang the hotel manger and he said he was going to have a look then he phoned back saying it’s not in the room so basically the hotel staff have stolen the bag from the room, so I reported this to the police and they said this happens all the time I also checked there reviews and someone’s Rolex watch went missing out of there room aswell. The hotel staff didn’t do anything to help us or offer us anything all they did is send us a email saying they can’t find it. I would advise anybody to stay a way from this hotel as the staff are all corrupt and like to take peoples hard earned items and steel them it’s ridiculous you can’t leave your stuff in the room with out it going missing.",1,2023,11,27
143,3 STAR WANNA BE 5 STAR,"Majority of the staff and guests are from the Balkans Bulgarian,Serbian,Albanian etc…

The premises are clean but 
The staff definitely not proficient in English language,

The staffs outfits are all ill fitted they are mostly to tight for most and shabby for the rest
Perhaps New HR Director & Manager?

I would replace the F&B Director without the slightest hesitation he deserve a Medal for procuring the worst and the cheapest eggs in the country-Bravo 

Obviously he is not aware that eggs do play a big role not only in Breakfast but when preparing other dishes too

Guys do you think you are on par with the luxury 5 Star hotels where staff speak fluent English and the food quality is far more Superior to yours,Ni wonder at nights no one eats at your restaurants 

Oh one last thing for the GM when you walk around the hotel go and check the paintings in the walls on the 6th and 5th floor corridors and let’s see if you can spot the wonky frames 

And when you go in to the fitness there’s a step in 4 days that I was there nearly everyone tripped-Health £ Safety ?? 

Conclusion-Best to Avoid",2,2023,11,21
143,Amazing Staff,"We had a lovely three night stay here. I want to start by saying, the staff here are absolutely wonderful, some of the nicest, friendliest staff we have encountered in London and we have stayed at most of the top hotels. 
Positives:  We had an Executive Room, and it was spacious and very quiet. From the moment we arrived, our car & luggage was taken care of. We were shown to our room, all what you expect from a 5 Star hotel. 
Décor throughout is lovely. We had afternoon tea, which was wonderful and again, brilliant service. 

Negatives: Attention to detail is lacking. On arrival our room had half used Toiletries in the bathroom, the bathrobe had a hole in it and the belt loop was broken. Some of the silicone in the toilet area was very worn & discoloured. Water wasn’t  refreshed during the morning cleaning service. These might be minor but for this standard of hotel, you don’t expect it. We have raised the issues with management. We also found the bed very hard - however this was resolved with a topper. 
Breakfast is also average. We tried both buffet and A La Carte. I ordered poached eggs with a side of mushrooms. This was presented so badly, no effort at all and a single small mushroom. 

We also booked directly with the hotel, as they offer a “complimentary upgrade” subject to availability - we didn’t get an upgrade. So if you see a better offer elsewhere don’t be swayed by this. We wish we had booked via British airways Avios now and earned our points! 

We did , however, have a lovely stay and the staff made the visit memorable.",4,2023,11,20
143,"You chose, well.","We were looking for a hotel in which to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  The decision came down to location, ambience, room size, value for money and amenities.
Our stay got off to the best possible start, with an early check-in proving no issue. Lovely, well appointed and very quiet room (45 m), including a Dyson hairdryer.
The spa was the finest I have ever visited, with luxuriant robes and towels and the most helpful of staff.
Speaking of staff, the level of service was nothing short of perfection, we breakfasted daily at the Northall and had Sunday lunch with our visiting children, the food was of the finest quality with generous portions.
Huge thank you to all the staff, which is surely testimony to the management team in place at the Corinthia.

We experienced multiple instances of generosity during our stay, going above and beyond our expectations, leaving us with wonderful memories that will surely stay with us for the years to come.",5,2023,11,19
143,What a Transformation!,"The photos and facilities look so fantastic! What a transformation. It looks so different from the run down corridors and offices of the former Metropole Building of the 1980s. I had many good memories of working on the 6th floor. Some offices looked over the front/side and others overlooked a courtyard in the middle of the building. The turrets at the top were unoccupied and left to pigeons. In those  days, we only accessed the building from Northumberland Avenue (entrance in Whitehall Place was locked and gated). The old Ballroom was used as a furniture storage area. Unbelievable today when you see the grandeur and luxury of what is now The Corinthia.",5,2023,11,19
143,A wonderful experience after a big disappointment,"booked online on a Friday night after abandoning another hotel for truly unacceptable accommodations.
Hotel Corinthia recommended by daughters who live and work in London.
What to say.....
A truly superior hotel, extremely difficult if not impossible to find anything less than perfect.
Staff very kind, helpful, knowledgeable and attentive to meet any need.
To be recommended without a doubt.
We will definitely stay there again.",5,2023,11,07
143,Best hotel in London,An amazing experience from start to finish. Staff are so friendly professional and helpful. Rooms are beautiful spa is amazing. Nothing too much trouble for anyone. From the friend. Helpful doormen to reception to room staff. Radul head doorman went out of his way to make us feel like vips! Can't wait for our return in January,5,2023,10,27
143,Amazing spa,"Had a spa trip with my husband and the facilities are AMAZING. You could spend the whole day down there. On top of that, Ana looked after us like we were royalty! I’ve never felt so special! Definitely one for the ‘to do again’ list! Loved it. ",5,2023,10,26
143,Amazing hotel experience.,"Stayed here for four nights with my partner and can state without reservation, that this is one of the finest hotels I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying. 
It started with a warm welcoming, seamless check in, and tour of the property from Aisha, the Director of guest relations. I ordered some treats for the room to celebrate my partners birthday. When we checked in the room was ready, and there was a personal note of welcome and congratulations.
The staff were exceptional and referred to us by name throughout the visit.
Stayed in an executive room, which was spacious with a luxuriously comfortable bathroom.  Coming from Florida, the heated floors in the bathroom were much appreciated.
I  forgot to mention my allergies down bedding and, when it was brought to the housekeeping staffs attention, the bedding was changed out within 45 minutes. 
Special thanks to the valet Radu, for helping with transportation and suggestions to get around town in the simplest manner.  We were able to take advantage of the hotels car service, which is upon availability and very much came in handy when going out to dinner a couple of evenings.
Friday night at the Velvet cocktail lounge was a fantastic experience, with an excellent musical ensemble and fantastic singer . The bartenders were welcoming and cocktails  especially creative.
Cannot rave enough about this exceptional proprty.",5,2023,10,26
143,My best Hotel Experience in London!,"
Anyone who has the opportunity to check in at the Corinthia, eat something in one of the restaurants (excellent tea time), visit the bar or enjoy the spa will certainly not forget it. One of the most beautiful and luxurious hotels in London in a perfect location for sightseeing or business, many beautiful places such as Trafalgar Square with the National Gallery are just a few minutes' walk away, as is Horse Guards Parade. The Thames is a street away, where there is also a beautiful park, the Whitehall Gardens. Also the tube station Enbankment is very close and various bus stations. Food: I've never had a better breakfast (even the simple porridge was absolutely delicious), steak and Scottish salmon were on point, room service food was also very tasty (best club Cesars Salad I've ever had), prices fair for such a luxurious hotel. It is quiet in the beautifully furnished rooms, many small details from the nice-smelling soap to the orthopedic mattress give you the feeling of experiencing a luxury holiday! But the most important and best thing in every hotel is the open-mindedness and professionalism of the staff and here I classify the Corinthia in the absolute champions league, any requests and suggestions were gladly received and quickly fulfilled. Actually, there are small things in every hotel, even in very high-quality ones, that can bother you, but I couldn't find any with the best will in the world. Many hotels can offer luxury today, but the greatest value during a stay is the friendly smile of the staff and their willingness to help. I can fully recommend the Corinthia London and look forward to the next stay! ",5,2023,10,23
143,Fantastic stay,"The most excellent and attentive staff from check in to check out. God sized room, excellent spa facilities and truly outstanding Velvet bar. Concierge was most helpful and the breakfast was outstanding. The key to a lovely stay was that each member of staff was attentive, helpful, polite and a delighted to assist.",5,2023,10,23
143,Items stolen from my room.  They did nothing,"I stayed here on business as my favourite hotel was fully booked.   Hotel is a standard 5 star in London.  Nice but nothing to make it stand out above the others.   I went down to breakfast just before check out and when i returned to collect my bags my AirPods were not there.  I check on my apple app and they were leaving the hotel.  Someone had been in my room and taken them when I was away.  I checked with the hotel and they did nothing about it.  I have asked them on a few occasions and I am told security are working in it.  They will no doubt reply on this review to ask me to contact them to discuss.  Either way, if you stay in this hotel watch out for theft.",1,2023,10,21
143,Awesome,Awesome expierence. I really like that it’s close to everything. I love going to the Big Ben nearby. It was very close to my new favorite restaurant that sells the best curry. I’ll be back in the future.,5,2023,10,19
143,Home away from home,"The most amazing hospitality experience! The most attentive, caring and professional staff accompanied by wonderful facilities and beautifully decorated rooms. I will not stay anywhere else when in London. The hotel upholds the highest standard of service and luxury and well deserved with its prestigious name. I am truly impressed.",5,2023,10,16
143,Unassuming luxury ,This is the best hotel in London and worth every penny. The hotel is immaculate and the staff are very attentive but not pushy. The standard of accomodation and food is exemplary throughout and nothing is too much trouble ,5,2023,10,16
143,Most amazing hotel!,This hotel is impeccably run. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly and the amenities are perfect! The bedding is so luxurious and the heated floors in the bathroom make it feel so comfortable. The breakfast is expansive and fresh and the flowers are absolutely outstanding.

143,The top-notch service made for a truly memorable stay,"Stayed 3night with my partner to celebrate our anniversary.upon arrival we were greeted by the friendly staff who promptly checked our in and escorted us to the room. The hotel itself is beautifully designed ,with modern and elegant decor. My suite was spacious and my partner and I spend great time here.
The dinning options at the hotel are also exceptional,I had the pleasure of dinning and drinking at the hotel restaurants and BARs, especially dinner at the kerridges.the service was impeccable ,food are amazing, I love the paw print details, and whole restaurant ambience was elegant yet comfortable.",5,2023,10,08
143,Expected the best and got just that!,"The difference between great hotels and good hotels is often subtle and involves the small but discernable. The Corinthia achieves greatness by attending to details, like upgraded furniture, beautiful wood finishes, high ceilings, and tasteful art and table books that make one feel like they are home, or better yet, in a luxury apartment that is better than home! The beds, linens and pillows are a dream. The towels in the bathroom are new, thick, and plentiful. My ladyfriend loved the size and depth of the tub, and the rainshower was the biggest I've ever experienced. While there, we made two requests of staff, both of which were fulfilled as if we were the only guests at the hotel. 
I'll be back for sure!",5,2023,09,24
143,Best Place in London,"The Corinthia is a great location but that is only just the beginning.  I could go on forever about the fantastic food and the incredible rooms.  But the best part of the experience is the staff. From check in to check out, every detail covered and addressed.  I cannot say enough about the Butler service. They are always there for you. I have stayed at the hotel multiple times and excellence is consistent every time . Give it a try and I think you will feel the same!",5,2023,09,23
143,A truly special hotel.,"We went in for 2 diet cokes, having seen this on the tv. They treated us like Queens. It's a beautiful place and an uplifting experience. We were in the Northall Bar and the customer service was elegant and smooth as a ballet. The staff are friendly and welcoming, and the hotel is the most beautiful space.",5,2023,09,19
143,Perfect stay,"We stayed for one night at the corinthia. Our stay was perfection from start to finish 

On arrival, we were greeted by the lovely reception team, and quickly escorted to our room. Rooms are well equipped, with all the luxuries expected of a 5 star London hotel. 

We dined at both the Garden and Velvet whilst in the hotel. Both outlets had an excellent atmosphere, with fantastic service. The velvet bar was a particular favourite, given the excellent cocktails and love singers. 

We also ordered room service breakfast which was promptly delivered, and of excellent quality. 

During our stay, we visited the spa which was also fantastic.

We will return in the near future!",5,2023,09,18
143,Excellent ,"My wife and I had the please of 3 nights at the Corinthia. This maybe one of the finest hotels I've ever had the pleasure of staying in. The staff was an absolute 10 and the facilities are impeccable. The gym and spa are second to none and our room was immaculate, spacious and well appointed. This is a must stay if youre in London",5,2023,09,16
143,Top notch,"I have stayed at the Corinthia Hotel many times and it never disappoints. It has beautifully appointed rooms, 1st class service, great food, a wonderful spa and workout facility, and a warm dedicated staff that always exceed expectations. I’ve stayed at lots of hotels in London and can say definitively that the Corinthia is my favorite by far. Strongly recommend.",5,2023,09,16
143,Excellent hotel with minor issues,"Excellent hotel overall. Really good and fairly consistent level of service throughout, with well appointed rooms.
Minor issues - at one point this Australian bartender was rude to us one morning (informed front desk but not much was done about it). Hotel at this level should train staff on how to speak to guests in an appropriate manner. 
Another little issue is that at the end of the stay, they added service charge to room charges. Wouldn’t be an issue if this was communicated ahead of time (check in) that they will add service charge that will “pool funds for all employees” as was explained when I was checking out m. However, I kept tipping all staff directly (bellman, housekeeping etc) so I don’t understand point of this. Totally unnecessary. Especially given you don’t inform the guest ahead of time.",4,2023,09,16
143,Always excellent!,"This was our fifth visit to The Corinthia.  Obviously, all of our prior visits were excellent so we returned!  The Corinthia remains a premier hotel.  The building and rooms are beautifully decorated and maintained.  The breakfast is outstanding.  The staff is friendly and professional.  The rooms are well stocked and immaculate.  AND, the Corinthia has the best Concierge team!  We have been to many five star hotels over the years, but the  Corinthia is at the top of our list.  ",5,2023,09,07
143,Beautiful Hotel,What can I say except WOW!!! We stayed for one night for my husbands birthday and also our wedding anniversary.  We stayed in a deluxe room which was lovely.  We had lunch at Kerridges bar and grill which was delicious and the portions are very generous. The staff at the hotel are all lovely and really helpful and everyone went out of their way to make us feel looked after.  Couple of minor issues - we used the spa facilities on the morning of our checkout but forgot to bring a bag to put our wet swimwear in afterwards so we asked guest services if they could provide a plastic bag so our suitcase wouldn’t get wet and they provided a bin liner - it would be better if guests were given a proper bag in the spa.  We also had room service breakfast which was generally very good but the pastries were cold and there was no toast.  These were minor issues as everything else was so good and we will definitely be back.  We had a lovely stay and will definitely be back.,5,2023,09,01
143,5 Star all the way,"A true 5 Star Hotel!!

We stayed for 2 nights and our experience was outstanding. It commenced the moment we arrived, the smell of fresh cut flowers and Check In staff that escort you to your room, the staff in the restaurant, everyone is professional and pleasant!
The breakfast is one of the best we have ever had in any hotel. 
The gym is a good size and well equipped. 
Our room was nice and quiet and considering how close you are to the action of London, it is a perfect location to walk around the city or jump on the underground. The bed linens are cozy and something to experience after a long flight! 
We would rate this higher if possible. We have stayed in numerous hotels and must say that the Corinthia is one of our absolute favourite hotels. We stayed at the Corinthia a few years ago and on this trip we returned again. We were just as impressed as we were on our previous visit.
Highly recommend it, as they really know how to be a 5 star property!!!",5,2023,08,30
143,Brilliant London Hotel !,"After some initial trouble using my gift voucher, Iiona really assisted to make sure this could be used for my two night stay and went above and beyond.

The hotel and staff were lovely -

The pool and jacuzzi considering the hotel is in  central London is awesome.

The room was lovely with really comfy bed.

The location is great.

Breakfast was lovely.

9.5/10!!!!",5,2023,08,24
143,Birthday Celebration ,"We always have a fabulous time at Corinthia London, this was my 5th visit. The hotel's location is perfect for exploring, close to the river and two underground stations and within walking distance of lots of the main sights. The hotel is proper first class luxury, the hotel staff are always welcoming and friendly. The rooms are spacious and very comfortable. I received a lovely unexpected and thoughtful surprise in the room for my birthday: a delicious slice of cake and a bottle of champagne. They certainly know how to make you feel like a princess. The hotel spa is a fabulous, calming space, the perfect place to unwind after lots of exploring. We will definitely be back for my annual birthday treat.",5,2023,08,13
143,Sublime,"Amazing hotel, you are greeted with opulence as soon as you enter reception. The on-site spa is the best in London. Room service sublime. Friendly and attentive staff. I would recommend the afternoon tea. ",5,2023,08,12
143,Outstanding.,"I’ve stayed at the Corinthia many times since it first opened and I can only say it started off great and simply seems to get better as each year passes. The location is outstanding, the decor is stylish and comfortable but importantly everything is maintained perfectly.
The biggest differentiators are the service and the food. Team members all smile and say hello and nothing is ever too much trouble for them. There are three great restaurants and three bars - and room service arrives quickly and magically hot.
If I could give 7 stars I would.",5,2023,08,12
143,Perhaps the Best!,"Perhaps the finest hotel experience I’ve ever had. My family typically stay at 4-5 Star properties and the service, comfort of the room, and attention to detail was unparalleled during our stay. It will be our home in London whenever we return from now on.",5,2023,08,09
143,Our wedding weekend,"We hosted our intimate wedding celebration at the Corinthia on Saturday and as such also stayed with them for the weekend.

Every single element of our weekend went perfectly, the staff provided a level of service I have not experienced anywhere else in the UK before. Nothing is too much for them. 

Our hotel room blew us away. Spacious, modern and provided everything you could need for a night away.  Concierge and housekeeping were attentive and every request was fulfilled almost immediately. 

We used the spa facilities three times during our stay and WOW! Beautiful facilities, spotlessly clean, and so well thought out that they have specific ‘family times’ so everyone can enjoy.

An extra special thank you to our event planner Giulia, who could not do enough for us and ensured we had everything we could possibly need for the weekend. If you are looking for a venue to host a really special occasion / event, I couldn’t recommend the Corinthia highly enough. You will not be disappointed. ",5,2023,08,07
143,The ultimate luxury hotel in London.,"A fantastic experience. The room was luxurious & very spacious. The service was superb from check-in to departure. The staff was attentive, helpful, yet not intrusive. The food was excellent. In my opinion it is the best luxury hotel in London.",5,2023,08,05
143,Beautiful hotel but…,So attended the bar on a Friday afternoon. Thought we’d have tea and something light to eat. Asked what appeared to be a senior waiter if any of the meat was halal. Told the chicken was. So we ordered a chicken club sandwich. This waiter bought our order. All looked delicious. Very well presented. As we took bites we noticed there was bacon atop the chicken!! I called the waiter over and showed him. He was puzzled at first then said he thought we only wanted the chicken to be halal! Now you’d expect staff in a central London hotel which is frequented by a lot of Arabs en masse to be knowledgeable about such a thing. But no. Think the owners of the Corinthian hotel need to do a better job in their training of staff. It won’t put me off going to the Corinthia again. It’s one of my favourite hotel.,4,2023,08,05
143,Luxury in London ,"If you are seeking a Luxury Hotel then look no further.  Excellent service from the moment you arrive.  We normally stay at the Sofitel St James but came here instead.  This will be our new base for all future trips.  

Breakfast was amazing and the service was again excellent.  The spa is worthwhile after a 24 hour flight. ",5,2023,08,05
143,The best,Love this hotel. It’s a favourite for true luxury. The spa is out of this world. We have been as a couple & with the kids and will definitely be going back. Breakfast is something to really look forward to. Staff can’t do enough for you. ,5,2023,08,04
143,Amazing afternoon tea,"Amazing afternoon tea to celebrate my graduation and my mums belated Mother’s Day present. The staff couldn’t do enough for us and it was so peaceful. The sandwiches were really nice, five choices! they offered us more which we asked for more egg mayonnaise as they were delightful. The scones and sweet treats were lovely, so much choice and selection and we got to take it all home which was amazing. I am not a big fan of tea so I asked for a hot chocolate. They brought me an entire teapot of hot chocolate and a bowl of marshmallows and whipped cream to add into my hot chocolate if I liked which was such a nice touch. As I was celebrating my graduation, they gave me a little congratulations sweet treat at the end which was so special. Overall, a lovely treat and will definitely do it again.",5,2023,07,31
143,Stunning afternoon tea. A+++ Hard to top!,"Weve heard that this the best afternoon tea out there and we tend to agree! The service and food were second to none. 
The staff were so attentive and couldn’t do enough for you. Portions were generous. Stunning surroundings. A bit more of a pricey afternoon tea but honestly worth every penny.",5,2023,07,24
143,Outstanding throughout,"My wife and I stayed in February 2023 for a short (toddler free!) weekend break and as part of my 40th birthday celebrations. We have been lucky enough to stay in some amazing hotels around the world, but the Corinthia is just outstanding. Obviously at this price point you expect the service to be amazing (it is), the food to be first class (it is) and the facilities to be top notch (they are). They are a given. And so you are looking for the little extras, the soft touches, the feeling of staying in the world’s finest home and not a large hotel. All of which it has. Whatever “it” is, the Corinthia has it. We loved every second and (against our usual rule), will absolutely return.",5,2023,07,03
143,Fantastic afternoon tea!,"We had afternoon tea here this weekend, the food, drink, venue & service were all perfect- just the right amount of attentiveness from the staff without appearing pushy or over bearing. The tea selection was very good, the sandwich, scones & cakes were some of the best we have had.

The venue itself is excellent, you would not know that you were in central london until you leave, it was nice and peaceful with a pianist playing in the background.

Having had afternoon tea at other venues in London & elsewhere, this was by far the very best! We will be back.",5,2023,07,01
143,Excellent stay at Corinthia!,"Fantastic stay at the Corinthia with our teens.  Service was amazing - from the check-in at the front desk, to the concierge, housekeeping and the spa- everyone was so friendly and helpful.

We’ve stayed in a few rooms and suites. My favourites are the river suites. But trafalgar also good.
Afternoon tea is very lovely too, and highly recommended. ",5,2023,06,15
143,Unbelievable experience,"There is nothing about this hotel and the staff that you will not enjoy. 
The spa deserves to be voted the best in London and if you have a treatment, especially a massage, with Cathy you will never want to have a massage with anyone else. In under 2 minutes she identified my problem areas and tailored my massage to suit, I will return just to visit her!!
We also got to meet Tom Kerridge and was sent complimentary cakes and champagne for my birthday.",5,2023,06,09
143,Houston review,Thoroughly amazing from start to finish. We was with our 5 year old son and the attention to detail even for him was outstanding. The staff are a next level of class and care. Cannot wait to return. I missed it the minute we left. ,5,2023,06,09
143,Excellent 5 Star London Property,"The Corinthia met all of our very high expectations for a 5 star luxury hotel in London. All staff were professional, warm and attentive. In particular, the concierge (we dealt with Rafal and Dario) are sophisticated, knowing and responsive and provided great recommendations.   Fab cocktails and live music at Velvet Bar.  The suite had the perfect mix of contemporary elegance mixed with some British charm. Very well located for walking to attractions. Overall an excellent experience and we will certainly be back. Corinthia is a new favourite property in London.",5,2023,06,04

143,Beautiful Hotel,"What a fantastic nights stay. Firstly, the initial check in experience with the reception staff was so friendly and welcoming I knew this was going to be a stay to remember.  The room was beautiful and with a gorgeous bottle of complimentary champagne which really topped it off.    We had drinks in the Velvet bar before dinner.  What a gorgeous sumptuous space this was.  The cocktail menu was vast so there would be something for everyone. After a cocktail we ate in Kerridges.  Again, a great experience with beautiful food and surroundings.  This stay was a treat which will be repeated !!!!",5,2023,05,07
143,A really lovely happy atmosphere,"I have stayed once in this hotel and loved it and have been back for dinner/drinks since then. I went with friends who had not been before and I just had to write this as we had such a good time!  We were greeted in the lobby by a charming smiling lady and sort of butler beautifully dressed guy and they asked us three "" are you drinking or dining with us this evening?""  ""Both I hope"" I replied!  He showed us to to the Velvet Bar which is divine where they had a table free - all low lights, plushy red and gold seats - very very nice. we drank Champagne and all the waiters were smiling and charming even when we knocked over a glass of Champagne!  We then asked if we could go to Kerridge's and one of them very obligingly walked over there, confirmed it was okay and then escorted us there.
Everyone in that restaurant was also fun, welcoming and smiling so I commented on it and our server said "" we love working here"" - wow - and they show it!  We had a great dinner, chatted with more happy staff about the bread, the wine, the lovely crockery - it was really a remarkable atmosphere which we all noticed everywhere we went.  The chandeliers amd flowers are spectacular and I love the spoken poetry in the ladies room!
Thank you and well done!",5,2023,05,02
143,"5* hotel, staff and stay",Every time I stay in the Corinthia staff go over and above to make every moment special. I've only stayed a few times but they always remember me and manage to make me feel like I am the only person there.

The Northall is always a treat with delicious food and one of the best sommelier's I have come across. ,5,2023,05,02
143,Exceptional hotel,"Exceptional hotel - superb staff, friendly, helpful and welcoming. Room excellent with everything you could wish for. Our room had a view of the London Eye which was great.

The staff could not do enough for you, our room is the best we've ever stayed in... and yes.. would 100% go back.",5,2023,04,05
143,Exceptional service and rooms,"Wonderful hotel probably one of the best in London and for good reason.  Yes it’s big bucks but the service is exceptional.  Beautiful rooms huge beds, fabulous toiletries you could just spend all day enjoying the room and spa.  Sadly I had to work but loved every minute when I was there!",5,2023,04,03
143,The Best Afternoon Tea in London,"We visited The Corinthia for afternoon tea with friends.  From start to finish it was a special occasion and everything was absolutely perfect.  The room which has a stunning light installation, piano playing, excellent service - professional, friendly, nothing was too much trouble.  The quality of the sandwich selections , scones, cakes and selection of teas and coffees were second to none.  The champagne we choose to start our tea was excellent.  The value is exceptional and we would not hesitate to recommend afternoon tea here. This will now be our go-to for afternoon tea in the future.  Thank you for making our afternoon so special.",5,2023,04,03
143,A weekend well spent,"The most wonderful weekend in the most incredible hotel. From start to finish the service was impeccable, food incredible & the best experience. All staff are excellent at what they do , so friendly and helpful. ",5,2023,04,03
143,Almost perfect.,"We stayed for three nights and found the rooms luxurious and peaceful and the hotel public areas beautifully decorated. Well done to the staff who are attentive, helpful and friendly without being over-bearing or too formal. 
One or two things were less than perfect…considering the price I would expect breakfast served hot and on hot plates, Though tasty, none of the breakfast food was hot and my partner reported the bacon a little tough and overdone. Breakfast took some time to arrive one morning. 
Continental breakfast had a very good range of foods as you might expect at this level of five star hotel. 
The Northall meal we ate was delicious and the Kerridge restaurant also excellent. 
We had afternoon tea, a lovely experience although we were seated in a slightly strange spot where staff were sorting plates and glasses etc, which was a bit distracting. In hindsight I should have asked for a better table. 
The Velvet Bar…we would have like to try it but on arrival, we were told there was no space except next to another couple, as 10 guests were expected. The website stays this bar has a No Reservation policy, so we were very surprised. 
Overall a luxurious, peaceful and pleasant place to stay, placed near so many attractions.",5,2023,03,29
143,Phenomenal Experience,My wife and I stayed at this amazing hotel on the 25th March celebrating our 20th Anniversary.  Everything from the moment we walked in to the moment we reluctantly left was spectacular and exceeded our expectations.  Each Bar was fantastic and the food and service in the Northall was exceptional.  Thank you to every member of staff for making our first stay at this hotel one we will never forget and trust me... We will be back!!!,5,2023,03,27
143,Beautiful Hotel!,"I would give this hotel 10 stars if possible! I love to stay at nice places. The Corinthia is beautiful! My rooms were immaculate. (I had a suite) The staff is amazing - they go above and beyond to make sure you have a memorial stay. They supplied bottled water, nepresso, candy and every night they put fresh lavender on our pillows. The slippers and robe are so comfortable.
My daughter and I had the afternoon tea at the Crystal Lounge. I had informed the staff before we arrived that we have special dietary needs. They went above and beyond to make sure that everything was delicious and beautifully presented. Definitely lots of photo ops!
I was also fortunate enough to have a spa treatment. The first thing that I noticed besides the spa being beautiful was the wonderful smell. I loved it so much I bought it back to the US. I had a wonderful massage and the infinity pool - I just loved it!
Breakfast was delicious. The chocolate croissants were better than France. I brought some home to my husband and he said it was the best chocolate croissant he ever had.
This was our first trip to London, and we will definitely be returning.  I will stay at the Corinthia again.
.",5,2023,03,25
143,A Valentine’s stay to remember,"Stayed the night here to celebrate valentines and to my surprise I was proposed to, my now fiancé couldn’t praise the staff enough on helping him plan the proposal, the room was full of balloons, cake, champagne, roses…the list goes on! 
Was simply stunning! 
we had an executive room which was pleasantly spacious, our room included a walk in wardrobe which was a perfect touch, loved everything about this room.
We used the valet parking, seamless service and attentive staff.
We enjoyed both the northall and velvet bar for drinks would highly recommend both.
The winter garden for lunch was absolutely stunning I would say this was the highlight for us, the feeling whilst your dining outside in the winter but so cosy with the most comforting food and drinks is something special, can’t wait to return here I’ve been dreaming about that baked Alaska ever since! 
We enjoyed the ESPA spa on both days and has to be my favourite spa I’ve ever visited in the UK, great facilities and perfectly laid out so you never feel it’s too busy.
I would lastly like to thank all staff for the great hospitality you had made our experience one to remember for sure! 
Now I look forward to returning every year to celebrate all over again",5,2023,03,23
143,Luxury at its very best,"This hotel wonderfully combines luxury and warmth. The staff are amazing, they do everything to make your stay comfortable from the start. Our room was very nice, it had a walk in closet, a bathroom with a bath & tv and walk-in shower, the bedroom was huge with an office area and rest area. 

We started our visit with champagne and oysters in the Northall Bar, again the staff were really excellent here. There is a large and varied cocktail list, good snacks and a vibrant atmosphere with many families stopping off for lunch.

Our lunch was in Kerridge’s Bar & Grill also situated at the hotel. This was a real treat and faultless.

We ended the evening in the champagne and cocktail bar Velvet, found behind a large velvet drape. It was like stepping back in time to the 1940s, soft jazz playing in a luxurious, dimly lit bar, you could imagine Winston Churchill smoking a cigar in the corner! The cocktail menu was extensive, including a page of cocktails made from vintage ingredients, some from the 1920s costing between £200-300!! We didn’t have those!!! 

This hotel is one of the best I’ve stayed in, it cleverly combines making you feel at ease with a high level of luxury. We will definitely stay again and can’t recommend it enough for a special occasion.",5,2023,03,23
143,5 Star All Around,"This is one of the top hotels in London.  The rooms are big and modern.  The location is central without being loud or touristy.  The food and service are 5 star.  The extra touches, like the design and set up of the hotel, are excellent.  All in all, a top choice!

One of the immediate standouts compared to other hotels is the size of the room.  We originally booked a Deluxe Room but, on account of our Amex FHR booking, were upgraded to an Executive Room.  It was huge.  The bed was supremely comfortable, the bathroom was large, the rainfall shower was excellent, and the windows were fully soundproof.  The bathroom even had heated floors.  One note, while there was good closet space, there was limited drawer space, so just an fyi.

The Northall for breakfast is excellent.  Both the huge buffet and cooked breakfast were included with our Amex FHR booking.  The spaces are stunning.  The service was very personal such as staff would great us by name each day; truly above and beyond.  The Velvet Room had an excellent cocktail selection and the space (and music) are awesome.  We did not eat at Kerridge's but the menu looked great.

Concierge is top notch.  The service is personal and friendly.  Everyone made the stay very comfortable and first class.  And the design of the hotel is very chic and modern.

One comment on check-in service that we quickly realized was a blip (because the rest of the stay was flawless) but wanted to note because it's an easy fix for the hotel: we arrived late morning when there was a tube strike as well as a big banking conference.  Our room was not ready (Amex FHR offers a noon check-in) and the front desk offered for us to relax for coffee while the room was finalized.  We were lead to believe it would be about a 30 mins-1 hour wait and that the coffee was on the house.  No one checked on us for about 2 hours, and then 2.5 hours later we finally got to our room (but our luggage was still downstairs, which required a call to get it since it took another 20 minutes to arrive).  The lounge also tried to charge us for coffee, but the server quickly waived that off as he said we had been waiting a long while.  It was clear from the front desk staff and the bellman who brought our luggage that things were chaotic (and to their credit they were professional and did not try to blame anyone), but this is an example of miscommunication and not managing expectations which is an easy fix. It would have been smarter to just say the room may not be ready for a bit, it's lunch time so go out and have bite, we'll call you when ready instead of us sitting around thinking the room would be ready shortly and not having lunch for several hours.  Thankfully, this was an outlier for an otherwise first class stay.",5,2023,03,22
143,A luxurious experience ,"We had an absolutely amazing stay. From the welcoming and friendly check in service, to the beautiful and relaxing spa facilities, to the delicious dinner at Kerridge’s (the best fish and chips we’ve ever eaten, every mouthful of the meal was perfect), to the wonderful live music and cocktails in Velvet bar, and then finally my partner saying yes when I proposed at the end of the night, an experience we will never forget. The staff both before we arrived and during could not have been more helpful. Definitely a luxury and expensive treat, but it’s more than worth it if you want to feel truly spoiled and taken care of. I’m sure we’ll be back, we definitely didn’t want to leave! Couldn’t recommend enough. ",5,2023,03,20
143,Top Class,"From the moment you step out of the London black cab to when you sadly have to depart we were not disappointed. Attentive, happy smiling staff yet discreet. A special occasion for my wife’s birthday, those little extra touches provided were special. Location could not have been better for us, walked for miles over the long weekend, coming back to rest our weary feet in luxury. Kerridge’s Bar & Grill superb, the Northall Bar for light snacks a must. Afternoon tea on the Sunday before leaving topped it off, wow!!. Thank you Corinthia and team.",5,2023,03,13
143,Great hotel,Amazing hotel. Beautiful lobby and very nice rooms. The gym was the best hotel gym I have ever seen! Great location and amazing restaurants and bars. A great place for a high end stay. Make sure to appreciate the gym and afternoon tea! Very close to Trafalgar Square,5,2023,03,10
143,Classy Corinthia,"When the General Manager personally welcomes you seconds after you walk through the entrance, you know this is a pretty special place to stay. Jochem Meijerink, thank you for making us feel incredibly welcome and valued from the moment we arrived. Corinthia London is clearly a very well oiled machine and every member of staff we encountered throughout our short stay made us feel very special. Our beautiful suite was wonderful and the little touches in the room made it so inviting. Beautiful fresh flower arrangements, wonderful books to read and a gorgeous cashmere blanket on the bed. The spa is something very special indeed. First class facilities and the ultimate secluded hideaway to completely switch off and relax in. Thank you to the therapist Vera for being so kind and caring, my massage was wonderful. We enjoyed a delicious breakfast in our room. So often a room service breakfast can disappoint in temperature or something being left off the order, but not at Corinthia. The breakfast was bursting in flavour and was a great start to our day. All in all a very spoiling 24 hours away from the reality and hustle bustle of life. We will most definitely return. Oh, and we didn't have afternoon tea on this occasion but having enjoyed a wonderful afternoon  tea last summer, I can confirm that it is THE best in London. Not the usual 'production line' that I've experienced at some of the other top London hotels. The service was immaculate and so friendly and personal and the actual tea offering itself was delcious.",5,2023,03,09
143,Beautiful Hotel in London,"This hotel was a delight.  Stayed in a Garden Suite that was very nice. Had a wonderful dinner in the Winter Garden, Breakfast every morning in The Northall & a few nights in Velvet, where I developed a taste for a Spicy Fifty (should have gotten the recipe). There were a few surprising glitches when the weekend approached. Had to ring a number of times for turndown service on Saturday night. Also, on the weekend, Northall service went from smooth & very professional to a bit frantic & lacking. Seems it was very busy & perhaps understaffed. However, overall it was 5 stars.",5,2023,03,04
143,The most amazing place,"I have no words to describe this hotel. From the first day my husband and I went there until we got married at the hotel Ballroom. Everything in the hotel is exquisite. The staff, the modern decor, the food. Our wedding it was just magical the events team is perfect! They will make everything in their power to guarantee a brilliant event. Their food menu is incredible. The canapes, the main coursec dessert. The service impeccable. I’d stayed 2 nights at one of their suites and OMG what a room. 80sq room. Beautiful living room with London Eye view. The bed is huge. A beautiful bathroom. I had the opportunity to enjoy the spa that has some nice lounge chairs to relax. I can’t think in a more magnificent place to stay and also to celebrate one of the most important days of my life. I should have done this review one year ago, but I wasn’t doing much reviews at that time. So now I couldn’t lose the opportunity. Perfect central London location and you will be treated just like royalty. And even more important they are a pet friendly place. 100!",5,2023,02,28
143,The BEST afternoon tea in London,"The BEST afternoon tea in London.

Amazing food, great service in a beautiful ambiance. Would definitely come back again and highly recommend it.

Sandwiches were delicious, freshly baked scones with the traditional strawberry jam and a delicious rhubarb jam, great touch.

They even offer pastries and cakes to take home. 

Loved it !",5,2023,02,23
143,Impressive Hotel with the most amazing dining hall,"Stayed at the Corinthia for a night as have had it on our Hotel Hit list for a long time. Location is amazing if you want to be close to Trafalgar Square, Buckingham Palace and Whitehall. Also, a stroll along the Themse is but a minutes walk away. 
The lobby and Cristal Moon space is breathtakingly grand ! What a statement and visual triumph as you enter the building. The check in counters are set to the right of the entrance call which is brilliant as the flow of foot traffic is directed very cleverly, avoiding congestion in a busy lobby!
There are two entrances to the hotel as it’s built on a triangular plot which is intriguing and practical as it allows for a good flow through the ground floor. The flower arrangements in the grand hall are gorgeous, whimsical and tasteful, infusing the lobby with a magical bouquet, making for a brilliant first impression. 
Check in was straight forward and our room was ready for us well before the usual check in time. Our room was on the first floor and overlooked a side street. It was beautifully proportioned and appointed with a comfortable king size bed. The floor plan made the most of the size of the room, separating the bedroom from the entrance hall and sizeable bathroom by means of pocket doors. Plush carpeting and insulation throughout the hotel meant that we couldn’t hear any of noise disturbances in our room at all!
During our stay we enjoyed lunch at Kerridge’s Bar and Grill (best fish and chips we have had in an age!) and enjoyed a very relaxing afternoon at the spa. 
Breakfast was stunning. Set in the gorgeous Northhall, it was a feast for the eyes as well as the stomach. The buffet was opulent and high quality and the cooked menu items were sublime. 

All in all, the Corinthia was a truly impressive hotel stay. The opulence is understated but evident at every turn. The staff were authentic and friendly with a genuine and unstarched approach. The Corinthia is a supremely elegant hotel that prides itself in professional and friendly service without trying to be anything more than it is: a very solid 5 Star luxury hotel.",4,2023,02,19
143,Overpriced…poor overall,Stayed at the hotel for a few days on business. Staff are very good as you expect. Gym is great. Room was very hot - A/C didn’t work. Also had problems with ‘do not disturb’ issues with staff entering the room. Overall for a 5 star property charging very high rates stay was poor. There are other hotels offering better value for money in the same area of London. I wouldn’t rush back.,2,2023,02,18
143,DISAPPOINTING-The Standard of the rooms have declined!!,"I’ve stayed at the Corinthia several times in the past & never had any problems but my stay this time has been very disappointing.

Last night there was a spider crawling on my bed & I was so shocked at this!! I asked for a room change. The manager on duty said the hotel was booked & they didn’t have any rooms; so housekeeping came to change the sheets. 

The following morning, Angela was kind enough to move us to another room, BUT Now this new room is very warm and the AC is not working. And the AC is making a very loud noise. They said the engineer fixed something on the roof of the building & that this would cool down the room, but the room is still very warm and the AC is making a very loud noise. This is going to be the second night I’m going to have terrible sleep in the hotel. The first night, I kept imagining a spider was still in the bed & I could hardly sleep!!

The quality of the hotel has certainly gone way down since my last visit here. The staff are still very nice, courteous and helpful but I’m very disappointed about the problems in the rooms. 

Even the carpets in the rooms are very dirty with stains and looking very tired & ripped at the corners. 

Corinthia, it is TIME TO CHANGE THE CARPETS, UPDATE YOUR AC SYSTEM & IMPROVE YOUR PEST CONTROL  & UPDATE THE QUALITY OF YOUR ROOMS if you’re going to keep charging the same prices you charge!!  

For a hotel of this pricing, the standards & quality of the room should be A LOT HIGHER. 

I will not be staying at the Corinthia in the future. The state of the rooms now makes it like a 3 to 4 star hotel!!",2,2023,02,17
143,Amazing stay,"We traveled with a group for several theater performances for a week and the hotel was just fantastic!!  The staff from the doorman meeting us on the street (due to road closures) to the check in staff, breakfast staff, housekeeping and even checkout staff were completely wonderful!  Any request was filled within minutes.  Always with a smile!  I can’t say enough about them! 

The room was spectacular as well.  We truly enjoyed the heated bathroom floor.  I can say we never experienced anything like that!  The room and features were as advertised.  About the only thing I would like to see changed is the pillows.  They were small, not much to them, but it did not take away from any sleep!

I would highly recommend this hotel!!!",5,2023,02,15
143,Upscale and fancy,"This hotel is fancy fancy and oh-so fabulous.  Everything is lovely and extremely high end to match the price. The rooms are enormous and the beds are the best I've ever stayed in.   My only (small) issue with the rooms are there are no outlets by the bed.  My one outlet was way behind the side table and you could not fit an adaptor.    And the room had 1 USB port. But other than that, I loved the rooms.  Bathroom floors are heated and so are the towels/robes which give it a nice touch. The staff go out of their way to help you.  

I had breakfast at the hotel which was nice, albeit portions are small.  

The common areas are dripping with flowers and decor that brings the extra luxury feel. ",5,2023,02,12
143,Afternoon tea was really lovely.,"My husband booked afternoon tea for my birthday. It was a really lovely experience from start to finish. The location is lovely with the magnificent chandelier above. The staff are very welcoming and efficient. It is a lovely balance of luxury but without being pretentious. Some comparable hotels offer this but you feel you are “number 54” that day. Here it is much more of a personal experience. The food and drinks were all delicious and in abundance. They couldn’t have been more accommodating. At the time of booking I requested provision for 1 vegetarian, no white bread and no egg sandwiches - a big ask / test. Not only did they phone a couple of days before to discuss dietary requirements but they absolutely delivered on the day. This is frankly pretty exceptional attention to detail and customer service. Even if the kitchen staff had cursed my request there was absolutely no sign of it and you felt that nothing was too much trouble. In common with many others we couldn’t eat it all and brought some away in a perfectly packed little box. Absolutely everything we had was absolutely delicious. The only minuscule point to mention is that because the lemon drizzle is cut in advance and in a very warm room it had dried out a bit but everything else was so exceptional it more than made up for it. I would highly recommend a visit for afternoon tea. Finally I should also mention the very accommodating pianist who played beautifully throughout including a birthday request from myself. Thank you Corinthia team for a lovely birthday afternoon.",5,2023,02,10
143,Beautiful hotel with kind and attentive staff,"The hotel made me feel very welcome from beginning to end, very kind and attentive. It really was an experience being there, left me feeling very satisfied and well looked after and happy. The spa is an amazing feature to have, especially after a business event.",5,2023,02,10
143,"Hotel with a WOW factor, made extra special by the staff","The most amazing birthday treat from my husband for my 40th birthday. What a hotel. The location, the facilities but most importantly the staff we all amazing. 

From the moment we stepped into the hotel we could not have asked for any more. 

The staff were warm, welcoming and helpful. The hotel was spotlessly clean and the facilities in the room were amazing. Everything had been thought about. 

I have never known a hotel room in London be so quiet.  The underfloor heating int he bathroom was delightful

We dined one evening in Kerridge's which was delicious. 

The breakfast choice was phenomenal and amazingly tasty. 

The spa was an oasis of calm. 

I would love to come back, but its a luxury for very special occasions so will have to wait a while before we return",5,2023,02,06
143,You must visit…foodies will enjoy this place,"First visit and hopefully not the last. It’s motivated me to do more work to save up for another trip!
Lovely warm staff who collect your luggage on arrival and departure.
Superb food - breakfast and bar drinks - up to the perfect standard you expect for a 5 star hotel.
Visited Velvet bar and the Northall.
Room service perfect and no issues at all. 
Walking in corridor to room was lovely and smells amazing.
Warm staff who make you feel valued. 
Felt rested at the end of the trip. 
Stayed at another 5* hotel several times in London this year and overall this feels the most comfortable/value for money.  
Overall worth it and only 3 mins walk to the tube station so happy days.",5,2023,01,29
143,London Corinthia best in Class,Charming and elegant with a service quality top. The Spa is a treasure in the centre of London with its fantastic marbles on the wall. Ideally located corinthia is a best in class hotel expressing warmth and professionalism.,5,2023,01,28
143,A way to energetic capacity in order to think and perform,"A rare experience can be ever experienced with a special girl such as   the therapist Ana K in 90 minutes running treatment,   after that treatment literally I felt 10 years younger. This is a recommendation which shouldn’t be missed by any chance . Her attention to details are precise in making you to relax to a point where you ask yourself when this time goes so quickly and obviously her gentle hands plays a major part in not just realizing her presence  but almost a silent moment in recalling your inner energy from within a climb to heightened your level in advance .Naturally I  present this application  as part of expressing my gratitude towards her smooth response …",5,2023,01,27
143,Afternoon tea,"We wanted to visit this hotel when we fell in love with Thomas Kochs on the TV series.  Wow it was worth it.  Booked in for afternoon tea and had those fabulous striped China crockery.  But let's get down to the food. Scoffed the sarnies before we remembered to take a photo.  Absolutely amazing.  What is even more amazing is the amount of sarnies you can have is limitless.  Cucumber and pickle, coronation chicken, egg, smoked salmon and ham all served on exquisite breads.  Warm scones on a box follow and then you are presented with a dessert tray where you don't get to choose one cake, but get all six!  What you can't eat you take away with you in cute corinthia boxes.  This was all washed down with limitless tea and a fabulous flute of champagne.  Thomas we love you!  Only disappointment was we didn't get to meet the man himself!  😕",5,2023,01,24
143,What an Experience,"I was fortunate enough to stay with Corinthia’s recently. Thank you Tore for the personalised arrival and departure experience. The room was spacious, nearly facing the Thames and all the amenities fantastic. We spent couple of hours in the Spa which was a very relaxing experience. After spending the day out, returning to The Corinthia is like returning to a lovely home. That is the definition of true luxury.
I look forward to a chance to stay longer and enjoy the property more! Yes, the staff anticipate every need. A truly royal experience!
",5,2023,01,24
143,Gorgeous experience,"All I can say is such a beautiful experience here at this hotel. From private dining in the Northall room - which was amazing from the food to the service, could not fault. I had the buffet breakfast option the following morning and I loved the option of healthy breakfasts such as granola, juices and fresh fruits.",5,2023,01,23
143,A shining light in dark times,"OK. So many of us have been all over the world and stayed in hotels of all types, from 3 -6 stars. What I have found is that the real test of a great hotel is when things go wrong. With that, here is my review of NYE at the Corinthia:  The hotel is wonderful. As good as the best in London. Beautiful and quiet Garden Suite, fanastic food and drinks, and staff as good you get. So what went wrong? My wife got COVID (probably from the plane trip over) and I got the flu. Everyone at the hotel was so helpful. At a difficult time for us, we felt like our family was there to help. Thank you Corinthia, especially the wonderul concierge desk, and Daniele Quattromini, Director of Food and Beverage. A+
Amanda and Glenn",5,2023,01,23
143,Perfection! Best hotel stay in years and i stay in hotels weekly!!,One of the best hotels I've ever stayed in. The hotel is of course stunning and the Suite had everything we could want and more. I was in London for my book launch and the hotel suprised me with champagne and a cake to say congratulations!   The customer service was amazing from start to finish.  Honestly i couldnt think of anything that was negative and i stay in hotels on a weekly basis. Perfection ,5,2023,01,22
143,A Fantastic Birthday Treat,"I had a surprise birthday treat at the Winter Garden Corinthian Hotel yesterday afternoon. Our table was booked for 3.30pm. 
We had such a wonderful time and we were made to feel very special by Sebastian and his team.  We had the lovely specially commissioned rugs for our knees and the heaters were great.
The food and service were excellent and I highly recommend this for a special, memorable occasion. 

The only slight issue we had was the table next to us were conducting a loud business meeting !!   After our starter course we asked to be moved to another table, which the team did  very quickly and efficiently. 

Thank you Sebastian you and your team were outstanding and made us feel a part of your family. 

We will definitely return.",5,2023,01,16
143,My absolute favourite!,"Amazing again! This is my absolute favourite hotel. Everything about it is fabulous! We stayed just before Christmas and the deco was beautiful and very festive. 
We ate dinner in Kerridges which was lovely. We had breakfast in the Northall which was great and we had drinks in the new Velvet bar. There was live music playing and the cocktails were lovely. The bar wasn’t open last time we stayed…..it has been decorated to a high standard. 
The staff were great as always. We arrived early and our room was ready for us. 
We will definitely be back. It is an expensive hotel but it’s worth saving up and treating yourself.",5,2023,01,14
143,The always classy Corinthia London,"Another fantastic visit to this awesome hotel. From the moment you step foot on the steps outside, you are made to feel welcome and it’s almost a requirement that you leave reality behind you, when you walk through their doors. 

The hotel is as splendid as always, with super friendly and helpful  staff. Check in is quick and easy, you’re shown to your room and then left to your own devices. 
As you’d expect, the hotel is spotless, the rooms are a good size and once that door closes, so so quiet. 

We were meeting friends away from the hotel so we didn’t eat there this time, but we had drinks in the Velvet bar when we got back, with live music, ambience and a huge range of drinks. Again, everyone here was friendly and helpful. 

Breakfast was spot on and then we had a spa day booked downstairs. Their spa really is out of this world, with steam rooms and pools. We had a private spa room booked for the afternoon with lunch and treatments which really have to be experienced to be believed.  

Then, reluctantly, it was time to leave. 

As always, thank you for a much needed break from reality and we will be back. G and C",5,2023,01,06
143,Over priced and terrible breakfast,"PLUS POINTS
- hight quality furnished rooms youd expect from a 5star hotel
- staff are polite and well trained again as youd expect
- great that Tom Kerridge is attached with easy access
- great location for river  bank

NEG POINTS
- dire breakfast - poorly cooked GREASY English breakfast and lucky it was included otherwise i would have refused to pay
- breakfast buffet split across 3 rooms one of which is the kitchen service area full of staff! Weird!
- kids pool hours limited to 1 hour with limited space. Us adults can use it anytime so should be a min 2 hour slot I say
- jacuzzi was only 30 or so degrees so basically a bubbly pool
- drinks extremely expensive
- rooms over priced for a family stay based on the above",3,2023,01,04
143,Simply the best!,This is without doubt the best hotel in London. Every single staff member is lovely they can't do enough for you. 6th time I've been back with my daughter for a lovely relaxing night and spa. The flowers and decor is amazing - now it's Christmas and fabulous,5,2023,01,04
143,Fabulous lunch in the Winter Garden,"Having watched the tv programme showing how the hotel had been dressed for the festive period we wanted to experience it first hand. We weren’t disappointed. It was exquisitely decorated and the staff were charming. Although technically outside we were kept plenty warm enough with the heating and sheepskin backing to the seats. It was good to see a menu that didn’t overwhelm you with choices and all our courses were beautifully presented and tasted divine. The pace was perfect and our waiter( seems the wrong word when he was so much more!) was attentive and good humoured. It was the perfect way for us to end a long weekend in London.
A suggestion though. With metal legged chairs on tiled floors any movement meant noisy screeching so rubber stoppers on the ends might help.",5,2023,01,02
143,Exquisite Service & Pure Class,"What a wonderful place to stay over the festive period. Every member of staff we encountered was fantastic: from the ease of handing over our car and luggage to the valet attendants, to the friendly check-in, to the luxury service of the in-room dining, everything was carried out to perfection with due care and attention. The food we had for dinner as well as breakfast was delicious and well worth the cost. The only things we could think of that weren't perfect was the fact that the bathroom television was frozen, and that hot water came out of the cold tap. But these small things did not take away from the overall grand experience. We especially appreciated the little extras in our room when we arrived, alongside the lindor chocolates that came up with dinner. A luxurious experience that really made Christmas for us.",5,2023,01,01

143,Amazing,"I was treated to a festive afternoon tea, and what a treat it was! From the moment we walked through the doors to the most beautiful Christmas decor I have ever seen, we were treated like royalty. Attentive, friendly and knowledgeable staff.  Absolutely delicious variety of finger sandwiches. Scones and homemade jam with clotted cream and an exquisite selection of pastries.   Not forgetting a glass of champagne to.  We were so full we had to bring some home. Packaged up so nicely for us and also give a complimentary treat of some chocolate almonds.  Highly recommend for a special occasion.",5,2022,12,30
143,Festive Afternoon Tea,"We had booked a family Festive Afternoon Tea at this beautiful Hotel many months ago. We were delighted to see the Christmas Programme on the TV a few days before our visit so we’re excited to experience the wonderful Christmas decor in person. The beautiful golden tree in the foyer didn’t disappoint nor did the perfect lighting of Joy on the outside of this iconic building. The Joy theme carried through to the exquisite cakes and chocolate almonds served during our afternoon tea. 
We have enjoyed afternoon tea in most of London’s best Hotels but it was the exemplary service of the staff which made this probably the best. Our server was so courteous and nothing was too much trouble. I was only sorry I didn’t catch her name. A huge choice of teas, plenty of top ups and of course perfect sandwiches (amazing combinations) glorious scones with jams and cream and of course the perfect cakes. What we couldn’t manage were boxed up for us to take home. 
The superb pianist was fantastic and even asked if we wanted to request a song. He was so very lovely to us. We were not rushed in any way and the space between tables was spot on. In many other Hotels we have felt incredibly squashed with other customers. This was most definitely not the case here. 
My only disappointment was not seeing the General Manager Thomas as I would have loved to tell him in person what an incredibly magical Hotel he has and how brilliant all the staff are! Thank you all for the best Afternoon Tea! Happy Christmas 🎅🏻",5,2022,12,24
143,Outstanding.,"The Corinthia is now my favourite hotel in London. The staff are great, especially in the newly opened Velvet cocktail lounge (our first visit so not sure if this replaced something similar). The room decor is elegant but contemporary, and all very high quality. Temperature control is good in the rooms, and not stifling hot like some hotels, similarly in the beautiful public areas.
All food offerings that we had were first rate. The hotel location is excellent for pretty much everything in central London that you might want to visit during a leisure trip.
Big positives for me were it is not on the tourist trail so everyone in there is either a resident, or non-resident using the bars / restaurants and not just grabbing a photo for Instagram; and the Christmas decorations are traditional and elegant, unlike some of the faddish nonsense that has appeared at Claridges & the Savoy in recent years. Please never succumb to this.
Already looking forward to returning.",5,2022,12,22
143,One of the best 5* hotels in London!,"I have stayed in some of London’s best 5-star hotels, and can safety say that this one goes straight to the top two! 

The concierge were friendly and helpful upon arrival, and our car was taken to be valet parked straight away. 

We had an excellent room service lunch, with delicious salads and fresh bread which were exceptional. It was lovely to see a complementary bottle of Laurent Perrier waiting in the room to revitalise us after a rather gruelling journey down to London. 

That evening we had a table booked at The Northall restaurant. We went down early to have cocktails in The Northall bar but it was full so instead went to The Corinthia’s other bar: Velvet. 

The atmosphere in the Velvet was lively, and the bar staff extremely knowledgeable and friendly. We had some lovely cocktails there, my personal favourite - Champagne Charlie. The live jazz music performed in Velvet was the perfect addition to the bar.  

Breakfast in The Northall both mornings was excellent (although on the second morning, due to space in the main restaurant, we were seated in The Northall bar which was slightly disappointing). However, the buffet was delicious, as were the cooked options that we opted for. 

Overall, a fantastic hotel. I would certainly stay again.",5,2022,12,18
143,Perfect place to stay in London,"Perfect place for a London stay. 
The location is great - at the heart of London- and the hotel is truly at top standards. Lobby, rooms are wide and nicely arranged - all the more with Xmas decorations. Highly professional and smiling staff. I’ll come back.",5,2022,12,08
143,A fantastic family Christmas weekend.,"What a fabulous weekend in London enjoy the beautiful hotel, service and the immediate surroundings. Thomas and his team run a first class operation. The spa and pool was fabulous and nice that for a certain period of the day families are made to feel welcome there. We didn't venture too from the hotel with the river, Somerset House, Covent Garden all on your doorstep. We walked to everything. Fantastic team and fantastic hotel.",5,2022,12,05
143,The Standard Was Even Higher,"We had visited the Corinthia several times before and had always been very impressed with the standard of food, service and the attention to detail by the manager Taylor and his team.
A visit for a ‘Festive’ afternoon tea was a new experience. The one thing we had not thought about was how the levels would be raised.
The table decorations, sandwiches with a Christmas theme and the cakes were all to the usual high standard. Add to that the impeccable service provided by Bella made our afternoon tea so special. All staff are passionate and always willing to engage with guests.
After afternoon tea a visit to The Northall cocktail lounge where again all staff were welcoming. The cocktails prepared by Andrea were superb.
Having met the hotel managers previously it is clear that the high standards of this hotel start at the top. We look forward to more visits to The Corinthia in 2023.

Everyone at Corinthia is so kind, courteous and nice it almost feels like they are able to read your thoughts and come up with a solution before you even about to ask <3 We had a splendid memorable tea time at Crystal Lounge, a beautiful River Suite facing the Thamse, excellent Dinner at Kerridge's Bar and Grill with the best Fish and Chips ever had and a way to short booking to discover all the other spots and gems of the hotel! So many reasons to come back soon again! And we will for sure! Corinthia got a place in our hearts!",5,2022,11,29
143,The Best,"Don't look anywhere else as you won't find a better property anyplace.  The hotel is beautiful and the staff is even better.

Can't get any better.",5,2022,11,28
143,poor standard of food ,"Sadly, the food wasn't up to scratch. Very poor standard indeed.  We will not be returning ! The whole three course lunch was extremely poor. Extremely poor portions and poor presentation.  We had lamb, there was more bone than actual meat. ",2,2022,11,28
143,Absolutely perfect.,"There are a few really amazing hotels in London, but this one is truly outstanding, and it's biggest asset, the wonderful staff who to a man / woman delivered a perfect stay for us.

Thank you all for making our stay so wonderful!!",5,2022,11,28

We have been blessed to travel the world while staying in the leading hotels of the world, including icons such as the Burj Al Arab in Dubai. 

We truly can say that you are our favorite hotel if it comes to atmosphere, quality of service and kindness of the entire team. 

My wife and I are already looking forward to our next visit to London that will allow us once again to enjoy our stay to the max.

Thanks again and be well!",5,2022,11,24
143,Celebration stay,Thank you so much for making our stay so special. The staff were all amazing and nothing was too much trouble. From the moment we stepped in to the moment we left everything was perfect. Thanks so much for the celebratory drinks and patisseries - a super surprise. We dined in Kerridges and that too was truly worth it. Finishing our stay in London with you and your welcoming staff was fantastic. Thank you again,5,2022,11,15
143,AN ABSOLUTE GEM ,"This is our second stay at the Corinthia and again everything was amazing.
We checked in early and we were given an upgrade as well as breakfast pastries and fresh orange juice in the room prior to our morning meeting. How very thoughtful!
We found all the staff very helpful and extremely friendly. This place is an absolute gem. Trips to London can be very stressful but a stay at the Corinthia makes everything very calming. We look forward to returning again very soon.",5,2022,11,14
143,Great luxury hotel at prime location,"Since many years Corinthia Hotel in London is my favourite hotel in London, as it is very well located. I always try to stay in the same room, as it is  a spacious and quiet room.  The bathroom has a seperate shower and bath. I like the interior design, very stylish. It is a place where one van relax. The swimming pool is also a great space to relax. Unfortuntaly the gym was being renovated at that moment, so I wasn't able to use it. Breakfast is excellent. 

The staff at Corinthia is friendly and helpful. 

As I was going to Ascot, Corinthia suggested the taxi company Adison Lee to drive me to Ascot. I ordered the taxi two weeks beforehand. But on the day, the taxi did not show up and left me waiting at Corinthia for about an hour, before I called an Uber. I would recommend Corinthia not referring to Adison Lee any longer, as they never apologised. 

When booking at Corinthia, be aware that since the end of 2019, the hotel ads a discretionary accommodation service charge, raising 5% charge on the room rate. I was not aware of this, so it was a little surprise for me.",4,2022,11,09
143,Top class hotel,"A clean, crisp and modern hotel located very near Trafalgar Square.

We were only staying for one night but the welcome, room (upgraded which always helps) and venue were excellent.

The bar did close a little early for a  central London hotel and was a little loud for us after a night out but overal we had a great stay.

143,Lovely hotel with great people !,"Just got back from a couple of days visit at the Corinthia London. Hotel is stunning with exquisite decor.  The room is of a good size with an impressive bathroom. Housekeeping has to be commended for the hotel being spotless.  Had a lovely afternoon tea at The Crystal Moon Lounge - thank you Mr Cas. Room service - what can I say, the service is exceptional. The breakfast in Northall was delicious and my young person enjoyed it immensely.

The hotel's ESPA spa is something not to be missed.  If you are looking for relaxation away from a busy life, look no further.

Where the hotel is one of the best hotels in London, I can say that the biggest asset of Corinthia is his people. Having a special needs young person, our travels does not always go smoothly.  However, the staff of Corinthia has gone over and beyond to make my young man comfortable and have a lovely time. From the doorman to reception to all the F&B people, Corinthia indeed has a wonderful team.

For this, I could not thank you enough.",5,2022,11,02
143,Exceptional afternoon tea,"My wife and I have been to many an afternoon tea. But the Corinthia is on another level. 

For starters, we had sandwiches which were absolutely delicious. They managed to cater for my dietary requirements without fuss. They managed to make up some delicious combinations. 

Then came the scones which were presented in a box, the scones were warm and so fresh. The jams provided were the best I’ve ever had. A rhubarb and ginger combination was the winner for me. 

Then came the cake trolley which was stunning and looked like the best patisserie shop window you’ve ever seen. Each cake was exquisitely described with such passion. These delicate cakes were again some off the best cakes I’ve had. They explained you could take them away if you couldn’t finish them. They weren’t joking and we took the box home. 

The staff were all excellent, providing exceptional service. They just glide around, non intrusive, but always there to clear away, pour more tea or fold your napkin. 

They also presented my Wife with a special cake for her birthday. This made her feel very special, nicely done and nicely understated. 

I can’t recommend the Corinthia enough, and will definitely be returning in the future. If you want the best afternoon tea, look no further.",5,2022,11,01
143,Great hotel!,"Very pleasant, helpful and professional staff. The room was top with great cleaning and high quality feeling on everything. The restaurant and breakfast was among the best i have seen. I recommend Corinthia if you are looking for a hotel among the best there is",5,2022,10,28

143,Exceptional on all fronts,"I was in London for business and had booked a 2-night stay at the Corinthia: my first time here. Everything from the service to the rooms (quality + cleanliness) was amazing. And really, I stay in +50 hotel nights per year on business and this was by far amongst the nicest, and full of small but thoughtful detail (e.g. the lights turn off slowly at night so you're not completely in the dark the moment you flip the switch). I was in this regard exceedingly excited to stay the full of my journey - but had to unexpectedly fly back a day earlier on account of my child falling ill. The front desk staff (Heike) helped me to check-out early without incident, and beyond that showed incredible care for my situation (which was indeed stressful!). To then have her follow-up and moreover her colleague Cassia do the same a few days later was really nothing short of remarkable. I'm coming back 100%, and this time for as long as I can!",5,2022,10,23
143,A wonderful afternoon tea experience,"Afternoon tea - what a treat! Elegant airy surroundings and exemplary service, never stuffy, always kind and empathetic. We really felt as if every member of the team genuinely wanted us to have a lovely time. Delicious, dainty sandwiches,  freshly baked warm scones and exquisite cakes. Special little treats for the two birthday girls in our party
The lobby pianist (Kevin, I think) absolutely made the experience for us, asking what we’d like to hear and playing everything for us.
As a floristry geek, I loved the lavish seasonal floral displays and the ability to see the floristry team at work in the open studio area.
I’d highly recommend The Corinthia for anyone considering booking a special afternoon tea in London.",5,2022,10,15
143,Amazing relaxing experience,"The staff were actual professionals, accommodating polite attending your every need with care. The facilities were exquisite, spacious, clean and the ambience was in total relaxing and the feeling was that you got the chance to escape from the outside busy and overcrowded world . The hydromassage options available could support any kind of taste and the sauna with view over the pools made it a trilling experience. The changing rooms were secure and organised with some dry fruits and nuts options along with tea to provide a full relaxing experience. I highly recommend it.",5,2022,10,11
143,Perfect location for sightseeing and wonderful service.,I stayed at the Corinthia Hotel for 8 nights to see the sights of London.  It was recommended to me by a friend.  It is in a perfect location.  Across the street from the Embankment tube station and the bridge which takes you over the Thames to the London Eye.  10minutes away from the Churchill War Rooms and  Covent Gardens.  Walking distance to Boroughs Market and a lot of other places.  My daily breakfast was very good.  Food and service at the 2 Restaurants for dinner were wonderful.  My executive room was larger than I expected and had a good size bathroom with separate tub.  A table in the room allowed me to work at night with 110  electrical outlet. I peaked into their gym and it was enormous!  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in London at the Corinthia.,5,2022,10,11
143,The best weekend of our lives!,"We celebrated our Wedding in an intimate setting with closest family and it was a real dream come true - the Ceremony Room was so romantic, the rooms we stayed in were just incredible, the dinner was absolutely delicious and the spa stunning… and the attention to detail, the helpfulness and friendliness of the whole Corinthia Team made our Wedding weekend the best experience of our lives! We cannot wait to return again, the Corinthia Hotel holds a special place for us. Thank you!!!",5,2022,10,09
143,Absolutely the best ever experience!,"We had a small family wedding planned in the Corinthia Hotel. What can I say,... it was absolutely perfect day and not only because it is a such a beautiful Hotel, but because of the people working there. We received so much love and care, the attention to details was just incredible, very professional service and always super friendly. The food in The Northall restaurant was delicious, the rooms were breathtaking and the spa very relaxing. I can't wait to go back the one day. Thank you so much!",5,2022,10,03
143,Elegance & Finesse ohhh yessss,"Finally a hotel that knows how to do it right!

This is a late review. I stayed here with my partner on 9th July 2022 - it was booked as he won an award through work with OWL financial.
I couldnt fault this place. The attentiveness of staff, The breakfast was amazing. I asked for my dinner to be made diary free with no issues. The spa was amazing but the show stopper was the treatments. I would travel monthly to receive these treatments. I have had many massages over the years and this one sets the bar so high I doubt it can be topped. 
We stayed in probably one of the cheapest rooms they had and I was blown away the bathroom - I could have screamed it was STUNNING
I am very very happy and would 100% stay again if ever I am in London. On the sunday the area was blocked off but staff moved heaven and earth to get us a taxi - we felt very special!
Thank you, Corinthia, for such a wonderful experience.",5,2022,10,03

The rooms are so spacious and comfortable as well ad homely. Had some great food in the room as well. Definitely would like to bring my amazing wifey here!!,4,2022,09,09
143,Amazing Return,"It's been a few years since I stayed at the Corinthea, and since then I've stayed at a few other hotels in London (Lanesborough, Langham), but Corinthea will always be my favorite. Especially as I was able to bring my family this time.

Staying with the family brought a different perspective. The location is a massive advantage. It's a 5 min walk to Trafalgar, St James Park and a few more to the London Eye. 

My daughter loved the stuffed animal they left for her on her comfortable cot, and is now insisting on a TV for the bath like the hotel. We stayed in an Executive room, which was more than spacious enough to accommodate the 3 of us. Not many hotel rooms have a vestibule and a walk in closet. 

The afternoon tea at the hotel was also a great experience. The cost may appear high, but it's on par with other high end establishments, and given the quality of the experience it is more than worth it. It was 65 GBP for adults and half for kids. For my child they gave her hot chocolate, ham & cheese sandwiches, plus the scones and deserts they provide. 

Finally, we spent time relaxing in the spa. They have ""family swim"" twice a day when kids are welcome to use the pool. Only adults are permitted to use the other facilities - and they are wonderful.

I couldn't recommend this place enough and look forward to the next visit.",5,2022,09,07
143,Finest Hotel in London,"I have had the pleasure of staying at many of the five star properties in London but the Corinthia London is at a totally different level. My wife and I came to celebrate her birthday in London last week.
The rooms are spacious and beautiful, the staff is friendly and efficient and the common areas, restaurants and bars are spectacular.
I would never consider staying at another London hotel after our 3 day stay at the Corinthia. Although not inexpensive by any means, it is worth every penny",5,2022,09,05
143,Exceptional!,"My favourite hotel in London, service is impeccable and such lovely members of staff help contribute to the whole experience. I would only stay here. Looking forward to going back soon. It was my partners birthday and we had free champagne in our room with a hand written note. Such a nice touch, things like that the make this hotel stand out. Nothing is too much trouble.",5,2022,09,04
143,WONDERFUL STUFF,"Perfect, I can’t speak highly enough of this place. The staff are exceptional, nothing is to much and they care about the hotel and it’s reputation with such passion. 

The food is wonderful, the rooms incredible, the ambiance is a whole next level to anything I’ve experienced before. 

It’s unusual to find a place and people that make you feel like a million bucks, the Corinthia is undoubtedly just that, ten stars from ten stars, a hundred from a hundred, it’s just faultless.",5,2022,09,02
143,Do you want to wake up furious in the morning from the sound of a fire siren?,"The terrible sound of a siren woke us up in the morning after a difficult flight and a night check-in at the hotel. We took a suite to sleep and rest properly. Instead, at 10 am, a very loud siren sound spread throughout the hotel, as it turned out, this is a fire alarm that they work out every week! How is it possible to turn on the signalization in the morning in such a luxury hotel! We came from a different time zone, people just relax, you can do it at lunchtime or later! We stay permanently in top 10 worldwide hotels, but it is the first time we encountered such nonsense!",2,2022,08,31

143,Best hotel in London - hands down,"Outstanding weekend from start to finish to celebrate my wife’s 50th birthday… the warm, personal welcome from the staff, the attention to detail, the stunning rooms, and a lovely, lively meal at the Garden on Sunday night were all just perfect…

Clearly, it’s not cheap, but it is genuinely a case of you get what you pay for, and I don’t believe there’s a better hotel in London…",5,2022,08,25
143,A good hotel - value for money?,"We stayed here for two nights for a special occasion. Having mentioned in a separate review that we thought The Langham had gone downhill and that we wanted to try the Corinthia, we were excited to visit. The entrance to the hotel is very welcoming and relaxing. The receptionist was efficient and courteous and informed us that, whilst our room wasn't ready, she would text me as soon as it was. Check-in time passed by and I didn't receive a text. Although this was not too much of an issue as we were sitting in The Northall enjoying some champagne and food, I do have perhaps unreasonably high expectations at this price point and, for me, attention to detail is absolutely everything. 

Once in our room, we were impressed by the size of it and of the bathroom. The champagne was a nice touch. The bathroom is well stocked with amenities (Langham, take note: it's not acceptable to have to call Reception to request amenities which should be included in the room as standard). The bed was comfortable. There was a broken blind in the bathroom which, whilst not a major issue, was nevertheless noticeable. 

We dined in Kerridge's and I have already provided feedback to the hotel about our experience and have been contacted by a deputy manager. The restaurant simply is not value for money. We dine in many fantastic restaurants, including Restaurant Gordon Ramsay where a meal with drinks costs over £200pp, but this is such a let down and, frankly, is pretty embarrassing for the hotel. We have dined at Kerridge's three times now. I'm no longer accepting Covid and lockdowns as an excuse for poor value for money. The food wasn't that great and the portion sizes were insulting at the price which was charged. The only saving grace was the waiter who was extremely apologetic and gave us a discount on our bill. We still tipped him because what came out of the kitchen wasn't his fault. 

Anyway! Breakfast was good on the first day. Very prompt service and nicely cooked eggs. The coffee was delicious. On the second day we waited for over half an hour for our food to arrive which was simply too long. The restaurant that serves breakfast could offer more gluten free options such as pastries. Had we paid for the buffet option, this would have been a complete waste of money as I can only eat fruit, gluten free toast and some eggs. I don't eat dairy. Other hotels are able to offer comprehensive gluten free options, so it should be possible for the Corinthia to do so as well, especially in this day and age. 

The room was cleaned, turn down service was carried out, and room service was efficient. No issues in this respect at all.

We enjoyed the spa as well (I have reviewed this previously). 

All in all, it was a pleasant stay. This is an expensive hotel, but was it value for money? On balance, and when compared to The Langham, you do get more here for your money: a better room, a better stocked bathroom, a nice spa, a generally nice environment, albeit a less good location. Would I return? Maybe. Though, for me, the experience of our visit failed to ignite in me a strong sense of brand loyalty to the hotel which I've often experienced when I've visited other hotels at which I've become a regular visitor - so maybe, without me realising, there was something missing that I am yet to put my finger on.",4,2022,08,25
143,"Superb relaxing afternoon tea in a lovely setting, highly recommended","Booked this for our wedding anniversary.  A warm welcome from the moment we arrived and were offered a choice of tables from which we could hear the pianist in the background. Fantastic interaction and personal attention throughout from the staff, great home prepared food starting with lovely sandwiches, moving on to freshly made scones and then cake. A couple of little extras knowing it was a special occasion for us. Completely relaxed at all times, with no attempt to rush us.  Very handy for Embankment Pier and Underground, as well as Whitehall Gardens. Would recommend most highly.",5,2022,08,22

143,Surprising issues for a 5* of this line.,"Two nights executive room stay. Our companion (who arrived an hour ahead of us) was charged full amount upon arrival despite having been reassured on the phone that, one, full amount is taken upon exit, and two, we were informed he could check in while I (lead booker) would pay upon my arrival. 

Breakfast was served with wrong drinks, and one wrong plate; third had to wait while other two tucked in. Second day was good, quality of food good though rather lacking compared to Claridges, Ritz and others in zone one radius, despite being of a price. (They actually charge Mayfair rates here on the very edge of the eastern side of the river.)

Two hours before checkout we were woken by a chambermaid who asked if we were checked out. Apologies and she left; a second, and then third chambermaid did the same within thirty minutes. A porter in a suit did the same in the next hour, with still fifty minutes to go before our checkout. Offered profuse apologies for doing so, and then apologised for the miscommunication and the chambermaid apocalypse while ducking away, only for a fifth and final sending to come and interrupt our rest after a difficult night. 

Upon detailing this to reception on checkout, nothing offered in apology or suggestion that the service would not persist to be as poor going forwards (we are perhaps too polite, I've worked in service role as a teen, so never give them a hard time, but one might need to, to have a point made). We will not be returning. D.DREW.",2,2022,08,17
143,Wonderful place to stay!,"We had the family room and an adjoining king, the rooms were spacious and well appointed.  Wonderful bathrooms and cool courtyard view.  Every staff member at the hotel was courteous and helpful.  Gym was large and had all equipment, and drinks and snacks.  Did not visit the spa.  
Afternoon tea was terrific.  Room service was quick and good.  Many restaurant choices.  Location was amazing, right by the river, walking distance to tons of restaurants, shops and sites.  Would recommend this hotel and look forward to staying here again!",5,2022,08,05
143,Condescending,"Condescending,front of house
Staff. 

You rate yourself as one of the best hotels in the world. 

Looking through, trip advisor reviews. 

Front of house needs some adjustments. 

Special trip to London. 

Having come up from Dorset. 

Hot day, booked into the playhouse for cabaret. 

So,having forgot tooth brush. 

Having drink at Tom kerridge. 

Asked very nicely if any chance.
I could have a toothbrush. 

Answer,no way. Only resident guest. 

Ok fair enough. 

However,kerridge, bar staff, made it happen. 

I went to ladies,to put my heels on & 1920s kit. 

Having cooled off. 
I would of loved to have a Botox under the beautiful chandelier. 

As I was on my own. 

I asked one of the front of house people please could you take a photo. Answer, are you one of Tiffany party. Ironically, because I was dressed up looking like Audrey Hepburn,no. We can not take photo. 

Return to kerridge bar & grill. 

Emanuel,said. I’ll take you out for a photo. 

I was very reluctant, as I was told under no circumstance, any photo could be taken till after 3pm. 

On arrival back under
Chandelier 3 front of staff appeared, to stop photo, which in no way included any one from Tiffany party. 

Really, how poorly was this situation handled. 

Im sure Tiffany, paid a fortune for after noon tea. 

Corinthia , sort yourself out. 

I have been travelling for 40 years.   

Staying, all over the world.  

Seba & Emanuel. 

Saved the day. 

They where empathetic 
& found solutions, to small problems. 

Please recognise there services.

143,Matt Smith is THE GUY,"This was a surprise booking for a very special occasion in March. The Corinthia was my dream hotel to visit but unfortunately, there were a few experiences here and there which almost ruined my visit.

The first night, we ate at the bar. I was determined to try the burger but what was served was careless and extremely dry. The bill was also extortionate and £13 was added  for no reason. Considering this, my overall experience at the bar was not great. The bar staff were miserable on the whole and it felt like they wanted us to think that it was a privilege to even be served. 

We were also sat near a famous pair actors who I once admired very much for their SUPPORTING ROLES in some of my favourite films. They were in London promoting a new show and they were both incredibly rude. Who would’ve thought? Not the hotel’s fault of course, just thought I’d note this here.

On the other hand, I did get the chance to meet one of my heroes, Matt Smith. He was class act. Thank you Matt Smith. 

Anyway, back to the hotel. There were a few aspects to the room which were in need of renovation such as the carpet and the sideboards which were marked in a number of places. 

One of my biggest disappointments with the hotel, however, had to be the inconstancy of the porters. Even in decent hotels which are nowhere near as well regarded as the Corinthia, you expect porters to always be ready to open the front doors for you as you arrive and leave. It’s a small thing but it’s nice. Surprisingly, this was not the case for most of our stay at the Corinthia. This is the main reason why I mostly felt unwelcome at the hotel. Very disappointing. 

I also had a particularly bad experience with one porter when I was speaking to some autograph hunters outside the hotel. I was curious why they were waiting outside and so I started a conversation with them. When the doorman saw me speaking with them he said: “Is this an inside job or something?” He said this and laughed. I was very offended. 

Generally,  I also felt that the porters were more concerned with guests arriving in cars (particularly celebrities) than guests who were exiting through the front doors. A number of times, the porters would just be looking out the front windows on their walkie talkies and wouldn’t acknowledge you in the slightest when leaving through the doors. 

To end on a positive note, I have to say that the spa was outstanding. I don’t really ever visit the spa in any hotel but it really was an experience. 

I do hope to visit the Corinthia again someday soon but to say that the experience fell below my expectations would be an understatement.",3,2022,07,31
143,"Great staff, great spa facilities!","I spent a great time at Corinthia. I went for a massage treatment after hearing some friends  speaking very highly of the service. It actually exceed my already high expectations. The spa staff was amazing (big shout out to Carla, Vera and Cristina for their amazing professionalism and sympathy). 
Everything is so clean and the state-of-the-art facilities are unmatched.
Definitely a place to revisit!",5,2022,07,20
143,Not Worth The Money,"My son and I stayed at the Corinthia. We are on day 2 of our stay. We stayed at the Savoy for a few days before transferring to the Corinthia due to the Savoy being full. Although we are paying 3x what we paid at the Savoy, I much prefer the Savoy! At the Corinthia no one answers the front desk in a timely manner, my room service that I ordered the night before arrived 18 minutes after the scheduled time requested and only after I called to check on it and overall the staff are not nearly as attentive and accommodating as the Savoy. For $18,000 I expected SO MUCH MORE!",3,2022,07,15
143,Amazing,"Most wonderul experience. Great atmosphere and outstanding service.we are looking forward to visit again soon.
From you arrive to you leave all the staff do their best to make you feel welcome.

The afternoon tea deserves a special mention, along with the in-house florist.",5,2022,07,14
143,"Awful, amateur service throughout","Very disappointed with the service at Corinthia. The cleaning of rooms is not up to standard, they do the absolute minimum and do not clear away clearly finished tea mugs, plates, replace tea bags, replace water, etc. Had to be constantly reminded to do so. They also don’t provide a kettle unless you ask…what?

The full English breakfast was pretty average for the nearly £50 spent on it, and the coffee was not great either…

The check-out process was confused and stressful. It took us 40mins to get from room and into a taxi, despite giving a heads up at least 30mins before…it took them 25mins to bring down the luggage from the room, and despite asking well in advance they had not bothered to call a taxi. Seriously amateur concierge and porters. 

And the final gift was despite confirming 7 pieces of luggage were loaded in the taxi, we arrived at Euston to find only 6. Had to hurry back, and ended up missing our train. 

Service at Premier Inn is probably better.",2,2022,07,03
143,Perfect,This hotel makes you feel good about life! Has everything you need. So nice and accommodating. Beautiful elegant rooms. Just a pleasure. They make it very hard for you to leave. I honestly can’t wait to go back,5,2022,07,01
143,Will not stay anymore,"Came to hotel at PM4:30 after 14hours flight, and they said the room is not available yet. Said they are busy due to the fully booked of the rooms. Waited 1 hour, and they put me to the handicapped room where has no bathtub, and not really luxury. 
Did not receive the baggages for one hour even though they said they will bring to the room, so I had to go to reception to pick up by myself. When I complained, they said “too busy because the rooms are fully booked” again….. Is that mean, the service will be bad if the hotel is fully booked? Requested dry cleaning, house keeper did not know when they can return it… I will request my company not to recommend this hotel anymore!!",2,2022,07,01
143,Incredible service,"The team went above and beyond to meet my every need, even just for my one night stay! I honestly can’t fault anything, and I can’t wait for my next visit…! Everything was thought of, and the small touches made a big difference. Great location too.",5,2022,06,22
143,Excellent Stay,"Perfect stay as always at the fabulous Corinthia - Staff are all amazing, special mention to all the Reception Staff, Concierge Team, Hendrik, Thomas Reesink, Olivia, All the Breakfast Team in the Northall - especially Rufat who always looks after us so well, Alex (aka Tom Selleck!!), and of course the excellent Northall Bar Team (shout out to Kerridges and the Afternoon Tea Crew Too - fabulous) - We always enjoy our 2nd home sooooo much thanks to everyone  - can't wait to return again very soon",5,2022,06,20
143,One of London’s best Afternoon teas,"If you like British history and afternoon tea this is a must! 

the Egg Mayo sandwiches were the best we’ve ever had and the truffles were outstanding. The level of service was also exceptional even though we are aware everyone is struggling for staff during this difficult period. 

We will definitely be looking to visit again and look forward to more of the delicious Egg May sandwiches 

Taylor Fisher and the team at The Crystal Moon Lounge are fantastic!",5,2022,06,20
143,It was our first visit but we’ll definitely be returning.,"We were booked into the Northall restaurant for a pre-theatre meal. From being met and taken to our table to paying the bill, the entire experience was pleasurable.
The entire team were professional and polite, especially our waitress Rosie who was an absolute delight, nothing was too much trouble.
The food was of the highest quality, with innovative but not pretentious presentation.
I cannot recommend the Corinthia highly enough.",5,2022,06,19
143,EXCEPTIONAL AFTERNOON TEA ,"Visited for Afternoon Tea with friends,for an exceptional experience 

Simply the best Afternoon Tea by far with unrivalled exquisite service

Every detail is attended too,dietary requirements, champagne, choosing which Tea,nothing is too much trouble 

Fabulous surroundings and a divine ambience, just make Afternoon Tea such a special occasion 

The staff are engaging, friendly, helpful but never intrusive, also great at taking the odd few photo's!!

Having visited previously, everything is exactly the same, the highest standards are maintained 

After our tea,we then went and spent the evening in the Northall Bar, looked after by the Fabulous Fabrizzo, the perfect evening of drinks,musical entertainment and atmosphere 

A fantastic day at the equally fantastic Corinthia 
Thank you to everyone who works so hard to deliver the best care and attention to your guests 
Unrivalled 5* impeccable service. ",5,2022,06,11
143,Worst Luxury Stay Ever!  Terrible room cleaning and housekeeping!  BEWARE of hidden discretionary service fees on bill!,"My mom and I complained about how poor our room was being cleaned several times during our stay, especially bathroom. We asked to speak to manager of hotel several times and he/she never contacted us.  We were told by receptionist when we were checking out that housekeeping manager is very hard to get ahold of and that he usually does not like to get involved or respond to any complaints personally.  That we should have asked for hotel manager.  Well, we did ask for hotel manager and never got response.  We had to endure dirty linens, dirty bathroom and toilet, and dirty glasses every day we spent at Corinthia.  BEWARE when paying bill about Discretionary Service Fees, ranging from 45 to 60 pounds per day, that hotel charges randomly on bill, without your approval.",2,2022,06,07
143,Such a luxury stay in central London A***,"We splashed out and decided to stay at this magnificent hotel, the service and staff were exceptional.
We got our room upgraded which is always an added bonus, we were booked in to Kerridge's restaurant so made sense to stay here.
We unfortunately didn't get a chance to use the spa but this will have to wait till our next visit.
I would say if your think about staying here just press the button and get it booked you will not be disappointed.
We also had breakfast as part of our stay, on both days we were treated to such a good spread, there was so much choice and all was delicious
10/10",5,2022,06,07
143,Consistently Brilliant,"We have been going back to Corinthia since 2019 when we got married at Hotel. We visited the hotel at the end of May 2022 for a long weekend with my wife. Consistency in hospitality is hard to achieve . It is even harder given the current personnel shortages in this industry. Despite all of this we still receive the highest level of service on every visit post covid and our most recent visit was no different. Corinthia is a full service hotel with elegant rooms and  everything you could wish for in a hotel. We normally stay at the entry level room which are more like a suite.  The restaurants serve great food. The Spa is hands down the best in London and treatments are carried out by real professionals. But what makes the hotel special is the people who work there. From the GM down everyone is there to see to all your needs. For example, Tim Lang, the Lounge Manager was in charge of our wedding service in 2019. He makes a point to come and say hello to us on every visit and welcome us  back. One of the most amazing hospitality professionals I have ever met over the years. Nothing is trouble for Tim. I spend about 60-70 nights a year in 5 star hotels across the world (work and pleasure) and have stayed at many in London. Frankly, hard to remember most of them.  Corinthia London on the other hand is all about making life lasting memories and we will be going back for many years to come.",5,2022,06,02
143,Simply The Best,"Quite simply the best hotel we have stayed in. Great location, beautiful hotel, fabulous facilities, friendly & helpful staff.
Upgraded room was amazing and the spa is the best we've experienced. Lovely breakfasts too.",5,2022,05,27
143,Trip to London,"We had a great visit to London made perfect by all the team at the Corinitha. Location was central, Food was great and the rooms and service were unbelievable. I would absolutely recommend this hotel for anyone travelling to London who wants luxury",5,2022,05,23
143,The top of ultra luxury hotels. Amazing!!,"The Corinthia London is the top of ultra luxury hotels, and in all my travels I have never experienced such amazing service. The hotel is simply beautiful. Every step through the public areas (lobbies and restaurants) offer breathtaking views of modern furniture, fresh flowers,  stunning chandeliers, and modern decor. The service here is immaculate. Every employee greets you with a smile and a warm hello, and if you pause for a moment, even simply to admire the beautiful appointments in this hotel, a staff member will stop to offer assistance. I've never experienced such a well trained team of service professionals in my life. Honestly, this management team could offer a case study for providing luxury experiences. 

The room we had (garden terrace suite) was incredibly spacious, and well decorated with modern furniture and every creature comfort one could imagine. The room was the size of a small apartment, it made me wish I could stay here forever. 

The spa is absolutely over-the-top gorgeous, with so many things to do and simply incredible design appointments. I have never seen it's equal in all my travels. 

The hotel is located right in the heart of London in the Westminster area, allowing one to walk to a nearby tube station or to any of the local attractions in just minutes. The only problem with this is that you may never want to leave the hotel, because The Corinthia offers the best of everything in London, all in one place. 

In summary, I would not only recommend The Corinthia London, I should say it is an absolute requirement to stay here if one wishes to sample the very best in luxury hotel experiences. My only regret is that we did not book our stay for longer. The value for the money spent here makes this hotel one of the best things one can do to ensure a pleasurable stay in London. 

I could go on and on about this hotel, but simply put: The Corinthia London is the best of the best in luxurious hotels, they should be studied by hospitality management education programs as a case study in immaculate service and facilities management. Bravo to the Corinthia management team. You have really outdone yourselves.  Thank you for providing my wife and I with such an amazing luxury experience.

This hotel deserves every one of my 5 Stars, in fact I would give them 100 stars if I could.  We will be coming back and making sure we book more time here for our next visit. Simply amazing!",5,2022,05,22
143,A must stay kind of place,"Excellent accommodations, great service, super clean, exceptionally quiet, excellent food. Conveniently located. Helpful staff. Honestly, couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. If we return to London we'll definitely stay here.",5,2022,05,20
143,The perfect birthday celebration destination,When deciding on where to stay for my birthday in London it was an easy decision to return to Corinthia. The staff the service and the facilities are all world class and the reason I will keep coming back. A special thank you to Aicha who helped organise and make my stay so special and memorable.,5,2022,05,20
143,Exceptional,"From the moment you walk in to when you leave, this hotel, the staff and amenities exude quality and luxury.  The staff go above and beyond and all add to the wonderful service and feeling. You are genuinely taken care of and everyone is so friendly and accommodating. I can’t rate my experience highly enough. Thank you to all of the staff for an incredible stay.",5,2022,05,20
143,Prepare to be delighted,"When I step out of the taxi and am greeted by the doorman at the Corinthia, I feel like I am stepping into another world. We decided to stay for our wedding anniversary and we were delighted with a wonderful stay. The Corinthia is by far my favourite hotel in London. 

The service here is faultless. Every staff member is on their ‘A game’, whether it’s the desk, the door, the bar, guest relations… every person we interacted with helped contribute to a wonderful stay. A particular thank you to Jochem. 

We had a wonderful room. We have stayed in both an executive room and, this time, a junior suite. The room was beautiful and tranquil. I felt so relaxed. Because it was our anniversary, the hotel were able to help me organise a couple of additional touches in the room. The team made this very easy for me. 

The spa is the best hotel spa in London - pool, jacuzzi, sauna, steam and more. 
The cocktails at the bar are delicious, the afternoon tea is great… But the best thing for me is the seamless, delightful service which seems to be engrained in the DNA here. 

The worst part is when I have to leave and get back into the taxi to Victoria station. I feel like Cinderella leaving the ball as I get on the Southern train back home! 

Thank you all for making a wonderful, memorable weekend for us.",5,2022,05,17
143,Best service ever experienced,"I had the pleasure of attending the Corinthia London for a global business forum recently, which resulted in a stay that exceeded my expectations in every way.

From the staff welcome at check-in, the ongoing friendly, uber professional and efficient service ethic was maintained consistently throughout my stay.",5,2022,05,17
143,The best hotel in London! ....if not the UK!,"Having stayed here many times since 2020 I cannot express enough the extremely high level of service provided throughout my stays. From the moment you walk through their doors you are greeted with excellence. From the highly trained staff to the beautiful warmth the hotel holds as you walk through. The rooms are always spotless and well designed with everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel. Having stayed in so many luxury hotels in Dubai where the standard is high, I've always struggled to find anywhere in the UK that even came close until the Corinthia which offers the same luxury & standard of service. 
The food in all restaurants is outstanding & I'm yet to meet a staff member that is not professional, warm, friendly and helpful.  Alice in front office is just amazing & made our stay so special, she offered an incredible level of service and was so attentive. Antony Rush is just exceptional on all levels, a true professional that has always made every stay feel so inviting and memorable.

Thank you Corinthia for making every stay an incredible memory especially my most recent for our wedding. We cannot wait to return to the best hotel in London!",5,2022,05,10
143,Absolutely outstanding!,"I booked the Corinthia as a gift to my partner on a significant birthday back on September for us both to enjoy in May 2022.
From the moment we arrived we could not fault the the service, Martina checked us in discreetly and gave us a tour of the hotel before escorting us to our upgraded room.
When we arrived in the room the prearranged champagne was awaiting along with a birthday cake the hotel had prepared to mark my partners special occasion.
After freshening up we visited the Northall Bar for some pre dinner drinks, once again service was attentive and non intrusive.
We then made our way to Kerridges for dinner, shown to our table by Matt who was so charming.
Service was slick, food good and drink choices in abundance. It really was a superb experience.
Having slept exceptionally well the following morning we availed of breakfast which again was first rate, after this we spent an hour or so in ESPA spa which was so relaxing.  As part of our room package we had a late check out so we didn’t feel pressured at all to rush.
We really didn’t want to leave as we had such a lovely stay and very staff member we encountered here was just a true professional.  We cannot wait to visit again soon!!",5,2022,05,07
143,A perfect stay in a perfect place,"Also this time everything was perfect, the accommodation with a bottle of champagne to welcome us, the kindness of the staff, always available for any need, the cleaning of a beautiful hotel that welcomes you every day with a magnificent scent of fresh flowers, what else to add? Simply perfect",5,2022,05,07
143,My favorite hotel…,It had been two years since I was able to travel to London but I was greeted at the front desk like an old friend.  This remains my favorite hotel in London and one of my favorite hotels in the world.  The rooms and baths are spacious and very thoughtfully appointed.  The service is attentive and discreet.  The food is delicious and the afternoon tea is a delight. The front desk and concierge team are friendly and eager to assist.  I can’t wait to get back to the Corinthia.,5,2022,05,03
143,Outstanding afternoon tea,"Visited for afternoon tea yesterday with my sister. We do afternoon tea in London at least four times a year, and this was definitely up there with the best of them. The venue is beautiful, the food fresh and delicious, and champagne is served in Baccarat crystal flutes. But by far the best thing about it was the service which was outstanding - friendly and attentive without being overbearing or intrusive. I’m sorry I didn’t ask for names but think Joe was one of the young men who looked after us so well. He is a credit to you. We have no hesitation in recommending the Corinthia and will visit again.",5,2022,05,01
143,Spoiled Rotten and Lovin' Every Minute of It,"It's not often that I enter a hotel room and feel spoiled and appreciated but this hotel exceeded all of my expectations. From check-in service until we said our final good-byes, the staff at the Corinthia London were friendly and attentive to our every need. Want your shoes shined? No problem, they were back in under two hours. Want an extra pillow or two? No problem, delivered to the room in less than 30 minutes. I felt so spoiled I didn't want to leave. Looking forward to our next stay! P.S. They serve a delicious Afternoon Tea that I would highly recommend.",5,2022,04,28
143,Tranquil & Luxurious,"My husband, 8 year old son and I stayed at the Corinthia London for 3 nights. From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we knew we were in for a special break. The staff were friendly and attentive, our family room was so luxurious and spacious, our son loved the little gifts left for him. The hotel Spa is out of this world, just the place to relax after a busy day exploring the city, our son loved swimming in the pool. We will definitely return, we all loved our stay and couldn’t fault the hotel.",5,2022,04,26

Couldn't stay for lunch this time, but we'll definitely be back for dinner, and fairly soon!",5,2022,04,25
143,You can’t  go wrong at the Corinthia!,"It was my first time to London and I did a lot of research on hotels. I am so glad I chose the Corinthia. It’s a beautiful hotel in a fantastic location. The concierge staff knew us by name and were so helpful. The garden restaurant was absolutely beautiful and my daughter fell in love with their Burrata. If you stay here, you must try it. We actually ordered one everyday. I loved the turn down service, and our beds  were very comfortable. The shower pressure was the best I have had in any hotel, and they actually provide bath sheets and not those little regular hotel towels. I really can’t say anything bad. If you stay here, you can’t go wrong.",5,2022,04,25
143,Best hotel in London,"The rooms are luxurious (even the entry level ones), the food quality is superb across the board and the spa is on another level. What more could you want for a special occasion?

143,Corinthia Hotel London,"Beautiful hotel with excellent service. Second time of staying and would not hesitate to visit again. Staff are friendly and can not do enough for you. Afternoon tea in the Crystal Lounge is an indulgent experience worth every penny. Tom Kerridge’s restaurant is great and the Northall restaurant supply a sumptuous breakfast. Location is central and easy walks to everywhere in the West end. Prices are what you would expect for a 5* central London hotel. We managed to take up one of their offers which included parking, early and late check in/out as well as £100 on tab, room upgrade and bottle of champagne!",5,2022,04,22

My friend and I were in London to visit my daughter who recently moved there. She works during the day so we were on our own to wander about. The staff at the hotel made every decision an easy one. Every single employee treated us like we were old friends. From the bellman to the bartenders! Exceptional service and a very well appointed hotel. If you are there, stop by the North Hall bar and say hello to Parade, Ben, Ali and Mateo! They had our drinks and snacks waiting as soon as we entered the room!! I will absolutely be back again!!",5,2022,04,16
143,Simply Amazing,We had an excellent time made even better by the staff. Our concierge Radu was amazing and helped us plan our trip from the moment we arrived and made sure we were looked after throughout the trip. The staff knew it was my birthday from looking at my passport when checking in and we were treated to complimentary gifts and spa access throughout the trip. We will definitely be visiting again.,5,2022,04,16
143,Honeymoon Stay,"We stayed for 3 nights after getting married in London. From the minute we walked in the door to the minute we left, everything was perfect. The staff were super helpful and friendly, the hotel itself is absolutely beautiful, and our room was so large with everything we needed. Staying just before Easter, there was a lovely cart with some chocolate goodies at reception where you could help yourself. We also had a small cake and champagne left in our room which was a lovely touch. Breakfast was to die for, so much choice, and we also had afternoon tea during our stay. We love an afternoon tea, and this is the best one we've had, beating Gleneagles and The Savoy hands down.  We hope to return, maybe not to stay as this was a real treat for us, but definitely for food or drinks.",5,2022,04,15
143,Will Return!,"My partner and I visited for lunch,at Tom Kerridges Bar and Grill.
Good meal,we stuck to the set menu.
Wine excellent.
The bar and grill are very tradition pub style,my man liked alot!

143,"Fantastic Visit, Fantastic People","First stay at Corinthia London. Special occasions- my wife's birthday and  forthcoming Silver Wedding anniversary.

Exceptional service and kindness from booking to arriving home. Booked by phone - very keen to know details to make the visit a special 5 Star experience.  

Before the visit, contacted by the Guest Experience Manager to ensure that everything was in place to make it the most memorable experience. 

When we arrived we felt a genuine welcome. River Suite amazing, with birthday and anniversary cakes and champagne on arrival. Restaurant meal was made special by the  Northall Team.

Team arranged for Afternoon Tea to be served in room as we had to leave early. Several of the team came to reception to say goodbye on departure. 

All members of the Corinthia Team
made every interaction exceptional. So many memories made; so much warmth and kindness shown.

Will always choose the Corinthia when visiting London. Our daughter is badgering us to take her next time!",5,2022,04,10
143,Spoiled by luxury :),"Two weeks ago, me and my friend visited beautiful Corinthia Hotel. Our first steps after check-in were to spa for a little pamper before we started our staycation. 

We had absolutely extraordinary time. The atmosphere at the spa was very relaxing and we fully immersed ourselves in the tranquil but magnificent place.  

I was in need of quick 30 min massage of my back. My therapist was very professional and so lovely lady. 
After the massage I felt very regenerated, well relaxed and also my lower back tension was relived. The massage was just perfect way to start.  

After that we enjoyed sauna and also swimming pool. For the hotel spa it is has a wide choice of facilities and it's very spacious (it has few floors) so it makes you feel comfortable and gives privacy.  

I have heard so much positive feedback about Corinthia's spa but after my experience I definitely agree that it's the best spa in London so far.",5,2022,04,07
143,Most luxurious City Hotel ever visited with most welcoming and 5* staff,"The hotel situated literally in the heart and most historic part of London. Spotless clean room and public areas with two beautiful restaurants and bars and of course the most exclusive, luxurious and world awarded spa in London. Even if you do not get the chance to stay you should definitely visit for dinner, afternoon tea or Spa Day. We celebrated my partner's 40th bd which was unforgettable. Bea from the spa and Tora from main reception really looked after us and I am sure they are valuable staff members of the hotel.",5,2022,04,06
143,Outstanding few nights away,"We have stayed at the Corintia before and we had another fantastic stay. As always the hotel was in emaculate condition and the staff were friendly and very attentive.

We used the Spa twice during our stay and again the facilities are 2nd to none.

We had guests coming for dinner and theyy were made to feel extremely welcome and commented how nice all the staff were.",5,2022,04,06
143,STUNNING HOTEL !!,"From the moment you walk in until the moment you walk out the hotel is second to none. The facilities on offer from restaurants to cocktails or just relaxing at the spa are all first class.
The staff are incredibly helpful and friendly which make the hotel very welcoming place to stay. A special mention for Aicha and Fleur just two of many that made our stay even better and I really look forward to seeing you both again.",5,2022,04,05
143,Outstanding hotel and staff.,"We went for a family staycation and did the London hotel tour ‘thing’.

The Corinthia was the best of the hotels we stayed in. We were booked for 3 nights and extended to 6 and cancelled the next / last hotel we were due to go to. 

The staff were incredibly helpful and nothing was too much trouble, the spa outstanding as too the bar / restaurant facilities.

I am wiring the review for this hotel 6 months after our stay and having just stayed in another hotel elsewhere and being reminded how much better and exceptional the Corinthia is / was.",5,2022,04,03
143,The Best Afternoon Tea at Corinthia London!,"The best Mother’s Day afternoon tea! We arrived slightly early so we ordered some fabulous cocktails at the Northall Bar. The service is always top notch at Corinthia! All of the staff are always very polite and welcoming, which goes along way. We had one member of our party that was vegetarian and one that was vegan and all our dietary needs were met! This was probably the best afternoon tea we’ve had in London and worth the price tag! We love to celebrate special occasions all year round at Corinthia hotel and look forward to our next visit! Thank you again for such a special day!",5,2022,04,02
143,Excellent in every way,"As expected everything was excellent, we had a special celebration weekend and everything was perfect, the staff are amazing and the food is out of this world, can highly recommend for any special treat.",5,2022,04,01
143,Excellence in the heart of London,"Beautiful rooms , very quiet , two minutes walking distance from Trafalgar square and close to the major museums ,the opera and Buckingham Palace.The restaurant setting is very pleasant , the staff is superbly trained and the choice of foods is varied and very well prepared.Breakfast buffet is outstanding . Of note ,one of the restaurants presently offers alpine specialties , including Raclette,Fondue , Tartiflette etc.Our family reunion was a great success.",5,2022,04,01
143,MOTHERS DAY WITH FAMILY,"Excellent all round visit, from the moment we pulled up and were greeted by the very professional and polite valet team, through to the reception team and the great staff at kerridges restaurant.
great family day / night out at this lovely hotel.

Thank you to all the staff who made it special for my wife on mothers day.",5,2022,03,31
143,My favourite hotel in London,"The Corinthia made my stay extra special at every moment, their staff are wonderful and the decor is beautiful.  When checking I let the team know it was my mothers birthday, they provided a wonderful experience by providing my mum with birthday cake and a champagne in our room and again during our diner service at the hotel. The food is impeccable and service is outstanding in all areas of the hotel. I love staying here and hope to be back soon!",5,2022,03,30
143,Engagement Surprise,"The Corinthia provided a memorable setting for the marriage proposal to my future wife.  The hotel is exceptionally well appointed, modern and tastefully decorated throughout.  All staff we encountered, without exception were friendly, professional and engaging. 

We had afternoon tea in the Crystal Moon Lounge which was a wonderful experience and highly recommended.  I personally believe this is one of the best afternoon teas in London. 

We stayed in an executive room which had some very nice features, from a single switch mood lighting button to a television in the bath!  The ‘turn down’ service at night was also a very nice touch and made the room very welcoming after a long day on our feet. 

Breakfast was superb and there was an excellent selection and wide variety of food available. The service again was impeccable.  

We also had cocktails in the bar and lunch at Kerridge’s.  Again this was a pleasurable experience in a relaxed, friendly setting.  Matt and his team worked effortlessly to ensure our food was delivered expeditiously, owing to time constraints we were under.  

The Hotel Spa provided a tranquil, zen like feel and again was very well appointed.  The Thermal floor had a good size swimming pool and even an ice fountain!  Watching flames dancing in the fire whilst listing to running water surrounded by bubbles in the vitality pool was an experience I will never forget.  

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to one staff member in particular, namely Aicha Anberree (guest relations manager).  Aicha was instrumental in ensuring the arrangements for my engagement proposal went smoothly and without a hitch, adding some nice personal touches along the way to enhance our experience and make our stay all that much more special. 

Having stayed in a number of 5 star hotels in London, the Corinthia by far is my favourite to date.",5,2022,03,26
143,Excellent conference experience,"Attended a conference for a day only but really noticed the kindness and friendliness of the staff, even to the waiter who brought my tea ! Really beautiful hotel, great food and overall enjoyable experience",5,2022,03,23
143,Wonderful stay,"My wife arranged for a two day stay for my birthday.

The hotel is beautiful and the service is excellent.

The room was very comfortable and a good size.

Having stayed at most other 5 star london hotels this is one of the best.

We look forward to a return visit in the future.",5,2022,03,20
143,Elegant perfection,"This is my favorite hotel in the world and I always stay here when I visit London.  It's hard to describe the atmosphere in just a few words, but for me, I feel like British Royalty when I visit.  The staff are exquisite, nothing is too much trouble (they show such kindness and good grace towards my 80-year old mother when she comes to visit me there), and they seem to really get on with each other which you can feel when you are there.  I love all the little touches, the turn-down service and the occasional extra treat just to make you feel special.  Add to this, it's perfectly located for central London and the tube.",5,2022,03,18
143,Amazing Birthday Stay,"We had a lovely stay for my partners 30th birthday. The room was amazing and staff were so welcoming and friendly. 
We visited the spa and I had treatments from the lovely Eleanor - she was very professional and knowledgeable. 
Couldn’t recommend enough.",5,2022,03,15
143,Disappointing start to a special birthday,"We arrived at the Hotel this morning having booked 3 Londons Calling Package Rooms for my brother in laws 30th Birthday and were disappointed to find our rooms are not ready and won’t be ready until 1pm.

We purposely selected the Londons calling package due to the “Guaranteed early check in at 10am” but have now had to amend our plans due to this.

Unfortunately added to this the receptionist was very dismissive of our disappointment and didn’t display any empathy whatsoever.

Such a shame as we have previously stayed at the hotel and hand a fabulous time, but would be sceptical about booking the addition Londons calling packaging again.",1,2022,03,12
143,"Wonderful, relaxing and very happy stay","Beautiful hotel, elegant throughout
Food : amazing. Wonderful breakfast, room service excellent as well. We had dined at the garden and atmosphere lovely.Food was also very good. Customer service impeccable. We did not have time to have afternoon tea though I can say all customers looked happy which resemble our experience there.
All staff are extremely professional and they want to get it right for the guest. My husband and I felt it was genuine and they have been very proactive to ensure we were okay.
The bed and pillow menu is excellent, we slept well. The turndown service was one of the highlights and we are grateful to Beatrice. I hope she will look after us when we return.
Thank you to all staff
Sabrina and NIck",5,2022,03,10
143,Sublime,"This Hotel is the most elegant relaxing Hotel we have ever had the pleasure of staying in, the welcome was so warm and friendly.

The staff had already arranged a beautiful birthday cake and champagne in our room upon our arrival as we were staying to celebrate my Wife's birthday.

The Hotel also kindly gave us a room upgrade to an amazing room with a fantastic view of the London Eye, that evening we had the pleasure of dinning at Kerridges Bar and Grill which was out of this world.

The spa is without doubt the finest in London, so relaxing, stylish.

I simply cannot fault this amazing Hotel, between the staff the room the food, it truly was a 5 star experience.

Thank you so much Corinthia.

Jody and Debbie from Dublin",5,2022,03,08
143,Husband stayed there - really unhelpful reception staff,"My husband spent a couple of nights there this week.  When i attempted to contact him due to a domestic emergency they said he was not there!! When I asked if he had checked out (to return home) I was told that they couldn't give me that information!! Finally found out that they had changed his room (leaking shower), then they refused to page him when he didn't answer the room 'phone.  What an utter shambles!!! Not what I would expect from a half decent hotel!!",1,2022,03,04
143,"Another Exceptional Stay at Corinthia, London","We stayed at Corinthia to celebrate my husbands 60th birthday and had a fantastic stay.  The luxurious Garden suite was a wonderful retreat from the activities of the day.  Spa facilities are exceptional and so relaxing.  Breakfast was delicious with an extensive offering.  Dinner in Northall, with drinks in the bar beforehand, fantastic. Great atmosphere. 
Another great stay at this wonderful Hotel with the most friendly, professional team you can ask for.  The best Hotel in London.",5,2022,03,04
143,Love this hotel!,"Visited  again after 2 years due to lock down and was  reminded of what a great hotel this is - we have missed it!  Stayed 2 nights with my husband and 2 children. Stayed in the standard family room which we had no real issues with. No kettle nor fresh milk though  but as it was a short stay we didn't bother requesting either - I am sure if we flagged this up, it would have been easily rectified by the hotel. Kids love watching the TV in the bath. Complimentary champagne and the  kids sweets were also a lovely touch.
Kids also loved using the swimming pool - a better time for the family swim would be 8-9am  so we did have to rush to breakfast but that is just my preference. 
Breakfast on both mornings was absolutely delicious. We also had lunch in the north  hall which was as equally as scrumptious - definitely recommend the oysters.
The hotel with its interiors and facilities is seriously impressive.
All staff we courteous, kind and helpful.
Looking forward our next trip already.",5,2022,03,03
143,Corinthia stay,"My family & I stayed here from the 21st to the 24th of February. When we arrived at the hotel there wasn’t any doorman on the door & my daughter & I had my two grandchildren & two pushchairs & two cases with us . The taxi driver helped with our luggage etc , he did make the comment where was the doorman & we thought the same . 
When were checking in at reception & my three year old Granddaughter noticed someone had put chewing gum underneath the top of the reception desk. My daughter told the receptionist & they quickly removed it.  People who do that are disgusting. However maybe the cleaners at the hotel should of noticed it & removed it before a child did .
I asked for an earlier check in if possible as my youngest Granddaughter needed her nap . The rooms weren’t ready but half an hour later they were & the drinks we had in the bar were complimentary which was lovely . 
On arrival in our rooms ( they were interconnecting ) , my daughters family room had lots of treats for my Granddaughters. A jar of sweets , chocolate lollipops, a cake , a dressing gown , slippers for my elder Granddaughter & lovely bath products for both of them . There was also a bottle of Laurent Perrier for us . 
Both the rooms & bathrooms had all the amenities you could wish for apart from kettles in the rooms & in my room no English breakfast teabags . Milk wasn’t provided for either . There was only Crema which is for coffee not tea . I think the hotel should provide it . We phoned room service & the kettles were quickly brought up . The kettles were also needed to heat up my Granddaughter’s bottles . 
We went to the spa in the afternoon which was really good . My Granddaughter’s both loved being in the pool which was lovely & warm . My daughter & I used the steam room , sauna & jacuzzi . 
We ordered room service that evening & the food was delivered promptly & was very nice . 
The beds were comfortable & at turndown we were left a lavender filled bag . 
The next day we went for breakfast & we were told the breakfast room was full as many of the people there were having their buisness breakfasts. We were put in the bar area where more tables had been laid up . I would of thought hotel guests would take priority over other breakfast guests who were only there for breakfast. The breakfast was delicious, with lots of choice & a good selection on the breakfast menu . The second day we had breakfast in the restaurant, on the third day we again in the bar area with my son in law who had arrived the day before . 
On our last day we arrived back to find a mattress had been placed between our interconnecting doors . We hadn’t asked for the mattress to be put there & on the mattress it had rooms 511-512. We were staying in room 514-515. I phoned reception who said they would arrange for it to be removed. After a while I phoned housekeeping & they sent a porter to remove it . Housekeeping had no idea why the mattress was put there .
My daughter asked if our rooms could be cleaned either before 9.30 or after 10 as my youngest granddaughter has her morning nap then . On the second day we got back to our rooms at one & my daughters room had been cleaned but my room hadn’t . We thought this was late for a room to be cleaned & couldn’t understand why my room hadn’t been cleaned at a similar time to my daughters . 
On the last evening my daughter’s room had been turned down but mine hadn’t. The maid came into my room at 21.30 to turn down my room . This was too late .
My daughters room had a heated floor in her bathroom but my bathroom didn’t & the tv in my bathroom didn’t always have sound . The handle also came off my bedside table . I do think maintenance needs to look at room 514 as it seems to have some issues with it .
Check out was fine apart from the receptionist said she would e-mail me the final invoice & it still hasn’t come . 
Even though there was  niggles about the hotel we enjoyed our stay . The hotel has a lovely serene atmosphere about it & is beautiful inside . 
There are many other hotels in London of a similar standard to this hotel & I do think the Corinthia could do a little better in certain areas particularly due to the price of it.",4,2022,02,27
143,London Sight seeing,"From the start everything was first class
staff were attentive, friendly and professional
hotel was spotless and you do feel you are somewhere special when you walk through the building.
Kerridges was fantastic, food was top quality whilst being relaxed
all rooms again were first rate, with super showers and toiletries 
would highly recommend and will be going back",5,2022,02,27
143,Birthday weekend,Had the best weekend at the corinthia hotel london the staff are a amazing made my stay very enjoyable could not wish for a better place the hotel is amazing from the spa bar restaurants food was amazing the room was relaxing staff go out there way to made your stay as comfortable as possible cant wait to go back soon,5,2022,02,22
143,Weekend stay,"Excellent hotel, superb staff, wonderful facilities. The room was clean and very well appointed, no complaints there The Northall restaurant was good and breakfast was plentiful. Pricey but worth every penny.",5,2022,02,21
143,As amazing as ever ✨ - the best hotel in London,"My sister and I have just returned from the most fabulous weekend stay at the Corinthia. Everything, I mean EVERYTHING was amazing. The staff are so lovely, the service is exceptional and the rooms, restaurants and spa are out of this world. Thank you for making our trip so special - we will be back! I honestly don’t know how anything could have been better… The Corinthia is now the ONLY place we will stay when visiting London.",5,2022,02,20
143,Timeless elegant and luxurious beauty without a glimpse of that 5* arrogance,"My first stay at the Corinthia was 6 months ago and I have returned four times since then! The hotel is elegant at every turn yet unlike some other large named 5* London hotels, does not have a stuffy slightly arrogant atmosphere. I have stayed at the Corinthia with a friend, with my children and with my husband and every time I have been treated as if my custom is of the utmost importance. All the staff I have encountered have a ‘no problem’ attitude and are always more than happy to go above and beyond to ensure that your stay is the full Corinthia experience. Aicha the guest relations manager was beyond helpful in securing us dining in a fully booked Kerridges on Valentines weekend after our plans were cancelled following an outbreak of Covid and was particularly helpful in the run up to our stay. Rory is an absolute credit to the Northall Restaurant and we always look forward to his cheery smile and conversation when dining there. The rooms are spacious, warm and inviting.  The London’s Calling is a particular favourite deal as we often take advantage of staying for the extra hours. I will not hesitate to return to this hotel whenever I possibly can. Elegant, timeless beauty which has a home from home feeling and staff who make you feel as if they have your personal interests at heart. I highly recommend this amazing hotel.",5,2022,02,17
143,The BEST Hotel in London,"Simply excellent. The service is warm, welcoming and professional. All the luxury of the grand hotels of London, with the service and genuine welcome of a small boutique hotel. Breakfast is stunning and I'd strongly advise booking a table at Kerridges Bar and Grill.

If you want utter luxury with atmosphere and genuine warmth, look no further.",5,2022,02,17
143,Cannot Fault,"Be rest assured that this place is a true 5 star hotel. If you are looking for a no nonsense 5 star hotel then this is definitely one of the best in London, should be on the top 5 list of Tripadvisor. When I am in London again I will be choosing this hotel again.",5,2022,02,14
143,I wish I could give more than 5 stars!,"My first time staying at the Corinthia and it is definitely not my last. The whole experience of my stay was faultless, the amenities, the staff, the room, the service. I would give it six stars if I could as my stay went above my expectations. Thank you to Mitja for organising and hosting our stay.",5,2022,02,11
143,Top notch,Just love this place - the rooms are amazing with great views and very comfortable beds. The service is second to none. The spa is just what you need after a busy day shopping and one of the best amongst the London hotels.  We will definitely stay here again.,5,2022,02,07
143,TERRIBLE and very expensive stay,"A group of us for work stayed at The Corinthia in suites for over a week in November 2021. So many issues!! The aircon wouldn’t work properly at all and horrible stuffiness in the room.

We ordered room service one evening , it took over 90 mins! I don’t know how long it would have taken in the end as I cancelled it at 90 mins waiting. I should have just ordered Deliveroo.

Turns out they charged us anyway for the room service. 🙄

My room wasn’t made up several days and I had to call to request service, which again took ages and delayed me.

The staff were totally incompetent and not friendly in the slightest. 

The food was just not good, soggy lettuce in the salad, tepid chicken. Cold chip.

The pool was nice and warm. Tiny, but lovely and warm. That’s the nicest thing I can say about this hotel. Oh and the flower shop is beautiful. Would never go back!!",1,2022,02,07
143,Afternoon tea,"Went for my wedding anniversary to The Corinthia. 
We were taken to the Crystal Moon Room. 
It’s such a beautiful and very well decorated room, so tranquil and inviting. 
The waiter came straight to us and gave us the menu and explained what order things would come. 
The sandwiches were truly Devine. For the first time cucumber sandwich in an afternoon had the most amazing taste.  
(And I’ve been to many!)
Overall all the sandwiches were incredible. Presented well and 10/10 for taste. 
The scones were presented in a lovely box. 2 plain and 2 sultana ones, with a compliments of clotted cream, strawberry jam and rhubarb and ginger jam. Superb!
Then the cake trolley was wheeled to us and showed us all the cakes and explained what they were. Incredible presentation!
The hot beverages menu ie teas, coffees was quite vast so there would be tea for any ones palette. 
The cutlery, plates, saucers etc were beautiful, not in you face patterns just nice. 
Champagne was chilled perfectly and the flutes were exquisite. 

The waiters and all who served us were really lovely and anything we wanted they couldn’t do enough for us. 

Don’t know how much it cost as it was given to us as a gift, but whatever it was it was worth it. 

Thank you to The Corinthia for a lovely evening to celebrate mine and my husband anniversary. 

Would definitely recommend anyone to come.",5,2022,02,06
143,Review of amazing employee,"Walked in not even expecting to be let in at all. Roberto immediately tended to our needs, sat us at a table and gave us recommendations which suited us.

Thank you!",5,2022,02,05

143,Luxury hotel stay with all the trimmings,"We stayed for 2 nights in the corinthia and from the moment we stepped inside this breathtaking hotel we were blow away. The staff all have a very caring manner and greet you so warmly every time you pass by. Our room overlooked the beautiful court yard with
 a very nice Juliet balcony. We dinned in kerridges for dinner , lunch in the garden & cocktails in the north hall bar.

Having stayed in a number of other top hotels in London, I would unhesitatingly recommend the Corinthia as the best.",5,2022,01,31
143,Excellent service in the lounge!,"It is always a pleasure to relax in the lounge after a day out. 
I prefer calm surroundings to meet and talk in the evening so I usually end up here after visiting the attractions of London. 🙂 
Violeta and Giacomo are excellent hosts and great ambassadors for the hotel.",5,2022,01,30
143,Fantastic stay at a luxury hotel.,"We had a fantastic 3 night stay at this luxury hotel. The staff were very welcoming, friendly and could not do enough for you. This started with the doormen and didn’t disappoint for the rest of our stay. The room was really spacious, well equipped and most importantly a very comfortable bed. The breakfast choice was huge and was very tasty. The spa is luxurious and the gym is very well equipped. We had a great meal in Kerridge’s, great food and wine with impeccable service.",5,2022,01,28

Thanks again",5,2022,01,27
143,Perfect Stay.,"We have just had 2 night at the Corinthia and it was absolutely perfect. The attention to detail and the friendliness of the Staff is on another level.

You rely don't need to leave the Hotel and the Spa facilities, restaurant options and the rooms themselves mean you can lock yourself away in total privacy for the duration of your stay.

Thank you Corinthia. We will definitely be back!

(Lobster Eggs Benedict was sooooo goood)",5,2022,01,23
143,Our favourite hotel 💜,"We always look forward to visiting the Corinthia Hotel as it’s our absolute favourite hotel in London/worldwide. The hotel manager Jochem and each & every single one of his team members always provide exceptional service and are super friendly.

The hotel is so beautiful, from the lobby to the rooms, they are all picturesque. 
The cleanliness is 10/10 as well as comfort (beds/pillows are dreamy) 

The spa is a must visit and is definitely the best one we have been to in the U.K.  
We have tried a few different treatments and they are all worth the price.

Today we booked in for afternoon tea which was delightful. There is a nice selection of tea/sandwiches/cakes and the scones were lovely & fresh. The staff were all knowledgable and again super friendly. We will definitely book in again!

Thank you again to all the team members and we look forward to our next visit :)",5,2022,01,22
143,Beautiful hotel!,"We have just got home after a 3night stay in room 331, first of all WOW what a hotel!! 
It’s such a classy place, the attention to detail is amazing, the staff are all so friendly and can’t do enough for you! 
Anyone reading this and not sure to book this hotel, please do book it, it’s just stunning!! You will not be disappointed. 
The food was lovely, and the breakfast was so good. the spa was amazing we felt so relaxed afterwards. 
Definitely worth every single penny! 
We got upgraded to an executive suite I think it was, the room was beautiful, they have a turn down service in the evening which was so nice. 
Thank you so much corinthia london, for making our stay so nice. 
Hope to stay again soon!",5,2022,01,15
143,Another Fantastic Visit,"Another amazing visit. Once again looked after soo well. We decided to extend our stay for another night as we where soo impressed. One of our rooms had a small issue which the team quickly sorted, and delivered a bottle of LP to apologise. 
We’re already booking our next two visits. Thank you Team Corinthia",5,2022,01,09
143,ESPA Life Experience,"I had the pleasure to visit ESPA Life at Corinthia recently, and it was an absolutely mind-blowing experience!
It all started with a luxurious and welcoming ambiance when I entered the hotel. I was lucky to have visited during the Christmas period, as the hotel is beautifully decorated - a real Christmas fairytale!

The SPA is stunning - it is spacious, clean, and offers everything for full relaxation including unique Sleep Pods for some peaceful time after treatment. 
There is a sauna and a steam room on the main floor accessible to everyone, as well as more private saunas in the changing room, which I found very thoughtful. The pool and sauna area, with dimmed lighting and dark marble, has an almost magical, mysterious ambiance. 

The highlight of the visit was the Therabody Full Body Experience, a deep tissue massage using the Theragun device for maximum effect. I loved how the treatment included a facial massage - an area that is usually left out during the classic massage. Spa Therapist Alexandra was delightful, ensured that all the areas of concern are addressed, and provided some great advice too! 

I highly recommend it for the ultimate Spa break and if you want to feel truly pampered and taken care of by professionals.",5,2022,01,07
143,Best breakfast!,"Perfect as usual :-) forth to wake up for the breakfast.Very nice service and top quality food.
We spent again time in our favourite spa in London ,never regret.Clean and neat place to chill.Fall on sleep at the marble beds...
Thank you for the experience again.",5,2022,01,06
143,BEAUTIFUL HOTEL AND AMAZING LOCATION,"My husband and I stayed at the Corinthia over the New Year's holiday for 3 days. We have stayed previously, and that visit was flawless. This time, we paid for a regular deluxe suite. We were told we were upgraded to a garden view suite. The suite was decorated beautifully and had plenty of room to move around in. The living room area was separated by a door to the bedroom and bathroom. Upon arrival, there was a bottle of champagne, a nice note welcoming us back, and snacks. The presentation was lovely. The view in the garden suite is not great. We were on the 3rd floor, so we could not even see the sky. We could see the walls of the building on 3 sides and the below view of the grass with benches, all of which were enclosed by the walls of the building. It was a bit unsettling to be honest, as it felt very claustrophobic. I would recommend the regular suite so you can at least see the street outside. 

We had room service for breakfast and it came promptly. It was very good. We had 1 dinner for room service and that also came very quickly. 

The turn down service was prompt at 6pm as requested.

We had an issue with the bathroom that was quickly addressed and we appreciated how professional and courteous the staff were.

The Corinthia is beautiful during the holidays and the hotel has a very luxurious feel. The staff are wonderful and very accommodating. It was apparent that the recent COVID issues were affecting the hotel, though. There were issues in Kerridges with getting service, but since we were here previously with no issues, we chalked that up to COVID. 

The location of the Corinthia could not be better. We walked almost everywhere and were were so close to Covent Gardens, all of the theaters, the horse guard, Big Ben, Piccadilly, Trafalgar Square, Parliament, the London Eye, and so many other places that we hardly needed any other form of transportation.  

Our previous visit was 5 stars and the only reason we could  not give 5 stars this time is due to the issues that we had in our room and at the restaurant. We will definitely be back again and would recommend it to others.",4,2022,01,05
143,Christmas Bash,"Rolling the company event over from 2020 to 2021 and glad we did, we all were appointed excellent rooms all with comp' bubbles. A few of the team enjoyed the facilities (Spa & beautician) and they said it was really good.
The rooms are really well equipped but still too much plastic on view, which in time with the savvy traveler will become a problem. The River suite we had was beautiful but the butler service was extremely scant when called upon. This changed completely when the night butler came on, he was awesome.
Breakfast was great and we were looked after very well. This though should be a gimme at the costs per room rate.",5,2022,01,05
143,A Christmas-to-New Year Near Miss for 2021,"Any first-rate hotel can charm and maintain both newcomers and regular fans mid spring and mid fall.  Any FIT frequent hotel guest knows that the ultimate test of any GM and down is how a property performs and upholds between Christmas and New Year’s with staff shortages, high demand, (almost) full occupancy, coupled with the pressures of staff wanting time off and then positive covid tests creating shortages.  Our 9 day recent holiday stay at Corinthia for the first time left us with mixed messages.

The hotel standard BANS named-badges, so learning everyone’s name is a rite of passage here.

Review:

Quarantine:
The hotel really needs one designated staff member available from each shift as designated “Quarantine Concierge” to coordinate check in with guests and inform of all hotel policies.  Our Angelica not only welcomed us, but made us tea and dinner reservations, asked at what time we wanted daily housekeeping service (2000 but they NEVER came at 8PM), and more.  Later we found out when Ariana called us walking our dog that the hotel expected us to stay in our room, sans room service, engineering, or housekeeping until our PCR negative results return.  At no time on Amex Platinum or emails from the hotel did anyone explain such ridiculous procedures.  Even “room service” (Corinthia still hasn’t stepped up to call it “private dining” yet) can be left outside a guest room’s door if so much fear exists.  While we received since booked 3 months prior no less than FIVE calls to the USA from concierge to book holiday meals, at no time did anyone ever explain the hotel’s stringent PCR quarantine policies to foreign arrivals.  While we did do our PCR upon arrivals and awaited results, we can take no responsibility for the speed of the NHS delivering results and busy Chritmas, yet we really felt at a certain point hounded by Ariana for our results.

*High Points: afternoon tea with Tim who serves tea in courses and explains every item of every tea as if it’s his first; Kerridge’s Fish and Chips with dogs allowed; we loved the separate dressing room area for luggage, hanging coats, wet umbrellas, and more; architecture of gym and thermal floor (despite being on 3 floors) is incredible

*Low Points: 
ROOM: many, many items in room needing repair and refurb: dirty winter carpet, outdated pulley-system for curtains (room and bathroom) which needed multiple repairs, falling lights under the tub presenting electrical-water danger, never-repaired shower lights that never worked; hotel-wide the windows are extremely tall and narrow, so if your curtains don’t open, you’re in for seeing a lot of dark and a lot of wall
GROUNDS: the display windows for all elevators are always black and reveal nothing about where an elevator is at any point in time; when we wandered around the hotel and asked directions to Kerridges from the 2 men arranging flowers in the “boutique” area they informed us “sorry—we just work here and aren’t familiar with the hotel.”; the room is—with all lights set to bright—quite dark, and for my disability with limited sight, even during the gray days with curtains barely able to open with the dated pulley system, the room is difficult to navegate 

ROOM: we never ever figured out how to produce heat in the room despite the apparent simplicity of the aircon display; also the lighting system is NOT the most intuitive for all sections of the room: oftentimes one button creates various effects and that can frustrate sleepers; seeing the staff working so frantically on Christmas Day --including serving the hotel GM – made us uncomfortable; if you are sound sensitive, know that you CAN detect the underground nearby Embankment station trains pass by during the quiet of night; upon check in we found a pair of lady sunglasses under one of the chairs which we turned into the Concierge—unsettling this because during COVID we expect high cleaning procedures and any simple normal vacuuming procedure would have revealed this misplaced item

SPA: the no-cellphone policy inside the wet and dry areas of the spa was NEVER enforced and I felt vulnerable using these facilities with so many unmasked individuals walking and laying around using their phones as well.

Unique Points:

F&B Big Threes

*Northall Bar Lounge
Food: n/a
Service: understaffed on Christmas eve and Day but eventually all came around
Ambience: real-time music by a band made the holiday feel even more special

*Breakfast Room
Food: excellent tasting hot food items from menu with incredible bacon; unfortunately, despite our requests the hollandaise sauce came cold EVERY.  SINGLE.  DAY.  
Service: *Sam introduced himself to us on the LAST day and inquired about our room # and name; how wonderful to have had this interaction when the room was full when we checked in on the day before Christmas eve; a great example of too little too late too insincere; *Mira from Philippines was incredible at working under understaffed pressure, and *Martha helped her with drinks in the mornings.  NO other seater of the restaurant ever took beverage orders, yet that’s a logical thing to do when severely understaffed and sitting guests: at least find out what they’re drinking cuz they’re going to be waiting a LONG time for food service every day until the new year.  On some days our tea came in silver pots, in other days V-B pots, and yet in other days in the pots from the tea lounge.  On some days our toast came all soggy piled together on a plate and on other days it came in proper toast rack.  
Ambience: no music, hectic, no requests for guests to mask at buffet which seems hypocritical against the huge PCR quarantine we had after check-in; most guests in all buffet lines we observed wore no masks and the hand santitizer at only one end of each buffet line was often inoperative; on our first day we were denied entry rudely by a staff who said we were on the list of those not to let into the restaurant (our PCR test results hadn't yet come) and he could have informed us in a much more polite way and suggested room service even though Ariana had told us we couldn't even have that; should the hotel Quarantine Concierge reach out each evening to coordinate how guests which to take breakfast, none of that rudeness and embarrassment could possibly happen.

*Tea Longe Chandelier
Food: incredible courses, food prep, presentation AND taste of all the pastries
Service: Tim on a scale of 1 to 10 deserves a 13
Ambience: wonderful holiday festive area run by all top-notch servers pulling high service standards for each other

*Garden
Food: our 2 50 US dollar mulled wines were so sweet we couldn’t drink them but had to ask for water to dilute them (rendering them cold) and also felt the rush as we only had 20 minutes before they needed the table for Christmas Eve diners
Service: apt
Ambience: because of a rain shower while we drank, the umbrellas keep diners dry but the water floods inward from the edges of the restaurant.  Any packages we kept under the table, our dog, and other items like purses need to be constantly shifted to accommodate for the flowing water that becomes a walking and floor hazard before long.

Kerridge’s
Food: fish and chips are top notch and first rate; it’s a very upscale pub for beer and cider offerings, too!
Service: Roberto from Italy made a wonderful experience happen for us with our dog
Ambience: 2 sections: bar and restaurant allow one to choose formality feel; we love the chef’s dog’s pawprint as mascot logo and the pin on the staff’s uniforms",3,2022,01,03
143,Great hotel,"Great hotel, staff were really helpful and the room was stunning. Would definitely recommend Corinthia hotel. We stayed here for New Year’s Eve for a couple nights. Food was nice and the spa was really good nice place to chill and lot of options",5,2022,01,02
143,Christmas Stay,We stayed at the Corinthia for 3 days over Christmas and everything was pretty much faultless. Christmas Dinner was superb as was the accompanying service from The Northall staff (both bar and restaurant).  I don't think I've had a nicer Christmas pudding (prepared with a little theatre at the table). Housekeeping did a great job  with our room. We will definitely stay again -  hopefully that will include next Christmas!,5,2022,01,01
143,Corinthia,"Wow what a place, unbelievable spa facilities. It’s the best spa I’ve ever been to. We had luch also which was superb, the staff were amazing and so helpful and polite. Couldn’t recommend it enough. Can’t wait to go back in 2022!",5,2021,12,31
143,Sumptuous and opulent afternoon tea,"Probably one of the 'poshest' - and most expensive - afternoon teas I've had in a 5 star London hotel.

The tea is  taken in a central atrium off the lobby  which is quite formal and  elegant and opulent ( but not very cosy) . A piano player performs in the background. The Christmas decor was beautiful.

The tea itself was faultless and beautifully presented. The crockery and glassware was gorgeous. Excellent well filled sandwiches. Scones served in their own box. Refills of both provided if desired. Exquisite individual akes chosen from a wheeled trolley. Very good tea menu.

Really can't fault it. Although high end service was not pretentious and very friendly

Great choice for a special occasion. ",5,2021,12,26
143,Special occasion stay!,"We visited the hotel for three nights as a treat for my husband’s 50th birthday.

Having wanted to stay here for a number of years we decided to push the boat out for his special occasion!

I had requested early check in which was kindly accommodated and our room was a beautiful corner room.  I had arranged some special surprises in advance, being balloons and a cake, which were all ready in the room and added to the occasion.  The hotel had also kindly left a complimentary small bottle of champagne and card for him which added to the surprise.

We were in an executive room which we found to be comfortable and spacious with a fabulous bathroom and large walk in wardrobe.  We were surprised to find no pillow menu available although the reception lady did offer a soft or hard pillow which caused us some amusement!

We had daily access to the spa which we enjoyed each day for an hour.  It is a truly beautiful space and helped with our relaxing break.  Although it had to be pre-booked, due to covid, we found it was easily available on the day when we asked.  We were also surprised that the lift down to the spa wasn’t working throughout our stay which led to many steps up and down to the basement, as it’s quite a long way.

We found the staff to be pleasant and helpful throughout the hotel but sadly, the housekeeping/maintenance service was an area that we felt was lacking.  For the price point,  the small mistakes and things missing, are unnecessary.  

We found that even after raising issues they were not resolved which was frustrating.  Our toilet did not flush properly and remained this way.  We ate the cake I had arranged for our arrival, over the course of a couple of days, but the cutlery and plates for it were removed after the first day and not replaced, leaving us with no way to finish it easily…. Minor things but none the less annoying.

We also ate at the Kerridge’s Bar and Grill, which is within the hotel, and enjoyed our meal, although the drinks service was painfully slow and left us waiting half an hour for our drinks during the meal.

Overall, we had a fantastic stay and would love to visit again one day.",4,2021,12,19
143,"Brilliant stay, very accommodating",This is one of the best hotels we have stayed at. Supposed to be a couples weekend away but due to family having covid we wouldn’t leave the baby with anyone and therefore had to bring him. I called the hotel prior to arrival and they were very accommodating. I cannot fault a thing and I am a hotel snob. We have visited many and this hotel is by far our favourite so far. The little touches with gifts to our little one and even the turn down service with the lavender we’re all lovely touches. Everything was clean and restocked food was outstanding and we will definitely be returning again.,5,2021,12,13
143,Excellent Stay,"The hotel itself is beautifully styled and the rooms are really comfortable. The best thing about this hotel is the staff everyone we encountered were amazingly good at their jobs and really personable. 
Could not find a fault in our stay and we will definitely be booking a return visit.",5,2021,12,13
143,Classy Corinthia,"This review is in regards to a recent visit for afternoon tea in The Crystal Moon Lounge. 
I have, in recent years been lucky enough to stay in some of London’s most luxurious hotels (The Savoy/The Goring) The Corinthia is now most definitely on my never ending list of hotels to stay. 
From the moment you enter the modern grandeur & in particular the million pound chandelier overwhelm you. It is so tastefully decorated & furnished with friendly & welcoming staff. Even their Christmas decorations are tasteful & so very classy. 
As for afternoon tea (please see my separate review) it is no wonder the Corinthia comes out top on places to experience afternoon tea. 
Can’t wait to revisit & next time have the full experience of an  overnight stay.",5,2021,12,11
143,Best hotel in london,"The most amazing staff in all aspects of a stay.
Delicious breakfast lots of choices.
Really comfortable bed and a luxurious bathroom 
We can’t rate this hotel highly enough
Excellent room service. The Corinthia burger is yummy",5,2021,12,09
143,5 star Hotel with 7 star service 👏,"I've been blessed to stay in some of the best hotels around the world..this is up there as one of the very best. 
The hotel itself is beautiful with lavish rooms...the spa world class, the resturants some of the best in London however it is the staff from the GM Jochem Meijerink who went out of his way to send us a welcome note / Sam the resturant director and his amazing teams in the numerous resturants/bars ...right through to the front of house concierge/room service ...we have been overwhelmed by the level of service and general warmth which made our whole weekend even more special....
This hotel is simply a delight and if you want that special treat there is no better !!! 
",5,2021,12,05
143,High Tea,"I had a wonderful high tea with my friends. It was a great experience, everything was perfect. Ambience, service and, above all, the delicacies for tea were wonderful. Special thanks for having a great selection of gluten free items for one of my friends. We would be happy to come back ",5,2021,12,05
143,Just a stunning hotel and team in London,I have had the pleasure of staying here now on three occasions and I wish that could be more often. The people are the real difference though and it's obvious that the leadership team have a real eye for detail and creativity. Carry on doing what you do and keep the levels of service quality as they are and you will be the best in London for many years to come.,5,2021,12,04
143,Good for a staycation in London,"Corinthia hotel	

Location: close to Embarkment tube station, Charing cross and parliament.

Atmosphere: 5 star hotel with very nice modern interior – world class decoration and service.

Service: not many hotels in the world will offer this kind proactive service in all departments ranging from reception, room service and restaurants. I never had to ask for any service as they had been provided before asking for anything.

Facilities: restaurants, free wifi, high-end spa

Rooms: offer nice view over London, well designed modern rooms. You get what you pay for.

Restaurants: Northall, Garden. Both restaurants are very special and offer great food and service. The garden restaurant offered a lot of German type food and considering that it is end of November it was cold to sit outside. Infra red and an open fire helped to combat the cold in combination with sheep skin and a warm water bottle. These guys know how to make a customer happy.

Overall verdict: I rarely dish out a 5 star rating but in this case it is an easy decision.",5,2021,11,29
143,A birthday to remember,"Attentive , professional and genuine welcome  received by the doorman and Gloria on reception. Our suite was so elegant and very comfortable , we didn't want to leave it. Outstanding food and service from the teams in Northall and Kerridges restaurants , thank you all for making my birthday visit so memorable  !",5,2021,11,27
143,Spectacular hotel and staff,"Our sons kindly bought us a nights stay and lunch in Kerridges Bar & Grill for our birthdays last year but because if circumstances we had to delay. The staff were fabulous. Lucia the receptionist who booked us in was so lovely, smiley and welcoming. The bar staff were very attentive. The building is spectacular. We didn’t get a chance to sample their afternoon tea but will be put it on my list of things to do. Our room was comfortable, warm and clean with lovely complimentary toiletries. All in all a memorable stay. Thank you",5,2021,11,14
143,Beautiful Hotel & Great Staff!,"The hotel is beautiful and in a great location about a block from the Thames. The location is prime for seeing downtown London, such as Trafalgar Square, and Buckingham Palace. From the hotel it's a 2 1/2 mile relaxing walk along the Strand to Tower Bridge.
The hotel accommodations were of top quality with comfortable beds and daily housekeeping. The restaurants in the hotel are quite good with good food and excellent staff.  All were helpful and Sam, Marta and Rufat went above and beyond. The concierges were helpful and pleasant.  We dealt with David who was very accommodating. The spa was clean and invigorating.  I had an excellent massage there.  We plan on visiting London and staying at the Corinthia again.",5,2021,11,05
143,Top Notch Hotel,"From soup to nuts, the Corinthia London was one of the top five hotels we've stayed at in the world.  Service was exceptional.  The lobby is beautiful.  The restaurants epicurean.  The rooms palatial.  High recommend.  And will return again soon.",5,2021,11,05
143,Amazing hotel - the very best,"I stayed at the Corinthia yesterday for the first time in several years.  I was delighted to see that standards have absolutely been maintained despite the many issues over the recent period.  The team have many familiar and friendly faces and you quickly feel at home again.  Facilities are exceptional, the spa has limited time slots available but continues to provide the best haven for relaxation and pampering in London.  Kerridge's provided a lovely meal and the service was impeccable as ever.  I hope to be able to return at the earliest opportunity to experience this splendid hotel again",5,2021,11,04
143,Afternoon tea,"My friend and I decided to have a late birthday celebration here and went for an afternoon tea. The experience started off great, with our amazing and attentive server. Sandwiches were yummy and they got replenished. The scone and jam is one of the best I've had (I've had so many afternoon teas in London). The pattiserie was amazing too. Luckily the booking after us got cancelled so we were able to enjoy the experience for longer. The reason I've marked down is that we for a very long time were left unattended. We asked for drinks and after half an hour we still didn't receive them. We had to refill our own tea and never asked if we wanted more etc. Was such a shame as the service started well but went downhill and we felt neglected and it was difficult to even get the attention of the staff. This did spoil it for us slightly.
However, for the quality of food and the fact my friend and I enjoyed each others company again it is somewhere I would recommend. We are already planning our next trip here.",4,2021,10,30
143,Amazing stay at (easily) one of London’s best,"Visited for my birthday and absolutely absolutely loved this hotel. It was one of those idealistic stays one hopes for where nothing goes wrong (which never really happens), and honestly can say the stay was seamless. The other reviews are true, all of the staff are kind, welcoming, and genuinely seem interested in you/ making your stay a comfortable one. On my first night there (having left another hotel that was not going to work out for me), I was received with a warm welcome from Anise (sp?) and Bernardo. Thank you both, you are obviously lovely people from both in and outside of your jobs, the Corinthia is fortunate to have you. My room (a deluxe king) was very nicely apportioned for a solo traveler (although we had discussed an executive suite, this was honestly perfectly sized); I love the way it is set up with the bedroom walled off from the sizeable bathroom, and even a decent-sized walk-in closet. My view from the 6th floor was really nice, and I even had a glimpse of the London Eye :). Tried a number of the restaurants and they were stellar — and yet not exhorbitantly priced though given quality… rally could be — Kerridge’s was absolutely amazing, and the Garden (tried with friends) was also very nice — a covered courtyard (yes!) that was decorated for fall/ winter — just beautiful. And the spa! This multi-country spa goer definitely approves. The amenities (pools, sauna etc) are stellar; a lot of treatments were not available so I recommend booking early — maybe a week out, I only did so three days before when I checked in. In sum, thank you to the Corinthia team and the lovely setup you have there. Will definitely be back!",5,2021,10,30
143,Fantastic Birthday Afternoon Tea!,"My mum and I visited the hotel for afternoon tea yesterday and wow what an experience! 

From the moment we walked in we were greeted with smiles and warm welcomes from all the staff.

We were served by Giacomo who was absolutley brilliant, kind, friendly and very attentive! I particulary really enjoyed the green tea and asked if I could buy some, he said it wasnt available yet to buy but arranged for some of the tea bags to be placed into a takeaway back so I could take it home and enjoy it there to. Every time I have some I will think of that amazing afternoon in the Crystal lounge so thank you Giacomo!! 

He then arranged for us to have a table in the Alpine Garden after the afternoon tea. He handed us over to yet another fantastic table host Paride. Paride chatted us to whilst always making sure our glasses were never empty. 
He even didn’t mind taking some photos of us (3 or 4 for that matter!) so thank you so much Paride we did not stop laughing for the whole afternoon! 

The whole experience was fantastic and the Corinthia is truly beautiful. Thank you once again to Giacomo & Paride for your truly professional service and making sure we had the best afternoon possible from start to finish! We will definitley be recommending to all our family and friends :)",5,2021,10,23
143,special birthday,"My friend had one of the big 0 birthdays in August so I booked the Corinthia for afternoon tea.We thought the atmosphere was lovely, very calm, beautiful decor especially the chandelier, the meaning of the red crystal was explained to us. The young staff who served us were so friendly and attentive without being overbearing.And the food ... amazing, full of flavour, so well prepared especially the sandwiches which were room temperature not cold from a fridge and curled at the edges, the scones were warm and the cakes were works of art.As we were being served champagne I mentioned we were there for my friends birthday treat and before we had finished eating a small birthday cake with candle appeared, a lovely surprise. We had travelled from Wales and Kent and was definitely worth it, we hope to repeat the memorable experience in the future, thankyou so much.

  ",5,2021,10,23
143,Marvelous,"Our family visited the hotel for afternoon tea today.
We absolutley loved the warm atmosphere and lovely staff. 
We thank the whole team and especially Giacomo, who hosted us.  He works in a very professional and friendly manner.",5,2021,10,18
143,"Television not working and withering flowers, disappointed.","Television did not work in my room. 

I booked for a special birthday occasion for one night I wasn’t aware of this until later in the evening when returning to my room from a theatre trip and having drinks in the hotel bar. 

Withering Flowers were placed in the room but after informing the manager he wasn’t sure if they were part of the room package. 

My overall experience would of been exceptional but this was disappointing.",3,2021,10,18
143,London Calling for our Wedding Anniversary,"Wedding anniversary visit and our 1st time. We took advantage of the ‘London Calling’ package and weren’t disappointed. The service, the room and the stay were all exceptional. We will happily return. ",5,2021,10,07
143,Just wow! My favourite so far.,"Wow this hotel is amazing! We loved it and have booked another trip for a special occasion in December. The reception when you walk in is gorgeous, as is the rest of the hotel and restaurants. We visited during COVID times and everything was fine and organised.
We booked a deluxe room which was lovely. The only issue was the curtains had dropped on one side from the rail. I only mention this because the price is quite expensive and for this level of hotel you expect perfection. We didn’t actually notice this until our second day and therefore did not mention it to staff, however I am sure that if we had, it would have been sorted straight away.
We ate at the Northall restaurant which was lovely. We couldn’t get booked into Kerridges but we did have a drink in the bar.
Everything about the hotel is great - it is grand, luxurious and in a fab location. I think this is my favourite hotel in London. It’s pricey but if you can afford it as a treat for a special occasion, you won’t be disappointed.",5,2021,10,07
143,Exceptional Hotel,"If I had only one trip left in my life to enjoy-I would return to the Corinthia. It is stunning property with unrivaled service to match.  The traditional English breakfast buffet was delicious and perfectly presented each morning.  There is an abundance of service, concierge and desk personnel which isn't the case everywhere post Covid. Our rooms were beautifully appointed, the spa was exceptional and tea time was such a esteemed event.  I think the daily floral displays should be the basis for my dreams. Just perfect in every way.",5,2021,09,26
143,50th Birthday,Had such a lovely afternoon tea which was delicious. The sandwiches and cakes were excellent and so was the service. The pianist was brilliant too and what a lovely man. Played Happy birthday and some of our favourite tunes on request. Altogether a lovely afternoon treat from my best friend. Would highly recommend.,5,2021,09,17
143,Best hotel in London,"I absolutely adored my stay at the Corinthia and already dream about when I can go back. We stayed for our wedding anniversary and from the moment we arrived we were made to feel welcomed and valued. The difficult last 18 months of the pandemic was left at the door and true relaxing and luxury could begin! Reasons why I really think this is the best hotel in london-
1) room size - brilliant rooms and so gorgeous 
2) the bath! It’s so lovely to have a bath in every room option at the Corinthia and they have a tv at the end for true relaxing! Great shower too and lots of space. 
3) the spa - its AMAZING. It’s like booking a spa break. Relaxing, stunning, you can’t want for anything. Relaxation pods. Huge changing rooms. Fantastic gym.  Espa products are incredible and it’s the best hotel spa in london for sure. At the moment there is a one hour limit for residents each day in the thermal area, but if you have a treatment you can stay a bit longer and they always help you where they can. You can change in your room and go down to the spa in your robe and slippers via the spa lift, once you are back in the room the staff are just a phone call away to bring up dry robes again for lounging about your room in! 
4) the beds - divine - I could sleep forever 
5) the breakfast- it’s truly delicious 
6) all the personal touches to make the stay extra special such as the Happy anniversary little cake they made for us.

For the price point you can’t find anything better in my opinion.  It really is perfection and if you haven’t been and are looking for a hotel of this level I would heartily recommend you pick The Corinthia. A really special place indeed.",5,2021,09,17
143,Excellent Hotel for a couple of days in London,"Great location, lovely room and fabulous Spa. had a great visit to London and the Corinthia made it so much better - great service and food. Will be back next time we are in London. At the high end on price but worth it",5,2021,09,15
143,Excellent all round,From check in to check out the service we received was excellent. All staff are very friendly and willing to help when ever needed. We stayed in a suite booking the 'London Calling' package which is very good value. The breakfast in the Northall was excellent and we also enjoyed afternoon tea in the Crystal Moon Lounge - I can thoroughly recommend both.  We used the Thermal Spa floor twice and can  recommend that as well. Overall we enjoyed our stay and will definitely be returning again. Thank you to everyone at the Corinthia for making our stay so special.,5,2021,09,14
143,Cocktails at the Corinthia hotel,"Popped into the Corinthia for cocktails after watching the excellent TV program about the hotel, we were made so welcome by staff and Andre from the bar showed us round the ground floor of the hotel, we also caught a glimpse of the CEO Thomas which made our visit complete, stunning hotel , going to start saving so we can stay there for our 30th wedding anniversary in a few years time, thank you all so much x",5,2021,09,13
143,Weekend away,"Just stayed at the Corinthia hotel, London for the second time. Pity that for the use of the spa was limited to 1 hour slots and the only slot available on the Sunday was 7am - not very 5 star. Not sure whether this was due COVID but if not, I won’t be staying again or recommending this hotel.",1,2021,09,12
143,Fantastic afternoon team with friends,"Great location, lovely room underneath the chandeliers. Tea, sandwiches, cakes, champagne all fantastic with very good service. £332 for four, might seem a lot but for a special occasion it really was worth it. Would happily spend another Sunday afternoon there.",5,2021,09,12
143,Good Stay,"We enjoyed our stay at the Corinthia hotel. The staff were very friendly, we went for a birthday and they had left us a birthday cake in the room which was lovely. We were slightly disappointed on two occasions, as we weren't told exactly how to gain access to the spa which meant we were wondering about different lifts. The second was that the turndown wasn't done at the time asked nor did the cups/milk get refilled which meant we had to call room service. Not the end of the world, however, the amount you pay we expected a little more. 
Overall, a good stay but not sure we would return.",4,2021,09,12
143,"Violeta, a great ambassador for Corinthia!","I have visited a number of times recently and I can say that the lounge area to be a relaxing place to start or end my day as the hotel itself is very close to many central London's attractions.
Service from Violeta is always warm and positive, so much so that my friends will go out of their way to come down if they know she is there. :)",5,2021,09,11

privatedining@kerridgesbarandgrill.co.uk
the day could not have been better. The room was amazing, the staff superb and the food wonderful. Anna was our host and she deserves a particular mention, for her skill in making everyone in such a wide age range feel special. Super memories of a fantastic day. Thank you",5,2021,09,09
143,Business lunch,"I met colleagues for a business lunch. We sat at the bar section. Service was very good. The ambiance is excellent for drinks, high tea or lunch. It is located very centrally in London and close to everywhere. Next time I visit, I plan to stay there.",4,2021,09,08
143,Staying at Corinthia,"We had a great stay at the Corinthia. Since we had to holiday in the UK we looked for nice hotels close to theatres in London and the Corinthia is decorated very well, smells nice, has spacious rooms and friendly staff.",5,2021,09,07
143,Family Celebration at The Corinthia Hotel/Kerridge’s Bar and Grill,"I organised a birthday celebration at The Corinthia Hotel with a  family meal at Kerridges.
All the hotel staff were extremely welcoming and incredibly helpful. They were polite and very professional.
Although we had an issue with one of our rooms this was resolved by the hotel manager the following day.
We had a  super celebration meal in The Private Dining at Kerridge’s and we were looked after wonderfully by Anne -  no need was too great.  The Private Dining Room was perfect for our requirements. 
The breakfast was fabulous and would definitely return for a further visit",4,2021,09,06
143,Fabulous city hotel,The location of this hotel is central to most attractions. I celebrated my belated 35th birthday and I was amazed by the level and quality of service I received. It is simply one of the best city hotels. It gives you the feeling of a resort. The spa is also a bonus. Thanks to all the team.,5,2021,09,04
143,Could easily have been 2 stars not 3,"This has to go down as one of my most disappointing hotel stays ever.  Nothing major happened to make the stay so poor, Spa aside however everything was simply poor.  If it had not been for the fact the hotel refunded 1 night of the 3 nights as way of apology and thus taking belated responsibility it would have been 2 stars not 3.

The public areas of the hotel are very nicely looked after and certainly looks and feels like a luxury hotel.  Checkin however was not so smooth or professional, they were having issues which delayed the process and took some time but eventually got the keys.

Room 1 - We had booked a room with a King bed, upon arrival to the room not only was it 2 Twins pushed together, they were badly pushed together with no topper to covert the gap, further the bedding was so badly done it looked like someone may have slept in the bed already (to be clear no one had, it simply appeared this way).  While frustrating a 'luxury' hotel is selling twins pushed together with no topper the real disapointment was the state of the bed.  So back down to reception to change rooms.

Room 2: The bed was a king in this room so that was better, but it still looked like it had barely been made.  Add to the fact that the duvet didn't fit the bed and it was not exactly screaming luxury, more Premier Inn, in fact I can say I cannot remember any hotel I have ever stayed in where the beds were made to such a poor standard.  They did change the duvet for the correct one, although on the final day the small one reappeared for the last night, at which point we couldnt be bothered to get it changed.
Add to this the rooms look dated and furnituired marked and walls could do with painting and overall the room felt very much like they needed refurbishment.
The good news is the bathroom was much better and very good water pressure in the shower so that was a plus.

The Spa - It should be said the spa is stunning and the staff professional.  The only issue with this was due to Covid restrictions you were only allowed to book 1  slot ahead of arrival and I had been advised you could book the other slots once you arrive.  It turns out that actually you can request on the day you want the slot, but not in advance, meaning you cannot plan your days.  I can understand this, but the fact I was mis informed when I specifically asked what the situation is was frustrating.  Thankfully it did get resolved as they booked me a second slot as apology for the state of the room.

Breakfast - This was probably the most disappointing thing, the setting is lovely and at weekends they use the bar area as well, which is where we chose to sit for two of the days as it was more peaceful that the main restuaarnt which was just chaos.  The service was hit and miss, always friendly but breakfastw ould turn up with items missing or incorrectly cooked which was bad enough but what really struck us was the poor quality of ingredients.  At any truely luxury hotel they use high quality ingredients not simply catering suppliers and I am afraid here you could be at any 4 stay hotel in London, really was not good at comapred to other London hotels.

The Garden Restuarant - This alongside the spa was the best part of the stay, service was good, food of good quality and fresh.    We would resturn here.

Crystal Moon Lounge - We had drinks here in the evening as the main Bar was closed and Northall was so loud we couldnt hear ourselves think let alone talk.  The setting is stunning, the pours however that are said to be 125ml are frankly maybe 100ml and what was most funny is they didn't either bother to match the pours, so one glass maybe had 100-110 and the other 90-100ml. Suffice to say we didnt get a second drink or return the following evening.

Excluding the Spa and the public areas there was simply nothing luxury about this stay.  Staff were all polite but until checkout it never felt like they cared, simple things like requests for Ice needed making multiple times.  On checkout I detailed the issued and it was taken seriously and we were given a refund of 1 night, which did make the overall stay feel a little more like value for money and was suggested if we returned they would upgrade us further.  
We debated returning but the issue is there were just to many issues, some clearly choices by the hotel management rather than just unfortnate occurances.  With stays recently at another hotel in London that really does know how to be luxury there is just appeal to us to return.  It is just not up to the standard for the rates it charges and is somewhat off the pace of the top hotels in London.",3,2021,08,31
143,Immaculate,"My aim for my night away was to get the best service I could find in London and I was not disappointed. 

Overall, an excellent stay and immaculate service throughout all parts of the hotel. Not once did anything slip!

Highlights 
- staff and service are immaculate 
- style is modern, luxurious and comfortable - every space is one you want to stay in 
- facilities are excellent - fully equipped spa, restaurants, bars plus chocolates in reception 
- attention to detail everywhere 
- flowers throughout are excellent

My husband and I are debating whether this is our favourite ever hotel stay… competing for the top spot with The Residence (Dubai) or the Ceylon Tea Trails (Sri Lanka)… we joked we wanted ‘Dubai style’ service in London and this place is not far off that. 

As a complete nitpicking traveller (when I’m paying for a top end hotel), the ONLY thing I found here were some missing curtain hooks 😂😂😂 
For anyone else like me, some details I liked were decent sized glasses for juice at breakfast, great sized towels (from a female view), awesome room slippers (maybe the best I’ve had) and robes, TV in the bathroom, easy light switches and all operable from the bed. One thing I loved when we checked in was being asked what time we wanted our turndown service. I also liked the fact the mini bar had some fun stuff in it (cola cubes!) and the room service menu looked good too. Just little surprises to tempt you. 

I will certainly return. Thank you for making a memorable stay for us. Our first night away since Covid was a wonderful one.",5,2021,08,28
143,CORINTHIA LONDON,"From the deco to the staff The Corinthia London has got it's game right. Lunch at The Garden Restaurant  was a lovely experience, the staff were great.  The food pesentation was spot on. It felt like a visit to someones home more than a visit to a hotel.

143,The most beautiful hotel,"The most beautiful hotel we have ever had the pleasure of staying at, we were just blown away with the attention to detail. The team could not have been more helpful and welcoming from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. The spa was extremely relaxing and just added to the amazing facilities available at the hotel, we just can’t wait to book another stay!",5,2021,08,26
143,Graduation present,"My daughter and myself arrived for a 2night stay at The Corinthia, we were warmly welcomed and allocated a twin room as requested.  The room was actually quite small so I asked could we have something larger with two queen beds.  The reception staff could not have been nicer, changing our room immediately to a wonderful large room with a balcony.  Fabulous bar with great cocktails, had lunch in the Garden restaurant, again so nice .  We used the spa for a few hours and honestly one of the nicest spas ever.  All the staff from reception, bar , housekeeping were welcoming and just seemed happy that we were happy !! Great job and can’t wait to return.",5,2021,08,25
143,Excellent Hotel - Superb Customer Service.,"The Corinthia Hotel in London hosted both the Wedding, reception and evening celebrations for our Son and his fiancé it a memorable and beautiful day recently. In addition many of the guests and friends also had the privilege of staying for one or two nights in extremely elegant and stylish Suites or high quality bedrooms.
The service from all members of the hotel staff and employees from reception through to those we met during the two days was exemplary and demonstrated the highest standard one could ever wish for.
Excellent food was served and everyone felt at eased to the assistance from the hotel's staff.",5,2021,08,22
143,Afternoon Tea,"Afternoon Tea - we went as a family for afternoon tea, one  of us has a peanut allergy and all food was suitable which is was very unusually and so refreshing. Lovely room with a pianist in the background. Food was excellent and lots of it. Quite expensive but was for a special occasion, I’ve been to afternoon tea in London hotels a few times and don’t remember service being added to the set price so you should factor this in.",5,2021,08,22
143,Absolutely outstanding,"Stayed for one night and it was absolutely wonderful. The level of service and detail at every turn is perfect. Beautiful, spacious, comfortable rooms, great restaurants and bars. A stunning spa. In a great location. Worth every penny.",5,2021,08,21
143,We wouldn't stay anywhere else in London!,"I was so happy to be back to The Corinthia to celebrate my 50th birthday. The staff could not have been more welcoming and attentive. On arrival we were upgraded to a Junior Suite. The Suite was very spacious and beautiful, it had 2 balconies with a great view. A complimentary birthday cake and a bottle of Champagne on ice were awaiting us on check in. The bed was huge and very comfortable, I loved the lavender bag on the pillow in the evening turndown service, such a nice touch). 
The marble bathroom was beautiful with a large bathtub, tv, tropical rain shower and underfloor heating.
On this occasion we did not use one of the restaurants downstairs, but we ordered from the Room Service,  it was delicious! 
The English Breakfast was  to die for,  loved the carrot juice, great quality ingredients: sausage, eggs, black pudding, butter etc...yum!  
And as a French native, I also did enjoy very much the delicious pain au chocolat and croissant (the cinnamon roll was excellent too).  Thank you to everyone at The Corinthia for making my birthday so special. 
We can't wait to be back for another staycation. 
While I was still in my Suite, I have already booked our next stay for this coming  December, we are so looking forward to it.",5,2021,08,20

143,Fabulous !,"The Corinthia is absolutely charming in every respect and with out doubt holds a 5 star rating if not higher in my opinion.

The hotel itself is luxurious/grand without being pretentious, all the people you meet are so professional and will do their upmost to ensure your stay is a happy one.
The rooms are superb and the beds/linen so comfortable ! 

Choice to dine is excellent with three restaurants of varying taste and the foyer a delight to relax in.",5,2021,08,19

This is an amazing hotel with a wonderful vibe, special thanks to Violeta and Barbara for making our experience wonderful. Champagne, Sandwiches, Scones and Cake what more could you want. 

A great vibe, pianist playing in the background, surrounded by people having fun.

Thanks The Corinthia team for making this a very special occasion",5,2021,08,19
143,"Wow, just Wow","We had an amazing 24 hours at The Corinthia recently celebrating our wedding anniversary. We did get a little upgrade but I am not going to elaborate on that. Night 1 in London we stayed at The Shangri La at The Shard which my wife and I felt was amazing. However, the next day we landed at The Corinthia for our celebration weekend and `wow, just wow`. Service, elegance, afternoon tea, Spa and massage, dinner at Kerridges, staff, rooms, ambiance everything was truly exceptional. We are lucky enough to travel and eat well and have to say that out of all the hotels we have been too in the world, The Corinthia is absolutely now our number 1 and we will certainly be back! If you are thinking of booking, do not hesitate.",5,2021,08,17
143,Magnificent 5* Hotel,"Everything about this magnificent hotel oozes 5* luxury, from the initial welcome you receive, the wonderful fragrance throughout all the public areas, the amazing, friendly yet professional service to the overall experience this beautiful hotel provides.
The accommodations are beautiful, functional and give you every conceivable luxury you need, the Northall bar is a fab venue for pre dinner drinks and the spa is just on a different scale/level, literally. Housed way below ground the 'Thermal Suite' is simply incredible. Free of charge for all hotel guests, the pool, the huge thermal bath, the steam room and sauna epitomise the very height of luxury and is a welcome addition to all the other services they provide. The only extra cost would be for any treatments you decide to book.
My wife and I spent 3 nights celebrating our wedding anniversary and frankly we couldn't have found a better hotel to celebrate it in if we had tried, there was nothing to complain about at all!
We are already discussing a future visit and would highly recommend this great hotel to anyone that appreciates 5* hotels. Probably one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in....and we have stayed in quite a few!",5,2021,08,17

143,Afternoon tea with great service,"My friend and I booked this as our first face to face meeting. We had been Zooming throughout lockdown and met through work. For us both  this was our first visit to the Corinthia and our first trip to London from our respective homes in over 18 months. 
The whole experience was delightful, service impeccable and professional - without being too intrusive.
The scones and Rhubarb jam were to die for and in our opinion, the stand out. 
We both took home what was left for other halve’s to eat. 
Thank you for allowing us to stay a little longer due to a late arrival due to trains etc. 
Please thank all of the staff for making this a memorable  visit - we will be back.",5,2021,08,14
143,Tony,We stayed at the Corinthia for 3 nights and it was amazing. The staff went over and above in everything they did. We had 2 shows cancelled due to COVID and Gael managed to get us tickets to Phantom which was amazing. Over and above was normal in their eyes. Would highly recommend.,5,2021,08,12
143,Luxurious London Stay and The Corinthia will not disappoint,"Thank you to all of the staff who could not do enough for us on our recent stay at this outstanding London hotel.  The quality and attention to detail to meet every need is worthy of a 5 star rating.  The experience was uplifting and unforgettable.  We arrived and did not leave.  You don't need to! 
We watched the Channel 4 programme on Luxurious hotels of the world.  It is now very clear why it makes the cut. Other top London hotels could learn some of the graces and etiquette bestowed by Corinthia.",5,2021,08,10
143,Consistently outstanding ,"The Corinthia delivers on every level. Full Stop! Service is consistently outstanding, the rooms and public areas lavish, the cuisine delicious. Not a hint of stuffiness or pretentiousness.

It’s price point is incredible, compared to other hotels of its class. 

Do use the spa, surely up there with the absolute best? And do take time out to enjoy the most sumptuous of afternoon teas.

It has become my “London” must stay hotel.

Thank you ",5,2021,08,10
143,Best 5 star in London (and I've been to most),"We chose the Corinthia Hotel, unknown to me before this stay, after pricing my past 5-star favorites. We booked The Corinthia for value honestly, but it outshines them all in luxury and service and detail. I am blown away by it, and it’s comparably reasonable price point, and cannot believe I've missed it until now. It is my new favorite in London, and we will go nowhere else in the foreseeable future. The consistency and standard of the hospitality training is exceptional, and they manage to add the friendliest of touches to everything. My wife, famous for putting the concierge staff through their paces, is completely overwhelmed by their consistent and exceptional help. Our family of four is completing our week-long stay, and all are sad to leave. Owing most to an extraordinary staff, it quickly becomes ‘home.’ Whoever does the hiring and hospitality training at this hotel is brilliant. Also, the rooms are spacious and beautifully appointed. The common areas, restaurants and bars are all equally exceptional. This place is amazing.",5,2021,08,09
143,Thank you again,"We have just returned from a two day trip to London with our two children and staid at the Corinthia. 
Absolutely outstanding service from start to finish.

Best hotel in London by a country mile, thank you.",5,2021,08,08
143,Staff make the hotel,"We booked a Spa break staying Saturday night and our stay was excellent. What stood out was the friendly and extremely helpful staff.
When we arrived we were checked in and shown to our room by the lovely Martina, who made us feel so welcome. She was both friendly and professional. Even when she accidentally slipped on the stairs and fell, she still managed to maintain her composure - 10 out of 10.",5,2021,08,08
143,Fantastic stay!,"We originally booked Saturday and Sunday night to have a little staycation, we then decided Friday afternoon we would need to stay Friday night as well.

The service from the time we called and started the booking through to our check out on Monday was excellent !

We pretty much stayed in the hotel for most of the days so ate in Kerridges (phenomenal service and food was incredible ) and the claridges tea which i would highly recommend to anyone staying there or even if you just want to go for tea was amazing and super filling (we just had a very light bite for dinner later)

The spa - and i go to a lot - is one of the best spas in london hands down! My massage was amazingg , the layout of the spa is so calming and their thermal pools and sauna is the perfect place to unwind.

We chatted to a lot of the staff who were always smiley , friendly and very helpful with anything we needed.

it was a very needed staycation and the hotel went above and beyond! 

thank you Corinthia we will definitely be back :)

Thank you to everyone that made my birthday celebrations, one I will never forget.",5,2021,08,03
143,Wonderful couple's weekend in London,"From start to finish this was a 5 star visit. We had the ""London Calling"" package that included valet parking, early check-in, late check-out, champagne in the room, upgraded room, spa access, breakfast and £100 hotel credit. The room was amazingly comfortable and luxurious and I've never seen such wonderful bathroom. We had everything we could possibly want including extra special touches for the birthday we celebrated. The staff can't do enough for you and the hotel is in one of the best locations in London - near to everything and easy to get to. We used the hotel credit towards afternoon tea in the Crystal Lounge and the service was very attentive and the cakes and food were delicious! The spa is wall-to-wall marble and lots of space to relax. We will definitely be going back - we have stayed in 4 other Corinthia properties over the years and they are all great but this one is exceptional. THANK YOU",5,2021,08,02
143,Exceptional service - highly professional staff.,"We would like to thank one of the hotel restaurant staff, very attentive gentlemen Rufat who delighted our breakfast with sensational service. He was great at listening to us with due diligence and conducted himself at excellent professional standards all the time with a very friendly manner, positive attitude, was always kind and smiling. Rufat suggested and offered us the great breakfast options to choose from, leaving us with full satisfactory and very special memories of our stay at the top class hotel Corinthia. The high quality of the service encourages returning to this place again and we will be looking forward to it. We highly recommend visiting luxury Corinthia to people who value their time and expect exceptional service.

143,Probably the best hotel in London,"This was my fifth stay at Carinthia and the experience reinforced my view that this is, in my humble opinion, the best hotel in London and possibly the best hotel I’ve stayed at in the world. 

The quality and attention of a staff he is one of the elements the marks out Corinthia as a superlative hotel. The interior is modern, fresh and subtly luxurious without being over the top. It was only a short trip this time so I didn’t eat in but I can heartily recommend the restaurants too.",5,2021,08,01
143,Absolutely stunning,"So lucky to be surprised by hubby with a nights stay at The Corinthia. Treated so well by every  staff member, made to feel really special. Had lunch at Kerridges. Loved the look, the ambiance & food exceptional. 
Room, standard, was beautiful with a little balcony (lovely in the evening heat), huge bed, plenty of furniture, functional hallway and really big bathroom. Just such class. 
Have stayed at Corinthia Budapest which was stunning but for me Corinthia London has the edge. I can’t wait to return.",5,2021,07,31
143,Marvellous Mini Break,"My daughter & I stayed at the Corinthia Hotel this week in need of a short break! Fantastic staff, amazing food and the rooms are beautiful. The main reason we keep returning is the personal touch the hotel staff give you, always attentive, kind and helpful.
The Northall bar/ restaurant is superb!! Can’t wait to return ❤️",5,2021,07,31
143,The best hotel in London,"Everything about the Corinthia is outstanding. Easily the best hotel in London. Rooms, food, location and service are amazing. The staff can’t do enough and look after you from start to finish and add extra treats.
The food at Kerridges bar and grill was superb along with the wine. Thank you so so much!",5,2021,07,31

143,A hotel and experience you cannot fault,"Fantastic stay at The Corinthia from everything to the spa, in room dining, cocktail bar and their delightful turn down service. Every part of our stay was a 5 star experience and we will most definitely be returning. Unfortunately we were unable to dine at Kerridges bar & grill but look forward to hopefully securing a table on our next visit. If you are looking for an incredible hotel experience The Corinthia is the place for it.",5,2021,07,30
143,Exceptional Hotel,"As regular visitors to Corinthia we could not wait to book our return stay after Lockdown 3. From the moment we walked into the hotel my heart lifted and it felt so lovely to be back. All of the staff are so welcoming and helpful and the hotel itself is just jaw droppingly beautiful. The personalised service and touches are what makes this hotel stand out and it was such a wonderful surprise to receive a hand written 'welcome back' note from Thomas Kochs in our room, together with a delicious cake. 
The spa is second to none and even though we had to book specific time slots due to Covid restrictions this was done with ease and we enjoyed an hour of pure relaxation on both days of our stay. 
When we stay at Corinthia we never leave the hotel! Why would we?! Having dined in the Garden twice already this year and thoroughly enjoyed it we booked to have lunch here on both the Saturday and Sunday. The ambience is beautiful, just like dining in the Mediterranean, and the food is amazing, particularly the vegetarian choices and the delicious bread and welcoming cocktail to start. The real gem in this restaurant however has to be Alessio, who goes above and beyond to make sure your dining experience is a special one. He remembered us from previous visits to Corinthia and welcomed us back with his huge smile and attentive service. We will certainly be dining there again this year and cannot wait to be greeted by Alessio and the team.
We also dined at Kerridges with some friends and we were all impressed with the ambience, food and service. Love the decor and vibe of this restaurant.
Having stayed at several 5 star luxury hotels in London we have now decided that we will look no further than Corinthia. This really is the most amazing hotel and the exceptional team, and personalised service, led by the truly brilliant Thomas Kochs,  is what makes it stand out from the crowd. We have already booked our next stay and will continue to return to make many more happy memories. Thank you for making us feel so special and for everything you do.",5,2021,07,29
143,A gem in the heart of the city.,"Having recently stayed at The Savoy in London and been disappointed with the room and service,  I was hopeful of a better experience at The Corinthia and they did not not disappoint. What a contrast! We stopped in an Executive Room which is one up from a standard Deluxe. The room was very spacious, light and bright. The bed was extremely comfortable.  Small touches such as complimentary sweetie jar and lavender on your pillow at night were lovely. The service at reception was impeccable and nothing was too much trouble. The location is ideal and Trafalgar Square is only a few minutes walk away. Guests may use the pool and thermal suite facilities and I highly recommend this. It’s a lovely place to unwind. I would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay there again.",5,2021,07,29
143,First time stay,"First time staying at the Corinthia for my wife’s 40th birthday. I have to say that we have stayed in many top hotels in the uk and around the world but never at a luxury hotel like the Corinthia for this reason I was a little apprehensive about staying here.Any anxiety or apprehensiveness I had disappeared as soon as we entered. I am pretty sure we were treated just like any other guest at the hotel with exemplary customer service and where nothing was a problem. From the staff at the door, reception to the waiters from the little extra touches like the birthday cake for my wife at afternoon tea and the cake in the room absolutely fabulous. There is not one member of staff that I could pick out they were all fantastic making you feel at home and relaxed. My wife used the spa and found that to be an experience she will never forget, the only downside for her was not being able to catch a glimpse or meet Mr Thomas kochs other than that I can’t recommend the Corinthia enough. Thank you all for making my wife’s birthday an experience we will never forget.

The staff are wonderful, the hotel rooms are perfect, the spa it out of this world and the location is second to none.

143,Special stay,"If you are looking to stay at the best Hotel in London look no further. Every member of staff went above and beyond what you’d expect from a 5 star Hotel. 
I’d come from a 2 day stay at another top hotel outside of London and was instantly blown away by the service in comparison. 
The Corinthia is the benchmark every other Hotel should aspire to be, top class can’t wait to visit again.",5,2021,07,25
143,Exquisite Hotel,"Having had our summer holiday cancelled for the second time, we decided to treat ourselves to a night at the Corinthia on a recent trip to London. Many luxury hotels are missing their foreign travelers and there are currently some amazing offers for hotels that wouldn't always be affordable. Our offer included breakfast, restaurant credit, a bottle of champagne in our room, early check in, late check out and room upgrade if available. We were upgraded and our room was the size of a small flat, immaculately presented with so many thoughtful touches and treats. The bed was like sleeping on a cloud! The spa was spectacular. We hoped to eat at Kerridge's  but it was fully booked so we ate at Northall and our meal was amazing, the chocolate and cherry desert was one of the best I've ever had. Like many top hotels though what set this hotel apart was the service, greeted at the door, bags whisked away appearing within minutes in the room, attentive waiters, bar staff and sommelier, we were treated like royalty. After our wonderful dinner we went back to the room to find the beds turned down and lavender sachets left on the pillow to promote a restful nights sleep, we didn't want to leave. Well done to the team at  Corinthia, these are difficult times for hospitality and we will certainly be back.",5,2021,07,24
143,Fabulous stay,"If ever I dreamed of  a classic, stylish  hotel stay it was brought into reality today.

The corinthia is a beautiful, charming hotel! I cannot recommend a stay enough. The staff, oh the staff! All fabulous and attentive. Ollie in kerridges bar was fab, he offered insight into the menu and has since converted my “go to drink” thank you for the memories!!

143,Disappointed :(,"We chose the Corinthia London for our wedding stay. Based on its world class reputation, we were disappointed upon arrival with the condition of the room (thick dust everywhere). 
For a 5 star hotel, we were also surprised that there was no doormen to greet us daily at the entrance and for the hefty price tag, hoped for a more personalised experience given the special occasion (just a sad dry piece of cake left on the table on our wedding night). 
Sad to say, that we have stayed in better 3/4 star hotels :(",3,2021,07,22
143,Brilliant Hotel.,"Stayed here as a couple post-lockdown 3.0. The hotel didn’t disappoint in any aspect. The room and service were impeccable - we booked so that we could check in early and leave late to maximise our time in London. 

The staff were incredibly attentive and nothing was a problem for them. The room was upgraded for us and for central London was a great size. Everything we needed was included including a bottle of LP for when we arrived. 

In terms of location we could walk to places such as Leicester Sq, Mayfair etc so geographically it was perfect. 

We will definitely stay here again.",5,2021,07,19
143,Utterly out of this world!,"Where do I even start! I’d dreamt of after noon tea at the Corinthia for about 5 years and finally got the opportunity to go for my birthday. From the moment we walked in I knew we were somewhere special. The smell of their in house florist working away and the staff laying tables for afternoon tea. 

The main room where you have your tea is utterly breathtaking. The tea was outstanding and the sandwiches and sweet bits were unbelievable. I don’t have words to say how good they were. I worried that there was more hype and it wouldn’t live up to its reputation but it genuinely exceeded all expectations.

Staff are attentive and so warm. Alastair was just a delight and it was extra special when the pianist played the Proclaimers 500 miles for me when he found out I was from Scotland! He also told the staff it was my birthday and they gave me a beautiful cake and candle. To top it off they helped my partner get a single pink rose to present to me. I honestly couldn’t praise it more. We have decided we want to come back to stay! 

Thank you so much for making my birthday so special! ❤️",5,2021,07,18
143,Beautiful champagne afternoon tea,"I’ve been wanting to visit the Corinthia for a very long time. I was kindly gifted a gift voucher for a champagne afternoon tea for my 30th last year and due to Covid only got to go today. But it did not disappoint and was well worth the wait. The staff made this experience. They were really lovely, attentive, friendly and personable. I didn’t catch their names but they were superb. Very good selection of sandwiches and cakes. Scones were superb and the rhubarb jam was lovely and a welcome change. Lovely ambience and the pianist was great. I would not hesitate to recommend the Corinthia for a fab afternoon tea.",5,2021,07,12
143,Superb Hotel,"The hotel exceeded expectations, the staff were fabulously excellent but not intrusive, the spa was luxurious and very relaxed. The food was beautifully served and fantastic in all restaurants. We have already booked a return visit !!",5,2021,07,11
143,Faultless service by Violeta and Jackamo,"Went to Tom Kerridge’s for dinner, was lovely although rather dark deco. Service was good and food delicious. Due to covid time restrictions went and had coffee after at the parlour/lounge. This was the highlight as the service was amazing so friendly and even more special due to the fact that Violeta remembered me from a month ago. The service back then was great and it still was this time too. Jackamo and Violeta looked after us with amazing, faultless service of tea and coffee. The attentiveness and beautiful manner of them both made us so comfortable and welcome. We have already booked to go back to see them again. Thank you Violeta and Jackamo, you are fabulous.",5,2021,07,04
143,Dinner and coffee,"What an evening. Kerridges bar and grill food superb. Service very attentive and choices in menu splendid. 
After dinner sat in the open lobby had coffee with jacamo serving what an asset to the hotel. Beautiful service and clearly has very high standards. He is a delight and made our night. Thank you so so much we will be back. Outstanding service.",5,2021,07,04
143,A wonderful birthday weekend away,"We would like to say a huge thank you for yet another wonderful weekend stay. It was my husbands birthday and they couldn’t do enough for us, the attention to detail was perfect. The room was very spacious and the in room dining was served quickly and was absolutely delicious. We would have liked longer in the spa, but fully appreciate the rules with Covid at the moment. Hopefully our next visit will be restriction free.  Thank you so much for making the weekend very special and we hope to see you again before the end of the year!",5,2021,07,04
143,Never disappoints,"Corinthia is just on point! This place never disappoints, the service is so friendly, lovely and welcoming. From showing you where the toilet is to the service for dinner, I’ve never felt so welcome and really created a magic experience!! Thank you",5,2021,07,03
143,Amazing Anniversary Weekend,"We were looking for somewhere special to celebrate our wedding anniversary and looked no further than the Corinthia Hotel. This was due to the reputation of Mr Thomas Kochs who was manager when we’d previously stayed at Claridges. This would also give us the chance to dine at The Northall and return once more to Kerridge’s Bar & Grill. There would also be an opportunity to try the amazing ESPA Life Spa which looked amazing.
Our arrival at the hotel on friday couldn’t have got of to a better start because as we approached the entrance the doorman came down the stairs gave us the friendliest of welcome before taking our luggage and escorting us to the reception desk. This really gave you an immediate good feeling about staying here. This continued as we were checking in as the receptionist was a delight to talk to and gave us all the information we needed to enjoy our stay. Once all checked she asked if we’d like some treats from the trolley before escorting us to the lift and giving us directions to our room.
Our standard room was on the third floor which had a small hallway where straight ahead was the walk in cloakroom. To the right was the bathroom that featured a huge bath , two sinks , a separate toilet & a walk in shower. Then across the hallway was the bedroom with all the facilities you required TV , tea & coffee machine , dining table & chairs and two french style doors that opened out to the inner courtyard. The room was kept spotlessly clean and everything thing you used was replenished either in the morning or during the evening turndown.
This was a fabulous place to enjoy your breakfast , lunch or dinner. The room is light and airy and has lovely views of the river thames. We enjoyed our breakfast here every morning and even had a fantastic dinner in the evening. For breakfast there was a great selection to choose from. The staff were warm and friendly which created a nice relaxing atmosphere so it really was great place to start your day. 
On the Saturday evening we decided to try the Northall for dinner. This was due to me personally wanting to try chef Andre Garrett’s food which I’m now pleased to say was amazing. The staff keep their warm and friendliness as well as adding some professionalism to the service. There is only an A la Carte menu available. We started with oysters before enjoying our starters of the Guinea Hen , Pork Belly & Cabbage Terrine and the Treacle Cured Chalk Stream Trout. For our main courses we chose the Red Mullet and the Norfolk Black Leg Chicken with sides of Fresh Peas & Baby Linder Potatoes. We finished with a couple of delightful desserts. Sable with lemon curd , raspberry & meringue as well as Cherry with cocoa cremaux , cherry & black pepper sorbet. This was a truly fabulous dinner and one that I would highly recommend.
We were lucky enough to enjoy an hours visit to the ESPA spa which I have to agree with all the reviews I’ve seen that it’s a fabulous experience. We enjoyed the steam , room , pool and jacuzzi. When we got back to our room we felt so relaxed so I would definitely recommend a visit.
This was our fourth visit to Kerridge’s and once again the food , wine , drinks & service was excellent. We started with a drink in the bar where we’d enjoyed some great cocktails over the weekend before being escorted to our table. For our first course we chose the Cornish Crab Scotch Egg and the Pork & Mushroom Terrine. This was followed by the main courses of Day Boat Cornish Turbot and for me personally a stunning Saddle of Wiltshire Lamb & Haggis with seasonal vegetables , triple cooked chips & roast potatoes. We finished with a Cheese Course , Bread & Butter Panna Cotta plus a surprise as chef Nick sent out his “Comet C” dessert from the Great British Menu. A big thank you to Blaine and the team for another fabulous dining experience. 
So after three fabulous nights it was time to head home. I can’t thank everyone highly enough because from the moment we arrived until we departed every member of staff was as friendly and professional as they could be and where anything that you required was never a problem. You can clearly see the effect that Thomas Kochs and manager Jochem have on the hotel which is why I would highly recommend to stay here. 
I would now personally like to thank everyone at the Corinthia Hotel for making our Anniversary a special one and looking forward to seeing you all again soon.",5,2021,07,02
143,Outstanding!,"My husband and I absolutely loved our stay at the hotel last Saturday. The experience from start to end was incredible. 

We were offered an upgrade on our room on check in. What a stunning room we had. The decor and furnishings were beautiful and there were lovely ESPA products in the bathroom. 

We enjoyed drinks in The Northall Bar on both Saturday evening and Sunday afternoon as we had taken advantage of the late check out which gave us a chance to enjoy a visit to the spa and a long walk along the river before returning to enjoy a couple of glasses of bubbles before we left. The breakfast was delicious too.  

All of the staff were so friendly and accommodating. A special mention goes to one of your bar staff in The Northall on Sunday afternoon. His name escapes me now but he was from Naples. He was a pleasure to talk to and is a credit to the hospitality team. He made us feel so very welcome. 

All in all it was a perfect weekend and it is definitely one of the very best hotels we have had the pleasure to stay in. Can’t wait to return!",5,2021,07,02
143,Excellent attention to detail,"We stayed at the Corinthia last August. We went for a repeat weekend visit in June. Fantastic- staff are fabulous, simply cannot do enough for you. Everything was beautiful- our room , our breakfast and the meals- afternoon tea and dinner at Kerridges- reviewed separately. A stay here is just a treat from beginning to end- thank you!",5,2021,06,30
143,Five star stay,"Fantastic stay at the Corinthia, London, the staff went out of their way to look after us. A stunning hotel where you are made to feel relaxed as soon as you arrive.  We received a room upgrade and stayed in a Junior Deluxe Suite, which was very spacious. We cannot wait to stay again.",5,2021,06,30
143,So Readily Repeatable,"We have experienced and thoroughly enjoyed this hotel pre, and now post pandemic, and just cannot fault it. And we have - constructively - tried!! Last week it was an unforgettable combination of - Spa treatments/Northall Restaurant and bar/Kerridge’s Restaurant/afternoon tea with bubbles - all superlative.",5,2021,06,28
143,Outstanding,"Outstanding Hotel, great location and the most friendly, helpful, accommodating team of staff.  The rooms are beautiful and spacious even for a family of four, every amenity you could possibly need and the lovely little touches like jars of sweets and freshly made cookies.

The Spa is stunning and an absolute must to visit.

We had drinks and snacks in the Lounge area on Saturday evening and it was a pleasure to sit in such a stunning and relaxing area.

Breakfast was excellent, great service from all of the staff and a lovely selection to choose from.

This Hotel is a top five star and we will definitely return.",5,2021,06,27
143,Perfect for a London weekend ,"Everything about our stay at the Corinthia was beautiflly done and not overdone.  Warm welcome and friendly service from the whole team, along with the elegant, relaxed decor, and amazing flowers made for a great atmosphere.  The double upgrade for our anniversary was an unexpected bonus! There were thoughtful touches throughout such as treats and a celebration cake on arrival, and our suite was tasteful and comfy.  Lunch at Kerridges was flawless and we have finished our weekend feeling thoroughly spoiled. ",5,2021,06,27
143,Afternoon Tea,"Went for Afternoon Tea. It was a very relaxing experience with all you can eat sandwiches, scones, and yummy specialty desserts. Paulo our attendant was especially wonderful. The sandwiches were very upscale with a selection of five. They have caviar and champagne available. ",5,2021,06,26
143,Great staycation with twins,"This was our first trip as a family since our twins were born last year, and we couldn't have picked a better hotel! We were upgraded to the Deluxe Suite on arrival due to our Discovery status and the room was huge. Staff at check in (Tom and Jochem) also made us feel very welcomed. And both of the twins had their own cots with children bath products and a teddy bear, which was a very nice touch.

We had Afternoon tea at the Crystal Moon lounge, which was a great setting. And we also visited the pool during our stay, which is one of the best SPA in London, and the twins loved it.

The hotel was very accommodating with our needs and we didn't want to leave. We will be re-visiting again for sure in the future!",5,2021,06,26
143,Superb!,"What a beautiful hotel, we stayed in a king suite, lovely big room and en-suite. The bed was really comfortable, the staff were excellent from the minute we got there, so attentive and friendly. We ate in the garden restaurant for lunch, food was excellent. Breakfast was delicious too.",5,2021,06,25
143,Lovely spa day,I had a lovely day at Corinthia Spa. Amazing 1h massage the staff was friendly and very professional. The place is very clean and look after. If you are looking for a relaxing day in London this is your place. I can't wait to come back!,5,2021,06,21
143,25th wedding anniversary afternoon tea,"I was so impressed by the service and hospitality of this hotel. Our waiter was so friendly and helpful as was the front of house person as well. In fact all staff were friendly. I have been to the Ritz a couple of times but this hotel is so much better than the Ritz. The hotel itself is so beautiful and classy. The pianist wandered around asking if he was playing too loud. He asked if we had any songs we would like him to play as it was our anniversary, which he played beautifully and not too loud! This is not a snobby hotel, my husband wore smart jeans, shirt and shoes which is acceptable for the dress code, no need to wear a suit. I took the opportunity to dress up though and the hotel surroundings and decorations made me feel like a princess for a couple of hours. I will definitely be going back and taking my two daughters as well. ",5,2021,06,17
143,Unbelievably good,"Stunning hotel, flawless service. Excellent rooms. Unique spa, absolutely incredible and best hotel experience I have ever had anywhere in the world.

Would recommend to anyone at any time and I cannot wait to return when budget allows! 

Exceptional!",5,2021,06,16
143,One of the best in London,"True 5 star London . Seamless and friendly check in and a stunning building . Got a great deal with London calling . 

Spa facilities were superb and not over crowded . Treatments were also first class .

Beautiful room , and thankfully sound proofed so could hear none of the usual noises of London and sleep peacefully .

Dinner at Kerridges is a must and their lobster Thermidor is essential to try .

Great breakfast selection the following day ; and we also thoroughly enjoyed the afternoon tea under the beautiful chandelier.

There was 1 miscommunication about a request made upon online check in , so do double check if necessary . However the manager Tom dealt with it professionally and courteously .

Overall a truly wonderful stay , the staff were efficient and polite at all times , fantastic location , beautiful food and spa , What more could you want.

A throughly wonderful stay and I will return soon",5,2021,06,14
143,Champagne Afternoon Tea,"Perfect way to spend an afternoon.  Staff very friendly helpful and attentive.  Nothing too much trouble, did not feel rushed and the sandwiches,  tea and cake just kept coming.
As it was my birthday and anniversary treat, made us feel extra special and put cakes in a box to take with us.
10 out of 10, to all the staff st the corinthia.

143,Corinthia Luxury bubble for the weekend……,"I booked the London calling deal for my partners birthday so we stayed one night/2 days at the Corinthia. It was such a great deal and a wonderful weekend! Everything was perfect. We had early check in, a free upgrade, champagne in the room with a lovely birthday cake, breakfast and a late check out the next day up to 4pm. I booked lunch in the garden, an hour in the spa then dinner in Kerridges and the spa again the next day. The spa is amazing. Lunch and dinner were delicious. We never left the hotel the entire time and enjoyed every minute of our luxury weekend away. It was our first night away since lockdown began and we couldn’t have picked a better place to spend it. The service is impeccable and the hotel is stunning. It was our second visit to the hotel but first overnight stay and we will be back. We previously did the NYE dinner in the Northall and private viewing of the London fireworks in 2019 which was also amazing! A great weekend spent relaxing and eating great food in such luxurious surroundings. We can’t wait for our next stay!",5,2021,06,10
143,Nice city break but limitations on spa access,"The hotel and staff are lovely - room service is great and the rooms are clean and full of amenities.

I mainly stayed here due to having to take an exam and wanted to relax after it in the spa!  I was unaware at the time of booking that the access to the spa was limited (due to coronavirus) and only allowed a space of 1 hour and only allowed to access once during the weekend?  It was a bit disappointing as the spa had incorrectly booked my session and then being notified I wouldn't be able to use it during the weekend.  I only chose Corinthia because of the spa...I'll probably stay at a comparable hotel which does not have limitations on the spa next time.

Good stuff:
-The Hypnos beds were amazing...struggled to get out of bed as they were so comfy!
- Doormen are SO helpful...massive shout out to those guys",3,2021,06,09
143,Great as always. ,"We stopped by in the evening for a relaxing drink in the crystal moon lounge.
The drink and the atmosphere was very calming after a day out. 
A special mention must go to our waiter that evening (V. L) she was very friendly and helpful. ",5,2021,06,08
143,An Unbelievable stay,"We booked the Corinthia for our Wedding night and we were not disappointed. 
I arrived in the morning at 10 o'clock in order to set our room up with balloons and decorations and the concierge offered to assist with all of this preparation. 
Reception also upgraded us to a better room once they knew we were there for a wedding night. I guess this was subject to availability but either way it made it all the more special. 
The service from every person in the hotel is like we have never experienced and they make you feel special. Anything they can do to help you they will.
Also, the spa is like stepping into a different world and you forget that you're in central London! 
It was a great experience from start to finish and we will definitely be back in the future.",5,2021,06,08
143,beautifully done afternoon tea at Corinthia,Visited today with my husband and it was absolutely beautiful experience. Our waiter Jacomo  was very professional and kind with great attention to details. Choices of finger cut sandwiches were amazing.Thank you for looking after us and we will be back very soon,5,2021,06,07
143,Champagne afternoon tea.,"This was a belated birthday treat, champagne afternoon tea. 
The staff are amazing, making you feel very welcome. Especially Tim, our waiter. Nothing was too much trouble. The decor is fabulous. Some people have complained that you feel you are in a corridor, but as I like people watching, this was not a problem. 
I have never felt so full after an afternoon tea. The chefs have excelled themselves with the vegan version. 
The pianist introduced himself and asked if there was anything in particular you would like him to play. 
A throughly lovely experience and we are looking forward to repeating it.",5,2021,06,07
143,"""Excellent""","From the moment we walked into reception we knew we were in a special hotel.  The staff were on the right side of being attentive and could not do enough for us during our stay.  At check in Lucia could not do more for us and as she had a note that it was our wedding anniversary she made us feel so special enquiring how long we had been married, our plans for the trip and was there anything we needed.  She is an absolute star and the hotel should be so proud of one of their employees who goes the extra mile making guests feel special.   
Our room was superb and one of the best we have ever stayed in.  Everything about this hotels screams luxury and class.  From breakfast to a drink or meal in the bar area.  
We will now only stay at this hotel when we are in London.  Ok it is not cheap but it is worth. every penny.  A true 5 star hotel.",5,2021,06,01
143,Outstanding,"Undoubtedly the best luxury hotel in London. What makes this hotel special is not just the building (which is amazing). Attention to detail by the staff separates this hotel from the rest. The atmosphere is luxury but relaxed. They only seem to hire staff that are genuinely hospitable. The facilities are second to none. The food is amazing with a great selection of venues you don’t need to leave the hotel for something different. As returning visitors we have gotten to know everyone. Tim who runs the Afternoon tea operations (must try) is such a delightful, kind and a true professional individual. Adam is amazing at Northall with making your visit memorable  and Celina at the Garden makes you feel welcomed and looked after like you are family! 

The spa is also a must with some of the best treatments in London. 

This hotel was not always like this I must say. We visited the hotel before Thomas Kochs became the general manager about 6 years ago. A very different experience. Thomas has simply brought the hospitality magic into the hotel with his touch. 

To sum up….outstanding.",5,2021,06,01
143,Wonderful stay,"We stayed at the Corinthia for three nights and it was perfect ... the hotel is beautiful, the staff are attentive and friendly, the spa is divine and our room was heavenly ... loved every minute of our stay",5,2021,05,31
143,Perfect!,"Absolutely loved our stay here. Perfect location. First class service, the staff genuinely care and welcome their guests. Amazing food and drinks. The rooms are beautiful with so much attention to detail. We have stayed in some incredible hotels, but this has to be the best so far and without doubt, the best in London. You simply must go! Thank you everyone for making our stay so incredible.",5,2021,05,31
143,Amazing.,"We stayed on the London’s Calling Package for my 30th Birthday. 
Our room was lovely and the bathroom was amazing! We had Dinner at Kerridges Bar and Grill, used the Spa and had Lunch in the Garden. All faultless and every member of staff was lovely!
SO grateful to Daniel (Assistant Front of House Manager I believe?) for helping my now Fiancé arrange the most special proposal at the hotel!
Was the prefect stay and we can’t wait to return.",5,2021,05,28
143,The Corinthia is back!,"After having to reschedule our planned visit to the Corinthia, due to the restrictions being extended and rules changing, countless times, we finally made it this weekend and it was definitely worth the wait. 

From the moment you walk into the hotel and are greeted by all those smiling faces, and take in the amazing surroundings, you literally feel all your stresses fall away, and stepping into the magical Corinthia, you can almost forget the last 15 months or so. The staff literally cannot do enough for you, no matter how busy they are, they stop to help you in whatever you are trying to do, from the moment you walk in, to the very sad time that you leave. 

Things are obviously slightly different from our previous visits, you can see the hotel has all the relevant safety measures in place, but these are subtle rather than overbearing. The staff were all happy to be back into the swing of things, and there was a really buzzy atmosphere to the place too. 

The room was amazing and the hotel was spotlessly clean too. We took advantage of the facilities while we were there and we chilled in their amazing spa too before we left. 

All in all a very magical experience and The Corinthia is fast becoming our favourite London hotel. 5* and highly recommended.",5,2021,05,24
143," Spa heaven ","Just returned from a fabulous stay at this stunning hotel .
This was my 3rd visit and the hotel takes my breath away every time .
We had such a warm welcome and had lovely dinner in the Italian courtyard outside but it’s still big chilly but they have blankets .

The spa is incredible! I had the most amazing Barbara strum facial by a lovely lady called janiela. She has magic hands !

We did feel that the spa seemed a bit busy at times .

The room was amazing but the pillows were very  soft and uncomfortable but that’s a minor detail and I’m sure they would have got us other pillows if we asked .
It felt amazing to be out again .

Well done corinthia 😍👍",4,2021,05,21
143,Made-to-delight ,"It was truly a pleasure to be able to revisit the beautiful Corinthia and with the current regulations in place, dine at their courtyard gem, The Garden. 

The Mediterranean inspired menu by the wonderful Andre Garrett didn’t disappoint, and made us even more “hungry” for international travel brining back great memories of 2019 trips to Sicily and Sardinia

Wild Seabass Fillet was a true perfection and Bourgogne from Domaine Bernard Moreau et Fils - a perfect match.

Having perhaps one limoncello or glass of  Blandy’s too many, we had the best time and were very much well looked after by lovely Vita, Giacomo and Tim.

Can’t wait to be back already.",5,2021,05,12
143,"Back after a long sojourn - still fantastic, in spite of Covid restrictions!","Stayed last week for 2 nights as in London for meetings.  Incredible hotel, everything is perfect.  The staff are unbelievably helpful and friendly.  The restaurants did their best to work around the outdoor seating with heaters, blankets and hot water bottles.
Fortunate to get a double upgrade on the room due to low occupancy rates - to one of the biggest suites - exquisite! 
Cannot say a bad word about this place, I love it.",5,2021,04,21
143,Finally got married,"This is our favourite hotel in London, the attention to detail and the staff are just impeccable. We were due to get married at the start of 2020 but it was cancelled due to a lockdown. We managed to have a ceremony in December and the hotel did not disappoint. The wedding was completely different to what we had spent years planning but the events team, in particular Jenna and the in house florists - Alfie and team really went above and beyond for our special day. We are so excited to come back this year for our renewal of vows and party! Many thanks to Hope and Daphne also for all their help in the planning of the wedding! We know it wasn’t easy for the team in light of the current situation, a massive thank you. We hope to be back for a spa night as soon as we can!",5,2021,01,09
143,BJG London,"I have stayed in the Corinthia Hotel London, with my family , for 3 consecutive years over the Christmas period, unfortunately with the current climate, not this year. I feel without a doubt, it is one of London's top 5 Hotels, the pricing is extremely competitive, being such a luxurious Hotel, and the staff are superb, catering to children and adults alike. I have procrastinated over experiencing a new Hotel many times,just to see the difference, but I am too contented with Corinthia now, it feels like our second home...",5,2020,12,26

143,Outstanding hotel and fantastic team,"We had the most amazing stay at the Corinthia to celebrate my birthday. It was our first time in this hotel and we must say that we were overall WOW’d with all aspects of the stay. Lucia warmly checked us in and took the time to explain all the facilities of the hotel and escort us to the room. Daniel also provided a lovely welcome and introduced himself as a main point of contact should we have needed anything during the stay. The Executive Room was spacious and beautifully decorated. The spa is probably one of the best we’ve encountered in the world. Even with Covid restrictions the facilities were well maintained and attended to. 

What sets apart Corinthia from other hotels is the genuine and attentive service from the staff. All staff we spoke to during the stay were so courteous and were going the extra mile to ensure that the stay was perfect. During these unprecendented times it was great to see how the Corinthia staff were truly dedicated in providing the most personalised and luxurious service they are well known for.

We will definitely return to the Corinthia and cannot recommend it enough. Thanks again Lucia, Daniel and entire Corinthia Team! ",5,2020,12,21
143,Beautiful hotel with impeccable service!,"The Corinthia hotel is by far the best hotel I have ever stayed at and I'm already trying to book my next stay with them.
Daniel Chung (Hotel Manager) was outstanding and I've never known a hotel manager go to the lengths that he did to ensure your stay was the best it could be.
The service we received from all the staff was world class, they cannot do enough for you and they literally make you feel like royalty. 
Fiona (receptionist) was so lovely during our check in and personally showed us up to our room and explained everything about the hotel along the way.
I have a nut allergy and all the staff knew about my my allergy before I even mentioned it to them - beyond impressed!  
The hotel is perfect, there isn't anything out of place and the cleanliness it next level! 
I would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a luxury hotel with impeccable service because Daniel and his team will not disappoint you.",5,2020,12,18
143,World Class Hotel Experience,"Firstly I would like to thank the absolutely superb staff (especially Phiona and Mr Chung) for making both my and my fiance's stay at the Corinthia Hotel the best hotel experience I have ever had. As a seasoned traveller I have stayed in many high end hotels all over the world (including Dubai, Paris and Milan) and I can safely say this hotel and my stay there is an experience I will never forget for all the right reasons. The staff are impeccable, from the moment you enter the reception to the moment you check out the team are welcoming, professional and friendly. Nothing is too much trouble for them and I would like to personally thank every singe one individually for making us feel like we were the only guests at the hotel. 

Mr Chung is a credit to his hotel and a perfect example of a top class manager who is involved in all aspects of the property and made sure above all else that our stay was in every way perfect. We honestly can not thank him enough. 

The rooms are clean, fantastically equipped and finished to an extremely high standard with everything you could imagine needing for your stay (including face masks and Spa Product testers).

The in house bar and garden area are lovely and reminiscent of a street in Italy or France with a great selection of drinks and food. 

The food in the hotel bar is to a Michelin standard - I have eaten at various high end restaurants and the dishes we were served would not have been our of place in any of the places I love to eat. Exceptional. 

I would also like to say that the Spa is phenomenal with great features which again I would describe as rivalling any high end hotel. 

Finally I would like to encourage anyone thinking about staying in London to book this hotel as I am sure it is the best available. World Class. 

Thank you again Team Corinthia and I wish you every success for the new year.",5,2020,12,18
143,Outstanding Hotel,My daughter treated me to 3 nights stay at the Corinthia 8-11 December. It was the perfect stay in such a beautiful spotlessly clean hotel. All the staff are very polite and extremely helpful. Our room was beautiful and it was serviced twice a day. Definitely one of the best hotels in London - if not the best! Tom Kerridge restaurant is fantastic and we had drinks and cheese and biscuits in the Crystal moon lounge. Staff are charming. The breakfasts are divine and again the service faultless. If you ever get the chance to dine or to stay at this hotel grab it you will not be disappointed. What a fantastic few days away in the run up to Christmas and we will definitely be returning. Thankyou so much for such a wonderful stay.,5,2020,12,17
143,Weekend stay at the Corinthia,"Our stay was outstanding, for such a fancy hotel, it didn't feel stuffy at all.  The staff were so friendly that we felt like part of the family.
The decor is stunning, and our room was huge - the sheets were so soft!
Would certainly recommend for a special celebration.",5,2020,12,15
143,Such a beautiful hotel and the staff are amazingly gracious and helpful.,"The Corinthia is a London institution in my mind.  We stayed there for a romantic evening away and from the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty. The staff who checked us in were spectaculary, we had a drink in the bistro and the service was wonderful. We had plans to see a show and wanted to book a post-show dinner and the manager was an absolute star he took our name and said he would do his best to have a table when we came back despite being booked.  We arrived and he remembered us and was so thoughtful when we wanted to sit side by side he moved us to another table.  I only wished I could remember his name so I could recommend him by name.

During the entire time we never felt unsafe.  The hotel was very clean and such a Christmas treat.  It was just what we needed.",5,2020,12,14
143,"Incredible hotel, with staff who go the extra mile for families","This is a wonderful hotel for a luxury treat away. Great location in central London. The staff can't do enough for you. The rooms and food are wonderful, as you would expect. But it is the extra touches here - the chocolates to welcome you on arrival, little touches for the children in our beautiful family room, the attention the waiting staff pay to you, the gorgeous festive decor at Christmas time (we loved the nutrcrackers everywhere!) and the care and attention throughout. The thermal floor and spa is to die for! Do go and stay here if you can - you won't regret it.
ps: try the sticky toffee pudding and have the salmon at breakfast!",5,2020,12,14
143,First Class ,"Just returned back from the most incredible stay at the Corinthia in London . I went with my 2 daughters for a 30th Birthday treat . 
Right from the first off we felt super special being escorted through the doors with such friendly doormen . 
We had a slight hiccup with the room ( we didn’t want a roll out bed ) being  3 of us that’s always abit more challenging when it comes to finding a room ) 
No problem whatsoever Tom Evans changed our room without any quibble, had all our bags moved to the new room while we ate the most gorgeous Afternoon Tea under the iconic Baccarrat crystal chandelier . 
Our new room was perfect . The beds were so comfortable and the sheets were like silk . I had a bath watching the telly at my feet . That was a first . 
The Spa was incredible . The aroma of lavender and geranium was intoxicating . Due to Covid we booked a slot which meant there were very few of us there and we felt like it was our own ! 
Basically it was the most beautiful hotel I had stayed in . We did go shopping but tbh we couldn’t wait to get back to the hotel . 
If you’re after ultimate luxury with super friendly staff look no further than this place . We will be back !

143,Wonderful hotel but Kerridges let it down,"The Corinthia is a wonderful, luxurious hotel. The staff are very attentive and friendly and nothing is too much trouble for them. We have just returned from a night's stay with them using the Festive getaway offer. We booked a deluxe room and was given an upgrade to an executive room and a bottle of champagne. The room was lovely and spacious, amazing bathroom with marbled underfloor heating, bath with built in TV and stand alone rainfall shower - all with spa products. The bed was extremely comfortable and the room had mood lighting, a mini bar and Nespresso machine. We started our stay with lunch and cocktails in the Northall bar. Food and cocktails were delicious with good service. The hotel is near to a lot of attractions so plenty to do and see on your doorstep. Dinner was at Kerridge's bar and grill. This was disappointing as the service was poor. We waited about 35-40 mins for our waiter to come back to offer us more drinks, even though tables around us were being served. In the end I had to get up from my table and find someone to ask for our bill. Its the first time I have asked for a service charge to be removed from a bill but I found the service very poor. A manager apologised and offered a free glass of champagne should we ever come back?? How about you offer that to us whilst we are still there? I wish we had booked dinner at the Northall as it ruined the evening. I expect more from an expensive, well known establishment. Breakfast the next day in the Northall was lovely and it was nice that the staff recognised us from lunch the day before.  We had festive afternoon tea in the Moon lounge. This was lovely and the staff super friendly and helpful. So well done the Corinthia for a great stay, but Kerridges need to sort out their service. If not for them I would have given 5 stars.",4,2020,12,12
143,My new favourite hotel in London!,"I stayed at the Corinthia from the 8-11th December 2020 and it is absolutely my new favourite hotel in London (having normally stayed at Claridges). Firstly the hotel felt very safe during these times, it is absolutely spotless and all staff are wearing masks. The hotel is absolutely stunning with the best Christmas decorations I have seen in any hotel in London! We had a beautiful room with a balcony overlooking the courtyard which had lovely high ceilings and the bathroom was wonderful with espa products. The spa is an absolute stand out and I especially enjoyed the thermal pool- so relaxing and beautiful. We ate in the winter courtyard which was immaculately clean and beautifully decorated. No ask is too much for the staff and Alex from reception was particularly helpful (although every staff member we spoke to was friendly/helpful and engaging). The location of the hotel is fantastic being able to easily walk to Covent Garden/Mayfair/St James’ park and the river! I could not recommend the hotel more and can’t wait to go back!",5,2020,12,12
143,The best stay!,I proposed to my girlfriend at the hotel. Our stay was amazing and couldn't have wished for anything better. Staff arranged anything requested and everyone was so attentive to our needs/requests......,5,2020,12,12
143,Ultimate Luxury ,Just had a fabulous night in the Trafalgar Suite.. beautiful room and amazing service from the whole staff. Spa was a lovely relaxing venue. The whole experience was extremely ‘CovidSafe’ and comfortable.,5,2020,12,09
143,Great Luxury Hotel,"We booked a Junior Suite for a 3 night stay.  Lovely hotel, very well presented, particularly the amazing Christmas decorations!

Great service with very friendly professional staff.  This wasn't our first time here and it won't be our last!!!",5,2020,12,08
143,Fantastic Corinthia,"This was our first time at the Corinthia and from the moment we walked through the entrance we were made to feel as if we were regular guests. We chose a deluxe room which was beautiful with walk in wardrobes, Her's and Her's !! sinks in the bathroom and was immaculately clean. We had dinner in the North Hall restaurant and although my wife is Gluten & Lactose intolerant, she could not have been better looked after. The Corinthia lives up to its reputation as a luxury hotel and we will now actually be regular guests.",5,2020,12,08
143,Spectacular Afternoon Tea!,"My wife and I went for afternoon tea at the Corinthia for our wedding anniversary and had the most wonderful time. The food was absolutely sensational, every mouthful as divine as the last. The service was wonderful, we were looked after by Violeta who was incredibly friendly and attentive. The pianist, Kevin, was amazing too, and played a song for my wife that we’d had at our wedding! A truly special place, heartily recommended.",5,2020,12,07
143,Amazing stay,"So it's back in business, fantastic news. I only hope covid hasn't done too much damage and the Corinthia can recover.
We booked two rooms with a Festive Stay. We were allowed to drive and have the car valet parked for free, get a room upgrade for free, have a bottle of champagne in the room gratis, arrive at 10am and leave at 4pm.  What a great deal. Yes the Corinthia isn't cheap, but quality comes at a price. And when you pay this money you do not receive sub service just because of covid.
The check in was easy and our rooms were ready at 10am.i think it is not guaranteed, but you can always leave your bags until ready. Our car was whisked away and we were made to feel very welcome. Concierge looked after us with sorting dinner at kerridge, thank you Darren. The rooms are spacious along with amazing products for Bathing and showering. It's is luxurious. The staff treat you so well whether you are in a superior room Or the penthouse suite. We booked an hour in the spa, only limited to 6 in the pool per hour. We booked in advance but the spa was nearly empty. And considering covid, there seemed little in the way of compromise. As for breakfast, it is still in Northall, a restaurant within the Corinthia. But obviously the buffet has gone. So it's a menu to choose from. Food is served to you and again, no compromises there except the fact you are not up and down so if anything you are better off. And surely for the hotel, less wastage.
Before we left we decided to have afternoon tea. Amazing. So much food and so so well prepared and served with the piano in the background seemingly playing anything you want. We were lucky to have lots of Christmas songs through to Elton John. Very good. 
My only complaint was that we never received a turn down in one of our rooms, something I raised in an email but 12 hours later and having left, no response.i haven't marked the Corinthia down for this as I guess there are less staff doing alot more and mistakes happen.
I cannot wait to return. Enjoy",5,2020,12,07
143,The secret Proposal,"We only ever stay at this hotel when we visit London which is every 6-8 weeks. This was an extra special visit as my now fiancé planned a surprise proposal with the help of the entire team at the hotel. From the moment we were checking in, the theatre started, I was told we had been given an upgrade to a special penthouse (of course I now know this was booked but part of the act), on our first evening we returned from dinner to find a pianist in our room which was organised by the hotel. He was fantastic! The terrace had been set up by the butler team with candles and petals. It was amazing! Dean would not have pulled this off if it wasn’t for the help and discretion of the team. This hotel will be forever in our memories and definitely part of our future! Simply the best hotel and team in London. Nothing was left to chance and there was no stress or worry on Deans part as everything was taken care of. 
A special thanks to doorman Ivan who ALWAYS remembers us, and Sergio for making this happen! Long live the Corinthia Hotel! ",5,2020,12,04
143,A fleeting trip,"My wife and I managed to pop into the Garden for a couple of hours between a meeting earlier in the day and our train home.  We were looked after by the incredibly hospitable Tim.  He arranged an excellent bottle of Champagne some food and a visit from the Cigar sommelier.  Service was exceptional.  The welcome exceptional.  The surroundings matched the unrivalled good nature of Tim and his colleagues.  The Cigar, like every other moment of our too short visit was exceptional.  My wife and I cannot wait to find an excuse to go back and have a proper stay at the hotel.",5,2020,12,03
143,Lovely relaxed stay ,"First stay at this particular hotel as it is a bit further away from our usual spot but lovely all the same. The bedroom was lovely and I throughly recommend booking direct and the London package if it is still running.
Everyone raves about the spa so we dutifully booked in for 7am as this was the last time available and having been told there would be 8 guests there were over 20 in there which begs the question why bother booking a time let alone such an early time. I was a bit disappointed in the food at Northall, lobster was a sparse starter and my fish main was over cooked to the point of being fish food. Unfortunately the live band (which were fantastic and worth a trip back for) finished at 9.25pm and I feel for the cost of the cocktails it would have been worth keeping them there until 9.45 or 9.55.
The hotel is beautiful and clean and worth a revisit perhaps after covid restrictions are lifted. ",4,2020,11,06
143,Exceptional hotel and staff,"Stayed at the Corinthia London for 3 nights for my birthday treat. I must say, you guys are extremely  wonderful, very polite  and caring. We've been upgraded to deluxe room. The room was super clean and very comfortable. The spa was amazing. Overall, the hotel is beautiful. Thank you ever so much for my birthday cake. Very thoughtful of your staff to presented me with such as beautiful treat at breakfast and in the room. Stay safe everyone and we will definitely come back.",5,2020,11,06
143,Exceptional hotel and staff,"We wouldn’t stay anywhere else in London. The Corinthia is superb in every way - the hotel is beautiful, the food is unbeatable (especially afternoon tea and Sunday roast in the Northall restaurant) and the friendly staff can’t do enough for you. Excellent - can’t wait to return.",5,2020,11,03
143,Birthday Weekend in London,"Stayed at the Corinthia London for 3 nights with my family to celebrate my wife’s birthday. Had an amazing time and came back with that holiday feeling. Definitely a top class top hotel with all the London charm. Thank you to all the staff who went out of their way to make our stay effortless. Special thanks to Alex, Andrew, Sahil and Sergio. We look forward to staying with you again soon!

143,Perfect for a special celebration ,"This has always been one of my favourite grand hotels in London and The Corinthia maintained its high standing with this visit. 

Tried Kerridge’s for the first time for dinner which was a real highlight - cool surroundings and fab menu (the sommelier’s recommendation of a smooth South African Cabernet Franc was so spot on). 

Treated myself to a much needed massage in the oh-so wonderful spa which was one of the best I’ve had for a very long time. 

Five stars comes at a five star price but it’s hard to beat the wow factor of this hotel when looking for a place in London to enjoy a special celebration. ",4,2020,11,01
143,Speechless,"My partner & I stayed at the Corinthia Hotel to celebrate my 30th birthday & (unbeknown to me) to get engaged. We spent 2 nights in a Junior Suite which was just stunning. There were so many nice personal touches as well, which made us feel so special. 

The spa was so relaxing, clean & carefully thought out to ensure guests remained safe throughout the pandemic. 

The food was out of this world & the service from all staff truly was exceptional. My partner was so thrilled the engagement went so smoothly & a number of the staff were heavily involved in making this happen! It was easily the best trip we have had for many reasons - we genuinely didn't want to come home.

Thank you so much for making my 30th birthday and engagement so special - a trip we will never ever forget! 

A special thanks to Thomas R & Daniel X - you really went the extra mile to make this what it was :-)",5,2020,10,30
143,Beautiful Corinthia,"Just returned from a night away at the beautiful Corinthia hotel! From start to finish the service from all the staff was extremely professional and smooth! We stayed on the London calling deal which I would highly recommend, free room upgrade, bottle of champagne in the room and a £100 credit against the spa, kerridges or bar bill! Fantastic value for money! We visited the spa which was beautiful and very safe, limited people at any one time! 
We will be returning to Corinthia very soon and can’t wait",5,2020,10,29
143,October 2020,"My Family and I stayed here for a few days and didn't want to leave.
Prior to my arrival Thomas had asked for some details about the children in order to arrange for bath robes, sweets and a welcome gift, immediately my kids fell in love with this place. 
Family swimming time had been pre-arranged with the hotel & spa along with some treatments for my wife - everything was just perfect, very efficient and nothing too much trouble.
Lucia in reception was incredibly helpful from start to finish - as was everyone in the hotel from the moment we arrived at the front door. 
This hotel is just perfect and that is mostly down to the staff. They are so attentive and really want to make your stay as perfect as possible. Our children absolutely loved this hotel and are already requesting a return stay.

Would recommend this place to anyone. I have stayed here with my wife on our own and with our three children as a family and on both occasions i could not fault this place.

Thank you everyone at Corinthia London

Sam",5,2020,10,29
143,Fantastic from start to finish,this is the second time we have stayed in the hotel and decided to drive to the hotel this time as we are trying to avoid public transport during these difficult times. The valet parking was first class and from check in to departure the service was faultless. we had afternoon tea and then dinner in the restaurants and breakfast via room service and each member of staff was polite and very professional.,5,2020,10,27
143,5 star amaaaazing ,"This the most amazing hotel in London - a cool find !
Where do I start !
Angela gave a us a wonderful greeting , she had everything in place, we got a great room courtesy of a double upgrade with Espa amenities. All our needs were met, and the London Calling was absolutely a great offer - champagne , early Check-in and late checkout.

The Spa is out of this world - discreet, stylish and wonderful . The pool, sauna, steam and jacuzzi were just superb. Express lift directly to spa was ideal.

All the restaurants were excellent ! Sunday lunch is modern British and the dessert table was like a Charlie and the chocolate factory dream - go for the crepes suzzette !
Breakfast was just as wonderful with everything you would need. Nothing was a problem.

I think the staff made the difference, Vita at the the Crystal room with afternoon tea was brilliant .
Tomas And Angela at front desk, Northall restaurant staff, Maitre D, and Sommelier were all great.

Well done and coming back for more 😀
",5,2020,10,27
143,My favourite London hotel,"My daughter and I booked direct with the hotel, they have a fabulous deal at the moment. Our room was upgraded and we had a lovely bottle of champagne waiting on ice as we arrived, the room was spacious and the bathroom full of Espa goodies.
Due to Covid we had to book for the spa our time slot of 6pm seemed a little busy so we waited till 7 am it was worth the wait it’s a thermal heaven!!!
We booked Dinner in the Northall as Kerridges was full, the service was faultless and our food was Amazing we both had the black leg chicken and truffle mash which was the best I’ve ever had ( I would travel just for the mash).
Breakfast is table served at the moment homemade granola and thick Greek yogurt with berries and avo on sourdough with poached eggs and their own brew of tea.
We had a late check out which was nice and the guys from concierge took the challenge of helping to fit 2 days Shopping  in London into a small white 2 seater car. Thanks guys,
Everyone at the hotel was lovely they really look after you . The Corinthia is my favourite hotel in London and in my opinion the best.",5,2020,10,27
143,Our 2nd visit,"We have been here twice now, first the spa is AMAZING, love that you don’t have to sit in the main restaurant for lunch, has its own space. A little slow on the lunch service but I guess if you are there for a spa day, time is not important.

Second visit was for afternoon tea.... WOW, by far the best I have had in London and I’ve had quite a few. They have an extensive selection of tea, sandwiches were perfect, cakes were divine especially the trolley of cakes 😂.

What finishes off the experience and pushes it above all the other afternoon teas I’ve had in the past is the level of service... the waiter knew of our special diet ( halal)and kept that in mind throughout, never had to pour my own tea, he was on it every time. Professional, friendly throughout.

The pianist was a delight to listen to and great customer service again. 

If you’re celebrating a special occasion or just want to be spoiled this is the place to come. 

The decor around the hotel for Halloween was stunning, will be back again to check out Christmas decor and to try Kerridge’s next 😉",5,2020,10,27
143,Amazing!,"From check in to check out the whole experience was amazing. The room was beautiful, and the complimentary upgrade very appreciated! The welcome gifts a great touch. Drinks in the hotel bar were fabulous, as was the live entertainment! Dinner at Kerridges was a real treat. Breakfast was fabulous, the service amazing as was the food, nothing was too much of a big ask. We were lucky enough to secure a 1 hour spa slot, this was fantastic. The facilities were beautiful!! We cannot wait to stay again!",5,2020,10,26
143,An oasis of calm in this time of uncertainty,"Everything for my stay was just perfect from check-in to check-out. This hotel has got the perfect balance,  embracing the restrictions of Covid-19 whilst proving a professional and personal service. A big thank you to Lucia for arranging an early check in and check out which allowed us to fully utilise the hotels fantastic facilities.",5,2020,10,26
143,A fantastic afternoon tea,"We went for afternoon tea and weren't disappointed. It's such a warm and welcoming hotel thanks to the staff who couldn't have been nicer. The pianist was great too. 
 The more lavish London hotels often provide very average sandwiches with their afternoon teas, perhaps on the basis that the patisserie and cakes will shine through but the sandwiches at the Corinthia deserve a prize in their own right. Seriously delicious!!",5,2020,10,25
143,Great customer service,"I really noticed and appreciated that in these Covid times, how much the staff were willing to do to make the stay a great one. 
I’ve stayed in hotels that may well be the equal of this one, but I’ve not stayed in one where the level of customer service has been so high, but not in the slightest patronising",5,2020,10,21
143,Perfection under Covid,"My wife and I stayed there for one night to celebrate an important wedding anniversary enjoying a dinner at Kerridge’s while we were there. 

From check-in to check-out, the stay was perfect. All the staff we met are models for how hotel employees anywhere should behave; welcoming, gracious, knowledgeable and friendly.  We were immediately made to feel at home and nothing was too much for anyone. All of this while operating under the very difficult restrictions of Covid and a Tier-2 lock down in London.

Kerridge’s was amazing. The lobster omelette was sensational, the pig cheek pie divine and the clotted cream potatoes obscenely good. Great wine list too!

I love this hotel, elegant and grand without being over the top, beautifully decorated, wonderful flowers and fantastic staff. 
",5,2020,10,21
143,Brilliant birthday away,"Amazing service from the moment we arrived till the moment we left. The staff and the facilities couldn't be better if they tried. We had the afternoon Tea which was amazing (even had the Piano play HB for me!!) we explored every Bar and Restaurant and all as good as each other! 

We loved it so much we decided to stay another night!",5,2020,10,21
143,Wonderful Weekend,"My wife and I stayed at the Corinthia for a small family wedding. It was a lovely occasion and thanks to all the staff who made it so.  We were upgraded on arrival to a Whitehall Suite which was stunning and enormous.

The wedding reception was held in Kerridges' Private Dining Room where we were looked after splendidly.  The evening after my wife and I dined alone in The Northall where the staff were so engaging. Both meals were outstanding. We also had a lovely lunch in The Garden.

We enjoyed our weekend very much and will almost certainly return.",5,2020,10,21
143,Another incredible stay!,"A truly wonderful return to The Corinthia. After visiting the hotel previously with my partner, I booked a girl's weekend for myself and a friend's 30th birthday and was, yet again, blown away with the experience.   
The staff cannot do enough for you and make you feel like royalty. Every member of the team go out of their way to provide an amazing experience. Head Concierge Darren was extremely helpful and friendly and went out of his way to give advice on leaving the hotel to explore for the day. Fleur and Lucia were extremely friendly and made us feel so welcome during our check-in. 
The spa is incredible and, even during the Covid-19 pandemic, felt completely safe.  
The breakfast is outstanding and there is so much choice. 
The room and hotel facilities are impeccable - nothing is out of place. 
The best hotel in London!",5,2020,10,20
143,Perfect Stay,"We stayed at the Corinthia for one night to celebrate our wedding. Every aspect of our stay was sensational from the complementary double upgrade on arrival to the the amazing food and service we had in Kerridges Bar and Grill Private Dining Room. The service from everyone we came into contact with was second to none, we were there for a special occasion and we were certainly made to feel very special. We look forward to staying there again in the future!!",5,2020,10,20
143,Great stay loved it,"Myself husband and baby stayed her for a quick get away 

It’s a great hotel and the staff could not be more helpful if they tried.

The spa is also great if fully recommend a visit if you staying by there 

Already planning our next visit",5,2020,10,20
143,The most perfect engagement ,"My now fiancé took me to the Corinthia for a surprise weekend away in London for what I didn’t realise was going to be our engagement. The staff at the Corinthia left no stone unturned for it to be the most perfect weekend. They upgraded our room and worked with my fiancé to ensure there were balloons, petals and flowers in our room on our return. They even brought us a beautiful chocolate cake to the room to congratulate us.
To celebrate we booked a table at the Kerridge’s bar and grill for the most incredible roast dinner! You must go here if you stay with them. The portion sizes were so generous we couldn’t finish our plates; which is a first from us..
When you’re at the hotel you feel like royalty. Each member of staff makes sure you feel like the most important person at the hotel, from the doorman to the team serving us breakfast. Each person there contributed to the most magical weekend and we couldn’t be more grateful to them. 
",5,2020,10,20
143,Afternoon Tea at the Corinthia,"Oh wow! Four seasons, Park Lane Hilton, Corinthia...all amazing and each stand out for their uniqueness. Afternoon Tea at the Corinthia is an incredible experience and up their with the best if not the best! I took my friends for a combined 50 & 60th birthday celebration. We took a late afternoon booking in the magnificent crystal atrium and I’m so glad we did. We were never rushed and allowed the time to devour our experience so much so we invested in far more champagne than was truly good for us but it really was a wonderful experience and being able to watch and experience the shift in ambiance between day and evening  was enticing us to stay. The tea itself is divine, the scones in their beautiful keep me warm boxes enhances the flavour and the cake display, choice and flavours would put anyone into dessert ecstasy! This experience ignites every sense. An incredible gift to bestow, an amazing indulgence to partake. The service and attentiveness is perfectly aligned bring it altogether. Can’t wait for another wonderful excuse to go back!",5,2020,10,18
143,First wedding anniversary stay,"We had a wonderful stay for our first wedding anniversary at the Corinthia. The staff were fantastic and arranged for us to stay in the same room as our wedding night. Everything was spotless and the staff was clearly taking every possible measure to ensure the safety and comfort of guests. 

I couldn’t rate the hotel and staff more highly.",5,2020,10,16
143,Great job,I’ve never stayed here before and I would highly recommend. We had a great suite that was well appointed and large. The ambience of the hotel is modern and stylish. The spa is awesome and the restaurant’s within the hotel are great. Wrap this all up with a healthy dose of great service and you have something well worth returning to! Great job Corinthia!,5,2020,10,15
143,Back again to heaven,"Again visit Corinthia is like back home. Truly a pleasure.
Clean room ,very quick and helpful staff.Highly recommended spa ,safe in Corona virus- wise. My wife had a treatment with Lauren ,she felt amazing after ,very helpful tips and good time.

Looking forward to visit again the hotel. 
Many thanks ",5,2020,10,13
143,Outstanding!,This was our second visit to Corinthia within 2 months and it did not disappoint. The whole staff team are welcoming and friendly and go out of their way to please the guests. Our little dog was welcomed too. The food in all the restaurants even in room dining was superb! We honestly cannot find any fault with this hotel which is why its our favourite hotel in London. Cannot wait to return!,5,2020,10,12
143,Top class hospitality,"The Corinthia truly does go above and beyond for top customer service. Below I’ve listed the highlights.

- Arrived in the hotel lobby to a very friendly pianist playing one of our favourite songs. He kindly stopped playing to take the time to talk to us. Whenever we saw him again he always acknowledged us. 

- Received one of the best hotel check-in’s we’ve ever had. Lucia was absolutely great at reception. Received the warmest welcome from her and she kindly wished my husband a happy birthday. She then took the time to escort us to our room.

- Received a complimentary upgrade for our room.

- Birthday card and cakes were in the room upon arrival - such a lovely touch.

- Bedroom was spacious and bathroom had heated flooring, separate bath and shower. Complimentary ESPA toiletries.  

- The Bar in the steak restaurant was great. The staff knew all the cocktails and were really attentive throughout our time there. 

- The spa is beautiful and offers a variety of amenities. 

My only minor gripes were:

- The spa cleaner was rude and made a point of making sure every guest knew the closing time. She reminded us several times during our one hour slot. Definitely lost the luxury spa feel with her shouting out “25 minutes until closure” several times across the whole spa and then repeating another twenty minutes later. She even summoned couples out of the sauna 5 minutes before spa closure and then stood at the end of spa beds waiting whilst we and another couple dried off and put our robes on. It was completely unnecessary and unprofessional to have adopted this approach. Guests were fully aware of the closing time and whilst there is only a one hour slot given to guests now it would be great if during this time they could enjoy the spa in peace without the cleaner lurking during that time with her mop hurrying everyone out. Surely a 10 minute buffer could have been acceptable in this instance to allow guests to enjoy their full one hour.

- The main spa pool was cold and this put myself and many other guests off using it.

In general we very much enjoyed our stay at The Corinthia and hope to return in the future.

Thanks goes to all the wonderful staff who make the place special! ",5,2020,10,12
143,Stay at the Corinthia,Had an amazing stay at the Corinthia. Some of the best service and accommodations in London. I travel frequently and Corinthia is my absolute favorite hotel and the best place to stay in London with the best service.,5,2020,10,09
143,The best Spa hotel we've been to,"Went for a birthday weekend with their London Calling offer. Which I would recommend if your booking here. This gives you a free room upgrade, bottle of champagne, early check-in, late check-out and free parking. Plus £100 to spend in the hotel.
This offer makes it cheaper than the ""cheaper"" prices you'll see on comparison sites.

They added a few little extra touches for the birthday and the room is amazing. Overall the service offered by the staff is excellent and very friendly.

But the Spa is really what made the stay. The Spa is very spacious and they are controlling the numbers, the facilities are superb (thermal pool, additional pool, warmed loungers, chill out areas, sauna, steam room) and this is definitely the best Spa I've been to.

Kerridge Bar & Grill does some excellent food. Heavy and expensive but if you're staying here then you're splashing out anyway :D",5,2020,10,06
143,"Perfect day, perfect evening, perfect service from start to finish. Cannot wait to return after such a wonderful stay","We booked a private dining room for our small wedding reception and accommodation for our wedding night. The team went above and beyond throughout our stay and made our day so special. From the initial response we had to our enquiry, to the details of planning the day, to the thoughtful and generous service we received from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. Each team member we encountered delivered 5 star service, and all went out of their way to help us in so many ways without us having to ask. The Senior Waiter who served us on the evening of our wedding reception delivered the best service myself and my family have ever received and we want to thank him for all of his efforts. He made our evening so special and at no point did we need to ask for anything, he was attentive and thoughtful and everyone commented on how amazing he was. Thanks to him for ensuring we had the best day. The team at the door were extremely friendly and again went above and beyond, suggesting areas to take photos in the hotel, offering drinks and ensuring we were all looked after. The food was incredible at our reception and at breakfast when we dined in our room. The room was prefect, spotless and luxurious- exactly what we wanted for our wedding evening. With the current situation, we have visited other hotels and restaurants and did not feel that social distancing and hygiene standards are where they should be- at no point during our stay did we feel unsafe, all measures were being taken without impacting the atmosphere at any point. Thank you to everyone for making our day so special, I can not recommend your service and facilities enough and we cannot wait to visit again hopefully for afternoon tea and Kerridges which looked incredible while we were walking through the hotel! No doubt this hotel should have nothing but a 5 star rating. Thank you for making our special day so memorable.",5,2020,10,05
143,All Round First Class ,"Everything about this hotel is top quality and first class.  Our room was so comfortable, well thought out and perfectly designed, they even have a tv for the bath!!  The turndown service included lavender on the pillow was a quality touch and left you feeling good before bed. You’ll be hard pushed to see how they could improve it!  

Then there’s the Spa, beautifully designed, the ultimate in relaxation and COVID safe with limited numbers and a lot of staff.  The faculties here are top class and again hard to improve. 

Finally we enjoyed a Sunday afternoon tea, which was of the highest quality with fresh and delicious sandwiches, scones and cakes.   What more could you ask for!! 

The staff at the hotel couldn’t do enough for us. You’ll be hard pushed to find a more complete hotel. We didn’t want to leave and we can’t wait to return.  ",5,2020,10,04
143,Birthday weekend ,"Had a wonderful stay at the Corinthia. Felt very safe. All staff wearing masks. Hand sanitizer everywhere. Used the spa which was fab. Visitors need to book 1hr slots so it’s very easy to keep socially distant. Ate in the room which was very relaxing. Lovely Lebanese options on the in-dining menu. Also ate in Kerridges, my hubby didn’t like anything on the menu so they cooked him steak !! Very happy with the service. Altogether thoroughly enjoyed our staycation. Would def recommend if visiting London. Great location. Staff are extremely helpful. Needed to borrow a wheelchair for a family member which was not a problem. Customer service was excellent. ",5,2020,10,04
143,"Luxurious, spectacular, 5* all round","Myself and my husband stayed at the Corinthia for one night at the end of September for our 2nd wedding anniversary. We booked the London Calling offer and I am so thrilled we did. Such value for money! 

The offer included early check in of 10am and late check out of 4pm so we really felt we could enjoy our room properly. We had valet parking included which started our getaway off perfectly.

The check in was smooth, friendly and we were taken to our room where a bottle of cold champagne was waiting along with a surprise anniversary cake! 

The offer also included spa access, £100 hotel credit, breakfast and a room upgrade.

The room had everything you could possibly need, incredibly comfy bed... gorgeous bath room with a huge bath tub.

The spa.... was just something else. I had the most stunning facial by the most lovely therapist called Maggie... she made me feel so relaxed and pampered. It made my trip so thank you! 

We left feeling relaxed and very very happy.

We will be back! 

",5,2020,10,01
143,"Fabulous service, amazing room, wonderful food","My husband and I stayed at The Corinthia for 1 night in September to celebrate my 40th birthday and our 12th wedding anniversary. The hotel was truly exquisite. Amazing floral displays, comfortable furniture, attentive staff and incredible food. Nothing was too much trouble. Our room was so luxurious too! I couldn't recommend a stay here enough.",5,2020,09,28
143,Birthday celebration,"An overnight stay in London arranged through my concierge service for my partner’s birthday. Fantastic service throughout including seamlessly arranging an upgrade to a Whitehall Suite, which was impeccable. Various birthday treats I had requested had been perfectly executed. Hospitality at the bar at Kerridge’s  for drinks on Saturday evening, and at the Northall restaurant for lunch following our birthday night out in Sunday, was top-notch (the plaice meniure was delicious with a good wine selection and helpful staff). The spa is perhaps the best hotel spa in London and we enjoyed great massage treatments. Importantly the spa, and the hotel generally feels safely Covid-complaint, with staff proactively but politely reminding guests of the rules and mask-wearing etc. Overall an excellent trip which we will likely repeat!",5,2020,09,28
143,Corinthia London,"During these unprecedented times. Myself and my daughter had a treat into the capital to celebrate my birthday. The staff in all areas were charming, helpful and fulfilled all our need for a truly wonderful experience. Food in Kerridge fabulous. Breakfast was delicious and as for our room, well worlds can’t do it justice. Our first visit was truly memorable. Can’t wait for the next time. I get around with a mobility scooter, very disable friendly. Staff navigated me around for full access. Well done Corinthia.",5,2020,09,27
143,Total Luxury start to finish,"We stayed in a junior suite for 3 nights, the staff were so friendly and professional, remember your name, what you want to drink, the place is clean and total luxury, our new favourite London hotel and we have stayed in most of them. The staff couldn't help us enough, unlike most places, they didn't use COVID as an excuse for bad service, highly recommended!",5,2020,09,25
143,Great afternoon tea in lovely Art Deco surroundings,"Afternoon tea allows you to be both civilised and self-indulgent at the same time, though the surroundings have to be right, and at the Corinthia they are. The staff, food, decor and general ambience are all top notch. This is  better than the Savoy or Fortnums and not far short of the Ritz for this most English ritual. The occasion has to be a bit special, but definitely a place for a celebration a deux or a treat for a special friend or two.",5,2020,09,24
143,Afternoon tea ,"The staff at Corinthia are what makes this afternoon tea so special. From Paulo, to the incredible pianist, and the serving staff the service was second to none. The service is completely personalised to each set of diners, something that we’ve not experienced in other similar establishments. The food was really great, with the option to take as much food as you wanted home. Already planning our return - can’t recommend enough ",5,2020,09,22
143,Outstanding weekend,"Must review this outstanding hotel . OK, its a 5* hotel, but the staff make this hotel that bit better than just a 5*. From the warm welcome at Check in, to the fabulous guys in the Concierge to the gorgeous anniversary cake delivered to our room and the card from the team at Kerridges Bar and Grill.  We felt very special being here this weekend and are so glad we chose the Corinthia. The room was fantastic. The finish and layout of the room was superb, so much so that you dont really want to leave it...! The breakfast dining room is so elegant and the food outstanding.  I cant wait to go back to the Corinthia.. Thank you to Christina too who was so patient whilst I was booking. Hope to see you soon Corinthia...",5,2020,09,21
143,Amazing!,"We stayed for the night this weekend, and from start to finish our stay could not have been more perfect. We have stayed at the Corinthia many times, but not since lock down. The staff could not have done more to make us feel safe, welcome and comfortable. My son was greeted with a gift on arrival as it’s his birthday coming up and his party has been cancelled to the restrictions. We were then welcomed by balloons and champagne in our room, with a complimentary upgrade!
The staff were nothing short of amazing, and we cannot wait for our next stay!
Thank you to Thomas and the whole team.
Charlotte x",5,2020,09,21
143,Outstanding,"This was our second stay at The Corinthia and it certainly lived up to our first experience. From the moment you walk in to the moment you leave, this worthy luxury hotel does not disappoint. The staff are faultless and really cannot do enough for you. We stayed for 3 nights and really didn’t want to leave. Our room was extremely comfortable and well thought out. Every aspect of our stay was faultless. We will certainly be returning. Kerridge’s for dinner is an absolute must.",5,2020,09,21
143,Unique,"I am SO happy that I have been introduced to this amazing hotel , the whole
Experience have been just so perfect. This time we did booked for afternoon tea as we love to go around the top Hotel in london and treat ourself. Everything has been explained so easy and not one thing felt ever that was too much, this particular time we have been server by a young Italian named Giacomo, we had an amazing afternoon thanks to him which entertained us in a very professional and fun way, making us feel unique.The sand which where amazing we even got second round and they even pack few extra to take home ( no hotel around is doing that ) , the selection of tea have been good, the scone I have to admit are one of the best around London , and the trolley it’s just the WOW effect. We had an amazing stay and I am 100% Sure that I will come back but this time to experience it all. A very big thank you.",5,2020,09,20
143,Best Service we’ve ever had,"Since the arrival till the end. Fantastic!!!! Never leave a review anywhere I go, but this time I felt the need. We got the most amazing waitress... what a bright soul. By the name Violetta , she was super super attentive and with such a strong aura!!! She responded to all of our needs while being extremely professional and sweet. She definitely stand out from the rest of the team, always smiling and every table she was in, everyone was so happy! Going through tough times like this, it is very comforting to meet people like this girl! We enjoyed a lot! Thank you Violetta , you were superb!!

We will be back!!
",5,2020,09,20
143,Delightful festive afternoon tea,"We booked this for a treat between Christmas and New Year at what has become our favourite London hotel and we’re not disappointed by the festive afternoon tea! 

The service, as always, was 10/10 and the champagne top-ups were much appreciated! 

A huge selection of teas available - would highly recommend, a great competitor for places such as The Ritz’ afternoon tea! ",5,2020,09,20
143,Superb Afternoon!,"I went for afternoon tea with my sister for her birthday and it was magical. The expansive room is filled with ambience with a luxurious chandelier as the centrepiece. The food and service was impeccable, especially Paolo who was a joy to talk to. Would recommend to anyone looking for a place to celebrate or simply indulge!",5,2020,09,19
143,Outstanding afternoon tea! ,"A perfect afternoon at the Corinthia Hotel. Having read the reviews our expectations were already set very high. The amazing team managed to exceed them. We were looked after by the lovely Violeta who could not have been more helpful. She was naturally friendly and charming and quite possibly has now persuaded us to visit northern Portugal next spring. (Thank you Violeta for the recommendation, Geres looks stunning). The food was, as expected delicious! We perhaps over indulged on a second round of sandwiches but still left enough room for the perfect freshly made scones and amazing cake selection. The experience was made even more special by the incredibly talented pianist (Kevin Lee). Kevin popped by our table in between playing and whilst we chatted he managed to establish our favourite songs before returning to the piano to play them perfectly. My wife and I decided we just had to order a second bottle of champagne so that we could continue to sit and listen. He really was amazing and the range of songs incredible. Having experienced many afternoon teas in Dubai and London over the last few years our afternoon at the Corinthia hotel (thanks to Violeta and Kevin) must rank at the top. We look forward to returning. ",5,2020,09,18
143,Beautiful luxury,"We stayed as celebration for my husband's birthday.  The package was ideal,  as allowed early check-in and late check-out. We really made the most of the facilities at the hotel. The spa is stunning,  and feels very safe due to currently limiting numbers which allows the experience to remain relaxing.
Our therapists were excellent and showed expertise. 
We dined at Tom Kerridge's restaurant insure, and that had great food and atmosphere.  The Bassoon bar was also really nice, and a great way to end the evening with some live music and great cocktails. 
We appreciated a room upgrade,  which was superbly comfortable. 
The whole hotel is extremely clean and functions in a way that makes guests feel safe without being obtrusive. 
This was our second stay and would love to come back soon.",5,2020,09,13
143,Exquisite afternoon tea,"We booked afternoon tea here to celebrate my mum's birthday and my belated 21st birthday which was unfortunately scuppered due to lockdown. From the moment we walked in we were blown away by the beauty of the Crystal Moon Lounge! We were seated under the crystal moon itself, which felt magical. We chose to have our afternoon tea with a glass of rose champagne.  Laurant Perrier Cuvee Rose- my favourite!! The champagne was served in stunning flutes which were nicely weighted when you picked them up. 

The service we received was fantastic from start to finish. Paolo and the rest of the afternoon tea team were brilliant. Nothing we asked was too much trouble, and Paolo did a great job of giving his favourite tea recommendations. Both teas he recommended we had, and they were delicious. It was very helpful as the tea list was so long and we are so indecisive! We were made to feel very special as Paolo spent time to talk to us (and make us laugh a lot), and the pianist also came over to introduce himself and asked mum (the birthday girl) for any song requests. The live piano music in the background created a lovely atmosphere whilst we ate. Every little detail was taken care of. Right from the continuous tea top ups, down to the social distancing measures which is very important nowadays. The waiters maintained a safe distance when speaking to us, and always wore masks when in a closer proximity, i.e when serving us tea and food.

We started with the finger sandwiches. The different flavours of each sandwich were delightful. It must have been obvious that we liked them so much because we got given another plate without even asking for it! Next we had scones- two plain and two fruit- which were served in a very cute box, accompanied by clotted cream, traditional strawberry jam, and rhubarb and litsea cubeba jam. I never thought that you could get a better combination than clotted cream and strawberry jam, but the rhubarb and litsea cubeba jam definitely challenged my belief! 

Following this, the cake trolley got rolled over and Paolo ran us through everything on offer. He then asked us if we wanted one of everything, which we of course accepted. Had he not offered, I don't think I would've asked for everything as it seems too greedy, but this is an example of how nothing is too much trouble. The selection of pastries and cakes were beautifully presented on a cake stand and mum and I munched our way through them in our own time. Mum was also presented with a small chocolate birthday cake with candles and happy birthday written on the plate. Needless to say all the cakes/pastries were delicious, and it was hard to pick a favourite. I happened to mention to Paolo my love for scones and he offered for us to have more, however by this point we were so full up that I had to decline this offer. Instead, he very kindly packed us a takeaway box of four scones and jam which was a lovely touch, and they were enjoyed later on that evening! 

Unlike some places mum and I have been for afternoon tea, we weren't made to rush here. We felt like we could take our time savouring the moment and the flavours, and even after we finished we weren't made to leave quickly, which was nice. Our experience encapsulated by how special we were made to feel. I would recommend this afternoon tea experience to anyone in a heartbeat!",5,2020,09,11
143,Perfection,"Work brought me back to London for an overnight stay for the first time in six months. I have booked the Corinthia previously and loved it, it was an easy decision to stay again made all the easier due to their current ""London Calling"" offer.
I arrived at 9am, the room was ready and upgraded, the welcome warm and friendly. A late checkout was also offered.

I was able to run business meetings, with real people, from my room, what a new office! There was plenty of space, along with all of the PPE kit necessary for safe distancing available in the beautiful bathroom.

Room service, dinner in the Northall Restaurant and breakfast in my room (the best crossiant - perfect, size, crispness and taste) , were all fantastic.

I'm booking in again.",5,2020,09,11
143,An incredible oasis of luxury and tranquility,"The Corinthia may be located in central London but this stunning hotel is an oasis of luxury and tranquility, just a stone's throw from the River Thames and Covent Garden. From arrival to departure, I couldn't fault a thing. My visit started with a drink in the Bassoon bar and ended with a wonderful work-out in the spa-like gym, which is part of ESPAlife. I enjoyed a delicious breakfast in the breathtakingly beautiful Northall Restaurant. I also extended check-out so I could enjoy the bath-tub, which comes with a TV and waterproof remote. In fact, I didn't want to leave! The staff are professional, friendly and go above and beyond to make sure the guests are happy and comfortable. I cannot recommend it enough and can't wait to go back.",5,2020,09,10
143,Unforgettable ,We stayed for my birthday and Daniel from reception went the extra mile every step of the way to ensure my birthday was an unforgettable one. Espa Spa is also one of the best spas we've been to in the world and definitely the best in London. The overall experience was exquisite. I'm sure it wasn't easy post-COVID times to provide the level of service however Corinthia certainly made it look seamless. ,5,2020,09,08
143,Amazing spa break,"After having to cancel my Mother’s Day treat because of lockdown we returned to The Corinthia with confidence we were warmly greeted at receiption  by Angela who was very informative about the hotel and Spa. Our room was a delight, spotlessly clean  and we were very impressed by face masks hand sanitizers and anti bacterial wipes left for us in the room. The comfort of the bed was  unbelievable the best night sleep I have had for a very long time, the breakfast the next morning was outstanding,   The Spa was a lovely experience, cannot wait to go back",5,2020,09,08
143,Top class hotel,"My boyfriend chose The Corinthia as our base when he decided to propose in February of this year and it could not have been a more perfect weekend!

Szabina F from the guest relations team worked with my partner for over a month leading up to the weekend, taking care of lots of little details, ensuring that everything ran smoothly and helped him create the most memorable weekend.

We love the spa at the Corinthia - we enjoyed 90 minute massages which were excellent and loved hanging out in the pool, hot pools, sauna and steam rooms.  The spa area really is stunning.

The breakfast at the hotel is also excellent, we loved the buffet and a la carte options.

It was therefore a no-brainer, when I had to return to London last month to come wedding dress shopping with my mother that we would stay anywhere but the Corinthia.  

This time a big thank you goes out to Thomas R - the reception manager who gave me a great offer to return to a Deluxe Junior Suite.  Not only were we wedding dress shopping, we were also celebrating my mothers birthday.  

Once again, the standard of service was extremely high!  My mother was made to feel so special.  On this trip we enjoyed dinner at Kerridges (very good although I think its a little over priced) and afternoon tea the following day - the pianist wished my mother a happy birthday and allowed her to choose a birthay tune.   The whole afternoon tea team really looked after us!  That paired with multiple well wishes, celebratory birthday cakes, a birthday card from Tom Kerridge, she had the most special weekend.

For both stays we had a Deluxe Junior Suite, these rooms are beautiful, spacious and have the largest most welcoming showers and bath tubs. 

I can't wait to return.  If you're trying to decide between The Corinthia and other leading London 5* hotels, you definitely will not go wrong reserving a room/suite at this outstanding hotel!",5,2020,09,07
143,Afternoon Tea to leave others standing!,"Such a beautiful space to have afternoon tea and staff were so professional and genuinely caring about your experience.  Beautiful food went down nicely with ""Bubbles"" on the piano.  The choice of Teas was superb.",5,2020,09,06
143,Amazing,"My husband and I celebrated our 14th anniversary at Corinthia and it was fantastic, the staff Was very friendly and professional,  the place was lovely and great food. In terms of Covid-19 safe, I would say 10/10",5,2020,09,01
143,Top notch,"Only stayed here one night over bank holiday weekend but the hotel was superb. Great location, comfy rooms and a brilliant spa / treatments. Very well set up for COVID. Will definitely return as soon as I can!",5,2020,09,01
143,A Perfect stay,"We were lucky enough to spend a glorious night at the Corinthia.  Every member of staff we met were polite, courteous, professional and made us feel very welcome indeed.  The room was outstanding, food delicious, impeccable service and a joy to visit.  It's our second stay at the Corinthia and it won't be our last.",5,2020,09,01
143,Amazing hotel............,"This is the second time that my daughter and I have stayed here.  We honestly would not stay anywhere else while in London now.
The staff are wonderfully welcoming, and always polite and most helpful.
Thomas the reception Manager goes above and beyond in making your stay a memorable one!
I could not fault anything from the cocktails in the bar, to breakfast on our terrace, which I have to say was the best breakfast I have ever had in a hotel and the sausages were superb.
If you are looking for a hotel in London, you would be hard pressed to beat this one.",5,2020,08,31
143,The most wonderful birthday I’ve ever had!,"I cannot thank the staff and management enough at the Corinthia (and my husband of corse lol) for the most wonderful weekend here celebrating my birthday! 

From the moment we checked in everything was perfect! We stayed in the Trafalgar Suite which is absolutely stunning and huge, the balloons, cake champagne and all the lovely extras really made my day! 

We loved the spa facilities which are the best I have ever seen and my massages and facial were so relaxing, I felt great afterwards! 

Everything is spotlessly clean and flawless, we really enjoyed our late night drinks in the garden next to the fire place and loved the selection of cigars too. 

Every meal we had was delicious!

We cannot wait to come back and visit again soon, hopefully in one of the Penthouses next time 😉

You have really set the bar for us and I honestly think you cannot be beaten!

Thank you so very much for making our weekend so magical!

Lots of love,

The West’s x",5,2020,08,31
143,Superb+superior stayin experience in central london,"This is an exquisite hotel in London.It is a superb place to stay!It is a sheer delight just being in the ambience the hotel exudes.In addition,the staff+personal attention to any whim or wish is impressive.The spa is a wonder in such a location+where you can certainly escape the reality of being in a city centre!!The decor is eminently tasteful.In fact,though what remains in the memory after a stay is the staff;such is their attentiveness.I would stay here for one night in preference to a weekend city break abroad or holiday anywhere else!!!!!highly recommended indeed!",5,2020,08,28
143,Amazing all around,"I stayed at this hotel with my mother and son and had an amazing 5 day trip.  Everything from the front desk to the restaurants are fantastic and everyone makes you feel special.

I must make a special mention to the turn-down service as the lavender is a fantastic touch.  Also the breakfast is AMAZING, by far the best I have had.  The sheer amount of choice is fantastic.

Honestly this hotel has ruined every other hotel, as I hold everything to this standard and so far no one has come close.",5,2020,08,27
143,The Best,"I travel the world and have stayed at many of the top hotels. The Corinthia is simply a cut above the rest. I can pick flaws with most hotels however genuinely had no complaints. This is LUXURY :-)

Thank you Corinthia ",5,2020,08,25
143,Fantastic,"We have just stayed for a Saturday night at Corinthia on their London calling package. Everything was wonderful- Fleur greeted us, explained our package, confirmed our bookings and even managed to book the spa for me for both days.
The room was beautiful and we enjoyed the spa and the gym. Very comfortable bed.
The in room breakfast was delicious, on time and very hot. We also went to Kerridges and had a superb afternoon tea, which I will try to review separately. An excellent stay, highly recommended, a very relaxing experience.",5,2020,08,24
143,My favourite hotel of all time,"I visit this hotel every month, and it's without question my favourite property, of any brand, in the world.  My job means that, pre pandemic at least, I stayed in hotels 5 nights every single week, with up to 300 bed nights per year.

The corinthia london is the only hotel that i look forward to visiting every time. The 'first name' service is impeccable, the attention to detail is unmatched, and the quality of the rooms and the property and phenomenal.",5,2020,08,24
143,Such a beautiful evening,"We decided to wander around London for a drink, we previously visit the Corinthia for the amazing afternoon tea and we decided to pop in for few drink in the Garden, we liked it from the beginning with a very warm welcome and the way they explained easily how things works with the QR code which is everywhere nowadays. We had a couple of champagne to start then our server Giacomo recommended a Whisky sour saying that was one of the best around we ended drinking 3 of those each. Sometime it get quite smoky as being a cigar lounge as has been explained to us but it didn’t bother us at all even tho we are not smokers. 100% I will be back with my fiancé perhaps for lunch this time.",5,2020,08,24
143,Perfectly prepared and looked after,The team at the Corinthia have done an amazing job preparing for guests during COVID and looking after everyone very well. I found everything clean and well managed including the beautiful spa facilities and restaurant. Thoroughly enjoy my stay and highly recommend to anyone visiting London for its quiet calm environment.,5,2020,08,24
143,The Garden Bar is lovely and has a skyview,"Had a tasty dinner and an old-fashioned cocktail in the Garden bar at this very posh hotel.  Attendant/server Giacomo was very helpful and friendly.  All the staff were well trained and very mannered, it’s refreshing/assuring to see that manners and polish still come naturally to people.

I don’t like being labeled a “rude American” when I travel, so I like to go to resorts and high-end hotels.  I especially like the open air atrium and fresh flowers/greenery in the Garden.  It’s romantic enough for date, but OK for a solo diner as well.  Thank you Corinthia! 🧚🏼💃🏻",5,2020,08,23
143,Everything is excellent ,"We stayed here for the New Year celebration and the location is just excellent. Our corner room is also two thumbs up (with heated bathroom floor and a big walk-in closet). Afternoon tea is also recommended here, very memorable. Then I rember that Red Sparrow shot a few scenes here too. What a gem!! I rarely give my stay a 5 star review, but this place is unforgettable.",5,2020,08,23
143,Always a pleasure ,"My partner and I frequently stay at The Corinthia, and have come to think of it as our ‘home away from home’ in London. The rooms are sophisticated and comfortable; the staff are incredibly professional and friendly; the bar and dining options (including breakfast: probably the best we’ve had in the UK) are all excellent. One of the best features, however, is the ESPA thermal floor - a quite simply stunning space, beautifully designed, with fantastic treatments (deep tissue massage highly recommended). We’ve been to this hotel many times and will be back again soon! Thank you, Corinthia London, for never letting us down. ",5,2020,08,23
143,Beautiful - a slice of Malta in London,"I’m half and half. Half Maltese, half English and I wanted to go to Malta but in the current public health crisis I didn’t want to fly - so - we chose the Maltese hotel in London. 

Check in and Valet parking were a breeze. All handled very well.  We arrived with a walker , a wheelchair and a mobility scooter. Everything went smoothly and we were escorted to our room 

We had the London Calling package which meant a room upgrade. The Executive room was spacious and well appointed and the bathroom felt luxurious. We didn’t choose a ‘disabled’ room as they were on the interior courtyard. It wouldn’t have mattered. There was no real point paying extra for the Northumberland Avenue side of the building as there is no balcony. The windows are large and Triple glazed 

The champagne 🍾 was a lovely touch but given the price of the room - you’ve paid for it really. 

Acfually I’ve just remembered we had to ring down to ask for our luggage to be sent up over an hour after arriving at the hotel. My memory isn’t as sharp as it should be - neither was the service.  The hotel didn’t seem overly busy and so there was no real excuse. 

Our aim was to enjoy the service at the hotel. We have stayed at some of the leading hotels of the world so we feel
qualified to write a fair review. 

Service - I’d give them a 9/10   It was great when we interacted with staff. They lose a point for not being attentive enough to anticipate our needs. We expect that in an expensive 5star establishment. We asked for a kettle twice and requested a seat for the shower. Neither ever arrived. 

The staff were lovely. We used the Spa, The Garden Lounge The Moon room, the Northall Restsurant  and Kerridges 

Mark at the spa went out of his way to help but it was disappointing that they weren’t set up to more easily accommodate people with mobility problems. It felt awkward and clumsy having to request the hoist for the pool.  It all worked ok and Mark amd his colleagues were great. We just wish they had designed the place with mobility issues in mind. we are disabled but it shouldn’t mean we can’t access the facilities.  The sauna - had it been operational would have been inaccessible and it wasn't feasible to use the hoist for the thalasso type pool. Disappointing. 

Restsurant staff were superb. Excellent service and we were happy to see them wearing face masks. 

Kerridges maitre d was very helpful and squeezed us in despite us leaving booking til the last minute. The food was first class. 100 % full flavour. The bread and butter Panna cotta has got to be one of my best ever desserts. 

The afternoon tea experience was disappointing. Ok - we are comparing it to some of the best afternoon teas in the world - but it didn’t come up to scratch.  The presentation lacked originality and the quality of the sandwiches and scones was surprisingly poor. My chamomile tea may have had a quick look at some chamomile flowers but none were evident in the pot or the flavour. This was remedied the next day when I was served proper chamomile tea by a very attentive waitress. We needed to ask for extra cream for the scones as only one tiny pot was provided  but the rhubarb and ginger jam was very good.",5,2020,08,22
143,The Corinthia never fails to impress,"Just had a mini staycation at The Corinthia, having stayed here for the first time last October. We have stayed at many top and beautiful hotels in the UK and abroad and this is hands down one of THE best. The hotel itself is gorgeous beyond belief, spotlessly clean and every little attention to detail to make your stay perfect has been thought of. The Spa is so unique and a soothing morning treat after a night out! Breakfast is delicious and every single member of staff from the front of house, waiters, sommeliers and housekeeping are super-friendly. If you want that little touch of normality and sheer luxury in these very strange times then this is the place to be. Cannot say any more - go there! Thanks again to all at The Corinthia - we will most definitely be back!",5,2020,08,18
143,Birthday afternoon tea,"I booked for my birthday with a group of friends. We all agreed this was the best afternoon tea we'd ever had. The staff catered brilliantly to a range of dietary requirements and were really attentive throughout. The food was delicious and so much of it. We all went home with boxes of treats. The hotel was beautiful, we were sat on really comfy sofas and not rushed at all with an excellent pianist playing in the background. We can't wait to come back!",5,2020,08,18
143,Absolutely amazing!,"My husband and i were looking for something special to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary when someone recommended the corinthia. The entire experience was amazing from start to finish - the staff  were so friendly, attentive and made so many extra special touches to make our stay extra special. From the bottle of champaign and yummy chocolate cake waiting when we arrived in our room to a little gift from the ESPA team when we finished our treatments. And upon check-out the again friendliness of Sergio and the front desk team to ask how our stay was, how our spa treatments were to remembering again why we were there and wishing us again a happy anniversary. A truly spectacular hotel, brilliant food and above all the friendly and attentive staff who made the our experience personal and one we won’t soon forget. I can’t wait to go back!",5,2020,08,16
143,"Anniversary & Birthday celebrated, nothing too much trouble","Travelling from Devon by train and going direct from Paddington to Embankment without a change then stepping across the road to the Hotel was so convenient, unless you travel by car.
Then from the initial step towards the door until we stepped into the taxi to return home was a delight. Every interaction with the staff at every level was attentive, engaging and personalised, they made us smile the whole time. We arrived early, 10:30 to drop off our bags, yet not only had we been upgraded, the room was ready and Alex(reception manager) escorted us to our room and there was a birthday cake already delivered.
The room was large, with a huge bathroom, it was on the busy Haymarket Road, yet we heard absolutely nothing, a great nights sleep.
We ate that night at Kerridges, obviously  reception must have informed them of our reason for being London and an anniversary & birthday card were at the table, smiles straight away, the food and interaction with the staff was again a delight.
The next day breakfast would have suited all needs, but we ate lightly, due having afternoon tea in the Crystal Moon Lounge, which on a day that was 34 degrees outside turned out to be a cool welcoming haven ,where we enjoyed great food and teas accompanied by complimentary champagne and more celebratory cakes served by Giacomo ( a Juventus fan)  being an Everton supporter  we were able to discuss Italian managers , despite this ,the service from Giacomo and other staff was fantastic.
On finishing afternoon tea, we were offered and accepted a box of afternoon treats to help us on our return journey to Devon. The Corinthia’s team really made our celebrations enjoyable and personal, many thanks again, Mary & Bryan",5,2020,08,12
143,"Amazing Hotel , Amazing Staff","My wife had an appointment in London so we decided to stay overnight , we choose the Corinthia as we had stayed there a few years previously and had enjoyed the stay before.
This visit didn't let us down , from the minute we arrived with the concierge coming to greet us in the car and valet park to the moment of departure was an absolute joy.
I cannot recommend this hotel enough.
We will definitely visit again this year.
Thanks to Daniel et al.....",5,2020,08,11
143,Wedding Night,"My wife and I spent our wedding night here and I don’t know where to begin with what an amazing job the staff did, especially Thomas Reesink. From the moment I first spoke to Thomas about potentially spending our wedding night at the hotel they were incredibly helpful and unfailingly polite. We turned up late for our check-in time (required for Covid) and we are still greeted as if we were old friends and it was a pleasure to have us back at the hotel, despite this being our first visit.  

We were then upgraded to one of the most incredible suites in the hotel. Not only did the suite have a roof terrace and hot tub (!) there was also a bottle of champagne, white truffles and congratulations spelt out in white chocolate. 

Luckily, the facilities at the hotel were mostly open compared to most other London hotels at the moment. The spa has to be seen to be believed… I’ve never seen a spa anywhere near the size or the opulence. In addition, we were kept away from the other guests very easily and efficiently (again due to Covid).

We had dinner in the Tom Kerridge restaurant and breakfast on our terrace the following morning. The food was beautifully presented and delicious while the service was impeccable at all times.

I really can’t rate this hotel high enough. I’d give them six stars if I could!

Thank you again to all the staff who looked after us. ",5,2020,08,10
143,Wife’s birthday ,"We stayed at the Corinthia hotel absolutely truly lives up to 5 star excellent service.

Amazing spa, Amazing service, excellent location. 

Bit pricey for a night stay upwards of £700 but you forget all of that when you get excellent service and also the location where this hotel is located.

Would I stay again ? Most likely yes since I really believe that this luxury hotel has the best spa in London ! ",5,2020,08,09
143,Great that Corinthia London is open again!,"Great to have the Corinthia back open again. It's been missed. From the moment I walked through the door it felt like being at home again (socially distanced of course). 

Service was impeccable as ever. Particularly loved having breakfast in the Garden Terrace. Perfect london weather and a very relaxed breakfast...perfect for my mini break. 

Dinner at Kerridges was divine and I'll write a separate review but in short... highly recommend it. 

Thank you to Thomas and the Corinthia team!",5,2020,08,09
143,Amazing stay,We stayed at the Corinthia - mainly because the spa is so EPIC that it made sense to stay the night. It was incredible start to finish! The service in particular is something that has made the stay stand out so much compared to other 5* hotels. On arrival - everything in the room was arranged as I’d asked (it was my husband’s birthday!) and all the staff seemed to be aware of us staying and knowing who we are and the special occasion. If we had a request - this was sorted very very quickly and easily. Amazing - he loved it! Of course the ESPA did not disappoint - the best spa I have ever been too!,5,2020,08,05
143,Perfect stay,"We stayed at the Corinthia for 2 nights to celebrate a birthday. From before we arrived until after we had left everything was perfect. Every single member of staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating and went above and beyond to make the birthday special. We were kindly upgraded on arrival and had a large room with a balcony looking inwards to the courtyard. I would request these rooms as opposed to an outwards street facing room, as you have the balcony and the courtyard is stunning to look over. 

The room was vast with a separate hallway, dressing room/wardrobe, bathroom and bedroom. The bedroom itself had two separate seating areas in addition to the large bed which made it spacious and comfortable. 

We had breakfast in the room both mornings and this was great and efficient. We didn’t have to pre-order and simply called in the morning and the breakfast was brought to the room within half an hour. 

We also dined at the Garden restaurant for lunch which we loved. The restaurant is in a lovely setting with comfortable tables, a great wine list, fresh summer menu and kind staff.

I also visited the spa for a massage and use of the facilities, which was lovely, as expected.

The gym in the hotel was really great and very quiet when we were there which meant we had it all to ourselves. There was a staff member who introduced themselves and offered to show us around. They were also very discreet and allowed us to proceed with our workout. 
 
An overall wonderful stay and we can’t wait to return!",5,2020,08,03
143,If you want to be pampered and experience true luxury - staying at Corinthia is a must.,"Going away for a short break during a global pandemic was very nerve racking but I must applaud the outstanding efforts of the management and staff of Corinthia. Most especially Iwona, she was phenomenal. She took care of me with the highest attention, respect and while of course being very safe. l highly recommend staying here and worth every penny. I miss it already!! Can’t wait to be back",5,2020,08,02
143,Fantastic Hotel,"Stayed here for first time this week. What a fantastic hotel. The facilities are second to none especially the gym and spa. All of the staff were exceptional and made us feel very welcome. We ate in the Kerridge’s Bar and Grill one night and it was really really good. The food was as you would expect of Tom Kerridge excellent but the staff made it for us, what a fantastic team of people. We also ate in the Garden restaurant on another night and again the food and staff were excellent. 
I can’t praise this place highly enough, well worth a visit ",5,2020,07,31
143,Lovely weekend break,"Despite living in London we often wondered what it would be like to stay in a London hotel rather than always going away when we wanted a break. We were not disappointed. Despite not all of the facilities being open, we had a really lovely time. It is a beautiful hotel and the warmth of the welcome from all the staff from the doormen to the restaurant staff was evident throughout our stay. A particular highlight was the afternoon tea. Daniele's team (especially Giacomo) were outstanding and it was good to see Kevin Lee on the piano (although we like to see him on the harp!). We are keen to return especially when the spa reopens but we might also pop back to enjoy a breakfast or perhaps a cocktail or two in the garden lounge. The Kerridge restaurant is also not to be missed. We were made to feel special and had a lovely weekend.",5,2020,07,20
143,Garden lounge,"An amazing sunny afternoon spent at the bar and grill followed by cocktails and cigars in the garden lounge, pure opulence and luxury, Adam in the lounge provided an amazing tour of a perfect humidor followed by no nonsense advice and couldn't have been a more helpful guy, all staff were polite, welcoming and we'll be coming back to stay soon at this stunning venue ",5,2020,07,18
143,Last Minute Booking,"We decided to get out post Covid to spend the afternoon and on the spur of the moment decide to stay and im glad we did. The hotel is absolutely fantastic and despite all the new rules. The staff were exceptional in the way they dealt with the new SD rules.
The Garden Room was beautiful and a lovely space to enjoy drinks.The room was well appointed as you would expect although currently no room service, which i understand considering the hotel was not full.
I great location for all London sights if you're from out of town and worth the money.",5,2020,07,14
143,First night away after lockdown,"Thank you for a seamless, safe and comfortable stay. This was a business/leisure trip. The hotel was spotless as always and very relaxed. Food was amazing we had afternoon tea and breakfast. The staff were great, the package we booked was amazing. Thank you again.",5,2020,07,09
143,Absolutely amazing!  Our new number 1 choice for London!,"Our stay at the Corinthia London was suburb from the time I initially booked until our departure.  My wife and I were looking forward to a weekend getaway and the Corinthia didn't disappoint.  I reached out to Thomas (one of the guest managers) prior to our arrival (via email) in regards to our stay and he went out of his way to make sure all of my needs were addressed.  I wished to have flowers arranged and even though the on-site florist was closed (due to COVID-19), he still managed to have a beautiful arrangement delivered and waiting upon our arrival.  Additionally, Darren,  with the Concierge staff, offered amazing dining suggestions that proved to elevate an already amazing stay.  Throughout our stay, the staff was attentive and helpful at every turn and made us feel like family.  The Corinthia exuded luxury and was able to accomplish it without an air of pretentiousness. The next time my wife and I are looking to relax this will be our number 1 destination in London.  THANK YOU!

NOTE:  This is also an amazing location to book if you are an AMEX Platinum or above member and are seeking to utilise Fine Hotel and Resorts benefits.",5,2020,07,07
143,One of our best & most memorable hotel stays.,"I stayed here as part of my honeymoon, several years ago and am craving travel (in quarantine), so I find myself here, writing a long overdue review! This hotel, along with the King David in Jerusalem, is one of our most memorable. It really epitomizes the chic, luxury hotel experience. Everything is new & fabulous. From the flowers in the lobby to the elevator to the spa to the room, itself. It is quite a treat! Pricey, but worth it. Very “celebrities” stay here vibe. Indeed, I even saw Agyness Deyn in the lobby! And I got a lot of looks and my husband assumed it was b/c people wondered if I was a celebrity (back when I used to actually dress up for travel-ha!). The location is good, but hectic. I learned to leave the lobby/enter the street with a jog so I wouldn’t get trampled. It’s literally right across the street from Trafalgar, which is a really happening location, but I must admit I prefer Kensington/more of a neighborhood experience, particularly in such a high energy city. My introvert needs some room to breathe! Still, I’d stay here again!",5,2020,06,20
143,First Corinthia Hotel,"This hotel in my opinion has the best location and view in London, it’s close to Downing and Chinatown. Very classic and modern hotel. The service is excellent. Breakfast is actually good, but also very expensive ",4,2020,05,17
143,Absolutely Fabulous,This hotel was beautiful. The best hotel I have ever visited. Staff made sure you were welcome an well cared for every minute of the day.  Amazing and relaxing.  Elegant bedrooms and friendly staff. This hotel has it all!,5,2020,03,22
143,Breakfast delight,"Called in after the first train got me into London way too early. Glad it did! Breakfast here was lovely. Attentive staff, great food and coffee, extensive menu,  lovely comfortable ambiance. Wish I could have stayed for lunch. ",5,2020,03,22
143,Fabulous 5 Star,"The Corinthia London is a must stay if you’re in our Capital. From the friendly and efficient check in to the elegantly appointed bedrooms through to the Bassoon Bar with live music (and fabulous Pisco Sour cocktails!) and the excellent breakfast in Northall with floor to ceiling windows (I recommend the pancakes, the hash browns and actually the tea!), Corinthia has it all. Of course there’s also it’s famous spa, it’s worth staying for this alone!",5,2020,03,17
143,Short escape,"The hotel was beautiful and I especially enjoyed the spa. One of the best I have ever visited, facilities  were amazing and very relaxing atmosphere. I also tried the detoxifying swedish massage treatment with a male therapist ,best experience. We will back for sure.",5,2020,03,16
143,Wedding Anniversary,"Wonderful stay ,very friendly people!

I just want to say thank you :-)
Covid-19 put down the hole city, but not in this hotel.Still good service. Well done!
The Spa was clean and tidy as usual ,I bought a new Espa oil to keep this feeling at home.

Looking forward to come back again.

Thanks!",5,2020,03,13
143,Outstanding!,"HOTEL - LONDON ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

The doorman were really friendly and helpful. Check in was made really easy and the duty manager showed us to our room. The room was immaculate, a nice size and had all the boxes ticked. We decide to dine in Tom Kerridge’s Bar and Grill which is situated within the hotel. The restaurant is very well furnished, we enjoyed a drink at the bar then sat down to dinner. We thought the food was good but nothing special, no wow factor like Tom’s pub, The Hand and Flowers. I have been informed the Sunday lunches are really good.

We enjoyed our stay and wouldn’t hesitate to book again in the future.",5,2020,03,11
143,Why haven’t we visited sooner,"Just returned from a weekend at the Corinthia in London.
Room fantastic, towels fluffy, service and staff all amazing apart from one miserable member in the Spa but maybe she had a bad morning. 
The Spa facilities are lovely and one of the nicest breakfasts I’ve had. We will be back it’s fantastic.",5,2020,03,08
143,Afternoon Tea is overwhelming,"We droped in without reservation and the welcome was very warm. 
The serviceteam was excellent and the sandwiches perfect. The scones were fresh and the cookies marvelous.
After 1,5 hours we went out full and happy.",5,2020,03,05
143,The garden lounge,"We visited only for drinks. Everything was superb, bartender is like machine - quick, accurated, knowledgeable - amazing! The drinks were delicious! Many thanks! Thank you also to manager who stopped to us to ask if everything was ok! Very professional environment. 
You should definitely visit them!",5,2020,03,05
143,Excellent hotel,"Beautiful hotel, clean and well decorated, super friendly helpful staff especially those at concierge and Casper at reception, central location makes it easy to explore London - will definitely return.",5,2020,03,02
143,Not quite Uber tier,The hotel is ostensibly up there with the best in town but little details don’t quite leave it best in class. The biggest let down is the highly regarded spa which on a Saturday afternoon was packed with day spa folk and given its size (fairly small) looked like a bomb site with towels strewn everywhere. In addition they allowed children of all ages in which again I don’t mind but not something you’d find in Uber class hotels - basically it’s not a spa to relax but one that leaves you frankly annoyed as you are unlikely to find a seat to kick back and relax. The rooms are perfectly nice with good amenities but not in the same class as other Uber hotels. On the whole underwhelming versus the levels you get in the lanesborough for similar price point. The spa needs to decide if it wants to serve the hotel or day spa crowd as I thought it was far too crowded for the amount of space on offer. Great bars and restaurants as you’d expect and exceptional breakfast.,3,2020,02,29
143,A wonderful hotel with the most divine spa in London!,"Everything about my experience at the Corinthia was amazing. I was upgraded to a suite which was an excellent surprise. Beautiful suite, great staff, wonderful food - and the spa was stunning! I’ve already booked to stay again!",5,2020,02,28
143,Afternoon tea treat!,"What a super treat. Paulo and Alessio attended to our every wish. Excellent array of sandwiches, scones and cakes. The cocktails were excellent too! Nothing was too much trouble and it was a lovely touch to be given a brief tour of the ground floor of the hotel. Bravo Alfred Pisani, a perfect experience that we hope to repeat. Alison and my Mum.",5,2020,02,27
143,Excellent Location for Business or Pleasure,I have just returned from another stay at this hotel.  The hotel itself is excellent but I often use the facilities throughout the day for meetings in either the lounge or bar area.  Both are excellent and the staff go above and beyond to ensure that both I and my guests are well looked after.,5,2020,02,26
143,Luxury Birthday Stay,"We stayed 21st-24th February 2020 in a deluxe King room. Room was ready on arrival, lovely and spacious and fastidiously clean with great views onto the street. We cannot fault any staff as all were gracious and welcoming, but Karim in the garden bar deserves special mention for excellent client care. We dined in both Kerridge’s and The Northall and were pleased with all meals. The meat displays and grill in Kerridge’s are novel and staff happy to explain the display, and breakfast in the Northall are a dream. 
Hotel is ideally situated for Whitehall, Westminster and the edge of Mayfair and very quiet to say you are minutes from some najor tourist sites. We shall definitely return.",5,2020,02,26
143,Great and comfortable stay,"I stayed at the Corinthia London it was a pleasant experience , relaxing on a personal level and on a business level a high profile and well equipped hotel.
The internet was fast, breakfast was nice and varied the location is superb and the amenities in the hotel were great.
On valentine day we found a cake in our room and the florist in the hotel made a great difference in decoration and atmosphere!",5,2020,02,24
143,Fantastic stay and superb staff ,"My wife and stayed at the beginning of January. we had a few cocktails in the bar, Emmanuelle was  very professional and very informative as well as fun.  The reception team we very responsive and nothing was to much trouble. We went to watch a couple of plays and ended the day in the cocktail bar again the staff were awesome and the singer was great.  Overall experience was fantastic and I wanted  to personally thank all the staff who made our stay a most wonderful experience. Thank you so so much. I would definitely recommend this superb hotel. ",5,2020,02,24
143,The best hotel I've stayed at in London by far!  Incredible spa.,"My husband took me to the Corinthia for a 2 night stay for my birthday.  From the moment we arrived to the moment we left you could not fault the level of customer service.   All staff were skilled and efficient.  We ate in the Northhall Restaurant where the food was exceptional.  We had after dinner cocktails in the Bassoon bar which had great live music.  The Corinthia give complementary upgrades whenevery possible so we had a lovely room.  The highlight of my stay was their incredile spa.  My therapist, Margaret, was the most experienced and knowledgable person I have met in a long time and my massage and facial were exceptional.  Thank you Margaret for adding the icing to the cake of my perfect brithday break.",5,2020,02,23
143,"Lovely Stay, Much Improved ","Having stayed at the Corinthia a few years ago, the first visit being excellent, the second awful (see my review here from January 2017); I had thought not to return but I am very glad I did. We stayed for 2 nights and I am pleased to say we had an excellent stay. The Corinthia is a very comfortable and relaxing hotel. The addition of Kerridge’s Bar & Grill, the spa & pool area and the rooms all excellent. The food was much improved, especially room service. Despite a few hiccups with house keeping (forgetting to replace towels etc), I would say there are few london hotels that have so many excellent facilities under one roof. It’s a nice bolt hole for a few days of rest & relaxation. Look forward to my next stay. ",5,2020,02,21
143,Fabulous 5 star hotel,"The Corinthia is a wonderful hotel not to be missed. Fantastic location for theatres and exploring London. 

From the moment we met Eddy in reception to our farewell from the concierge department and the doorman our stay was perfect. We were so impressed by all the staff - so friendly and polite and willing to help.

Eddy took us to our wonderful room on the 4th floor. The room was spotlessly clean with a balcony overlooking the inner courtyard. The bed was very comfortable and the hotel pillows some of the best we have ever encountered. The bathroom was luxurious and the walk-in wardrobe was spacious and well-lit. Loved the heated floor in the bathroom and the adjustable thermostat in the bedroom was responsive and provided an even heat.

Breakfast in the Northall restaurant was excellent. And we much enjoyed our post theatre meal in Kerridge’s. We were the last to leave! Don’t forget to indulge yourself in the well-equipped spa - delightful. 

Thank you to Eddy and the wonderful staff at the Corinthia. You provided an excellent 5 star experience.",5,2020,02,21
143,Another great stay but some billing and web site issues,"Just back from another very enjoyable stay at the Corinthia London. This was my 21st stay at the hotel since 2016 so I obviously like the place!

When I checked in the front desk agent made a great fuss over pointing out that I was a Corinthia Discovery Black member, entitled to a range of additional benefits, including a double room upgrade. However after making such a fuss over it, he then told me that they hadn't upgraded me even one category on this trip - which all seemed a bit odd to me.  The room I had booked, an Executive room, was just fine with a nice view down Whitehall Place.  One thing I have noticed in recent visits is that I no longer get a hand written note from the Hotel manager, welcoming me back . They used to do this and I always think this is a nice touch - most hotels I stay in (Rosewood, Four Seasons etc) all do this.

Breakfast at the hotel is alway a pleasure and the staff at breakfast always remember me and greet me by name - none of the other staff in the hotel seem able to manage that!

We also went for a few drinks in the Bassoon bar, which I used to like tremendously but not so much since they changed the music they play in the bar. Used to be laid back, mellow jazz, now much more noisy, rap type of music which reminds me more of a Brixton night club not a bar in a grand hotel.

There was a problem with my bill, which I didn't notice until after I had left. My booking clearly stated the price quoted included all tax and service. However when I looked at the bill they had added an additional 20% VAT and a 'discretionary' 5% service charge - which was a considerable addition to the bill. After reaching out to the hotel, twice, they refunded the excess charges.

Looking on the Corinthia web site however, I notice that they have changed the way they quote the room prices. The price they quoted when showing all the rooms used to be the price inclusive of all taxes and service charges. This is normal for the UK and every other luxury London hotel, Four Seasons, Rosewood, Dorchester, etc quote prices this way, so you know when you click to book that is the total price. For some reason the Corinthia have taken to displaying prices without VAT inclusive, which is cynical, highly dubious and legally questionable. UK law requires prices that are intended primarily for consumers, which this is, to be quoted inclusive of UK VAT. Please change this back!

The Corinthia web site is also a bit of a mess (not the fault of the London hotel). They keep changing it, so the navigation is all over the place. In addition trying to sign into your Corinthia Loyalty account prior to booking (so you get discounted member rates) is nigh on impossible - after putting in log on id and password (which works on the GHA.com) site, nothing happens, which is very frustrating.

Throughout the hotel staff are unfailingly helpful and pleasant. Enjoyed my stay despite the billing and web site issues (please fix). Am booked to go back in April",5,2020,02,20
143,Outstanding service in a beautiful hotel,We stayed at the hotel for four nights and needless to say it is absolutely beautiful and all the details are perfect with the best showers ever! The location is excellent and the food really nice but what really stands out in all the greatness is the service. My son accidentally dropped his down the elevator shaft. In order to appease the heartbroken kid we went to the concierge desk and ask for a toy rescue expecting to be told there is nothing to be done. But to my surprise they called the engineering department who then called the elevator maintenance company who came in and actually saved the toy form the elevator shaft. I am beyond impressed by their dedication to customer service! Thank you so much to the entire staff for a wonderful stay at an outstanding hotel.,5,2020,02,20
143,Afternoon Tea,"My wife and I had Afternoon Tea in the Crystal Moon Lounge on Valentine's day. The whole visit was perfect from start to finish. The staff were very warm, welcoming and helpful for the entirety of our stay. We were served by a bubbly charming waitress called Violetta who was wonderful. The food was beautifully presented and extremely tasty. The flowers decorating the lounge were exquisite and the lounge had a great ambiance. The day was further enhanced when a member of staff took us on a tour of the hotel and explained some of the history.",5,2020,02,19
143,"Luxury, Style and Service - perfect weekend break if you want to be spoilt","This was our second stay and did not disappoint one bit and hopefully we will be back again soon.  
The Corinthia is one of the most stylish, beautiful hotels and the attention to detail is everywhere.  
It looks amazing but especially important to me are the attentive staff who can't do enough to make you feel welcome and make sure you are having a great time and want for nothing. They  encourage you to relax and enjoy the moment. From the reception team, to restaurant, to housekeeping to spa, everyone is warm and attentive. 
I love the bedrooms, beds are incredibly comfortable and the Spa is something special and so unexpected in the heart of central London.  Every night out should start with a pre dinner drink in the the Bassoon bar listening to live music.",5,2020,02,17
143,Afternoon Tea Superb,"Faultless, the staff, the building, the food, Incredible service from everyone special mention to our waiter Alex and the the delightful pianist, everyone achieved the perfect mix of exemplary service with a  relaxed atmosphere",5,2020,02,15
143,Amazing facilities and location - bit of a mix up with the staff,"Very central and just a few steps away from embankment station and embankment ferry terminal. If you just want to walk, Trafalgar square and Covent Garden are within 10 minutes, and there are a host of theaters not to mention the London playhouse directly opposite.

Without a doubt the crowning glory of the place is their state of the art spa. The swimming pool and giant hot tub is incredibly futuristic. There are even sleep pods where you can grab a much needed rest after your swim and sauna. Complimentary nuts and fruit with ice cold water in both the changing rooms and sleep pods. You could easily loose days in there.

The breakfast was also exceptional. The dining room was amazing, and almost every culinary desire had been accounted for and we left feeling very full. Would definitely recommend going down early to max out the breakfast. 

The hotel itself is definitely 5 star. Very few details have been missed, and for the most part the staff were very welcoming, however there was a a few very disappointing a mix-ups at reception. There appeared to be a bit of a language barrier with the guy at reception who thought we had asked to see 'Magic Mike' rather than 'Magic gone wrong'. An admittedly amusing mix-up but we felt it could have been avoided.

I also rang in advance to book an outside view room, however, this hadn't been logged and we received a courtyard view room. I tried to change it with the same guy at reception but he said come back later. I came back as instructed but all rooms had been fully booked. No upgrade offers or efforts to rectify the situation seemed to be made and despite raising this oversight with others at reception, they didn't seem to want to take any responsibility just saying, 'we will feed this back'. 

If it weren't for this i would definitely award this place 5 stars, and it certainly hasn't put me off coming back.",4,2020,02,13
143,Dissapointing stays at this price point,"We stayed twice at the Corinthia in the past 12 months or so. First stay was a disaster and second stay was due to general manager giving us a free night as compensation and we wanted to give them a second chance. Note: This review is given against the very steep prices that are being charged at the Corinthia. We have stayed on better prices at the Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park. So, the good things first: Location is very convenient for sightseeing with Trafalgar Square, National Gallery, SoHo and the river Thames just outside the hotel, not so convenient if you want to go shopping in Mayfair or Knightsbridge; building from the outside is grand, so is the lobby area. We enjoyed the bar with the outdoor area. We liked the doorman service and the front desk which were very good. However, things went South after check-in. (Remember: during our first stay we paid approx. 880,- Euros per night): a simple request for twin beds or separate duvets was acknowledged at check-in but forgotten and when we returned after dinner to our room, it took them about 1.5 hours to get this resolved with us waiting in the room while a staff member showing up at midnight to change the duvets and split the kingsize bed to two twin beds. This procedure took forever as he had to return several times to wherever he came from to get linen and other bedding items as what he brought along did not fit. Very awkward situation for us waiting in the room and for him. Also, turn-down left no water, we had to ask. Room was dusty and seemed worn; no welcome note or amenities (as was provided during our second stay) and scratches on the silverware and furniture which is surprising at this price point, morning newspapers ordered never appeared. Breakfast is mediocre and staff seemed overwhelmed by amount of guests, service was not very proactive, small buffet section and mediocre quality a la carte items. Again silverware at breakfast was covered with scratches, a no-go for such a hotel. When we mentioned our dissatisfaction at check-out, we were offered a 20% discount for any future stay which we were sure that there would be none. So our first stay left a very sour taste in our mouths. After having filled-out the online survey provided by the hotel, the then general manager reached out to us, apologized and offered one free night should we return to Corinthia one day. Last May, we eventually were in London again for 2 nights and accepted this kind offer as we had not made any hotel plans. Unfortunately, this very general manager had already left for the Dorchester in the meantime, but the hotel was nice enough to keep their promise... We were assigned an Executive Room this time, very spacious, high ceilings, this time welcome note and amenities. However, inner window was broken and couldn't be fully closed, turn down service very late and forget to provide water on several occasions so we would have to call and ask. They extended some VIP services to us this time for compensation of our first stay, e.g. one time free use of house car to take us to the Indian Accent (driver was brilliant). Also, the Concierge did a great job this time, but still, breakfast was mediocre, service at breakfast was not attentive, quality of food mediocre at best and limited buffet choice and again: the old scratched silverware. I mean, is this a school canteen or a USD 1k per night hotel? At this price point, its not about having a bed to sleep in, but its the small details that differentiate a good hotel from a top hotel. I would have expected the Corinthia to excel in all areas, but so many details just were not right. And getting the right hardware shouldn't be that difficult. There were many positive things and nice people working here, but the overall experience and the details just fell short of what we are used to in such a category of hotels. Therefore, thanks for the second chance, but there will be for sure no third.",2,2020,02,11
143,One of the “Best” hotels in the world,"To anyone thinking of visiting London, do not experience the wonderful British hospitality without staying or visiting the amazing Corinthia Hotel. 

This was my second visit and I brought my two daughter and my 86 year old mum this time. We loved it that much that we hardly wanted to leave the hotel to explore London. 

It’s attention to detail is truly second to non. Everyone working and involved in this hotel should be so very proud as they do not leave anything to chance. Every tiny little detail is meticulously planned.  

I would not stay in any other hotel in a London. Two weeks ago we stayed in the Shard and it is literally not a patch on this stunning hotel. 

You also get free access to one of the most impressive spas that I’ve ever seen. 

It was my 50th birthday and when I returned to my room they’d left cake and Laurent Perrier champagne complimentary. I mean how wonderful is that!?

The breakfast is just one of the best ever and we actually talked about how excited we were to wake up and have such a wonderful treat awaiting us. 

We were also very lucky that we needed to stay and extra night because of the bad weather and train cancellations. It certainly wasn’t a problem staying another night In Such a beautiful place. 

We also treated ourselves to the amazing afternoon tea which was so relaxing and again the best we’ve ever had. With the wonderful pianist Keith playing all our favourite tunes. 

Everything is beyond exceptional. 

Thank you to all at the Corinthia for making my special birthday so very special. 

We will be back. ",5,2020,02,10
143,Wonderful hotel,"Thank you all,
My trip to London was impressive, starting and finishing with you hotel.
A big thank you to the Concierge team that gave me and my wife all the information about the city and all the available activities.
During the last few days we discovered many interesting places and the amazing night life that London has to offer. 
We will be back next year!",5,2020,02,10
143,Lovely room - room for improvement,"Violettas welcome and subsequent service was excellent. Her colleagues however were short of the expected mark. Explanation on preserves flavours , would you like another drink ( as I clear away your empties ) pretty basic stuff but noticeably average almost amateur for such a location I suggest. 
The sandwiches had good flavour salt beef especially , however clearly had been made a bit earlier in the day , the offered additional were much fresher. The cakes were excellent , scones again a little under par compared to other London venues. We will re-visit mostly because Violetta did her very best to recover the shortcomings , and so deserves for us to try again. The room is another food reason to return - delightful",4,2020,02,09
143,Fabulous stay,"Stayed for the first time and it was a nice, luxurious stay but personally wasn’t blown away. 

The check in process was quick and easy. They happily took our bags as we were too early to go to the room so got told they’d be in the room by the time we got back. This didn’t happen. We called up and got told they were on the way, still nothing. Called again and got told someone was outside with the bags, no they weren’t. After an hour our bags turned up. Apparently someone had written the number down but someone else misread it. This was disappointing because we were waiting to use the spa. In all honesty an inconvenience like this, unfortunately tarnished the experience and is not expected from this calibre of hotel. We brought it to the attention of a member of staff at check out but they weren’t really bothered. 

The room itself was very spacious with a wonderful bathroom. It did have a tv at the end of the bath which was a nice feature. There was also a dressing room which was fabulous. The bed was great in size and really comfortable. 

The spa is great. We used it twice during our stay.

This hotel is conveniently located for Waterloo station and also the West End. 

All staff were friendly and as it was Christmas time the decorations were nicely done. ",4,2020,02,08
143,Location and style,"Spent a night at the Corinthia during a Business trip and I was very pleased with everything this hotel has to offer! 
Also went for a fantastic run across the royal parks nearby early morning...great experience as well!",5,2020,02,07
143,Excellent Sunday Lunch,"We went to the Corinthia for Sunday lunch it was absolutely excellent. OK, it was £45pp or £55 with Champagne, for three courses and what a brilliant three courses, not small as you would expect in a hotel of this calibre. Go and give it a whirl",5,2020,02,05
143,Afternoon Tea,"Second afternoon tea here and absolutely outstanding.  Sets a precedent.  Staff are professional, friendly and attentive.  Absolutely faultless.  Food delicious and generous.  Going again at the end of February with a friend.  Wonderful.  Special mention to Giacomo - cannot do enough to help and remembered me from when I went in August.",5,2020,02,03
143,Weekend break,"My husband and I were booked into the Corinthia for a family weekend in celebration of my newly born grand-daughter!

The room we were given was beautiful and I thoroughly enjoyed the heated floor in the bathroom.
All the staff at Corinthia went out of their way to ensure our needs were met -  without being too over bearing.

We enjoyed both the in-room breakfast, which was well presented and also the breakfast in the Northall Dining room. There was a lovely selection in both instances to suit everyone's taste.

Unfortunately, it was too short a stay to enjoy all the amenities offered by this wonderful Hotel but will ensure a longer stay next time we are in London.

I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for luxury with the impeccable service  and standards one would expect.
",5,2020,01,29
143,Business lunch,"I met colleagues for a business lunch. We sat at the bar section. Service was very good. The ambiance is excellent for drinks, high tea or lunch. It is located very centrally in London ao close to everywhere.",4,2020,01,29
143,Spa at Corinthia hotel,"The moment you enter into the Spa, you instantly feel the serenity and  peace. A warm welcome form the receptionist who showed me around . It is a clean and luxurious Spa where you can fully relax and renew. I chose the hot stone massage and I felt so relaxed. I was told that my massage therapist, Ilaria was the most expert so I was  really looking forward to my treatment. I felt so at ease and so relaxed and fell asleep inside the steam room. I have been a fan of Espa products for sometime and I really like the scent and their natural ingredients. They have excellent anti ageing products.
I would highly recommend Espa spa at Corinthia Hotel.
I would highly recommend",5,2020,01,27
143,Wonderful Afternoon Tea,"I recently had the pleasure to try the Afternoon Tea at the Corinthia.
What a nice experience it was!!
Giacomo and Alessio were super nice and very helpful during the whole service and this was not only for our same nationality, the pastries excellent with a large choice and the sandwiches together with the scones were delicious.
The pianist made the atmosphere a real success and he organize us a small celebration plate, very appreciated!!
We will come back for sure and we will recommend it in the future.
Thank youuu!",5,2020,01,27
143,40th Birthday Stay,"Hotel was lovely, staff are very welcoming from the moment we arrived at the door, nothing was too much trouble. Room was extremely clean and had everything you would require. The bathroom was out of this world and the bath was very relaxing. We had breakfast included and it was delicious, all good quality, fresh ingredients. Spa was very well looked after and clean with a lovely ambiance, perfect for relaxing and unwinding. Overall an amazing stay, couldn’t fault it.",5,2020,01,26
143,Not A Five Star,"We stayed at the Corinthia last fall -  it was not up at all to our expectations.  It comes  down to details -  A number of things went wrong - we were caught in one of the lifts,(elevators), with no follow up from the management after the fact about our well being, had dirty complementary favors left on our pillows at night- there was no outlet in the bathroom for my mate to blow dry her hair - She was told instead to use an outlet in the closet which had a mirror - very strange - having to move all the clothes on hangers out of the way to blow dry ones hair. I am a large man and after numerous attempts of calling house keeping and talking to the front desk I could not get a bath robe that fit me - Having to have these conversations was inconvenient, frustrating and embarrassing. In the end  the hotel did not accommodate my request. It may be a problem of the scale of the hotel but that said the Corinthia is no larger than any of  he other major 5 star luxury hotels I have stayed in Ireland , France, India or Bali - Those hotels are superb because they pay attention to the details (down to the granular level).  For the most part the staff at the Corinthia were professionally cordial but we did not see a lot of non smiling faces - It made us wonder if there was a morale issue  -  Also we certainly don't expect everybody to be smiling at us all the time but we did notice that a number of staff appeared to look quite sullen -  There were other issues with the room like parts of light fixtures falling off, horrible foam pillows...fruit that left to go stale in bowls ....again details  - At a certain price point - it's all about the details when distinguishing one hotel from the next .  One last observation is that one of the lobby staff lacked discretion - one day one of the younger doormen rattled on to me about how he did not like some patrons whom he thought were rude to him -  this is not good all around. While it is absolutely wrong for any guest to be rude to the people who are there to assist them - it was completely inappropriate for this doorman to talk to another guest about the issue.  I walked away from that interaction wondering what this individual may be saying about me and other guests at the hotel .

I did have contact with one of the managers post stay - he offered an upgrade on our next visit to London but we thought no - Overall it wasn't horrible at the Corinthia but it was definitely not five star for the reasons I've outlined above. We would not go back.",3,2020,01,20
143,"Wow, a weekend of absolute bliss ","Having just spent a night at this most amazing hotel, I feel compelled to tell everyone about it. We were greeted at the door by the most attentive staff, were checked in immediately and our room was ready even though we arrived early. We had lunch in the Northall which was delicious 😋 followed by a couple of hours relaxing in the spa. This is an absolute must, we have never seen such a mesmerising place and so relaxing. It wasn’t even that crowded. Dinner was in the Northall again which was very nice. We were up early for a jog this morning and we had a lovely chat with the doorman (concierge recommended running routes for us and provided water and towels). Breakfast was fabulous, there was so much choice. We then went out for a walk around town as we had afternoon tea booked and felt the need to burn off some calories! Afternoon tea was superb, they could not do enough for you, we even had complimentary champagne. To top our weekend off we had use of the complimentary chauffeur driven limousine to take us to Westminster Cathedral. I cannot praise the staff enough for their service, it was exceptional and we were so pleased to have the opportunity to speak to them about their life outside of the hotel, they made us feel very special. Hopefully one day we will be back again for another luxurious weekend 🥰",5,2020,01,19
143,Fabulous Afternoon Tea!,"From when you arrive the doorman and others like the florist were so friendly and the flowers everywhere are just amazing along with the pianist!

Only small feedback is the welcome from the lady when we each arrived to the main room, we each said that we seemed an inconvenience for arriving slightly early and quite rudely got shown to the bar to wait. I'm pregnant and got told to wait at the table by the lifts when my friends had already been seated together in the bar, and asking for a glass of water again seemed like an inconvenience for her when I clearly was in need of it! This was a bit of a shame when everyone else we came across was so lovely and friendly!

Apart from this, Paulo looked after our table so well, he was welcoming, attentive and friendly throughout, giving us useful information about the teas, food, hotel and family owners! The china and glass tableware is also worth a mention... All looked fabulous!

Location and food were amazing, they replace sandwiches without asking, the scones were perfect and the sweet trolley had so much choice, we all thoroughly enjoyed it! And as I'm pregnant, Paulo made sure the chef and other waiters knew of this which was a nice touch as nothing seemed too much trouble which made our/my visit more relaxing! I'm also turning 40 so was a nice surprise to get an extra chocolate treat with a candle and birthday message brought out!

We have been meeting annually for afternoon tea for over 12 years now so have been to quite a few of the top hotels and overall I've got to say this is now one of my favourites, will definitely be back! 

Thanks to all the lovely people who made our afternoon so memorable! ",5,2020,01,19
143,The Best Afternoon tea,"As others have already reviewed the Corinthia does not disappoint!! The afternoon was simply superb.
The sandwiches was tasty, the scones as I like them and the cake selection, delicious.  The ambience allows you to totally enjoy this wonderful experience.
Our waiter Luca was engaging and very attentive. The pianist was lovely to have in the background and had the chance to also meet this fellow Australian. I would highly recommend.",5,2020,01,14
143,Afternoon Tea is superb!,"Started with the doorman, who was so pleasant and inviting to the hostess who seated us and took our coats.  Every one was friendly and kind.   Then came our awesome server, Giacomo.... funny, attentive and informative.  He suggested the best teas, promptly attended to every need, never missed a beat and even sent us home with great photos and boxes for our special occasion.  Everyone in the Crystal Moon Lounge made my mother’s birthday special ....from Giacomo, to the pianist to the chef, who made a special birthday plate and gave us complimentary Champagne!   The pianist Kevin even came over and introduced himself and asked her for special requests!   This tea experience was outstanding and beautiful, but not at all stuffy.   The front orchids, entrance, food and tea were just beyond impressive.   Could not pick a favorite sandwich because they were all so good and fresh, cucumber, egg, roast beef, salmon and chicken salad.   Scones, clotted butter and jams were delish, rhubarb and ginger and berry.   The desserts were hard to choose, so we tried one of each, favorite was chocolate mousse Tower and mango layered custard.  Went home stuffed and so impressed!  The China is beautiful and the huge chandelier is made of the same Baccarat crystal as the champagne glasses.   You must try their afternoon tea if you haven’t experienced and ask for Giacomo!  You won’t be disappointed and for $55, you will leave stuffed with a doggie box!   Oh, and make sure you book early!   They take reservations on open table!",5,2020,01,12
143,"Excellence, Excellence, Excellence and the best mattress I've ever slept on.","I stayed six nights on business and a little bit of pleasure and the service provided by the staff - all staff - was fantastic. There wasn't an employee I met that didn't attempt to go out of there way to make sure everything was good.  From the chef, to the housekeeping, to the desk managers, their attention to detail was impressive. The food is very, very good, the accommodations are top-notch, and the people are really what makes this place shine. Sergio at the front desk and Adam from the outdoor courtyard were especially excellent to interact with.  Also, this place has the best mattress I've ever slept on.  EVER.  I don't know why, but it was unquestionably the most comfortable. I no longer consider staying at other hotels when traveling to London.",5,2020,01,11
143,Good choice,"Very good location, coupled with client oriented service and spacious rooms. The Spa is great and opened 24/7. Awesome for business travellers. The breakfast buffet offers lots of choice. If i would need to mention anything „less good“ then i would mention the rather strong perfume smell in the room and corridors. Maybe its due to the carpets, but i think „ less is more „. Anyway, „great job“ Corinthia. You deserve 5 stars!",5,2020,01,10
143,Fantastic hotel for London NYE fireworks,We chose this hotel for it’s location for the London NYE fireworks as it’s within the blue zone.  This means you can literally step outside a few minutes before midnight onto the Embankment and do not have to stand outside for hours waiting.  The hotel definitely lives up to it’s five star rating as the service and facilities were all excellent.  Every member of staff we came across was friendly and helpful.  Guests can enjoy using the Espa thermal floor for free so we spent an hour or so there on a couple of afternoons.  We will definitely stay at the Corinthia again next time we’re in London.,5,2020,01,08
143,"Faultless, but I will find something................eventually!","Only for a few nights this time. The staff were very friendly and professional, reception staff and concierge exceptional, as always. I tried Kerridge's Grill for the first time and thourougly enjoyed it, recommend the dry aged rib of beef and selection of artisan cheeses.",5,2020,01,05
143,Refreshed and renewed at the Corinthia spa!,"I had an exceptional experience with my friend at the spa back in December. We booked a 90 minute Swedish massage with Mate and Riccardo who gave us both a detailed breakdown of the treatment. Consistent and caring, they delivered an excellent service in a very relaxing atmosphere. I am dreaming of my next appointment !",5,2020,01,05
143,Another wonderful tea at the Corinthia!,"My daughter and I had a wonderful tea at the Corinthia when we were in London in August 2018. We spent a few days in London over New Years and were so happy to be able to go back to the Corinthia for tea! During this trip, we had tea at several places and this was our favorite. We love everything about it - the setting, the service and the food are outstanding! We really enjoyed the sandwiches (again I had veg and she had meat). The scones are so delicious, and my daughter thinks these are the best she has ever had. The hotel had a special Christmas jam, cherry with whiskey, that was great. We also tried each of the sweets, which were both beautiful and very tasty. Tea here is a great experience, and we look forward to our next visit!",5,2020,01,04
143,BIRTHDAY SUNDAY LUNCH,"I had heard alot of good things about the Corinthia Hotel and had wanted to visit for some time without success. With the occasion of my 60th birthday looming, I mentioned to the family that I would quite like to visit for Sunday lunch. They used to do an unlimited Champagne jazz lunch on Sundays which we were looking forward to. Sadly when we enquired we were told this was no longer available. Anyhow, when we arrived we were greeted by an enthusiastic doorman and a huge Christmas tree! There were beautiful Christmas decorations all around the hotel and it looked very festive. We were then shown to the bar where several Porn Star Martinis were taken. When we were ready to eat we were ushered through to the Northall Restaurant. It was quite small and quiet, just to our liking. We all ordered the roast beef Sunday lunch. Although it was very nice unfortunately, we did have a couple of points about the afternoon which we did not like. Firstly the mains were served in a huge kind of pan at the table. This was left on the table and we had to serve ourselves. All the vegetables were in another pan which again we served ourselves. Also the roast potatoes were quite hard as if they had been cooked and left to sit. Not to our liking. Apart from this we had a nice afternoon. Not sure I would rush back and didn't really live up to my expectations and left us slightly disappointed.

143,It does not get much better,"I was attending World Travel Market and was staying with our team at the Corinthia. 

The whole experience from arrival to departure was perfect. Very friendly and helpful staff, rooms very comfortable. Fantastic bathroom with a really great rain shower. Last but not least a very very complete and tasty breakfast. 

I stay a lot in hotels, but this was a extraordinary experience. It can be considered costly but it’s worth every cent ! 

Recommended if you want a perfect London experience.

143,Simply stunning! ,"We had the most wonderful time at this hotel celebrating our wedding anniversary.

The hotel is beautifully designed and decorated. The scent when you walk in is lovely and our deluxe suite was stunning! 

All of the staff made our stay at the hotel so special. I would particularly like to mention the reception team who checked us in on arrival. So friendly and engaging and made us feel so welcome. This first impression has certainly made a lasting impression. 

I would highly recommend this  hotel and everyone will no doubt enjoy the experience as much as we did.
",5,2019,12,27
143,Thank you for the most memorable last days in London!,"This is a STUNNING hotel. Having visited for dining, drinking, the nail salon and even Christmas Day lunch extravaganza one year a while ago, it was an extreme pleasure to stay here for three nights. It feels glamorous and opulent but not in a garish way. Beautiful!

The smell is intoxicating everywhere you walk, even in the hallways on the way to your room. It is a world of ‘calm’ inside the Corinthia walls!

We were celebrating our international relocation and they put a bottle of Laurent Perrier in the room. So nice. Funnily, this was the hotel, on that Christmas Day so many years ago, that LP became our favourite go-to Champagne - so a very nice touch!! 

Other especially ‘nice touches’ were the lavender bags on the pillow at turn-down, the protein bites in the fridge in the gym and, above all, just the smiling faces on all staff and their pleasant greetings as you walk by them. 

Only three tiny points to mention: a few things were missed during the room services, like dirty coffee cups taken away but not replaced and only one robe replaced not two, the walk in robe automatic light turns off far too quickly and the temperature in the bathroom is excessively hot compared to the room’s main temperature. These small things forgiven, I don’t think you can beat this blissful hotel. We only wish we could have stayed on for Christmas Day to re-live what started our ‘love affair’ with the hotel in the first place. It would have been a dream to have Christmas fare in Kerridge's!",5,2019,12,25
143,Afternoon tea,"The afternoon tea was good, although not as good as in the Ritz. The Christmas decoration was amazing! Ideal for photos, selfies and Instagram :) The service was great, our waitress was kind, not rushing things, careful, always smiling.",5,2019,12,22
143,Afternoon tea,Excellent afternoon tea! festive menu for Christmas which was beautiful. It was my 50th birthday and it was lovely when the pianist came over to ask what tunes I would like! Also a lovely cake from the staff. Absolutely wonderful from start to finish.,5,2019,12,20
143,Amazing Afternoon Tea,"Five ladies battled on the train from Bournemouth during a train strike to get to London for a festive day out. The train was busy and delayed and London was absolutely packed but the afternoon tea at the Corinthia made it all worthwhile. From start to finish it was amazing. 
The hotel looks and feels fabulous. Lovely high ceilinged room with a glass dome with the most beautiful chandelier (one red bulb to match the restaurant’s theme) and lovely decor.  The crockery and champagne flutes that I’d seen on the tv programme did not disappoint. 
The service couldn’t be faulted. Very polite and attentive (even when we were being asked to vacate our table when our time slot was up). 
And the food? Delicious. We were offered additional sandwiches more than once. The scones were warm and moist. The cake choice looked beautiful and tasted as beautiful as they looked (the marshmallows are an interesting but perfect addition). My eyes were bigger than my stomach and I couldn’t eat them all but we got leftovers boxed up to take home. 
If I had to make one small suggestion it would be that egg sandwiches are great without truffle but that’s just my personal taste. 
This is our 7th annual. Christmas Afternoon Tea trip to London and the Corinthia is definitely one I would recommend. ",5,2019,12,19
143,Afternoon tea heaven ,"I took a friend for afternoon tea on Tuesday to celebrate his significant birthday. Not my first visit here and certainly not my last. I love coming here, the service is fantastic, the food sublime and, at this time of year, just Christmasy enough. Without even asking, a replacement was produced for one of the lovely cakes (I'm allergic to pineapple). The pot of hot chocolate was super instead of tea although we hit our sugar overload early! Well worth it though. Come here instead of some of the better known 5* hotels, wipes the floor with them",5,2019,12,19
143,Festive Afternoon Tea at it’s best,"My daughter treated me at the weekend to a festive afternoon tea at the Corinthian Hotel. This was our second visit and we still think it’s one of the best venues in London for afternoon tea.
Marianne was our waitress and really looked after us. 
There was a good selection of sandwiches, followed by plain and fruit scones with amazing jams and clotted cream. After that the fancy cakes arrived. It was a very leisurely experience.

The venue has a really good booking system to ensure that the place is never overloaded with too many people seated at the same time. All the staff were very helpful and the champagne was delicious.

Kevin was playing the piano (without music), excellent pianist he even asked us before he started playing if we had any special requests. The decorations were amazing. We will be back again soon.

143,Afternoon Tea,"Last Christmas I gave my wife a present of afternoon tea at the Corinthia, which she used almost a year later with me as her guest (lucky me).

It was a fantastic experience from start to finish. The staff were polite and very friendly and the whole occasion was a great success.

I can't recommend this hotel highly enough.

All the staff were foreigners and I was told that there were no British people working on on the frontline, as I have always suspected the Brits are work shy and could learn a lot from these people, I salute you all.

Will visit again, many thanks.",5,2019,12,11
143,Heather Small.,"From start to finish. This place is outstanding. On early arrival our bags were very quickly taken from us to our room as we checked in. 

Immediately we were offered a chauffeur to take us to The Gherkin for dinner.  From the concierge to the reception, the chauffeur working on his birthday and beyond. 

I cannot say thank you enough to all the staff at The Corinthia. We even stayed 4 nights instead of 2 we loved it so much.

Thank you. David.",5,2019,12,11
143,A pure weekend of luxury and a weekend of a lifetime!,"I would like to thank all the staff at the Corinthia especially Szabina from the Guest relations team! The weekend was absolutely outstanding from the start.Our room was impeccable, we were given a river suite which was quite the impression as soon as we entered the room, and the spa was brilliant, I found it difficult to leave the hotel! I will certainly be returning.",5,2019,12,10
143,Once In A Lifetime,"If you read my other reviews on this site you will clearly see that the Cointhia is not the ususal sort of Hotel I would normally book into. On this occaision we were celebrating our golden wedding anniverasy and looking for something special and I can honestly say that the Corinthia delivered. From the moment we entered the hotel to the moment we left we were treated as someone special. The hotel staff go out of their way to make you feel comfortable and nothing is too much trouble. Did they get it right all the  time? No but when it went wrong (very minor) it was very quickly put right without a quibble. 
We had a kingsize double room on floor 7 facing inside and even in the middle of London on a Saturday night there was never any noise to disturb us. I asked for a quite room when I booked and that is what I got. Of course you pay for this quality but it is worth it if you are looking for something special.
My congratulations and many thanks to all the staff at the Corinthia.",5,2019,12,10
143,ESPA treatment and spa experience just perfect!,"Today I had a brilliant 90 min Swedish full body massage. The facilities are brilliant and great customer services in the entire building.
Amazing place to relax after a busy week. My massage therapist Matt was great! He explained all the treatment for me and we did choose my massage oil together. He introduced me to the ingredients are in the products, what could be more beneficial for my health and well-being. I would definitely buy the revitalising body oil. Great massage, one of the best I ever had! He also gave me a very detailed advise what shall I do as a home care routine. My skin feels great, thank you Matt! I would definitely come back again.😊 Christina",5,2019,12,09
143,Amazing Afternoon Tea,"Arrived early for our 1pm afternoon tea, we were directed to the bar for a drink. Slow service in the bar and wasn’t sure if we were supposed to go to the bar to order and then to pay, however setting was beautiful and more than made up for it when we had our afternoon tea. We were served by Jacamo who was so attentive and made the whole experience wonderful. He brought extra sandwiches which my husband was thrilled at. Food was fantastic, I was full following my sandwiches and scones. I couldn’t eat most of the cakes and came away with them boxed up. Jacamo picked up on it being my birthday and brought over a cake and candle. Just the whole experience was fantastic and I felt so welcome and comfortable. Great first visit and hopefully we can return and stay at the hotel. ",5,2019,12,09
143,Fabulous afternoon tea,"My husband and I visited the hotel yesterday and enjoyed a splendid afternoon tea. The experience was enhanced by the charming Violetta serving us. She was utterly attentive and so sweet and could not have done anymore for us. At the end of her shift she offered to show us around the hotel. Violetta gave us information about the history of the building as well as details about the restaurants. Thanks to her we are now aware of Corinthia’s excellent bars and restaurants and will definitely come back for drinks and dinner soon.

143,Perfect ,"The most amazing afternoon tea in beautiful opulent surroundings. 
Fantastic teas , sandwiches, cakes and served by wonderful staff. 
We couldn’t get a reservation at the ‘other’ big hotels and this was a second choice but so glad we did it. 
Will be back another time to do it all again and maybe stay the night in what must be amazingly beautiful rooms. ",5,2019,12,08
143,Perfect for celebrating Ruby Wedding Anniversary,"A fabulous experience from arrival to departure. 
Our suite was very well presented with complimentary cake and champagne.
 The spa is accessed by a private lift for guests to allow you to go down ready changed. It is one of the best hotel spas that we have visited, especially the thermal floor. Thoroughly recommend The Corinthia.",5,2019,12,08
143,40th Wedding Anniversary,"We Chose this Hotel as we wanted to do something special for our 40th wedding anniversary. We knew we had made the right choice the moment we walked through the door.This is a world class hotel in every respect,the decor is to a very high standard 
We had a fantastic suite & the service and staff were first class.
We had an excellent evening meal at Kerridge's bar & grill & breakfast in the Northall restaurant.
I will use this Hotel again without hesitation. There are few Hotels with this level of service. My wife took full advantage of the spa facilities & had a lovely time. I found all the staff to be friendly & chatty, and would like to give Sergio The assistant front office manger a special mention for his kindness .
Although we were in central London the atmosphere was of a quite & calm oasis & we were not aware  of any outside noise when in our room.",5,2019,12,08
143,Short Break!!!!!,"We feel we have to leave a review which is something we do not normally do but the way we were treated from the moment the bellman entered our taxi and gracefully took our luggage and was chatting to us as he walked us to reception. Front desks were fully occupied so another lady Sandra escorted us to a plush desk and checked us in. As it was early our room was not ready Sandra took our number and escorted us to the bar,  taking her time to show us round the hotel. We recieved a text saying room was ready and went to settle bar bill with Kyht (Bar Manager who made us feel most welcome everytime we were in bar, always stating how welcome we were and to come back soon) and were kindly told the drinks were on the house. Room was amazing I must really thank Sandra who gave us a free upgrade and a beautiful view of the London Eye for making our weekend. Since we had the extra space in the executive room we decided to order the champagne breakfast, service and food outstanding again. We ate at Kerridge's which was fantastic and had a truly wonderful couple of days. The only negative is we had no time to use the spa facilities and we wil be definitely returning for a 4 or 5 day spa break. This must be the best hotel in London with the best customer service, cannot wait to return !!!!!!!",5,2019,12,05
143,5 Star Delight,"This hotel is situated in a great location for shopping,Security and Service,The hotel is stunningly finished and our suite was very nice and spacious ,The staff were very helpful and went out of there way to help.They sell the nicest Champagne glasses we have ever seen made out of the same glass as the very large impressive chandelier in the central part of the hotel,the bed was large and very comfortable,everything you expected was there in our suite they also gave us some delicious macaroons for brought to our room,the next day we given a late check out,I couldn’t fault this hotel and would definitely recommend it to anyone ",5,2019,12,04
143,Best spa hotel in london ,"I did a 90 minutes relaxing massage with a therapist called Monica and she's the best therapist I've ever met. She explained what the massage chosen consists in and the product she will use. I highly recommend her. I also liked the facilities and especially the changing area.

",5,2019,12,03
143,Claire Birthday ,Best customer friendly staff and service ever received 🔝...thank for making this resting break so special ...the concierge service was the best you could receive ...well done for the amazing atmosphere 🙏🏻,5,2019,12,02
143,Afternoon tea,"Ok. So I could not book the Ritz for the time that I wanted so came up with this place and glad I did. It was my birthday and I took my wife and daughter out to London for the day via Hatton Garden where I blew a couple of grand on a pair of diamond earrings for them to share. So we jumped tube trains and did Oxford Street (oh the crush) went to the national portrait gallery (enlightenment) and then completed the short walk to the Corinthia. You know, if some one asked you to name 5 star hotels then like me you would probably come up with maybe 3 including the Ritz and Savoy but not this place. Well let me tell you that the Corinthia is at least equal to the Ritz and in some ways better. They collect your coats from the table and bring them back to you at the table. The petit fours are a work of art and exceedingly better than the Ritz. Finger sandwiches are finger sandwiches wherever you go but the additions at the Corinthia beat the Ritz for the same prices. The waiting staff are excellent and really make you feel like one of the family. The lighting is exquisite, the seating is plush and I quite honestly could not think of one negative aspect of our visit.",5,2019,12,01
143,Perfect romantic stay ,We had a great time in London. Nice quiet hotel big rooms nice breakfast. Also nice gym and welness although a bit dark. Very busy at Saturday we had to wait 30 min for breakfast that is the only feedback we have from this top hotel. Also nice and good stuff.,5,2019,12,01
143,Just visiting the hotel,"Myself and my friend wanted to see the hotel and came in to have a look for the first time. What a beautiful place this is. There is such a nice scent when you walk in and true genuine smiles from all the staff. What was so great is that we ended up at the Northall Restaurant and the hostess, not to sure of the name but had brown hair and wearing red uniform was so nice and welcoming and asked us if there was anywhere else we would like to see and took the time to show us to the other restaurant ( Kerridges) I cannot explain how professional and friendly she was. Hopfully will be coming to enjoy afternoon tea at some point.",5,2019,11,26
143,Overpriced and Overrated,"We did have very high expectations for this hotel, especially as it was £600 per night, why wouldn't we, but unfortunately it didn't deliver.

When we arrived our cab accidentally dropped us off at the rear entrance not the front and there was no-one there to meet us to help with our luggage, meaning we had to drag them up the stairs to get to the reception. When we mentioned it at check in we were just told 'the taxi should have known better'.

The room we were allocated had a window which faced another brick wall so the room was very dark and dingy, despite it being a glorious sunny day. The room was however very well appointed with a huge bathroom in good order but the cushions on the bed were very thread-bare and had seen better days. One of the night stands was positioned half on the floor and half on the carpet so it wobbled around so much a glass of Champagne ended up all over the floor. There is tea provided in the room however there is no kettle? Only a Nespresso machine but you can't make tea with a coffee machine as it just ends up tasting of coffee! 

Prior to arrival I had requested a feather pillow as I have a bad neck, and I am always happy to bring my own but I was assured the hotel had some available. At check in we were told all the feather pillows had been removed from the room and replaced with non-feater as requested? I explained that this was a mix up but no problem can they just provide what I had asked for. Unfortunately I had to ask for them a further 3 times before they eventually arrived. And all the pillows were AWFUL, probably the worst pillows I have ever experienced in a hotel. The hypo-allergenic synthetic pillows were lumpy and worn and the feather pillows were not down but some cheap nasty feather with stabbing quills. They were soooo bad I thought it was some sort of a joke that we were given them in such an expensive hotel?

Breakfast is incredibly expensive (£40.00 - £50.00 each depending on what you have) and there is no complimentary bubbles, anything extra has to be paid for. The bar staff are however very friendly and the cocktails are good.

To top it off we only got an evening turn down on one night, it seemed they couldn't be bothered on the other night and we were left no drinking water. This is very poor for a hotel of this standard. 

In all our impression of this hotel is that it's all bling and no substance.",3,2019,11,26
143,Absolutely INCREDIBLE ,My boyfriend booked a stay for me as a surprise for my 50th birthday. From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty. Every member of staff new it was my birthday. The room was amazing. Our meal at a Kerridge’s was perfect. I met Tom Kerridge who gave me a signed book. We had afternoon tea and Giacomo was so kind & hospitable. I can’t wait to return!!!! Thank-you!!!,5,2019,11,25
143,Amazing Amazing Amazing ,"Persuaded by Jo Chandler at Luxury Worldwide Collection to book this hotel for my Partners Birthday, she even managed to get us a booking at Kerridge’s Bar and Grill which is part of the Hotel.  Thank you Jo Chandler and the Corinthia.  Our stay was amazing, the hotel is classy, tasteful and luxurious, the attention to detail both in presentation and when dealing with their guests is unbeatable.  The Christmas decorations and the warmth that the hotel lobby area and afternoon tea area oozes reminds me of being in a feel good Hollywood Xmas movie.  The rooms are spacious and comfortable, and you want for nothing, it’s all been thought of long before we arrived.  The breakfast offers everything, if you opt for a cooked breakfast the chef cooks to demand and is delicious.  And finally the gym and spa are by far the best and worth a visit just to experience the bliss and opulence.  Amazing experience, can’t wait to return.  ",5,2019,11,25
143,Great place to stay,Well located everything is near by. Fanradtic hotel great rooms excellent staff. Nothings to much trouble above and beyond is their mantra ! So yes pricey but 100% worth it. Just enjoy and relax. Great bars and resauraunts just eat drink and be merry,5,2019,11,23
143,Incredible experience at the Corinthia Hotel spa,"I went with a friend to the Espa Life at the Corinthia and I was left totally relaxed and thoroughly impressed. From the moment you step into the spa complex you are immersed in luxury and stunning attention to detail throughout. The reception staff were very friendly, polite and ready to help with anything we might have needed. 

Before the treatment that I was booked for, an hour long full body massage, we were able to enjoy the many amenities offered in the spa. The jacuzzi has numerous settings to enjoy whilst the steam room and sauna are well designed, elegant spaces. The dim lighting and dark marble tiles are perfectly suited to create a deep sense of relaxation away from the hustle and bustle of city life in London. 

The massage itself (with the brilliant masseuse Carina) was a truly soothing experience. I can't recommend highly enough! The only shame was that it was just an hour long. For anyone searching for an evening of peace and quite, the Espa Life at the Corinthia is the perfect place to go.",5,2019,11,21
143,Luxury spa experience,"My daughter and I were treated to a lovely day out at the spa. We had a delicious
lunch with champagne, and then we both had a really relaxing body and face
massage,by two very charming and friendly girls (my skin still feels lovely and
soft after a few days!) We then relaxed in the comfortable Sleep Pods. All the staff
were extremely welcoming and friendly, and it was a really memorable experience.
I recommend the Corinthian Hotel and Spa for any special occasion.",5,2019,11,21
143,A most luxurious and relaxing experience,"As it was our 30th Wedding Anniversary, we splashed out on a night at the Corinthia and a night at the Shard.
The Corinthia is one of the most excellent and well run hotels in London. Exceptional atmosphere with a stunning selection of food and drink, accompanied by very charming and courteous staff.
Our room was very spacious and comfortable and we arrived to find a bottle of chilled champagne and cake, with a personalised letter celebrating our 30th. How nice is that:)
The highlight was undoubtedly the spa experience, which literally 'blew our minds'. Beautifully lit, warm, relaxing and utterly sumptuous as we hoped it would be, however, this surpassed even our wildest dreams. We will be back.
Overall, nothing to fault with this Hotel and is HIGHLY recommended (as is its parent hotel in Malta).",5,2019,11,21
143,luxury in the middle of action,"The stay at this hotel met and exceeded all expectations. We were upgraded upon arrival free of charge. The suite was spacious, elegantly designed with marvel bathrooms, and quite a few hi-tech features.  Breakfast was included in our rate, and it provided abundant choices. The service was top notch at this hotel. Any question, inquiry was never a problem for anyone. Lastly, Corinthia is located in the middle of the action. Trafalgar Square, Thames, and London Eye are just a few yards away. Although it is a very costly place, the experience is worth the pounds spent.",5,2019,11,18
143,Flawless and amazing experience,"I had an amazing stay at the Corinthia. The service is flawless and the facilities super luxurious, whether the spa, the afternoon tea and the suite, I really felt spoiled and relaxed, the real definition of luxury",5,2019,11,18
143,First Class all the way!,"We’ve just been for a festive afternoon tea at the Corinthia Hotel.  We’ve stayed at the hotel before and have enjoyed dinner in the Northall as well as Tom Kerridge Bar and Grill.  The experience at the Corinthia is second to none.  Beautiful decor, excellent food and first class service.   I enjoyed the best gluten free afternoon tea I’ve ever had and my husband and son thought the food was wonderful.  It has the lovely ambience - soft piano music throughout but a great buzz about the place.  Special thanks to Paulo who made us feel so welcome.  He was completely charming and his service is impeccable.  Thank you so much for such a memorable day.  ",5,2019,11,17
143,Afternoon Tea,"Spent a lovely afternoon having Afternoon Tea. The service and staff were impeccable. They were quick to answer any questions. And no request was  too small.
My only point, please note that you are only allowed one hour and forty five minutes per sitting. And they rushed you along.   So we went to the bar and had a drink.",5,2019,11,16
143,Wonderful afternoon tea,"My wife and I recently visited the Corinthia Hotel for Champagne afternoon tea. Wonderful elegant Christmas decorations in keeping with the hotel style. Delightful venue, plenty of space around the tables, elegant but relaxing. Very welcoming staff throughout. Our waitress was delightful, interactive, recommending teas to suit our tastes, answering questions and catering for our every need without ever being imposing.  We would love to come back again and would definitely stay at the hotel on this basis. Great location as well, being just a couple of minutes walk from the River Thames, Trafalgar Square etc. Good transport links especially for the tube, being close to Embankment station.",5,2019,11,16
143,Made to feel special!,"This is a fantastic hotel, beautiful surroundings from the lobby to the restaurants and of course the spa. The room was pure luxury!
We celebrated our anniversary treat with two nights in the Corinthia and dinner in Kerridges which was one of the best meals we have ever had. Expensive - yes but worth every penny in our opinion!
Superb service from all the staff from the minute we checked in to checking out, our only disappointment was that we couldn't have stayed longer!",5,2019,11,16
143,Champagne Tea at the Corinthia Hotel,"We booked the champagne tea at the Corinthia Hotel for our Mum and Dad’s s 50th Golden Wedding Anniversary.  It was a difficult choice with so many great hotels to choose from and we did not want to be disappointed. We needn’t have worried. We had such a wonderful time!  The food was absolutely delightful - especially the salt beef and horseradish sandwiches and the scones (they were exquisite!). Then came along the dessert trolley.  Wow!  The presentation is something else and the hard work that has gone into making this the wonderful occasion it is, is apparent.  Fabulous food, fabulous surroundings and extra fabulous service.  However, I need to mention Paolo and Claudia.  Paolo was informative, courteous and very entertaining.  As for Claudia, well... my mum adopted her (more-or-less) by the end of the night.  She is absolutely delightful!  Nothing was too much trouble for either of them and as beautiful as the Corinthia is, it just wouldn’t have been the same without those two.  They made the afternoon.  My mum and dad (and both me and my sister) had the most amazing afternoon. Thank you.  There is one other person, I should mention, but unfortunately, I didn’t get her name.  She has blonde hair and wear glasses and checked us in when we arrived for the tea. She also took my mother’s arm, when she needed the “rest room”, as she’s a little unsteady on her feet. No one asked her to but she noticed right away and escorted her all the way. I loved that. 
I would, without hesitation, recommend tea at the Corinthia.  It’s truly wonderful.",5,2019,11,15
143,Corinthia London- the ONLY hotel to stay at in London,"We have visited this property before and again our stay was AMAZING!
The property is located walking distance to EVERYTHING; London Eye, Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, museums, theaters, great restaurants, & China Town.  We had a car service but we also walked around town a lot since being so close & the weather was great for October.  The Corinthia has so much happening inside this beautiful hotel;  we celebrated a birthday by having afternoon tea (PERFECTION), we had dinner at KERRIDGE'S Bar & Grill what a great experience of flavors, breakfast daily at the THE NORTHALL, the best made to order omelets, we had a free night and the concierges suggested the theater/play.   We ended up seeing 2 plays and they were able to get us the BEST seats.  The hotel itself is perfection, but it the staff that gives this hotel HEART!  Everyone from is so very nice and always there to assist.  There is one person who who cant say enough about, SZABINA, she is the Guest Relations Supervisor.  She created a transformational experience for us that so very unexpected.  She is very kind from the heart. I also must not forget the flower shop, WOW!!! They do AMAZING work and again the flowers designers so so very nice and outgoing.  We stayed at this property for 5 days and would LOVE to live there.  This is the perfect hotel for for everything & I want to THANK everyone there for making our stay amazing!  I will ONLY stay at the Corthinthia while I am in London!",5,2019,11,14
143,Simply One of the Best Hotels In the World,"My wife and I travel about 1/3 of the year, and try to stay in the best hotels, whether that is an Aman, Belmond, Oberoi, Penisula etc..... so our standards are not easy...

This Hotel simply cannot be surpassed....

The staff is flawless, they know that balance of being there when you need them, versus being too close...  the rooms and hotel are spotlessly cleaned.

The Room is one of the best designs we have come across (we stayed in the one bedroom looking outward toward the city).  The room had a separate hallway, walk in closet, bathroom with heated floors, and seperate bedroom......   but what made it all the more spectacular wa the longer we were in the room, the more details we noticed...e.g. the layers of marble.. the vases.. the coffee table books..... and the best rain shower we have ever experienced.. ..... the bed was dreamy and the linnen count must be ridiculously high... 

The breakfast was amazing... just the right amount of choices, laid out artistically ... great juice combinations, and breads.. pastries.... and the to order breakfast (I had the eggs benedict with smoked salmon every day)..was delightful.

Now... as if that were not enough, the spa is four floors... with a design they must have spent millions on.. there is a seperate heated lane pool... a large jacuzzi pool with differing jet amenities... sauna  and steam room that are stunning... even an ice basin to scrub your body.  My wife and I used the spa facilities every day, and had massages.. both excellent...

This is our new go-to in London.

In terms of the staff, I would like to specifically complement Silvano and Anna in the breakfast room.... their smiles and service made waking up worthwhile...",5,2019,11,06
143,We wanted to move in to live here!,"We have stayed in many fabulous hotels, but this one truly takes the cake. The bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom was spacious and had lots of marble. The tv used Google Cast enabling us to cast movies from my iPad to the tv. The restaurant where breakfast is served has large windows for people-watching and the food is fabulous. The bar/brasserie is gorgeous, and offers many wines and spirits. Alex is our favorite hotel staff member. He provided us with great directions and tips for touring. This is our new home away from home.",5,2019,11,05
143,Grand style hotel with massive hall and exceptional quality communal areas,Located in a convenient quiet spot. Exceptional service in the communal areas. An extremely comfortable spot to meet people in the communal areas. The main hall is richly decorated and has very high ceiling. ,5,2019,11,05
143,Afternoon Tea!!,"Fantastic tea and even better service! My only complaint is that we waited too long to pay at the end. The value for the price paid was great. The sandwiches were delicious and we were offered additional ones before the scones came out. I’ve had better scones, but I did enjoy the rhubarb jam that accompanied them. The desserts were plentiful. They brought over a cart and asked which you’d like to try. We tried them all and they were all good. My favorite was the éclair. Before the tea, I had never tasted an éclair that I liked. My tea was really good. I wanted to try something different and chose the Kooibos Tea. Our tea was refreshed about halfway through and someone was always around to refill our tea cups. I appreciated that because the tea pot was extremely heavy. We were a party of 2 and loved the seating along the side of the wall. I will definitely return on my next trip to London.",5,2019,11,04
143,A perfect escape and celebration,"My friend's husband bought her a spa day for 2 to this fabulous hotel for a "" special"" birthday, and I was lucky enough to get to share this experience.
Right from our arrival we were made to feel special! The staff were so warm and welcoming!
The first treat was an upgrade on our twin room!
The room was gorgeous!! And waiting for us was an ice bucket with Champagne, and a bowl of fruit.
Shortly after, we opened the door to be greated with a beautiful gateau with a birthday message, and another ice bucket of champagne!!
We then headed to the gym, to burn off enough calories for the treats.Again, a warm greeting and a tour....the fridge has coconut water, chilled drinks and healthy snacks to enjoy....and the gym was squeaky clean and well equipped.
Our voucher included a delicious champagne lunch ( bit of a theme here!!) , after which we enjoyed the Spa
And wow....it's amazing!!! Black marble, dim lights, pools...incuding a bubble tub pool .. saunas, heated relax beds..and sleep pods!
Our day also included 2 treatments ... a massage and a facial.
The massage was the best one that I have ever had, by Rosie...and I have had many, around the world ... she used hot stones and a personalised oil...sublime!!
After this massage, I slept for 2 hours in a sleep pod....bliss!!
We had dinner in Tom Kerridge's restaurant .. sublime!! The crispy egg starter, steak and White Choc and Peanut Butter Paris
 Brest was utterly divine!
After a great night's sleep in their famous Hypnose beds, we enjoyed a delicious buffet breakfast and a choice off the cooked menu too.
Checkout was also warm amd friendly...
So thankyou, Corinthia and Staff, for a truly memorable stay....We will be back !! 

Great migjt's",5,2019,11,04
143,Best hotel in London!,"TOP Service experience. Best comfort in rooms. The Spa is a highlight
Super quality of F&B in both restauants. Nice bar to hang out at night. Overall the best atmosphere at hotels in London I experienced. Highly recommended!",5,2019,11,02
143,Step Back In Time?,"Very disappointing to have to re-write this - as all of the locations/concessions are a part of the hotel and not separate businesses. I strongly suspect the hotel complained in order to get the review removed! I've re-posted it below as before.

Considering how new this hotel is in the London scheme of things, I can't help feeling that it's becoming increasingly stuffy and old fashioned in it's approach. There was a glimmer of hope, I felt, last year as the Tom Kerridge restaurant opened but having dined there with friends last weekend, I can confirm that even taking into account the more casual remit there, the service lacked a certain polish that you'd expect for the money (incorrect cutlery, a forgotten drink etc.) In the Bassoon cocktail bar on the other side of the hotel, we were subjected to live music, which made you feel like you were in a cheesy vegas hotel. It seemed to be putting people on edge, we ordered drinks and departed swiftly on to somewhere else to spend the rest of the evening. I note the Northall has been getting favourable reviews in this weekend's paper, so there is some hope yet. It's local to work and convenient, so I do hope they can up their game across the board.",2,2019,11,01
143,Espa at Corinthea hotel London,"Amazing service , fantastic staff and a great experience. If you want to feel special then look no further than Corinthia. We were spoilt from arrival to departure. Espa at Corinthia is so beautiful you’ll feel totally relaxed. Just bring a swimsuit!! 👌🏽",5,2019,10,30
143,Best Hotel,Without doubt best hotel experience I have had from start to finish. Always wanted to stay since I watched the TV serious and did not disappoint. I Wanted to thank all staff that made us feel special. Can’t wait to go back it was like a little slice heaven. Just for the record we stayed in a same rated hotel the night before in the same area and it wasn’t even close to the Corinthia experience.,5,2019,10,29
143,One night in a small room...,"Late in-early out, luckily as the room ,for that price, was very very tiny. I did not felt comfortable at all at that room. Bathroom charger did not work. However, the inroom early breakfast worked well. ",3,2019,10,29
143,Dinner at Northall,Me and my Cousin visited The Northall restaurant for dinner recently and the I must say the service and food was excellent. We were looked after by Sebastia and Rory and both were very attentive and knowledgeable. Exceptional service.,5,2019,10,29
143,Cream tea,"First visit to the corinthia for a delightful cream tea . The staff were all marvellous, so helpful, friendly and polite . They really made it so special for us . Thank you very much we will definitely recommend friends and family to come and experience it for themselves.",5,2019,10,27
143,a wonderful afternoon tea,"Had the pleasure of spending afternoon tea here with my family this afternoon. This hotel is truly beautiful, set in a lovely location. On arrival we were greeted warmly and shown to our table. Exquisite table settings, we opted for the champagne afternoon tea. 
The finger sandwiches on offer were scrumptious, a great variety and plentiful. You'll find yourself getting full so save room for the delightful cakes! A wide selection of tea is available, may I suggest the dragonwell green tea for any green tea lovers. Simply divine. We would like to extend our thanks to our server Luca, you were an absolute star, so welcoming and attentive. We enjoyed chatting to you and sharing our love of Italy. If you are looking for an afternoon tea experience then look no further. Corinthia London is the place to be!",5,2019,10,27
143,Lovely hotel with the best spa,"We stayed at this hotel December 2018 over Christmas as a couple.
Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We decided to do a spa day with some treatments. The spa is beautiful and exceptionally clean. Treatments were amazing and would highly recommend. A massage and scrub. 
Rooms are a good size ( standard room) with a lovely bathroom with a good size bath. Room service menu was lovely with allergies catered to. They have a movie night menu with popcorn and nachos which is pretty cool.

Breakfast was very nice, extensive things to order from menu. 

We did not try the restaurant  in the hotel as we had made other bookings. 

Highly recommend this hotel in terms of service and facilities and would return.",5,2019,10,26
143,Awesome hotel...,Not a great deal to say about this hotel.. its what a hotel should be in London and has everything. Amazing food and the strangest but relaxing spa (only drawback there is no large swimming pool. 5 star rating easy and worth a stay...,5,2019,10,26
143,Fabulous for cocktails,"Stopped by last weekend for a drink in the bar as a friend said it was worth the detour. She was right! We started with Champagne then hit the lovely cocktails. Wow! So good!! We weren’t all sure what to have, but the Italian gent who served had some great recommendations for us. Shout out to DJ Paula for the great music too, much better than Chiltern!!!",4,2019,10,24
143,Great Cocktails!,"Bassoon Bar is a great place to meet friends for a cocktail after work, they have super-cool DJs on at the weekend too.
Kerridges is worth a visit too for Dinner, though it can be quite rich, you might not want to go out partying afterwards!",4,2019,10,24
143,Fabulous hotel!,"We spent 3 nights at the Corinthia Hotel in London and the whole experience exceeded our expectations from the wonderful young woman who checked us in, Janine, until we departed.  They upgraded us to a beautiful suite, thanks to AX Fine Hotels and Resorts Program.  The breakfasts were wonderful and the staff was excellent.   We will definitely stay here again the next time we're in London.  If you want to be pampered, stay here!",5,2019,10,24
143,25th Wedding Anniversary Celebrations,"On the first weekend of September my husband and I celebrated our silver wedding anniversary, and we certainly celebrated in style.  As we only live outside of london, we are fortunate to drive in regularly for special occasions or just to indulge ourselves with a treat.  We usually stay at Claridges or the Savoy but on this very special milestone my husband decided to surprise me with the Corinthia, and I have to say it did not disappoint one bit! we were fortunate enough to have stayed for 4 nights, all of which i shall have imprinted in my mind for ever, it was perfect, seamless in fact, nothing was too much trouble.  The afternoon tea was simply delightful, the breakfast was exquisite and the resident restaurant, Kerridges, was incredible, we loved every single minute of it, and would highly recommend anyone looking to enjoy the sights of London or just simply have a weekend away for pampering, as they have an Elemis Spa which is incredible, as i had two treatments, which they made sure, at short notice, i could be squeezed in for, so thank you Corinthia for all that you did and for making my anniversary super special xx",5,2019,10,23
143,A perfect proposal ,"I am a complete Hotel Geek and it’s been my dream to stay at the Corinthia for a long time! To have my proposal in the hotel was nothing more than a fairytale. 

From the moment we walked through the door wet from the rain the Hotel Staff were nothing but polite and welcoming. We were taken to the check in desk by a member of the concierge and had a lovely greeting, we were asked if we were celebrating a special occasion; little did I know how big the occasion would be! 

The Room was absolutely incredible, the bathroom of dreams! Decorated and cleaned to such a high standard. We used the Spa and again it was absolutely faultless. 

The way in which we returned from Dinner to find the sheer amount of Rose Petals around the room and bathroom with “Will you marry me” on the bed took my breath away. The Champagne and Chocolate Covered strawberries were a perfect finishing touch. 

I will forever be great full to Szabina (Guest Relations Supervisor) and her team for helping my fiancé create such romance and perfect setting for me to say a massive “yes!” How couldn’t I after that! It’s something that I will remember for the rest of my life.

143,Miss Denise Polley,Very nice room...breakfast service was awful with wrong orders that took 30 minutes to arrive. Cocktail bar staff were ignorant. Check out girl looked appalling in a jacket 2 sizes too small..literally busting out of it..not a good last impression,3,2019,10,22
143,My favourite hotel in London,"My review might be biased... I quite simply adore everything about this hotel. Each and every staff member is so helpful and are clearly proud to work at the hotel.  Each visit I stay in a standard room but nothing about the room's furnishings are standard... the bed is so comfortable, the lighting is luxurious and the marble bathrooms are large with great toiletries. The spa is one of London's best kept secrets - it has a beautiful steam room and sauna and the various relaxing pools are unusual and invigorating.  There is nothing better than relaxing on one of the spa's heated loungers!  The Crystal Lounge is a great place for coffee.  An Uber from Paddington Station took about 20 minutes and cost £15. I can't wait to stay at this hotel again.",5,2019,10,22
143,Outstanding stay!,"We were impressed by the warm, calm and professional service from the Corinthia Hotel staff (reception, concierge, in-room/valet, and restaurant).  They even ensured that we got to the airport on time despite peak hour road blockages. Room was ample and luxurious. Northall food and service were superb.  Spa/hydrotherapy pool were fantastic.  We shall be back!",5,2019,10,21
143,birthday treat,"staff were brilliant, even had a small birhday cake waiting for my wife, nothing was a bother will be going back.  ideallysituated for palace, trafalgar sq etc. found some great restraunts near as well",5,2019,10,21
143,Great Hotel,"Stayed here for the 3rd time as we were seeing Only Fools & Horses at the theatre Haymarket, Check In staff and concierge very pleasant and helpful, the staff in Kerridges were a little snooty but on the whole a good experience, the hotel ticks all the boxes!",4,2019,10,20
143,Afternoon tea,"My family and I went for afternoon tea yesterday. We did have to wait to be seated for 15 mins but the staff were very friendly and we were offered complimentary champagne which was very nice.
Having done lots of ‘afternoon teas’ in London and watched the programme we were really looking forward to the afternoon. The China and crystal were beautiful and looked very dramatic. The sandwiches,scones and cakes were also very good.
Overall we had a very nice time and thank you to all the staff who served us.
",4,2019,10,20
143,Magnificent ,"We have just got back from a night at the Corinthia which was my Xmas gift from last year, And my god it was so worth waiting for ! 
From the minute we crossed the road towards the hotel with our overnight bags one of the doormen spotted us and bounded down the stairs to grab my suitcase and give us the warmest welcome ever, we were literally were made to feel  special from that moment by every member of staff we had the pleasure to come across. 
I can’t emphasise enough how amazing every member of this fantastic multicultural team was and they are a credit to the hotel and themselves. From Saturday afternoon until Sunday when we left they made us feel like royalty. 

We had afternoon tea booked which was beautiful, a real taste sensation. The staff were so friendly, helpful and attentive, willing to chat or to be invisible at any moment.
The hotel itself is stunning with a beautiful location on the embankment and not 2 mins walk from the tube. 
We were very lucky from minute one as the hotel in its kindness had upgraded us to a suite and it was one of the nicest hotel rooms I have stayed in and I have been fortunate enough to stay in a good few 5 star establishments. 
I will 100% be returning to this wonderful hotel with the elegant and lively Bassoon bar a must for cocktails and Kerridges bar & grill a stunning room to eat beautiful food in. 
I can’t thank the Hotel enough !!! ",5,2019,10,14
143,Excellent!,"Stayed with my wife for a weekend break.
We had a great time!
Room was excellent, staff were really friendly and bars were great.
Spent some time in the spa, it was awesome. Really chilled out and great facilities. 
All on all we had a wonderful time. It is a bit pricey but worth it as a treat now and again!
Well done guys!",5,2019,10,14
143,Excellent stay!,Excellent experience from start to finnish. Very well appointed room with shower and full bath. Very good room service and choice of retaurant especially The Northall. The spa is second to none. My favorite hotel in London.,5,2019,10,13
143,Wonderful wedding location and planning,"We had our wedding at the Corinthia, so technically it was not a trip. However, I just need to share how fabulous the location is (all our guests emphatically agreed), and how professional, nice, and efficient the events team is! 

Daphne has helped us every step of the way, while Anne took care of any issues during the event, so all of us had an unforgettable and amazing day! We can't wait to return for other occasions!",5,2019,10,10
143,My new London favourite,"Our stay at the Corinthia recently for our wedding anniversary was nothing short of absolutely wonderful.  

From the relaxing afternoon spent in the amazing ESPA spa, where I had a lovely Dr Barbara Sturm facial and my husband had a a wonderful massage, to the great meal in Kerridge's and then post dinner drinks in the Bassoon bar, with great tunes from the inhouse DJ.  The service from everyone was second to none.

We travel worldwide frequently and have also stayed in many top London hotels and I can say without hesitation this is our new London favourite.  In fact, I am just about to book another nights stay for my husbands birthday treat.",5,2019,10,09
143,Afternoon Tea at perfection ,"What one can say when everything is at the top of the top.. 

Starting from the welcoming of the very friendly smiling staff to the attention of detail of the food.. 

No complaints at all. Just enjoyed a wonderful evening with exquisite food. ",5,2019,10,08
143,Afternoon tea with the birthday girl,"Birthday treat for my daughter. Wow what a venue, elegantly designed. I have stayed at the Corinthia hotel in Malta. Loved the interior. We thoroughly enjoyed our afternoon tea. Fab service and lovely sandwiches. Scones still warm with cream and jam. Several cakes as well all delicious. We  took the rest home in boxes provided. We thoroughly enjoyed mum and daughter time there we will definitely be back.",5,2019,10,08
143,Friendly luxury in London,"Plenty of space, king bed, all the details in the decoration and outstanding service.
The buffet breakfast is something you won't want to miss.
The staff is young, friendly and highly proffessional.
The SPA is also something else!!!",5,2019,10,07
143,Not what it should be,"The building is impressive and the location to central London is very convenient, but to me, what makes a hotel a luxury hotel is the service.  A couple of examples- the phones did not seem to be working very well.  When I tried to call to book an appointment at the spa, I couldn't get through.  I went down to the concierge and asked them to book it for me, and they told me to do it myself!  The first time we tried to order room service, the kitchen told us they would call us back.  They never did.  We finally called them back and had to scream our order into the phone because it wasn't working properly.  This happened numerous times.  The food in the restaurants is good but the service was poor.  Most of the time they would forget to bring part of our order and they were extremely slow and disorganized. The general impression I had was that I was staying at a ""hotel school"" where the staff are students still learning their trade and not quite sure of what they are doing.  

I don't think we'll be staying here in the future.",2,2019,10,07
143,Timeless elegance and comfort,"Corinthia London is amazing! The attention to detail is second to none. The rooms are spacious, comfortable and spotless whilst the other areas of the hotel: restaurants, lobbies are stunning. The spa is out of this world and offers total relaxation. A massive thank you goes to Pauline and Antonina who went out of their way to make sure our stay was as pleasant as possible. The restaurants offer different cuisines to suit all tastes, although we did miss Massimo! As for the location.....it couldn't be more central and yet away from the hustle and bustle of London life. Can't wait to be back!!",5,2019,10,07
143,Just Stay Here!,"What is special about the Corinthia is the staff.  They are totally devoted.  We asked to change our room because of a metal plate on the street that cars banged over all night.  And they said ""oh, so sorry, we will fix that right away"".   They changed our room within hours.  The staff takes full responsibility for fixing any problem you have.

The rooms are luxuriously comfortable, particularly the bathrooms.  Check out the hot tubs and pool.  You will feel Roman!

Our only complaint - not unique to the Corinthia - is the noise at the Basson Bar.  It is stunning - the only place to get a bite to eat in the hotel after 10pm.  Both nights we visited after 10pm the bar was playing music so loudly that I believe the wait staff will be a special burden on the UK health system in 30 years.  WE ARE POSITIVE that no one wants this noise. Unfortunately it drove us away.

Bar or not, we will be back to the Corinthia (can't wait!).",5,2019,10,06
143,True luxury,"What an amazing luxurious hotel! 
We were checked in by the lovely Pauline whose smile and warm welcome set the tone for the entire stay. The room was spotless and well-furnished and even had a walk-in wardrobe, the bathroom floor was heated and the bathtub was one of the biggest I have ever seen. The spa deserves special mention, from its amazing therapists who know what it means to deliver truly five star service, to its thermal floor where we ended up staying for a few hours. Our breakfast was so generous, it seems that Corinthia definitely knows that it's the most important meal of the day, and Christina in the breakfast restaurant is a delight! 
We cannot wait to come back!!!",5,2019,10,06
143,Fabulous Afternoon Tea ,"Decided to try afternoon tea at the Corinthia and was pleasantly surprised.  Service was fantastic, we had a lovely Italian waiter, nothing was too much trouble.  The surroundings are stunning.  Afternoon tea was delicious and plentiful (seconds are offered if you have room).   We had vegetarian, pescatarian and gluten free in our party and all were well catered for.  No pressure on time too, I think we were the last booking of the day at 4.30pm but spent several leisurely hours enjoying our afternoon tea and the warm atmosphere.   ",5,2019,10,05
143,Splendid hotel in a great location for business ,This is a really nice hotel on Northumberland avenue and perfect for business meetings if you come into Waterloo or work in Westminster. Really impressed with the service with every member of staff really polite and helpful.  Hotel is beautifully designed and a really lovely experience.,5,2019,10,05
143,Good not great,"Stayed at Corinthia for a few nights on business. Overall compared to other 5 stars in London I found the following not quite up to par:

- the decor in the rooms is quite dated (old carpets, a lot of knicknacks); bathrooms are very good though
- the lobby area is quite messy so  it doesn't feel as quiet and exclusive as 5* usual do
- food overall isn't as good as for instance the Four Seasons
- service is good but not as good as Four Seasons for instance and they are sometimes over or understaffed.

The gym is small but very well equipped. The spa area is also a decent size and with good/clean facilities. However in the changing rooms there are no products or hair straighteners etc., that are now common in most upscale gyms/spa.",4,2019,10,03
143,Perfect as always,"We have stayed in all of the top hotels in London but do not bother going anywhere else now.  

The level of service and attention to detail is excellent, The fabric oft he hotel is perfect and the thermal floor a sanctuary

Above all this, however, are the staff who to a person are at the pinnacle of what they do",5,2019,09,30
143,Some “refreshing” could take place,"Currently staying, rm 332. Have stayed 5-6 times in past. We love this hotel, and it’s 1 out of the 5 we stay at, but have noticed this stay, some aspects of our room looking “tired.” The carpets are looking dirty, worn, frayed on edges. Curtains wonky, not all attached properly on rod. Hardware on bathroom tap has come off of faucet and not fixed etc. I have photos, if I can will attach.",4,2019,09,30
143,Luxury at its best!,"My friend and I stayed for 5 unforgettable nights at Corinthia. The hotel is simply amazing. We had an executive room that came with a very spacious walk in closet, which for us was the best part in the beautiful spacious room. We were attended to by the friendliest most professional staff. I would like to specially thank Janin for her professionalism, loving beautiful smile, and her assistance in making our stay the most comfortable. She was always checking on us making sure that the hotel serves every request we have. The hotel is huge with lovely interiors and high ceilings. The spa is one of the best in London. My friend tried their massage and really loved the experience.

Highly recommended hotel  and will definitely stay there again.",5,2019,09,26
143,Pre theatre meal,"Very nice enjoyed it. What a treat. My wife and I enjoyed the food and excellent service  have not been to this hotel before next time will stay overnight.
Theatre menu very good and they dealt with gluten free  well",4,2019,09,26
143,Best hotel in London.,"Been coming here every year for the last 5-6 years.  There’s no better place to stay.  Beautiful hotel, excellent rooms, attentive staff, great dining options and a great location for exploring London.  Been a lot of places, and this one is definitely at the top.",5,2019,09,24
143,Excellent location,This was the first time to stay in this hotel.  Read a lot of positive reviews before booking it.  Certainly didn’t disappoint me. It’s a luxurious wonderful hotel with excellent location. The room is very clean and quiet.  All the staffs are very friendly and make you more than welcome.  The food in the hotel is very delightful as well.  It’s so convenient to go out to do shopping etc. Plenty good shops are just in walking distance. In general very pleased with the stay and certainly will stay again.,5,2019,09,24
143,A 5 star hotel and a perfect afternoon tea with 7 star service!,"This was a special birthday treat from my sister and two friends and she had booked traditional afternoon tea in the Crystal Moon lounge.
We are all Afternoon Tea professionals,haven eaten many all around the world in amazing hotels, and had high expectations, especially as two of the guests had visited previously.
From being warmly welcomed by the uniformed doormen, to being guided to our table by friendly and attentive staff, we all were made to feel so welcome.
The tinkling of the pianist blended into the beautiful surroundings and when we saw the amazing cake trolley, we had to go up and speak to the pastry chef who proudly informed of the 'new Season' pastries he had created.
Our table setting was immaculate, with beautiful china, perfectly weighted cutlery and linen and, of course,the most incredible Baccarat crystal flute glasses.
Even though we had not ordered any Champagne, we were all kindly offered, with the hotel compliments, a glass of the delicious Champagne - so generous,un-expected and appreciated by us all.
What followed for the next two hours was sheer joy- from the delectable finger sandwiches (Egg and truffle oil and Tandoori chicken with raisens and apple were my favourites), warm fluffy plain and vine fruited scones with clotted cream, strawberry and Rhubarb with Letsea Cubeba (a type of Japanese ginger) jam and then the dessert trolley was wheeled in front of us!
There followed a prosession of delectable pastries, such as lemon drizzle cake, a salted caramel and pecan fancy,a choux eclair with pear, cinnemon and orange, a fig, marscapone cream on a Bretpn Sable biscuit with even a glass of rice pudding with mango compote, coconut to finish off.Oh, and I almost forgot the homemade marshmallows, Red apple,Rosewater and Orange blossom which were layered in a glass vase and snipped off with scissors!
Naturally the tea selection was amazing, with all types of coffee being offered and we finished off with hot chocolate. Even that came with a side plate of marshmallows, cream and white and dark chocolate shards.
If you are still reading through this menu, I am writing it so descriptively because the whole afternoon tea was a feast for our eyes as well as our stomachs - however, it almost paled into insignificance compared with the incredible service we received, especially from Luca (our waiter), Aris (the manager) and finally, Kevin, the superb pianist who floated around the room, in between playing beautifully on the Steinway piano, and chatted with any guests who wanted to.
Kevin was so interesting and a most perfect representative for the hotel, informing us of its background history and his own interesting career.
The whole afternoon just flew by, but, most incredibly, as were we were leaving, Aris and Luca then presented us all with a Corinthia bag full of delectable goodies to take back on the train ,as I mentioned the lack of a buffet car on it when we arrived and to apologise for being so greedy!!
This was just above and beyond anything we had ever experienced and completely made our day.
Thank you so much for Mr Thomas Koch, for you attention to detail in every aspect of the hotel (and still being so respected by all the staff).
Thank you to all the incredible waiting staff, chefs,florists, kitchen staff, housekeeping and especially to the Baccarat glass washer !!!
Teamwork indeed and a model of perfection to the hotel industry!",5,2019,09,24
143,An outstanding 5 star luxury hotel in a great location,"I recently completed a wonderful 8 day stay at the Corinthia Hotel in London.  Staying in a luxurious high end hotel is one of the things I enjoy most when on vacation and as this was my first trip to London I spent a great deal of time researching all of the top 5 star hotels.  After much consideration, I decided upon the Corinthia Hotel based on its location, the beautiful rooms and suites, and online reviews.  I had arranged for airport transfer through the hotel and upon arrival the driver was there waiting for us.  Check-in was very efficient as Tom at the front desk took care of us right away, and Sandra from guest relations then introduced herself and took us on a tour of the property and our Garden Suite.  Our suite was lovely and spotlessly clean, the decor and furnishings were beautiful, the bed very comfortable, and the bathroom very luxurious.  The location of the hotel is also excellent as although it is very close to many top attractions, it was in a quieter section of the area, which was a definite plus.  We had breakfast both at the beautiful Northall Restaurant and also through room service, and both were excellent with a large variety of fruits, cereals, yogurts, pastries, juices, and hot items.  The spa is also the largest in London and had a very nice pool and large jacuzzi jetted second pool as well.   We were very happy that we chose the Corinthia Hotel and had a wonderful stay, and would definitely choose to stay there again the next time we are in London.",5,2019,09,23
143,Very good,"This is a very good hotel right in the heart of London. Magnificent premises, excellent service and great comfort. The rooms are spacious, clean and well equipped. The bathroom is great combining shower and bath. Very good sound isolation, excellent linens and perfumes in the hotel. The breakfast is good, although could have been better.",4,2019,09,22
143,Delicious Tea !,"We had a lovely tea today with all the fanfare of a 5 star hotel in a beautiful room..
The tea was delicious  , excellent scones ,wonderful pastry 
and the best server named Pieter Timmer , he was fantastic serving our tea with finesse and enthusiasm. 
I highly recommend afternoon Tea at The Corinthia Hotel !",5,2019,09,21
143,Weekend escape,"We visited the Corinthia for a weekend break in London and having stayed in Corinthia hotels before, we knew it would be good. It exceeded our expectations dramatically, it is on another level!
From the moment we arrived to the moment we departed the staff were superb., Helpful, courteous and friendly, it was their ambition that your stay with them would be happy and enjoyable. 
Our room was beautifully appointed and the bed was exceptionally comfortable.All the usual amenities were available and, joy of joys, the floor in the lovely bathroom was heated!
We dined in the Northall restaurant and the food, the attentiveness of the service and the whole ambience was excellent, 
We would certainly hope to return and woiuld heartily recommend a visit,  
As someone who did an apprenticeship at the Dorchester Hotel (many moons ago) I was seriously Impressed.",5,2019,09,20
143,Our new favorite!!!,The place is hopping - in a good way!!!  Gorgeous property.  Fabulous restaurants and bar.  Seriously outstanding concierges.  Beautifully appointed room.  Overall spectacular experience!  Perfect location.  We will be back!!,5,2019,09,20
143,Afternoon Tea,"We visited the Corinthia on Wednesday for afternoon tea, which was bought for us as a present. We were a little early so popped into the lounge bar, the service was excellent. Then  it was time to experience the afternoon tea, oh my, it was superb, the staff are so professional but also friendly and make you feel at ease but are so attentive nothing is too much trouble you cannot fault. The food is what you expect from a quality hotel. In all a superb visit of high quality, which includes the surroundings, staff, food and drink. Excellent  !!!",5,2019,09,20
143,Exceeds all Expectations!,"This hotel is a must for any traveller coming to London and looking for the perfect luxury property.  Aside from the ideal location to enjoy all corners of the city, the hotel is gorgeous and the staff offer impeccable service in a most elegant manner!  Truly did not want to leave!",5,2019,09,19
143,"Wonderful hotel, real luxury and amazing staff","We stayed at the Corinthia recently with friends to celebrate a special birthday.  Our room was beautiful and the staff are always professional, extremely helpful and courteous; nothing is too much trouble.  We have stayed at the hotel several times and will be returning again in December. It's our favourite place to stay in London; real luxury and highly recommended.",5,2019,09,19
143,Wonderful property,"Stayed here for a quick one night stay - the executive King was very generous in size and extremely well apppointed - the balcony and inner courtyard view was definitely a very nice touch.
The staff here really made the difference - I was very warmly welcome by the check in staff and was escorted personally to the room - one of the most professional and warm welcomes I've experienced for a long time!
The thermal floor/spa was top notch - only complaint would be that the water temperature of the jacuzzi could be warmer/hotter
The location is perhaps one of the biggest drawbacks (personally prefer Mayfair/Knightsbridge area) but nonetheless very close to public transport (Tube/Bus etc) 

Will definitely look to return in the future.",5,2019,09,17
143,21st Birthday Celebrations,"My daughter and her friend came to the Corinthia to celebrate her 21st Birthday. For a long time she has been saying how much she would like to stay there. I contacted the hotel to ask if they could help arrange balloons in the room for her and I want to say a huge thank you to Szabina and the hotel for making Lauren’s birthday even more special. She was upgraded to a most beautiful room where she found balloons, champagne and a birthday cake.  Her stay was nothing short of spectacular and I can’t wait to visit myself. 
Thank you so very much",5,2019,09,17
143,My new favorite hotel in London,"I have traveled several times to London recently, but have not enjoyed any hotel more than Corinthia. The facilities are elegant and comfortable at the same time, while the location is ideal. The spa is particularly fabulous.",5,2019,09,16
143,Just perfect,The perfection comes from the amazing location 10 min walk to london eye 15 min walk to covent garden also the warm welcome on the entrance make you feel excited followed by the amazing lady made my check in (janine mallia ) she is suck a kind professional person she took us to a cute tour in the hotel thanks janine..the gym she should me and i used was one of the best it has all new high tech equipments and the spa is just more than perfect also the breakfast buffet is very good and has many choices i loved the strawberry smoothie for example i definitely recommend this hotel,5,2019,09,15
143,Family Vacation in London,"Excellent propriety, staff and restaurants. The Hotel is centrally located. Close to everything. Garden and parks, castle and historic building and places.
Great and clean rooms. SPA is the best. Staff are well trained and accomadating",5,2019,09,14
143,The golden cup (runneth over),"So nice for us to be back at the Corinthia and find that the standard continues to rise.  The River Suites are addictive - fantastic views of the Thames and other landmarks, with a terrific feeling of light and space.  Whilst the breakfasts were a feast and Kerridge’s impressed, a return visit to afternoon tea at the Crystal Moon lounge was the highlight.

I would like to say that that observation had nothing to do with snagging a place setting with a golden cup, but that would not be entirely honest.  Special thanks to Jack, who has a promising career ahead of him.  

The Managing Director was overseas on business during our stay.  It didn’t show, which is testament to the top flight staff in place.

Corinthia London is a class act.  Mr Thomas Kochs has created luxurious and uplifting moments.  He can be justifiably proud.",5,2019,09,13
143,This hotel can't be topped,"Perfect location, excellent breakfast and restaurants, cozy bar inside and outside, spacious homely rooms with all luxury you could need, super friendly and helpful staff, best hotel we stayed at so far.",5,2019,09,13
143,Phenomenal Stay,We couldn’t have asked for a nicer hotel to celebrate our anniversary. We were treated so special and everyone knew it was our anniversary. We had a lovely upgrade to a garden room which was beautiful. Janine made us feel so special and welcome. Our room was filled with cakes fruit champagne and flowers. Just amazing. Our meal at Kerridge’s was gorgeous and again the staff were so lovely. The spa was heavenly and I had the best massage from the lovely Marta. We had the most amazing stay and have decided to make this an annual event. Thank you so much.,5,2019,09,06
143,Fav hotel in London,"Corinthia is my favourite hotel in London as it ticks all the boxes. It’s very comfortable, service is impeccable and food is great. The tea time in the lobby is very good and their breakfast as well. It also has the most beautiful spa with marble everywhere and the massages are so good! 
I’ve stayed in many other of the big 5* hotels in London but Corinthia is by far my favourite I always want to come back to!

",5,2019,09,06
143,Family long weekend ,"For perfect relaxation and still in the central area can’t get better. We had adjournment that are always well kept and well stocked. Cleaned twice a day. Breakfast was the highlight for the children with a good variety to choose from.

143,Compliment,"Beautiful bar! Thank you to our lovely waiter (born in Florence) and to the wonderful James for being warm, welcoming, friendly, generous and professional.  
We enjoyed our time in your bar and you two made it special, thank you and thank you to Daniele for arranging it. 
This visit to your bar made up for our last visit to your restaurant so we have gone from never wanting to come back to planning our next visit. 
Thank you again
Natasha Jobsz",5,2019,09,05
143,Perfect Hotel in the Perfect Location,"We took our 14 year old twin granddaughters on a 5 day trip to London.  Our accommodations at the Corinthia were perfect: 2 connecting rooms that were very comfortable and complete with every amenity.  The hotel was perfectly situated for us as it seemed to be a 15 walk from almost everything we wanted to see:  Buckingham Palace, London Eye, Tower of London, St James Palace, Coven Garden, etc.
The staff could not have been more helpful including the concierge, the people in the restaurant who accommodated our food allergy issues.  The food was also excellent for breakfast and the one dinner we had at the hotel.",5,2019,09,04
143,Amazing for afternoon tea! ,Afternoon tea cakes were amazing. Love this place. The spa was also lovely but didn’t really like the meal it came with in the package. Lovely! Thank you for being so attentive.  Highly recommend zxxxxxx,5,2019,09,03
143,Birthday lunch,"Surprise birthday lunch for my son- huge Tom Kerridge fan, as he is training to be a chef.

Will be returning for Afternoon Tea !! Looks fab !!
Restaurant is absolutely stunning.",5,2019,09,03
143,Overnight in London,"Flying in from the Middle East, we were so exhausted and hungry. We arrived about quarter to 10am and went straight to reception to drop our luggage. We were greeted by Crystal and I love how she welcomed us and ushered us to the breakfast buffet. I ordered Asian Buffet which included congee, sweet bread, dimsum, and noodles for £39. Normal breakfast buffet is priced at £30. Just before finishing breakfast, Crystal approached us to give us the keys to the room. I’m impressed because it’s way too early before check in and she made the effort to come to us and inform us that the room is ready. She also gave us the tour of the hotel, showing us the spa lift and all necessary details so we can maximize our stay overnight since I’m flying back to the Middle East the following day. She even upgraded my room to Deluxe Queen! Thank you so much, Crystal!

The ESPA at Corinthia Hotel London is amazing! They have thermal pools and lapping pool. The steam and sauna are very spacious it can probably accommodate 20 people easy! They have sleeping pods, too! It was warm and relaxing and I actually feel asleep. Since I’m traveling with an 11 year old, we can only visit the spa from 4:00-5:30pm and 9:00-10:30am because that’s the window when children are allowed in the spa. My child had a wonderful time, grinning all day!

My birthday was 2 months ago and still they greeted me and even gave me a surprise birthday cake (plus a handwritten letter)! I felt special and loved even by strangers ❤️

The hotel is across the London Eye. You can walk to the bridge at night  and take the nicest photo with the London Eye and River Thames. You can walk up to different shops around the area and watch theatrical shows like The Lion King and Fiddler on the Roof. I’m a makeup artist and the area is perfect because there is a MAC + Boots + Superdrug + Body Shop + TKMaxx shops nearby! Also, days before I flew in to London , I had some makeup packages sent to the hotel which they gladly received on my behalf. Everyone is very helpful!

The room has a bath tub so I bought some bath fizz from TKMaxx and Superdrug and spent the night watching The Simpsons (yes, there is a tv in the bathroom!)

This is the perfect getaway I needed from the hustle and bustle of city life. I definitely recommend staying at this hotel! I love every minute of my stay! Shame I’m checking out tonight and flying back home. I would have loved to stay longer.",5,2019,08,31
143,Great Place,"We have stayed here four times. Always great! The rooms can be very different so be careful when selecting. They have courtyards, balconies, and even some little rooms. 

This place is really fabulous in every way. The High Tea is amazing. In addition, the spa is the best I have had while in London. The pool is totally cool in the basement with al kinds of thermal luxuries. The service is 5 star.",5,2019,08,29
143,"Definitely, the best hotel experience we ever had in London.","To whom it may concern,

We would like to write a very positive comment about the excellence that the Corinthia Hotel delivers.

Since our first step into the property, every single moment was just perfect. Starting with the personalized check-in with a lovely French gentleman who behaved very professionally to the housekeeping cleanliness, turndown service, concierge service (French gentleman who took care of our RL bag, many thanks! :) ) room service and it’s large selection of Lebanese cuisine that looked just so great and tasted even better. Not forgetting to mention the breakfast buffet that was just amazing, so many offers and everything fresh and tasteful with a very friendly staff serving us every morning :)

We can’t wait to be back at the Corinthia Hotel as it is definitely our first choice in London. We truly hope that you will keep your excellence and welcome us once again with such professional service, thank you.

 
Warmest regards,

Family Repac",5,2019,08,28
143,No attention to the small stuff,"Having stayed before on business previously I’m compelled to moan on here as nothing changed. 

Little things like tea bags, cups & glasses not replaced on a daily basis after room being serviced is SO annoying. The wait for the missing items can be up to an hour when you call to ask for said item! 
Everything else was up to 5 star standard you’d expect here",4,2019,08,28
143,Birthday treat for 9 year old.,"We booked this treat for our grandson,  as he had watched the television programme.  The hotel
Was lovely, as was the afternoon tea, and the pianist was just delightful.
However we were a bit disappointed by the service, the waiter struggled to understand requests, and we had to ask for tea pots to be re-filled, rather than offered, we asked for water, and whilst we noticed other tables were given jugs of tap water, we ended up paying £22 plus service charge for water. As we were a table of eight I did feel the service was not as good as expected, this may have been down to the hotel being busy.
Overall it was a lovely experience for our grandson, and the little touches for his birthday were appreciated, but the adults in the party felt the service was lacking.  Where service charge is automatically added to the bill you must make sure it warrants this.
Thank you.",4,2019,08,27
143,Don’t over think it....this is the hotel to stay while in London.,"Incredible stay at the Corinthia!   The wonderful people who worked with us (thanks Thomas and Szabina!) made us feel comfortable and welcome.  Our crew has very high standards when it comes to travel, and we typically stay in the best hotels possible.  The Corinthia not only exceeded my expectations, but more importantly, those of my wife and kids.  And it’s worth getting a suite if possible!  Fantastic spa, great food in the hotel restaurants and room service, and proximity to attractions and things to do.  The Corinthia simply can’t be beat, and will be our home away from home when coming back!",5,2019,08,26
143,awesome family hotel,"We stayed at the Corinthia with our three kids. The staff, services and attention to detail were incredible. The concierge took excellent care of us helping with tickets, a stroller and more. My kids are already asking to go back.",5,2019,08,26
143,Perfect!,Wonderful staff and beautiful suite with amazing view. Delicious breakfast and dinner and  beautiful surroundings. We enjoyed every minute of our stay! We think this is the best hotel to stay when in London. ,5,2019,08,26
143,Fantastic trip,"I had another amazing experience staying at the corinthia. The staff are incredible and will literally do anything to make your stay as comfortable as possible. They are 100 percent committed to providing the best service and always go above and beyond. The food is fantastic, the facilities are superb, a standard room feels like a luxury apartment! The whole experience was fantastic and I cannot wait to stay here again very soon! Thank you",5,2019,08,24
143,Simply Splendid,"My friend treated me to champagne afternoon tea here today. It was very lovely! We were seated in high back arm chairs in what was a bit of a thoroughfare rather than the main seating area near the lift. This meant we experienced guests going past with their suitcases on their way in and out of the hotel so we definitely didn't have the best seats in the house and would advise anyone booking to ask to be seated in the main area.  Having said that some of the outfits guests were wearing going past were quite interesting and Tom Kerridge walked by so that was a bit of chef celebrity spotting for us.  The staff were charming, giving us right balance of attention and service. The Laurent Perrier champagne was served in beautiful crystal glasses.  Sandwiches were plentiful, scones plain and fruit (bit light on the fruit) were served with clotted cream and strawberry and raspberry jam.  All absolutely delicious. Our first choice of tea we didn't like but it was quickly replaced with a stronger, different brew more to our taste (what I would call builders' tea!). Too full for the cakes they were boxed up and we took them home. A pleasant and generous selection. A word about the toilets, I always think you can judge a place on the toilets, they were sparklingly clean, lovely towels to dry your hands on and nice toiletries, oh and a story being told over the PA system in there, sadly wasn't in there long enough to get the gist of it. Before leaving we decided to take a peek at Kerridges Bar and Grill and thought it rude not to gave a drink in there. So more champagne later we left deciding that we will definitely return to give Kerridges Bar and Grill our full attention by not just having drinks but the full works.",5,2019,08,23
143,ROMANTIC VIEW,"We spend 2days in Corinthia Hotel. Every thing was perfect. Service, view, atmosphee was memories. It located in ceter of city. That is all i need for my vacation. Certainly i will back soon. Thanks for taking care my staying. ",5,2019,08,23
143,Favourite hotel in London with big rooms,"Beautiful quality hotel, and great room size compared to other London hotels, and amazing spa and gym too not to be missed . Theres better located hotels but hard to beat the rooms, and service level.",5,2019,08,22
143,What a lovely afternoon tea,"With great pleasure I write this review about my afternoon tea experience at the Corinthia Hotel in London.
If you are in London and you want to live in first person the British spirit, afternoon tea experience cannot be missing from your To-do list. In particular, if you are a  tea-lover like me.
The Corinthia Hotel turned out to be the ideal place for this and I recommend it for three main reasons:
1) Wide range of specialty teas as well as desserts: in fact, tea is accompanied by a mini cakes and sandwiches;
2) The staff is very attentive to customers and always available to offer an excellent experience (congratulations to the staff!)
3) The environment is welcoming and rich in details. The floral decorations are stunning and I also found the background piano music very pleasant.",5,2019,08,22
143,Great 5 Star Hotel,Took a standard King Bed room.  The room was very large. Included breakfast in the price.  Wonderful breakfasts.  Employees can't do enough for you.  The concierges were always helping us plan out our day.  They were warm and friendly.,5,2019,08,21
143,A truly wonderful hotel in London,"Having stayed at Corinthia several times, it was an obvious choice to indulge in the Champagne afternoon tea in the Crystal Moon Lounge for our 21st Wedding Anniversary celebrations yesterday. The food, and service, as always was fabulous and the interior design of this hotel is second to none. Although not visited on this occasion, we have used the spa in this hotel and it is truly amazing. We always leave Corinthia feeling like we have had the most relaxing and luxurious mini break ever.
A special big thankyou to the fabulous Thomas Kochs who took time out yesterday to wish us a Happy Anniversary, you made my day! ",5,2019,08,21
143,"Not a ""Stand Out"" experience.","Having watched the documentary and listened to the likeable Thomas Kochs explain what he wanted of the Corinthia we were expecting close to perfection. Having stayed at Claridges, The Ritz, The Dorchester, 45 Park Lane, The Connaught, Cafe Royal, Four Seasons Hyde Park and The Savoy we have an idea of the standards achievable and indeed the shotcomings you can expect from establishments claiming the 5 Star accolade and after a 6 night stay we were left a little underwhelmed by the experience.

Arirval-
We were very early and our car was deemed suitable to be parked at front of the hotel rather than valet parked. We were told to expect a text when the room was ready. No problems.
Checking in-
We pre- requested a soft matress, this request had not been met. I requested a room with a view. I was informed that the room category I had booked offered two views (courtyard and street) and I had been given the street, OK.
I pointed out by booking on line it was indicated that an upgrade was possible. The reply was ""have you got your champagne"" No, ""yes, you don't have a suite, they get champagne...""
If they had upgraded us we would have got the champagne, but, Oh, you are not upgraded so no champagne....At £650 per night I was hoping just to get what I paid for.
Now here's a strange thing. At this supposed level of customer service you would think that a request for my own tea making facilities would be easy-
A kettle, two tea cups, a teapot, two spoons, fresh milk, sugar and English Breakfast tea bags. In the 6 days, on three days they fell short. I got tired of informing the reception staff that I did without. No big deal really but it was the only thing I wanted and it could not be done.
Breakfast-
We tried breakfast in the Northall. Nice setting, good buffet type choice but the cooked breakfast was inferior. Everything had been precooked and kept warm. I know that tends to be the normal practice but lukewarm sausages, bacon and eggs is well below par. The plate was cold and the general presentation was lacking. 
Is it too much to expect a freshly cooked hot breakfast?
Service was very good.
Housekeeping-
Flexible and high standard, much appreciated. Thank you.
Check out-
We left at 5am and our car was ready. I had asked the hotel to keep some fresh meat in cold storage for us and we had a 20 minute delay in finding it. 
I questioned the £50 per day parking costs as my car was parked in front of the hotel and not in a car park. No leeway on that so on our way....

The Corinthia is a good hotel.
Excellent Concierge, great houskeeping and a pleasantly busy feel to the hotel but we had a feeling that the Reception staff were a bit up themselves! If we had a query it was brushed aside and deemed minor. So much so that I gave up in the end and just got on with enjoying London.

In short, at this price level you can stay anywhere in London, The Corinthia is a good choice but far from an exceptiona one.

Thank you.",5,2019,08,16
143,Perfect in every way ,"Corinthia London is simply incredible.  Location is superb.  The rooms are nice, spacious, comfortable and modern. Beds are super comfortable, lighting options for every mood, wifi always worked well, baths complete with entertainment system (!). 

The swimming pool and spa facilities are amazing though our hours were limited because of the kids (totally acceptable and fair enough).  Staff are very friendly from the moment you arrive and we were addressed by name every time we spoke to reception or concierge which may be a minor thing for some but gives an important personal touch and is something I value personally. 

The hotel just oozes elegance in every area.  We also had a lovely dinner at Kerridges.  My family simply loved it and were really sad to leave.  It was a truly wonderful experience and is highly recommended for both business and family trips. ",5,2019,08,12
143,Home away from home ,"Whenever I stay in London I always choose to stay at the Corinthia; and every time I leave with a smile on my face. From the staff at reception, the maitre d at the restaurant to the housekeeping team; they all work tirelessly to make sure guests are comfortable.
I treated myself to a 90 minute massage combined with reflexology at the ESPA and it was heaven.
This was followed by a delicious meal at Kerridge’s (I did not have a reservation but the maitre d kindly accommodated for me). The highlight of the meal was definitely the dessert, brown butter tart, truly sublime! 
Once again Corinthia, you made my stay extremely enjoyable and you will no doubt be seeing me again!!",5,2019,08,12
143,Perfect,"Group of 5 couples

Rooms perfect - Clean, Spacious, superb bed. Home a day and I miss the shower already.
Staff - Wonderful and attentive to every requirement
Food - A top class breakfast no matter what you would like. Superb dinner at Kerridges in hotel as well as lunch in garden area. Bar was wonderful.
Location - Superb for everything. A quiet haven in the middle of London

Thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of our stay",5,2019,08,12
143,Just Perfection,"I visited with an old friend who I see maybe twice or three times a year if I am in London.  I wanted somewhere special and found it without doubt.  This hotel is just beautiful.  We had a wonderful afternoon tea, which was excellent, but on top of that it was the staff who made it just right for us.  Despite being clearly a leading hotel, there was none of the stuffiness that can be experienced elsewhere.  We felt relaxed and pampered at the same time.  I loved visiting the in house floristry and the displays of hydrangeas are wonderful.  Thank you for a lovely afternoon - I feel my next wish is to stay in the hotel!",5,2019,08,11
143,Beautiful & Great Location,"Stayed a few wonderful nights here. The hotel is very centrally located but manages to be away from the crowds 
We were able to walk to most attractions and if needed the hotel car ( I suggest pre-booking for dinner reservations ) or taxi was very easy to get. All the staff were kind and courteous. A shoutout to the concierge staff for their time, expertise & patience.   
The rooms are beautiful and spacious & the hotel itself is beautiful. I love the in-house florist & all the beautiful fresh flowers 💐 I would highly recommend this hotel",5,2019,08,11
143,Espa at Corinthia ,"During a stressful week in London my husband and I treated ourselves to a spa experience Summer Glow treatment. 
We thoroughly enjoyed using the pool, jets and sauna beforehand. The whole area is impeccably maintained and kept scrupulously clean. 
The reception staff were very welcoming and helpful. 
The actual treatment rates as in my top 5 of anywhere in the world ( I’ve been lucky enough to have many wonderful treatments) 

My therapist was EMILY and she was wonderful. She completely put me at my ease, and was a truly excellent therapist,
Her massage was exceptionally good, very firm and highly skilled.

My husband had CHRISTINA and he was equally impressed with her. 

All in all a delightful way to spend an afternoon in London. We would love to come back to stay sometime. 
 
We finished our experience with a delicious cocktail in the bar.",5,2019,08,09
143,Impeccable Hotel,Great location near Trafalgar square.  Modern classic room.  Plenty of space.  Huge luxurious bathroom.  Wonderful elegant spa/pool.  Excellent staff.  Not stuffy.  Tea service in the lobby is superb.  Variety of room service offerings to meet every taste.  Cannot wait to return.  This was our second time at the hotel and did not disappoint -- again!,5,2019,08,07
143,CELEBRATORY LUNCH,We had been looking forward to visiting the Corinthia Hotel and were simply delighted with the time spent there before moving on to lunch at the Bar & Grill at Kerridge's.  Had brilliant pre lunch drinks at the Bar and returned there for a digestive after lunch.  The atmosphere was superb and the Service beyond reproach.  A total surprise when a truly delicious chocolate torte with raspberries was produced for the celebrant of a significent birthday.  Such a delightful end to an absolutely PERFECT DAY.  The Staff at the Corinthia Hotel are truly exceptional and ovbiously enjoy representing this wonderful Hotel.  A place definitely to revisit  time and time again.,5,2019,08,07
143,Fantastic Afternoon Tea,My Son treated me to a wonderful Champagne Tea at the Corinthia Hotel 2 days ago. The hotel is a beautiful building and the decor is outstanding. All the Staff were very pleasant and our waitress Marianna was delightful. My gluten free food was served in exactly the same way as my Son’s and no one would have known that I was on a special diet which I was most appreciative of. The sandwiches and cakes were a feast for the eyes as well as tasting delicious. Thank you for a wonderful Afternoon Tea experience.,5,2019,08,04
143,Wonderful Afternoon Tea,"My two friends and I visited the Corinthia for afternoon tea yesterday as a birthday treat for my friend. We had such a wonderful time. The lounge is beautiful and the atmosphere was made even more special by a pianist playing in the foyer. In our group there was one vegan and one vegetarian, this was accommodated for with no issue. The food, tea and service were faultless. The waiters were knowledgeable and charming and the tea and cakes absolutely delicious. At the end of the tea, my friend was even presented with a mini birthday cake which made our experience even more special. Thank you so much for a wonderful afternoon.",5,2019,08,04
143,Nice stay,Great hotel in a great location.  Can't find fault with anything at the hotel.  Staff are lovely and the amenities are top notch.  Stay here every time I'm in London.  If you want luxury this is the place to stay.,5,2019,08,02
143,Drinks,"Wow now that’s what I call a hotel 
Walked in for drinks in the garden bar having just come from the competition over the road
The Corinthia is in a different league a short steps across the road was like comparing Blackpool to Bora Bora
Staff friendly helpful & attentive 
The floral arrangements in reception and walking through the Crystal Moon Lounge were stunning. The afternoon tea looked delightful 
Sat in lovely quiet corner of the garden ordered negroni & Kir Royale came with snacks and lovely smiling service. Despite having a leg injury and having to elevate my leg the team took it in their stride providing me with a higher stool rather than uncomfortably & unsociably putting my foot on the table. They also offered me ice to put on my leg.
Fabulous service great drinks 
Will most definitely return and perhaps stay or have afternoon tea
Yes a 5 star recommendation for a 6 star hotel 
Well done everyone & thank you for being so classy ",5,2019,07,31
143,The Corinthia is my favorite hotel.,"We have stayed at the Corinthia 3 times now and it is really a special hotel.  The staff and service are over the top.  Friendly, helpful and accommodating.  The property itself is stunning with beautiful fresh flowers everywhere.  We love staying there!",5,2019,07,31
143,beautiful hotel and amazing service,"This is an amazing place to stay. The hotel is fabulous and there service amazing.
The rooms may need a little attention as they are a bit bumped and scuffed but the hotel is undoubtedly among the best in London and I've stayed at Claridges, The Ritz and Dorchester, among others......",5,2019,07,31
143,Best afternoon tea in London,Having been to quite a few afternoon teas in some of London’s most fabulous hotels I must say this was one of the BEST ! The staff we lovely Giacamo was simply fabulous as was borma our tea seemlier the tea was flowing as was the sandwiches (salt beef and horseradish) was my fave ! The scones were good as was the jam and the dessert cakes were out of this world ! Lovely decor also totally worth a visit and not super crazy in terms of prices !,5,2019,07,28
143,An elegant and relaxed afternoon tea in one of London’s most beautiful settings.,"My boyfriend and I visited the Corinthia for afternoon tea on Friday as a treat for my birthday. The whole experience was absolutely wonderful and we couldn’t have had a better time. I wanted to particularly mention the service which was superb and to specifically mention Giacomo who made our visit to enjoyable- nothing was too much trouble from advising us on the right tea to taking photos of us to presenting me with a mini birthday cake! The food was absolutely delicious and of an exceptionally high standard. I think for me what really made the experience was the attention to detail- the flowers, the way the table was laid, the performance of pouring the tea and of serving the cakes. I would go back anytime and would whole heartedly recommend it!",5,2019,07,28
143,The best SPA ever,"I recently visited the spa with a friend for a well deserved treat and relaxation session after hard couple of months.
The SPA is second to none, from the moment you walk into the reception of the SPA a very relaxing atmosphere and friendly receptionists welcome you, 
They go the extra mile to make you feel comfortable and relaxed at all times. The facilities are beautiful, extremely comfortable and luxurious.
And to top it up we had a delicious and nutritious lunch.",5,2019,07,23
143,Great stay,"What can I say and dining! A lovely stay in the heart on London. 

Staff during arrival were friendly and helpful. Room was specious enough. The bed was comfy and we spelt very well. 

Bathroom fitted with the bath and specious shower. There is not bath grips fitted in the bath. I came across it was a bit dangerous not having grips in the bath as bath is quite big and when it is full of water you just dive in. Be careful!!!!! 

Perfect relaxation at SPA area. Tidy and loved refreshments. There should be some information how to lock and unlock the lockers. I was struggle for a long time. I was a bit lost but no one from the staff did not ask if I would need any help. 

Breakfast and service during breakfast were superb.",5,2019,07,22
143,Great Afternoon Tea,"Having seen this hotel on the TV programme, my friend and I decided we would go for afternoon tea.  
Our waiter was charming, checked our food allergies and brought up the menu.  An outstanding range of teas, we made our selections and then the food came.  Beautifully prepared sandwiches in a range of flavours from smoked salmon to chicken tikka to the old favourite, egg and cress.

Followed one fruit scone and one plain scone, freshly cooked, with either strawberry jam or rhubarb conserve, with cream (of course).  I would happily have stopped there, but there was more.

I can’t tell you what they all were - there was a delicious pistachio cake for me, and a chocolate one, both with gold leaf on top.  The other two were creamy desserts.  For the note gluten free, there was a trolley with a variety of desserts.  On top was a jar that had pink, white and mauve stripes, which turned out to be marshmallow.

The food was all excellent and our waiter was lovely, very attentive, and quite worried when we didn’t eat everything.  Obviously we explained.  Wholeheartedly recommend it.",5,2019,07,21
143,Evening meal,"Called on spec, the exterior and window boxes enticed us in, very smart and attentive staff. Set menu looked very good, and it was. Beautiful trout rillette, belly pork done to perfection, and gooseberry tart.
Good food served absolutely precisely and tasty as well
Staff very helpful, checked regarding allergies.
This place has got to rank as one of the best, exclusive yes, friendly, yes, will revisit without a doubt. Maitre d and restaurant manager ran it with quiet efficency",5,2019,07,19
143,Overnight stay - a pleasure from start to finish,"This hotel can only be described as superb. 

As someone who has stayed at some of the most luxurious hotels in the world, the thing that distinguishes this hotel from many other 'elite' hotels is the staff. They interact with clients in a confident but respectful manner and without the overtly subservient nature of the guest/ staff relationship apparent in some top hotels - particularly in the Far and Middle East - which can be a bit uncomfortable for guests.",5,2019,07,18
143,Business meeting place good,Had a business meeting in one of the cafe/restaurant there - it was my first time - I must say I was a bit disappointed by a few things - I came to the front of the hotel by taxi and nobody open the door of the cab - there was a few members of staff but I think there was all a bit too busy saying goodbye to one of the celebrity coming out of the hotel - not the best impression - however inside one of the staff member brought me to the place I was meeting someone - overall good experience for a quick coffee business meeting,4,2019,07,17
143,"Tea , drinks & meals.","Outstanding & oozing ambience.  Beautiful decor & layout. Friendly staff. Located near many local attractions including Hungerford bridge over the Thames, Embankment , Boat rides, London Eye, Cleopatra's Needle, Trafalgar Square , Leicester Square , China Town , Admiralty Arch , Big Ben , House of Parliament , Downing Street , Covent Garden , Theatreland, & numerous restaurants.",5,2019,07,16
143,Exquisite from the first second to the last...,"My wife and I spent the weekend at the Corinthia London and enjoyed every minute. The property, staff, rooms and amenities are magnificent, second to none - this is the gem in London's crown. We stayed in one of the new London Suites which was spacious, beautiful and extremely comfortable. Like the whole hotel, every aspect of the suite was created with the highest quality in mind. Staff at the hotel went above and beyond on every possible occasion. The ESPA life spa is very special indeed, an expansive sanctuary that satisfies all the senses. I look forward to returning and I thank everyone at the Corinthia for a perfect weekend break.",5,2019,07,15
143,Superb afternoon tea - could not fault it!,"We went for afternoon tea at the Corinthia Hotel on Saturday 13th July to celebrate our engagement. We were a party of 6, including one vegetarian. From the moment we arrived, we could not have been made more welcome and nothing was too much trouble to make the afternoon enjoyable for us.
Afternoon tea takes place in the Crystal Moon Lounge which is light, airy and beautifully furnished. As a party of 6 we were seated on a combination of sofas and easy chairs around several small tables which we could move to suit us. This worked very well and meant we could relax and enjoy ourselves in comfort. The tables were beautifully laid.
The waiter who mostly looked after us was called Paulo and he took time to explain every detail of the tea to us. We had 5 champagne teas and one standard tea; two of our party do not drink tea and it was not a problem to have coffee and soft drinks instead. 
The sandwiches were quite amazing - I'm not sure how finger sandwiches can be quite so delicious! - and you can have as many as you like. This was followed by warm fruit or plain scones with jam and cream, again as many as you wanted. The tea was continuously refreshed and topped up throughout the meal. Finally there was an amazing selection of cakes, beautifully displayed on individual cake stands, but to be honest by this time we were all really quite full and could not do them justice! Any remaining cakes were carefully packed up so we could take them home if we wanted.(a very nice touch).
There is a pianist playing throughout the afternoon which helped add to the relaxing atmosphere.
I have had several afternoon teas in London over the past few years and nothing came close to this.
Our heartfelt thanks to the Corinthian for making the day such a special occasion. It may have been our first time there, but it will certainly not be our last.",5,2019,07,15
143,Excellent,"Stayed for four nights at the end of May in an absolutely gorgeous Garden suite. It was our third stay over the years as we love so many things about the hotel.

Across the board staff are excellent, so far we never had even one ""not so good"" experience.
Breakfast in the beautiful ambience of the Northall is a highlight every morning with attentive service and great variety of food.
The quietness of the rooms is stunning. Each visit we stayed in a different location and we haven*t heard anything from other rooms or the hallway. We also like the tranquil atmosphere when entering the hotel from the outside.
Location is fantastic. So many sites in walking distance in every direction. Embankment station is across the street.

Special thanks to the Concierges for arranging the airport transfer and the hotel car to the Royal Albert Hall and to the reservation team, which was helpful before and during our stay incl. early check in and late check out. The whole arrival experience was amazing. Will return in the future.

We also had afternoon tea for the first time. Sitting under the chandelier and watching around was quite an experience. Staff explained everything about the delicious food and the atmosphere was relaxing with piano music in the background.",5,2019,07,13
143,Great property and great team,Had a chance to stay at Corinthia London and it was fabulous! The ESPA spa and gym was the most comprehensive I’ve seen in England and I can easily spend half a day there. From the checkin the whole team has been very supportive and all requested was handled efficiently. The Wimbledon afternoon tea in the crystal moon lounge was also good—it was classy but still relaxing. Would definitely recommend to friends and families.,5,2019,07,10
143,Without doubt one of the best hotels,"I stay here a lot for business and my company run many events here. They are one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. Rooms are gorgeous, everything you could need. The staff are attentive, they have everything covered, extremely responsive, remembering little things for each visit. Nothing is too much trouble and everyone is very friendly and helpful. Five star in every respect.",5,2019,07,10
143,A PERFECT HOTEL IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE!!,"Where do I begin?  This hotel is perfect in every possible way!  From check-in to check-out our stay could not have been any better.  We were able to stay at the Corinthia for 10 days so we really got to explore everything the hotel has to offer.  There are multiple places to eat, drink and even enjoy a fine cigar.  Top it off with a world class SPA and you can't pick a better place to stay in London.  The staff is clearly the best in the business: people like Kareem (Garden Lounge), Fabrizio & Sean (Basson) and the bartenders at Kerridges were all top notch.  The best service combined with an architecturally stunning building makes this one of the finest hotels in the world!",5,2019,07,07
143,Excellent Afternoon Tea! ,"Last year I spent a magical moment in this hotel for the famous Afternoon Tea, and this year I wanted to repeat the experience. It was even more beautiful! In fact, this year I had the luck to meet Alessio, who took great care of me, with professionalism, competence and empathy! Thank you Alessio for the wonderful moment you gave me, and I hope to meet you next time! I strongly recommend this Hotel for the Afternoon Tea!",5,2019,07,06
143,The Best Hotel in London,"This is a 5 Star, A List Hotel.  Expect to be charged accordingly but you won't be disappointed by any aspect of the facilities or service.
A highlight on this visit was dinner at Tom Kerridge.  The most beautiful dining room with a very cool vibe, lovely service and exceptional food.",5,2019,07,05
143,Absolutely Fabulous,"Spent a wonderful stay at this fabulous hotel. Absolutely stunning and the staff could not do enough for you. So helpful, friendly and polite.

The rooms were and absolute dream and the beds were so comfortable. Everything you could ask for and more.

Loved the Bassoon bar, which had a great atmosphere and selection of cocktails. 

The crowning jewel of the whole stay was a trip to the hotel spa, which was absolutely out of this world! I could have spent my entire stay on the spa alone. I left feeling so relaxed. 

All in all an absolutely fantastic hotel and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for real luxury. I will definitely be going again. 

",5,2019,07,04
143,Love this place,I have been  coming to London for years and this is always a must on my list.  The hotel is the creme de la creme.   It is stunning and well appointed.   It is in a great walking location in my opinion and you will always see a star or two as movies seem to always be filmed in this beautiful location.,5,2019,07,04
143,Wonderful,"Everything is absolutely of an extremely high level, the furnishings the fitness center with gym and fitness room, the bar, the location make this place a center to discover for lovers of extremely well-kept places, and the comfort. All exceptional",5,2019,07,03
143,Afternoon tea,We decided to visit today to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. The setting was bright yet intimate.  The service was very attentive without being intrusive and the tea sandwiches & cakes were delicious. Particular attention to service were Luca and Aris who were both friendly and informative and they were very attentive to us today.,5,2019,07,02
143,Exquisite Afternoon Tea,After seeing this hotel on a recent tv programme I made sure this was on my list of afternoon teas. The venue for afternoon tea is stunning. Beautiful clam ambience. Loved the sandwiches and you catered perfectly for halal and gluten free. Scones were absolutely perfect. So thank you for this. Only a few things I would like to bring to attention. The tea pots seem to have brown tea stains  it took us two attempts to get water. And the staff pushing the dessert trolley was sliding his feet I’m sure that trolley is difficult to handle. I’m just being picky yes !!,4,2019,06,30
143,Literally one of the best in the world,"Service, food, the two bars, the fun with the staff, overall incredible. Ordered flowers and they were amazing - green carnations are not easy to get at short notice and they of course had them. Can't fault this absolute gem in London",5,2019,06,28
143,Excellent ,Centrally located close to all attractions. Grand entrance. Descent size rooms. A bit tired but well maintained. Good size and well equipped gym. Top notch spa. Friendly and efficient service. Very good WiFi. ,5,2019,06,27
143,Birthday afternoon tea.,"We visited the hotel at the beginning of June for a Birthday Tea. The hotel is beautifully decorated. The staff professional & attentive.
We were served by Giacomo & he was lovely. However the tea itself was a bit disappointing!! The China is beautiful. 
The sandwiches & scones were delicious as was the tea. But sadly the cakes or though they looked delicious were tasteless. Far to fancy. Why can’t we have good old Victoria sandwich, carrot cake choc eclairs??? The lemon drizzle was dry. Would I go back? Yes but not for tea. ",5,2019,06,27
143,Afternoon tea,"The Corinthia deserves to be among the top hot spots in London for a proper afternoon tea! I found it utterly delicious, elegantly presented and more enjoyable than other traditional high teas in other very famous places..! You can enjoy the same sophistication and glamour for a more personal and less pretentious atmosphere.
We have been well looked after by Jasper, who was extremely professional, knowledgeable and attentive. 
Who says when you have babies you cannot enjoy glamourous experience? Well go for tea at the Corinthia and you will not be disappointed. ",5,2019,06,26
143,Experience the Afternoon Tea,"My friends and I are quite old hands at Afternoon Teas, we were doing them before they were the ""in thing"".

First visit to the Corinthia for me.  Saw the programme about the hotel on TV and wanted to experience what they were offering.

We came in the door from Northumberland Avenue so did not realise that the area for afternoon tea as at the top of the reception area but wonderful area. There is plenty of space between the tables and there is also an open space outside if you wanted to eat outside.

We had the Rose Champagne Afternoon Tea and were not disappointed with the selection of sandwiches, scones (Ruburb & Ginger jam as well as Strawberry and then the cake trolly appeared what a selection.

My friend had been told we could only have the table for 1 hour an half, but we were not pushed out, especially as this was a treat by my friends for a special birthday.

I was presented with the second Happy Birthday plate (as had been given one in the bar).

Service was exceptional as only to be expected.  We were all made to feel special.",5,2019,06,25
143,Best vegan meal ever,I am currently enjoying what has to be the best vegan meal ever. From vegan desserts to all plant milks available with coffee I am seriously impressed. And the service this evening has been exemplary. I cannot wait for my return visit! ,5,2019,06,24
143,Review,"Adequate to say the least. I earn 900 pounds per month as an apprentice so when Spending 800 for a weekend, I thought I’d be going to heaven. How wrong was I ? Firstly all the employees didn’t understand English and always left me without toilet roll. The lift broke 3 times and I had to carry my own bags 4 flights of stairs!!! I entered my room and a brown stain was found on the bed sheets, it smelled fresh. To top things off my television remote had no batteries so I couldn’t turn off the bbc channels. TORTURE. It was international break aswell so match of the day wasn’t even on. The only highlight was checking out.",3,2019,06,23
143,Excellent hoyel in Central London,"Best facilities, biggest inhouse spa, and very spacious rooms.  I enjoy the proximity to a number of amenities .  The hotel personnel is very friendly and really explain every aspect of the hotel with a lot of conviction.",5,2019,06,21
143,Another Pitch Perfect Experience at the Corinthia London,"People  visit a city for the views, the cuisine, the museums, the rhythm of the place ... many because their business requires their presence; part of my personal experiences with London the last number of years has been the culture, beauty, elegance and impeccable service at the Corinthia Hotel.  It is absolutely one of my highlights of being in London ! I feel like I’m returning to my healing place.  I had been traveling for two weeks .. a delightful time, two weddings, many friends and fabulous dining and new experiences, but I was exhausted, the Spa Life at the Corinthia reinvigorated me, my suite was so beautifully appointed and smartly designed, and formal tea was so calming and delicious ... after a couple of days I felt completely refreshed!  I adore the hotel ... it’s a world in a world ... the staff, the stunning environment, the location, strolling by the beautiful on premise flower shop, the doting and knowledgeable staff, all of it is perfection ... always !  Thank you again for a remarkable and memorable time.  From the gentlemanly doormen to the valets .. from dining to sleeping in.  All a delight !  One of the best in the world without question !   ",5,2019,06,21
143,Pop in for a pre-theatre treat,"On my own and with an hour to spare before the Playhouse performance was due to start, I crossed the road for a little luxury and walked into the Corinthia. Its main bar was unavailable due to a private function but I was directed to the Bassoon bar where I enjoyed a beautifully served plate of smoked salmon and a glass of dry ginger beer in style and comfort. More expensive than the nearby Subway and Costa but worth every penny.",5,2019,06,21
143,Very enjoyable stay,"I am being uber picky but a hotel with this room rate and reputation really should get everything spot-on. My daughter and I celebrated her 18th birthday with a beautiful twin room. All my pre-arranged requests had been prepared perfectly (balloons, fizz etc) but some small general details were missed. A kettle was requested that didn't arrive and the TV in the bathroom did not work. I know...first world problems right? I would not normally even mention them but from a real high end hotel you (quite rightly) expect perfection, or very close.
These small details did not cloud what was otherwise a fantastic stay. One other small comment would be many of the non-restaurant/bar staff would not offer a greeting without prompting, I'm not sure whether or not that is hotel policy but it made the feel a little too formal.",4,2019,06,20
143,Can’t wait to be back !,"Wonderful experience celebrating our companies success over the last year. Had a lovely welcome from a manager as well as the receptionist Carolina who then took us to the room. The room was surprisingly spacious when compared to other London hotels and both a shower and a bath tub in each of our rooms.
Brilliant bar team at Bassoon and dinner in Northall was also delightful.
Over all excellent stay and we can’t wait to be back !",5,2019,06,19
143,Suite Stay at Corinthia,"My wife and I stayed 3 nights at the Corinthia for our wedding anniversary.  We booked a deal directly on the Corinthia website that offered a junior suite, transportation from the airport, a bottle of champagne in the room and breakfast each morning.  While expensive, it truly was a wonderful experience, and we felt worth the additional cost.  Here are the highlights of our stay:

Arrival / Check-in:
A driver from the hotel met us in baggage claim after customs, and whisked us to the hotel's Mercedes.  The driver was not a ""contract"" driver, but rather a hotel employee.   The ride was incredibly comfortable and he was very kind.  We arrived at the hotel around Noon, and they already had our room ready, and we had been upgraded to a Deluxe Junior Suite.  The front desk actually escorts you directly to the room personally and gave us a tour of the facilities and how to use everything - we definitely appreciated the personal service after a long travel from the US.

Service:
Everyone at the hotel goes out of their way to help make your stay enjoyable. One day in the spa, one of the workers approached us about our time and congratulated us on our anniversary.  We ordered room service once and it arrived within 20-25 minutes (on a Saturday night). We had use of the hotel car, and they dropped us off several times in the city, as a complimentary service.  All very impressive.

Room:
The room was incredibly spacious and comfortable.  I don't have previous Europe experiences to compare to, but our room / bathroom was very large.  Our door opened to a living room that had a tv, desk with multiple chairs, a bar area, and a dresser.  This was a great area to enjoy a meal, catch up on emails, or relax while the other is resting.  Then, it opened up to a very large bathroom / walk-in closet.  The bathroom had a soaking tub with a tv at the end to watch, a walk in rainfall shower (with incredible water pressure), a walk in toilet room, and a double vanity.  The separate bedroom with a King bed was very spacious and had a couch at the end of the bed, and we had a double doors which opened onto a small balcony that looked down into the inner hotel courtyard.  All of the finishes are high quality, and we couldn't hear a thing in the hallways or from our neighbors, so it was very private.

Property / Location:
Probably the most impressive aspect of this hotel is the spa.  Covering 3 floors, it is an oasis in the middle of the city.  Just the men's locker room alone has its own hamaam, sauna, sleep pods, lounge, etc.  The main spa floor has an indoor lap pool, hot tub (the size of a pool), an amphitheater sauna and lounging areas.  The next most impressive feature of the hotel is the location.  The hotel is within walking distance from Trafalgar Square, where I would sometimes pick up a Starbucks in the morning.  Overall, it is convenient to anywhere in the city, but secluded enough to feel private.  The most beautiful room in the hotel is the breakfast room, which looks out onto the Thames and the London Eye. It has vaulted ceilings and huge curtains, and is really an impressive space.  Breakfast each morning was wonderful, with a buffet of meats, cheeses, breads, pastries and cooked to order eggs and bacon.

Overall Impression: As you get more well traveled, the less touristy things you want to do on your time off and the more time you want to spend relaxing with your loved one(s).  The Corinthia is perfect for both, but really for us, it felt like a respite from a busy city.  They catered to our every need and let us relax and enjoy the city.  I would recommend to anyone, anytime, and hope to visit again in the future.",5,2019,06,19
143,Superb hotel,From the moment we entered the hotel until we departed everything was excellent. The facilities were superb and all the staff were very attentive and helpful. We shall certainly return and recommend the hotel highly.,5,2019,06,19

143,Corinthia hotel london,"Everything was super! Very friendly and polite staff! Food was delicious especially the hummus paste served during breakfast...never tasted such a good one! Room service was also very efficient!

143,Wonderful Hotel,Wonderful Hotel. Fantastic staff. Perfect location. Gorgeous rooms. Walking distance to many attractions. Very good breakfast. Loved the heated bathroom floor. The bed was very comfortable Will definitely return. ,5,2019,06,16
143,EXQUISITE ,"We visited recently for afternoon tea. A truly memorable day,exquisite service, ambience, with a first class tea.

The hotel looks stunning and whilst busy does not feel to noisy or overcrowded. All the staff we encountered could not be faulted, 5 star service without exception. 

The gentleman who looked after our afternoon tea experience truly was delightful, professional and attentive. 

Following our afternoon tea,we visited the Bassoon bar for drinks,which again had flawless service,and rounded off our day nicely.

We loved our day at the Corinthia and will return. Can highly recommend this charming hotel.",5,2019,06,16
143,Nothing too much trouble for this wonderful hotel !,"Location was just perfect - meant we could walk to the afternoon show we had booked.
Service was super. Hotel itself is stunning as was our room. Enjoyed our visit to the spa and also our evening at Tom’s bar - cocktails and bar snacks were divine. 
Would definitely recommend - all in all a fabulous experience !",5,2019,06,16
143,It's all about the customer service ,"My best friend treated me to this stunning hotel in central London as a pre 50th birthday treat. We were welcomed by the manager and given an upgrade on our room which was truly spectacular. The staff make this hotel along with the sublime exotic surroundings, great food venue, fantastic spacious bedroom filled with goodies and a relaxing Spa area. We spent a lot if hours in the hotel enjoying this special treat. Highly recommend. Well done to the staff. ",5,2019,06,16
143,First time in London,"The Corinthia exceeded all of our expectations. Being our first time there, we didn’t know what to expect and were blown away. We forgot to mention the doormen which were top notch as well as the other members of the staff. We would book another trip there.",5,2019,06,16
143,An Excellent choice of Hotel in all Respects,"A fantastic experience at the Corinthia hotel. The staff made us feel very welcome and nothing was too much trouble. A very relaxed atmosphere to the hotel and its staff makes it a great place to spend time in London. Location couldn’t be better and the Spa facilities and gym are second to none. Make sure you create enough time to relax fully in the 4 storey spa and gym.
An excellent stay. ",5,2019,06,16
143,The perfect hotel for business and for pleasure,"Well located for theater district and river walks, excellent business meeting facilities and support, excellent spa, over the top breakfast and the staff is plentiful meeting your every need.  No other place I would stay in Central London for the value ",5,2019,06,13
143,One of the best hotels to stay in London,We used the Penthouse for a photoshoot which was really beautiful. Lovely service and staff. The spa is one of the best in London too.The piano bar is also not to miss. Great cocktails and good service. ,5,2019,06,12
143,Opulent Excellence ,"Elegance and decadence at its upmost superior. 
From door staff to the Management, everyone understands what it is to serve. 
It has rewritten my belief of service levels in London being standard and basic - this was extraordinary at every interaction. 
The price point could perhaps deter the most discerning customer, but, it is well worth it! 
This hotel stay was so spectacular that it was the highlight of my entire marvelous trip back to the UK! 
Every space thoughtfully considered and gorgeously ornate with stunning fresh blooms and statement pieces  that are absolutely stunning and make you, for a moment feel that it’s all there for you and it’s like a dream moment where you feel you are as luxurious as your surroundings! 
I used to work in Hotels, so, please understand that for me to write this, holds a bit of gravitas as I would have only dreamed to have staff as dedicated and professional as all of these staff were. 

It’s also a thank you too the Corinthian Group which has now made several of my trips the most outstanding - with the hotel tipping even the most culturally fulfilling itineraries. 
I have had the pleasure of staying in your Budapest Hotel and I am now booking Malta ) 

Anyone looking to think shall I? Make sure you do!  You will not regret booking this hotel for any guest wishing to make a memorable lavish luxurious stay. ",5,2019,06,12
143,Tom Kerridge ,Setting is wonderful and the bar fantastic. The food was substandard for the price. I had fish and chips and the chips were not very nice at all. Not sure the man Kerridge would have approved of the food we ate that evening. ,3,2019,06,11
143,BEAUTIFUL HOTEL AND PERFECT LOCATION,"I spend a couple of nights in this luxury hotel in the heart of London. It has a perfect location for exploring the historical city centre.
The room was a classic one, very spacious with luxury atmosphere; big and comfy bed, wonderful bathroom and really nice amenities. The only downside was the view at the big gray wall…
The service was good and we had a wonderful time in London.",5,2019,06,09
143,Charming hotel that delivered a wonderful experience for the family,"From start to finish the service at the Corinthia Hotel was exceptional. The staff were friendly and arranged for a early check in after a long long flight. They then prepared a gift pack (an adorable hedgehog with a crown) for our daughter which kept her delighted for the duration of the stay. The rooms were made up perfectly each day with lavender potpourri, new bottled water and fresh towels. The little one enjoyed returning back to the hotel in the late afternoon to see her little dolls arranged nicely on the bed each day. The hotel itself has a classic old world charm about it that summed up everything that we enjoyed on our trip to London. I’m just looking forward to the next opportunity to return to London and the Corinthia in the near future.",5,2019,06,08
143,Superb Service !,"We booked using American Express Platinum Travel, we checked in at 12pm, had a room upgrade, and taken on a tour of the hotel, to explore all of its amenities . The hotel is clean and tasteful, and all the staff super friendly, and very professional . We live in Salisbury, Wiltshire, and travel up to London once a month, usually trying a different hotel, however, The Corinthia is a keeper, we will definitely  be back. Great stay. Breakfast was brilliant,and we had lunch at the bar, which was also superb. Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,06,08
143,our trip to london,"this hotel is perfect in all respects, good staff great rooms, good food nothing is a problem and they went the extra mile to help us celebrate our anniversary, even a cake that was totally unexpected  thank you very much",5,2019,06,06
143,Perfection,"All I can say was this hotel was one of our best hotel experiences ever!  We have stayed at many of the top hotels in London and the Corinthia exceeds them all.

Every staff member made us feel cared for and special.
Perfection!

143,A great day out in London,"The best hotel in London lived up to all it states. Excellent service, wine and food, although £1200 for a night in a hotel in London  is not for the feint hearted. Amazing that the staff where not aware of the trooping of the colour held opposite since1640. ",5,2019,06,03
143,Great stay in a perfect location,"We recently returned from a six night stay at the Corinthia. The hotel is perfectly located on a quiet street right across from a tube stop and a few blocks from Trafalger Square. The room was very large and well appointed for a London hotel and the lobby and bars/restaurants were great. In addition the staff was very helpful and provided us with a special anniversary dessert in our room which was a nice touch. The only modest disappointment was the spa. While the space and facilities were excellent the actual service were not quite as described and the atmosphere wasn't on par with similar spas we have experienced. Overall, however, it is hard to beat the Corinthia when in London.",5,2019,06,02
143,my hotel (home) in London,"As a smoker, I got a smoking room, which is very hard to find anywhere in the world. That already made me feel like home. add the great location, the supurb service, the beautiful and comfortable room and the tasty food , and you get the perfect place to stay.
I will not need to look for a hotel in London anymore. this is the one I will always come back to when I am in London. PERFECT",5,2019,05,30
143,A Top Hotel Experience,"We will absolutely return to the Corinthia hotel in the future. The staff was superb and the amenities were extraordinary. Additionally, the room was superior to nearly any other hotel I've stayed in around the world. We look forward to our return and could not recommend Corinthia more. ",5,2019,05,28
143,Birthday weekend,"I stayed at The Corinthia as a birthday treat for my husband’s 40th. We were treated with champagne and a birthday cake on arrival at our room which was a wonderful touch and really set the tone for our stay. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff were all extremely accommodating and friendly. The spa was amazing and felt like pure luxury. We tried Kerridge’s for dinner and loved the atmosphere and the food was great. An overall wonderful stay!",5,2019,05,28
143,My Daughter’s birthday,"We planned a trip to London for my daughters birthday, we stayed at the corinthia hotel as watched recently on the tv , and noted how hard the staff work to ensure the guest have an amazing stay ... we all arrived to a friendly and professional meet and greet, we were offered a tour of the facilities of the hotel , then by the time we arrived at the beautiful rooms our luggage was waiting for us , the staff are so helpful and friendly it’s a real credit to this amazing hotel , 
We had a wonderful afternoon champagne lunch and could not ask for more , the spa facilities on offer are fantastic, to round the evening off with dinner reservations at kerridges ! 
The rooms offer everything you need for a relaxing stay and breakfast in the morning was perfect

143,Wow,What a fantastic time . The hotel and services were over the top .  Amazing suite and adjoining room.  The north hall bar is really a special room .  Loved the spa and gym . I’ll for sure be back. Thanks all ,5,2019,05,26
143,Memorable stay at the Corinthia hotel,"Corinthia hotel is located in my favourite location in London, near Trafalgar Square. Whether you are a business or leisure traveler this place offers you exceptional facilities and services for your memorable stay. The atmosphere is unconstrained and relaxive - all you need to enjoy your stay in a best way.",5,2019,05,26
143,Perfect spot in London,"I stayed at the Corinthia  with my husband and two adult children.  It is a spectacular hotel in walking distance of great restaurants, theater, and tourist attractions.  The Spa and exercise facility is top notch. I had not intended to use those services but once I saw the quality of the facility I booked a massage and spent time in the gym. (Remember to bring a bathing suit to enjoy the ""thermal floor"").  The buffet breakfast wad delicious in a visually spectacular room.  

The service at the hotel was what you would expect at a hotel of this caliber.  I was especially impressed with the concierge service who gave great restaurant advice and helped with tickets to tourist attractions that I did not get in advance.  

When next in London, I will stay here again!",5,2019,05,23
143,Corinthia London,"This is an outstanding hotel, both for business and pleasure, and it's priced extremely favorably. The rooms and facilities are all top-notch, the staff is professional and courteous, and the price point is beyond reasonable. ",5,2019,05,22
143,London luxury BEST SPA,London!  Luxury!  Love this hotel!   It’s second to none.  Get city or water view though!  Join their club!  Celebrate your special day - they help you!  The concierge team is the best!   Walking distance to all,5,2019,05,21
143,Decadent afternoon tea. ,"If you’re looking for a luxurious treat then afternoon tea at The Corinthia is a must. 
The setting and ambiance is very plush. The lobby & Crystal lounge, with the huge chandelier within the domed ceiling (featuring a single red globe which points to the heart of the building), offers a comfortable and luxurious setting. 
The actual afternoon tea is very traditional. You have a choice of 3 - classic afternoon tea, classic with a glass of champagne or classic with a glass of Rose champagne. 
They have a huge selection of teas, along with coffee & got chocolate. 
There were 5 fingers sandwiches per guest and they were replenished throughout. 
Next came the scones - choice of plain &/or fruit. They’re delivered in a lovely wooden box along with clotted cream, strawberry jam as well as a rhubarb preserve. 
Next came the cake trolley. There were 4 cakes/pastries, lemon drizzle cake, French fancies and flavoured marshmallow strips. These are plated and presented on the traditional afternoon tea tiered cake stand. 
Tea was topped up continuously and you could chose extra cakes if you wanted. 
The staff were great. Very professional, yet friendly and promoted a very relaxed experience. 
Unlike some hotels afternoon tea at The Corinthia doesn’t subscribe to the conveyor belt experience whereby you have a set time before the bill arrives and you’re encouraged to leave as a queue is forming. 
The central lobby and crystal lounge flower displays are very impressive and give off an amazing scent. 
If you’re looking for a luxurious sweet treat in decadent surroundings...book The Corinthia. ",5,2019,05,20
143,Birthday treat for my daughter,"Fantastic afternoon tea!
The food was amazing, the fancies extra amazing, the staff attentive but not over the top.
The ambience was lovely with the piano player.
I would highly recommend.
If I had 1 niggle it would be that the area for afternoon tea is a thoroughfare for guests, many dressed in gym gear. A room designated for afternoon tea would be better.
But overall, I would go again, and would recommend to my friends etc.",5,2019,05,20
143,Overrated,"Having stayed a couple of times now, it feels like this hotel is tired and overrated. The room we had was nothing special and was not even particularly clean. Service can be frosty and perfunctory. Not the standard you would expect from the hype. There are better hotels at this price point and location. The Spa is wonderful. It is well staffed and beautifully designed. Maybe consider staying somewhere else and using the Espa spa.",3,2019,05,20
143,Comfort is in the details,"Meticulous detail in the rooms, guest comfort is designed into the room furniture. Walking closet, cloth lined drawers, light buttons etc..
Hot towel rack, heated marble floors, great ceiling shower.
Northall is a great restaurant. 
Too bad Massimo is not there anymore though.
Both bars are great, and teatime in the lobby is an experience.
ESPA is one of the best spas around.
One point to improve: Bottled water left for the guests by the night turndown service, I wish they go green and do not use plastic bottles.",5,2019,05,19
143,Touch of class in London ,"Outstanding staff, facilities, bars, restaurants, spa and rooms
I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend the Corinthia Hotel for a London break.
Easy access to theatres, Trafalgar Square, Westminster and Buckingham Palace and a short walk from Embankment station ",5,2019,05,18
143,A.Osbourne,"I have used the Corinthia on multiple occasions over the years from the first month of its opening. The rooms themselves are looking tired, soiled carpets, tired linen and televisions that don’t sit level to name a few issues. Not the quality of room that drew me to the hotel originally.

",3,2019,05,15
143,Anothe rGreat Stay,Had an extended business trip taking me over the weekend so my wife joined. This hotel has everything you need for business or tourism. This time I even discovered a cigar lounge in the garden. The staff and accomodations are excellent. The Spa and gym are top rated and it is amazing you can use many of the facilities as part of your room charge. I wil always come back here.,5,2019,05,15
143,A touch of luxury,"My wife Carol and I spent the weekend in London primarily to see her youngest sister sing in Verdi's Requiem at the Royal Albert Hall. Our son in law obtained a substantial corporate discount courtesy of his Bank who are regular patrons.
We have stayed in a number of luxury hotels over the 50 years of our marriage but this has to be right at the top of the list. The attention from the staff was amazing. The room was spacious and absolutely quiet (must have good sound proofing). The marble surround bath is extremely deep so beware any oldies out there they are tricky to get in and out of.
The Embankment underground station is just 5 minutes walk away so great connections to the city and sights. 
We had a lovely three night stay thankyou Corinthia.",5,2019,05,14
143,Wonderful afternoon tea,"I booked afternoon tea as a special treat for a friend’s birthday. We were going to go to a different 5* hotel but they were fully booked. I’m glad they were as this was AMAZING. Beautiful surroundings, outstanding service and the champagne, tea and pastries were delicious. Best of all it was incredibly relaxing, we didn’t feel rushed and my friend said she was so relaxed she felt like she’d had a massage. Worth every penny.",5,2019,05,14
143,Treated Like Royalty,"The Corinthia Hotel is an experience to behold. The level of service is outstanding, attentive and personable and by no means pretentious despite the high end market. We stayed in an Executive suit overlooking the glass roof of the Crystal moon lounge, simply stunning. The afternoon tea was perfect, again led by great service and the food was superb. Basoon bar had a Manhattan feel with great cocktails, we went for one and stayed for 3. Then we went to Kerridges, the service was not as good, we were delayed getting to our table and then as we were the last cover of the night the experienced was rushed. As good as the food was, it was let down by this. The Spa is very good, a real bonus for the hotel. We had a massage which was first class. The breakfast in the Northall capped of a truely memorable stay and one we hope to repeat. Last but not least to the doorman who ran a good 100m down the main road to hail a taxi for us. Going above and beyond. thank you to all at the corinthia. ",5,2019,05,13
143,London Trip,"Excellent experience at the Corinthia in London. From check in to check out they really look after you. The location is superb, that staff are super attentive with no request too much. We had a great weekend topped off with superb service.",5,2019,05,13
143,Lovely Hotel but noisy and loud Bar & Grill,"We love the Corinthia Hotel but were unpleasantly surprised by the noisy Kerridge's Bar & Grill the was recommended to us at check-in. They refused to organize a dish from the restaurant and we were sat at a very small table in a loud and noisy environment. Felt more like a conveyor belt in a busy train station.
The Basson Bar has replaced it wonderful ambience with life music and piano - the soul of place - with a bad sound system and soulless DJ. We really miss the old wonderful flair.",4,2019,05,13
143,17 pound drinks are weighty.,Excellent service. A bit strange arrangement carrying your bags through center bar tables to get to reception. Good rooms. Good location.  Not much to complain about except ridiculously pricy drinks - but that is London for you. ,4,2019,05,11
143,Excellent,"Top class hotel in a great location near Leicester Square. Spa is unbelievable, thermal floor and chairs. 
Gym is well equipped with all the latest equipment. 
Breakfast is out of this world, three rooms full of food.
Your stay will be a pleasure.",5,2019,05,08
143,HOME WHEN I AM IN TOWN,The hotel is simply beautiful. From the entrance to the spa. And beauty makes people feel good. I wish I could spend more time there and try higher standard rooms. But the value is a bit high from my standpoint. My room had a couple of clearly old elements that should affect its the value. This is maybe the only little spot on a candid canvas. The service though was impeccable.,5,2019,05,08
143,Lovely Elegant Oasis in busy London,"Our stay at the Corinthia was absolutely perfect. 5+ star hotel.  Staff is AMAZING!!!  Everyone was so friendly & helpful,  including: Sahil(Concierge), Sam (Manager),  Pieter in the Northall Restaurant, housekeeping, room service, door man just to name a few .  We stayed in a beautifully updated suite that was a lovely oasis to return to after a day of sight seeing.  Quiet and elegantly appointed.  Gorgeous floral arrangements throughout the hotel and even fresh flowers in our suite.  
We enjoyed both breakfast and dinner in the Northall Restaurant.  In addition to a traditional english breakfast, they offer a breakfast buffet with many healthy food options.  Dinner was superb - unique pairings of fresh veggies and fish entrees. 
Great location to many national landmarks and also walking distance to Embankment Tube STation.   CAn't wait to return!",5,2019,05,07
143,Superb location,Enjoyed my stay at the hotel. Excellent SPA and recreational facilities. I though roughly enjoyed my breakfast with plenty of healthy options available to choose from. You can walk from the hotel to the high street and enjoy shopping!,5,2019,05,07
143,Perfect London Hotel,This hotel has a beautiful inner courtyard restaurant for tea.  The hotel is well situated and within walking distance of many well known historical sites and museums.  The service was excellent and the room quiet and comfortable.,5,2019,05,06
143,Top location,Great place to stay if you need to be near the center and are looking for an Hotel with great staff and facilities.  You will be cared for and looked after. Everyone want to make you have a plaesent stay. ,4,2019,05,06
143,Pleasant stay for family and business,"We stayed as a family and booked two rooms; a suite and a room for a few days during our stay in London.
The service was excellent, tea time absoluely lovey. Room service was excellent. The rooms are large, luxurious and clean. Location is perfect  The suite was perfect to conduct business meetings without the wandering eyes. The hotel is quite large. The doormen were pleasant and the conciergerie quite efficient.  The only negative comment I have is the service of the maids; always at different times, somewhat lacking in efficiency and also no smiles. But all in all, we enjoyed our stay.",5,2019,05,03
143,Enjoyable afternoon tea ... but not exceptional,"We have been to some outstanding afternoon teas (the Dorchester, the Ritz, the Mandarin Oriental etc) and had high hopes for the Corinthia, especially after Thomas Kochs joined the team from Claridges. Sad to say, we were a little disappointed with the afternoon. The Baccarat chandelier is certainly beautiful, but the tables and chairs sadly do not match splendor and were a little uncomfortable to sit at to eat. The sandwiches were very tasty (the chicken sandwich was the favourite for all 4 of us) and the cakes were simply stunning. Thomas's idea of presenting them on a cake trolley is a winner. The tea service and champagne glasses certainly go towards making the experience a pleasant one, but the lack of attentiveness from the staff marred our experience a little. As at other 5* afternoon teas; our tea cups were not replenished when empty, we had to pour our own & request for the tea pots to be re-filled. Our napkins were not refolded if we left the table, our cutlery not replenished (we used the knife to cut the finger sandwiches) and when we were asked if we would like further sandwiches, we were given one further finger each. A wider choice of cocktails for those that don't drink champagne would be an improvement too. We understand it is a walkway through the hotel (it is the same at the Dorchester), but the continual flow of people/public/hotel guests walking through did not help with the afternoon tea ambiance. The pianist was a pleasant addition and we did enjoy our afternoon. It's worth a visit, but sadly it's not up there with the A-listers for us.",4,2019,05,03
143,It's not a hotel but feels like your private residence while in London,"Having recently travelled to London on business several times this year, the Corinthia Hotel is the perfect place to stay in London whether for business or pleasure.   It is a hidden gem.  The location is fabulous, near the Thames, London Eye, Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, Westminster, St. James Park, the Strand.  This hotel is peaceful and elegant.  Located on a quiet street away from the crowds but within walking distance to the above. The staff is warm, welcoming and attentive without being over bearing.  The hotel is stunning with rooms that feel like a private apartment, warm and cozy with elegant finishes.  I love the large marble bathrooms with deep soaking tub and heated floors.  Room service is outstanding.   This is one hotel where I can't wait to order room service and stay in my room.  The food is amazing and the room service staff are so pleasant.  There are 3 bars and restaurants on property each with it's own unique character.  Kerridge's has a renowed chef with an upscale pub feel that has excellent food.  I will return for a personal stay later this year with my family.  It's that special! ",5,2019,05,01
143,Sad to Say I Was Very Disappointed!,"I had high hopes for this hotel, particularly as the Manager had moved from Claridges to work here.  When I checked in I was told I would be upgraded and the girl on reception said the room I was given 635 was her favourite in the hotel.  Obviously her expectations are lower than mine.  The room was spacious and quiet overlooking an atrium but the decor was dated, the carpet need replacing, it was grubby and a stool in the dressing area had an obvious stain on it, which immediately caught the eye and one wondered why the cleaners had failed to deal with this.  The Receptionist asked me if I would like a kettle to make tea in the morning I said yes, it never materialised. When returning to my room I called the lift and when it arrived I went to go in but someone inside had already pressed the 'close doors' button, the doors closed on me causing me much pain.  There were two employees in the lift as well as three guests.  One of the employees asked me if I was ok to which I replied 'No', no more was said and they got out at the next floor.  I was in great pain and when I examined my arms I had a cut to one, and 4 days later I have considerable bruising to both arms, and they are still painful.  I feel that the members of staff should have reported my injuries.  To sum up I can only say that on my next birthday trip I will be going back to Claridges - such a shame this hotel just doesnt deliver.",3,2019,05,01
143,Disappointed,"We didn’t stay at the hotel but as part of my sons wedding party, we booked the bar area as part of the celebrations. We were all looking forward to visiting this amazing place. 

The service is good and the drinks were lovely. However after spending hundreds of pounds we were told that some of the guests might be getting drunk and they wouldn’t serve any more drinks. I wasn’t drinking so I knew we weren’t loud or rude so this surprised me. We are all aged 35-70  and unlikely to cause trouble. We regularly socialise as a family in all locations in London and have never been treated like this. I wouldn’t recommend this place and nor would we return. I also never leave bad reviews but feel I need to write this review.",3,2019,04,28
143,Fab trip to London,Great hotel 0ne block from Embankment station. Amazing check in experience. Room and hotel were impeccable. Very friendly and helpful. ONLY comment - When paying $600 per night I think lobby coffee or room service coffee should be a free service. Would stay here again in a heart beat and highly recommend. ,5,2019,04,26
143,Just beautiful,"From the moment you arrive to the scent that hits you from the entrance to the Northall. The staff from the doorman, the staff at reception and the bar staff, if you are lucky enough to stay here you will not be disappointed. The gym is unreal. The rooms and restaurants fabulous. Can’t wait until I return.",5,2019,04,25
143,Corinthia Hotel Review,"The Corinthia is an Incredible hotel with incredible service. Everyone here was friendly and ready to help with anything.  The location is central, and in the middle of everything, you would want to do in London.  The food was delicious and was available at all hours.  The lobby and sitting room are gorgeous, and the flower shop is a must see.  I highly recommend the Corinthia Hotel.  ",5,2019,04,24
143,"JUST LOVELY, IN EVERY RESPECT!","What a fantastic experience! Such gracious, sincere staff who obviously love what they do and take an exemplary pride in delivering the best service you can imagine.

Our wonderful driver picked us up punctually and was great company throughout the journey. The doormen, reception staff and guest relations lady who showed us round the hotel were friendly, efficient and welcoming. We were delighted to be upgraded to the stunning, spacious Garden suite : outstanding in every comfort and amenity. The flowers we had ordered were simply gorgeous. Such attention to details, aesthetically and practically. We ordered a sumptuous late room service lunch soon after arrival, which was faultless in presentation and taste. As a very fussy vegetarian I was well-catered for and my husband reports his shawarma was delicious. My buttered spinach, generous size pizza, tasty garlic bread and exquisite desserts were all memorable and sufficient that we didn't need dinner! Great coffee and tea facilities with good choice of varieties. Both staff members delivering and removing our beautifully presented tray could not have been more helpful or kind. Wonderful sleep every night of our stay, the duvet was light but just the right degree of warmth and cosines, the mattress so comfortable. Luxurious spacious marble bathroom with built-in TV, large fluffy towels that feel like a warm hug, well-padded slippers that feel like you're walking on clouds. Lovely touches every at evening turn-down like lavender fragrance and chocolate.

We visited the Spa several times in the early evening and we had a fantastic relaxing few hours. It was never too busy. The jacuzzi is state of the art and perfect for some quality couple time.  

In the stunning Crystal Moon lounge diligent staff were always asking if we needed anything. We treated our guests to a marvellous afternoon champagne tea and they were equally bowled over.

Wonderful spaces throughout to read and relax. Details like fragrance in the public areas enhance the general sense of well-being and thoughtfulness towards guests.
Pedicure: great treatments, friendly staff, lovely surroundings.
Gym: great facilities for a good workout.
We felt so well-cocooned in our little corner of paradise that only a few inevitable niggles surfaced but nothing that impacted the truly exceptional overall impression we were left with of this dazzling hotel which aims for and often exceeds perfection. It will be a great joy to return as soon as possible!",5,2019,04,23
143,Corinthia London for the height of British hospitality,Awed by the beauty of this hotel. Spacious Executive King Room was perfect for me and my 21-year-old son. Turn-down service with lavender sachet dreamy! Delicious dinner at Kerridges... late-night cocktail in Northall...  attentive staff and stunning chandelier in inner foyer was Instagramable for sure!,5,2019,04,22
143,loved the corinthia hotel,"excellent location, clean and comfortable room, great shower, staff was nice and helpful our entire stay. my wife spilled some staining material on her sweater and jacket and the staff took charge and sent  to laundry and it was perfect.",5,2019,04,22
143,Francis Kalangala,"Nice hotel, nice accommodations, excellent breakfast and very professional, helpful and impeccable staff. The location is fantastic. Having lots of shopping and touristic sites around is also a bonus. I highly recommend this hotel",5,2019,04,22
143,Wonderful location in London!,"We stayed at the La Corinthia after looking up multiple places online. We frequent luxury resorts around the world. I loved the location of this hotel, the room was small but we didn’t really need to be in there much as we were sight seeing. The spa was amazing and I loved the design/concepts. Maybe because we were there on a weekend explains why it was so crowded. The staff was very friendly and the concierge helped us tremendously. Thank you for the great accommodations!! ",4,2019,04,21
143,Delicious Easter afternoon Tea,"Have been wanting to visit this hotel sine seeing the documentary about the running of the place. Booked for the Easter Afternoon Tea today. Service was excellent, very attentive. Sandwiches and scones were delicious but the outstanding feature was the cake trolley. We got to sample all and they were truly amazing.  We have done a lot of afternoon teas and this has to be one of the best.",5,2019,04,21
143,Beautifully Grand ,"We spent a few nights at The Corinthia in November 2018. The hotel was all dressed up for the holidays with the most beautiful, tasteful, elegant decorations imaginable.  We were given a gorgeous room with perhaps the largest bath I’ve ever seen. 

Check in: we had quite a long wait for our room, but we did arrive early.  Some miscommunications with staff about the amount of time we would have to wait, and after a very long flight, we were utterly exhausted after the extended wait. 

Room: beautiful. The hotel was having issues with the heating and air conditioning.  The room was oppressively hot and stuffy, and we were asked to open our windows.  Fortunately, this worked.  Bed was very comfortable with fine pillows and linens.  Slippers were the best we have ever received in any five star.  Soft and super plush.  

Bath: truly luxurious. Huge center tub. Great shower. The highlight of our stay. 

Breakfast: good, but not among the best we’ve ever had.  My daughter loved the fresh berries.  Service somewhat harried. 

",4,2019,04,21
143,Best stay ever!,"A wonderful birthday present and an amazing time away! Could not have asked for better service and or a more comfortable stay. 

The Spa was fantastic and the food even better! 

Couldn’t recommend more and will definitely be returning in the near future! ",5,2019,04,21
143,Best 5* hotel in London ,"The Corinthia is the most luxurious and stunning hotel in central London. Everything from the staff to the rooms and decor were second to none. This hotel really epitomises 5 star luxury service. The bathrooms with the heated floors and built in tv are great. But the best bit has to be the award winning spa!!! It is incredible and is included in your night stay. Makes the price tag well worth it. Couldn’t recommend this hotel enough, 10/10.",5,2019,04,20
143,Exceptional service,From booking until we left everyone we came into contact with was first class.  They made our stay very special and it was the perfect hotel to celebrate my husbands 40th Birthday. Nothing was too much trouble. We had family join us for a surprise breakfast played along with by the staff and complimentary touches added to the room for our arrival made an extra special trip even more so. The location was great just over a 10 minute walk over from Waterloo. Would highly recommend. ,5,2019,04,20
143,amazing stay for Michael birthday,"we had the best stay.. with drink reception in room, excellent food and drinks in Northall and tasty cocktails in Basson bar. relaxing afternoon in the best spa.  thank you Corinthia hotel. we will come back again soon",5,2019,04,19
143,Top Luxury Hotel in London,"Amazing service from arrival experience to departure. The staff is always engaged with their guests and are there to ensure everything is to guest's complete satisfaction. The spa is out of this world, I did not want to leave. Thank you!",5,2019,04,18
143,afternoon tea,"Lovely contemporary hotel just off Trafalgar Square.  Had the champagne afternoon tea and enjoyed it.  Couldn't really fault the venue, service or food. Not cheap but for a treat , well worth it.
The only niggle was that the table we sat at was in a draft from the front doors in the lobby, only a problem in winter I think.",5,2019,04,18
143,It’s the little things...," I travel so much, I sometimes overlook the big stuff and focus on the details. 

This hotel has perfected the details from overlooking an upgrade and immediately fixing it to pointing out the requested cigar lounge was right in front of me to simply the staff in London. 

Rooms are great, showers to die for and a lobby you want to bring home. 

The location is close to all the great walking attractions and has a wonderful car service (plus taxis) if you need to leave. 

Most of all the concierge staff helped in every possible way. They made the stay perfect. 

I highly recommend this hotel! ",5,2019,04,17
143,Excellent Hotel Excellent Location,This hotel is ideal for business or family trip - very centrally located quick to offices as well as museums. Staff were very friendly and accommodating. The breakfast buffet is beautiful and very complete. The carrara marble in the bathroom is a nice tough. I highly recommend this terrific venue.,5,2019,04,17
143,Favourite Hotel in London,This is an extraordinary hotel. The suites are beautiful and the service is outstanding. We have stayed here several times from Sydney and The Corinthia Hotel London in Whitehall Place is consistently excellent.  We love the 5 minute walk to Soho/Covent Garden and the easy bike ride to Hyde Park.,5,2019,04,15
143,Out of this world,"We had a two day overnight business stay and it was our first time at the Corinthia. It was just lovely, a fabulous hotel with exceptional staff providing world class service. We wouldn’t hesitate to return Faultless!",5,2019,04,15
143,Amother excellent eperiance,"This is the 2nd time we have stayed on after a conference at the Corinthia, and for the 2nd year running they are without question exceptional.  The staff are wonderful, happy to help and very friendly clearly enjoying their work environment and nothing is a chore.  ",5,2019,04,15
143,One night visit,"Overall an excellent hotel, situated centrally with delightful staff.
Attended a private family function.
One night stay - everything first class.
Nothing negative to report. A most pleasant experience.",5,2019,04,14
143,Luxury as you would expect,"Customer service, quality and luxury that you would expect from a hotel of this reputation. Lovely time, breakfast in the room is to be recommended and the spa could easily absorb half a day. Parking is very expensive but given the location, kind of to be expected.",5,2019,04,14
143,One downside: the stay was too short....,"Great hotel in downtown London. Stylish but not pish nor dusty. Beautiful rooms, great service: magnificent bar (and exterior smokers room in front of a fireplace). A definite keeper for future visits.",5,2019,04,14
143,Enjoyable stay but not quite VFM,"Enjoyable stay in one of the Exec King “Corner” rooms - they accommodate a glorious bathtub in the centre of the bathroom. 
The bed was exceptionally comfortable. The staff and service was exceptional as always. 
Then there’s the hotel fragrance! I love it. If only it was commercially available.",5,2019,04,13
143,Amazing experience,"Wow - where to start... 

The hotel is in a great location and the facilities are amazing. The spa is out of this world. 

The food (especially the afternoon tea) is delicious! 

But I believe the most impressive part of our stay was the staff. The Corinthia should be very proud as I believe they have some of the best staff in London. The customer service was just simply the best! 

If I could score this hotel more than 5 stars I would. Our first trip to the Corinthia but certainly not the last, we can’t wait to return. ",5,2019,04,12
143,Excellent hotel,An excellent quality five star hotel deserves six first class service very high standard of cleanliness very good location for city and west end room and room service first class would definitely recommend this hotel as one of the best London hotels,5,2019,04,11
143,Wonderful,Popped in for a glass of red wine during a busy day site seeing . Such a wonderful hotel to visit . It's beautiful and the service here is second to none . You are made to feel special on every visit .,5,2019,04,10
143,Afternoon Tea,"Treated a friend to Afternoon Tea today for her birthday. Highly recommend the experience - great selection of scrummy sandwiches and cakes with a glass of bubbly. Service and setting was fabulous and welcoming. 
Am a big fan of an afternoon tea and would rate Corinthia's as one of the best in London",5,2019,04,10
143,Afternoon tea!,"On the whole very good, sat on a low sofa which wasn’t the most comfortable when eating. The food was nice, some unusual sandwich fillings, the salt beef was amazing! Not sure that I was entirely happy about the cakes being on display in an uncovered trolley...too many different types of tea on the menu but no alternative coffees. This may sound picky but it’s not cheap and service was added to the bill. I would rather leave my own tip. I would probably go again but won’t rush. ",4,2019,04,10
143,Outstanding Service and Great Eye for Detail,"We've stayed a couple of days at the Corinthia Hotel London as we where attended an event. I can assure you that everyone was so impressed with the overall service and level of detail at this property. 
The staff are so friendly and supper efficient and any requests where dealt in a very professional manner. Will definitely recommend this Hotel to anyone if they are looking for the best.  ",5,2019,04,09
143,The most perfect stay!!,"We decided to book a family wellbeing weekend and it was the best decision we made. The hotel is simply beautiful with the perfect mix of traditionalism with a modern twist, sprinkled with luxury and service that could be summarised as excellence with kindness. Will most certainly be returning!",5,2019,04,09
143,Rooms far too hot ,"I have stayed at this hotel many times as have my friends. The attention to detail is generally good and the breakfasts are now great. 
However I have one big big issue and that's that the air-conditining just doesn't work!! If I go to a hotel and set 18c on the dial i expect 18c and not 22c. At the Corinthia whatever you set you get heat. 
Now watching the TV series it seems that they pay attention to lots of things that I don't care about like the thread count of my towels or the size of them. I would much rather dry myself off with paper towels after managing to sleep in a cool room than basking in a luxury towel like a space cowboy because I haven't slept.
In this respect I don't believe the Corinthia is fair to it's clients. At 500 plus a night the Aircon should work. And it just doesn't.
I stopped staying there. ",3,2019,04,07
143,Wonderful stay,"Beautiful hotel with exceptional service, nothing is too much trouble. Wonderful experience at the spa. The food and cocktails at Kerridges was also excellent. Would definitely recommend and will be returning.",5,2019,04,07
143,Just wow!,"Title says it all, wow to everything! Wonderful birthday weekend here, the thermal suite and facilities are simply divine. Room was gorgeous, food very good and location perfect. My one and very small observation would be that the reception staff, although super polite and professional, could be a little warmer/friendlier. This is a personal view and was in no way an issue. Thank you Corinthia, I can’t wait to come back! ",5,2019,04,07
143,A real surprise,"Whilst the on-line reviews were very good, and the photos very appealing, we were not ready for just how good this hotel is. The quality is superb, the staff friendly and helpful and the location much better than we realised. Our new favourite in London",5,2019,04,06
143,"Wonderful Location, Great Service & Nice Amenities","I recently spent four nights at the Corinthia and believe that it is one of the nicest hotels that I have stayed in while visiting London. I had an Executive Room, which was both spacious and well-appointed. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the bathroom was spectacular - great bath products and rain shower. The only thing I wished for was a bedside clock - if there was one somewhere in the room, I missed it. The location of Corinthia is excellent - just steps away from many of London's leading attractions and perfect if you enjoy walking or jogging along the Thames. The dining options are also excellent and provide a nice variety. The hotel staff were all attentive and friendly. I definitely plan to return.",5,2019,04,05
143,A fantastic relaxing experience in the heart of the city,"entering the hotel, a sense of serene grandiose takes over, mesmerized by the chandelier sparkling in a bright morning. The receptionist were extremely accommodating, sending an sms as soon as the room was ready. The room, as expected, is nothing short of the best quality Corinthia can offer. Then, the SPA, a world unto it's own. do not forget to dine there. Northall is an excellent experience, but Kerridges is a must go to all foodies. Never has british cuisine has been so well represented. ",5,2019,04,05
143,Heaven again...,"I was able to stay once more in this fabulous Hotel. And again i had a great room with a comfortable bed, a guaranteed good sleep after a long day at work, unfortunately i had no time for the famous Tee Ceremony but i hope next time...because i will come again and again...thank you, Ute",5,2019,04,02
143,Pure perfection,"This place is a peaceful oasis in the midst of London’s busy daily routine. My wife and I came here for a late night snack, although the word snack doesn’t do honor to the sublime lobster club sandwich they serve. The staff are discrete in the background, but are there for you at the blink of an eye. A pity we couldn’t stay there for the night.",5,2019,04,02
143,Keep it a Secret!,"I almost hate to review this place. If you’re lucky enough to go… Go now. The spa is better than any Swiss or German mountain spa I’ve ever seen. And it’s all in central London. There are shower and water therapy stations  that can cure any jet-lag or body aches you may have. The therapists are top!
 The rooms are perfectly appointed with every amenity you could imagine. The staff is incredibly  willing to help you with any and everything you might need. 
 After staying at every five-star hotel in London… This is our home now.",5,2019,04,01
143,Amazing from check in to check out,"This is far the best hotel we have stayed in.  The Spa topped it off! We loved every minute of our stay.  The room, Spa, Dinner was amazing.  The staff were so friendly.  This is now our hotel of choice when we stay in London.  ",5,2019,04,01
143,Quality Service and Atmosphere,"A first rate hotel, great staff, and a terrific location.  Everything was perfect.  The bed was superb.  
Food  for our event was excellent.  Arrivals and departures were always made easy by the staff.  I love the location, whether for a walk or for the tube stop nearby.  This hotel is the best i have stayed in while in London.  ",5,2019,03,31
143,First Rate Hotel,"Excellent, friendly staff...extremely well managed hotel. Even though in an extremely busy section of London, my room was quiet with double glazed windows. Very large bathroom and room was quite comfortable. If you have time, an unbelievable Spa. Would definitely stay there again.",5,2019,03,31
143,Exceeded our expectations!,"The title says it all, we couldn't find fault - therefore must return and try harder! Seriously, we have stayed at some of the best in the UK/Europe and none surpass this in our opinion. 
They excel with decor, ambience, service, and we are now recalling the arrival/first impressions with the exceedingly smart liveried smiling, genuine, friendly multiple doormen - ditto concierges and receptionists, porters etc. The spaciousness, design, comfort of the bedrooms/suites (yes, we experienced both!) were truly impressive. The attentiveness of housekeeping and standards of cleanliness both in rooms and public areas was exceptional. 
We love good food and the meals here ticked our boxes. Every breakfast was a culinary experience with the staff seemingly capable of catering for the whims of all palates. We thoroughly enjoyed Kerridge's for a lunch and an evening meal, and will revisit - Michelin quality food with great beer and wines, with exceptional staff matching those elsewhere in the hotel.",5,2019,03,31
143,Hit or miss,Nice stay but have to say not really at the same level as other five star hotels such as claridges or savoy. Service was hit or miss - no turn down service one night; an hour for housekeeping to send up extra pillows; no blackout curtains; no guest card needed to operate lifts. First world problems for sure but when you’re charging 500 pounds a night...,3,2019,03,30
143,Quintessential British hotel,"Perfect example of old fashioned British hospitality and service. Lovely hotel. Delightful rooms, lovely surrounds, a very pleasant place to stay. Tom Kerridge’s restaurant inside the hotel was amazing. Make sure you book the restaurant we’ll in advance though.",5,2019,03,30
143,Enjoyable stay at the Corinthia London,"The Corinthia has been my hotel of choice in London for the last 5 years, with me staying three or four times a year. The rooms and public spaces are all well maintained and beautifully designed. Staff are all really good and friendly.

The breakfast is first rate too.

One minor irritant is the high staff turnover. Each time I arrive I am asked if I have stayed with them before, which is a bit odd and one would think it would be in their system. 

Also now happens in the Bassoon Bar, which used to be my favorite bar in London and I would go most nights I was staying at the Hotel. Unfortunately all the old staff, charming well trained Italians,who always recognized me and made me welcome, all seem to have left and again keep getting asked if I have been in the bar before. In addition they have now changed the music program from, what was mellow jazz to something quite terrible. On this last trip only had one drink in there and went elsewhere as couldn't stand the music and new ambience!

One of the features of a truly great grand hotel is the continuity of the staff, who recognize regular guests and make you feel welcome each time.",5,2019,03,29
143,Perfection !,A fabulous hotel with extremely helpful and competent staff. Stayed in a Deluxe Suite which was spacious and beautifully furnished. Breakfast is served in a stunning room offering a large choice of quality food. The hotel Spa situated in the basement is large and provides every opportunity to unwind and relax. We could not find fault with the hotel or staff. ,5,2019,03,29
143,Excellent for business trips,Clean hotel. Excellent service. Friendly and helpful hotel staff . Good room clean up service and the hotel room sizes were good. One of the best spas in London with various treatment options and experienced staff. ,5,2019,03,29
143,Wonderful hotel but a little noisy courtyard,"I have stayed at a Corinthia property before in Budapest so I am familiar with the level of service to be expected, etc. We stayed for 4 nights in a nice suite. The hotel, staff, location,service, concierge, and food were spot-on as one would expect.  All worth the money.  Yannick and others who handle the Concierge services were very helpful and their dinner suggestions were great.  

The only problem I had (didn't bother my wife or son) was the fact that our open-air courtyard facing room was really noisy at night due to the outdoor bar. We tried to have the balcony door open to get some fresh air but had to close it each night as there seemed to be a loud group each time.  I called down to the lobby on two of the evenings and they said they would look into it. They did offer to get us a new room but hated to pack and move at midnight. Can't blame them as I wouldn't expect the front desk to tell a group at the bar to keep it down. The voices were echoing on the courtyard. Again- it only bugged me.

You may want a river facing room if you want fresh air in nice weather.",4,2019,03,28
143,Corinthia Hotels,"An exceptional hotel with great service and outstanding staff.

I was delighted with the food of Kerride's Bar&Grill  and Cristal Moon Lounge.

If you arrive in London you should visit these locations and enjoy an exceptional menu.
",5,2019,03,28
143,Staying with a smile,"We spend 2 nights at the Corintha. After a swift check-in, the desk employee showed us the hotel facilities and our room, a beautifull and spacious 'executive king' at the first floor, very quiet in the corner of the building. No special view from the window, but the room itself was really nice with a small walk-in dressing, beautifull bathroom with ESPA products and a comfy bed. We also liked the fresh decoration.

We went to their Kerridges restaurant the first evening and were suprised by the quality of food and the tasty flavours. A relaxed atmosphere inside, altough they were fully booked. Also the superb coctails in Bassoon (the hotels bar) were spot on.
The breakfast was extended, with everyting you expect for a 5 star hotel of this standing. Very good service here, with good capuccino/coffee and lots of fruits.

Ofcourse we also tried their large thermal floor, which was very nice and beautifull. Quiet in the beginning, after a while more crowded. 

What we liked the most was the staff. Always ready to help and professional. The cleaning staff left a information letter on our desk to inform us about a running contest the next day. Very convernient for our day planning!

This hotel costs a lot of money and you expect everything to be perfect. We left with a smile, so they did a good job.",5,2019,03,27
143,Best afternoon tea ever,"My wife and I have been for afternoon tea at a number of 5 star hotels in London. Our children paid for afternoon tea at the Corinthia for a significant birthday for my wife. We went at 3 in the afternoon and left at 5, completely full, extremely happy and with a bag full of exquisive cakes.
The staff were wonderful, attentive, friendly, talkative if wanted, but always seeming to recognise when you needed something. We started with a glass of champagne, heavenly. Then came the sandwiches, very fresh, good quality and a wide range. As we started from the outside, every time we had consumed about 4 we were asked if we wanted more. Every replacement as good as the first. We both had afternoon tea, so good we both drank many pots without milk.
Eventually the scones arrived in a lovely box, I believe they were there as they were so light they would have drifted away if not held down. Clotted cream and strawberry jam, what's this? A pot of rhubarb and Tonka bean jam, surely not, but having tried it, it's great.
Then came the cakes, the final glory, each one a masterpiece, each different. We could only eat 2 each, the rest were placed in a lovely bag and were consumed at home.
This is the best ever in a truly great room, oh the pianist was great as well. So often hotels with supposed reputations let you down, the staff, the food and the ambience at the Corinthia surpassed our expectations, thankyou.",5,2019,03,27
143,Grand historic hotel in the heart of colonial London. ,"If £500 pet night is your price range on a hotel room in London,  then you'll love this place full of style,  grandeur and history. 
It's right by the Trafalgar Square, done throw from Thames,  on Whitehall, and you will find everything your demanding taste requires - doormen, chandeliers, posh looking lobby with impeccably stuffed bars and fresh flowers everywhere,  smoking garden, beautiful collections of spirits,  even a walk-in humidor with overpriced cigars... 
Polishes marble floors,  sculptures and plaques... you won't get bored just walking around the place!",5,2019,03,26
143,Love this place,We came here for my fiancé’s birthday and as usual The Corinthia never disappoint. If I had to be fussy I would say that I don’t really like the sit down breakfast and definitely preferred the buffet help yourself service.,5,2019,03,25
143,Wonderful hotel exceptional service level,"All amazing at the hotel. 
Let down by Kerridges but I see that as a separate review. The hotel itself was wonderful. Our room was as we expected. We will definitely return to stay here although next time we will try an alternative venue for dinner. ",5,2019,03,25
143,What a hotel!,"Just amazing service, accommodation, food and staff - overall a fantastic experience! The receptionist offered us a tour of the hotel and took us to our room upon check in. Also the doorman walked us to get a taxi from the other side of Trafalgar Square as the roads by the hotel were closed for a marathon - just amazing service!",5,2019,03,25
143,Incredibly well run.,"To the person running this hotel, thank you very much! You have obviously gone above and beyond to train to your staff to make every guest feel like they are extra special VIP guests. Bravo to you! I travel a lot and see a lot. I absolutely appreciate the special treatment I have received at the Corinthia hotel so far on my birthday. Top notch hotel. I will absolutely return. Thank you for making this stay so wonderful so far.",5,2019,03,24
143,"50th birthday experience for my wife, never to be forgotten","Sumptuous experience from arrival to departure. Warm and friendly staff where nothing was too much trouble. The room upgrade and champagne/birthday plate on arrival was a beautiful touch that made my wife cry. Only slight issue was with breakfast delivery on our first morning, still eating cereals when main breakfast plates were placed on table. Felt slightly rushed and the hot food invariably went cold quite quickly. Second experience of breakfast was near perfect. Will definitely return for similar stay and take in another show ( Les Miserable was superb). ",5,2019,03,21
143,Up with the best,My stay in one of the River Suites was the most enjoyable of any hotel I’ve stayed in worldwide. Facilities and service up with the best. The staff make the difference making this is a true gem amongst London’s top hotels. ,5,2019,03,20
143,Tom Kerridge,"Up until my visit to Tom Kerridge's new restaurant at the Corinthia Hotel in London Chapter One was my favourite.
Now I have 2.
First gold star went to a man brave enough to serve real ale in a 5 star restaurant, and it was excellent. More stars followed for the mastery of the menu. Typical Kerridge basics, magnificently crafted. I enjoyed the set lunch and my son went off piste for the a la carte. Everything superb and we are critical. With a combined 60 years experience in the catering trade we have a right to be.
A heart felt congratulations to you Tom and all of your team. ",5,2019,03,19
143,My new favourite hotel in London,"Nothing other than 5* for this beauty. The service level is amazing. We were upgraded to an Executive Room which was very spacious and complete with a walk in wardrobe. The bathroom, with under floor heating, was bright and big. The shower was huge and powerful; tough to leave! 
We had dinner in the Northall restaurant which served food sourced 100% from the U.K. Again, great service and delicious food.
My only gripe was the system they use for breakfast - once you get a seat, it’s devine. Thank you, we will be back. ",5,2019,03,19
143,Wonderful Afternoon Tea,"Celebrating our Anniversary and could not have wished for a better experience. The food and staff were first class, special mention to Jesper. Would highly recommend. Thank you for a lovely afternoon.",5,2019,03,18
143,Great experience,"Our second time to Corinthina and it is a slice of heaven for us. Luxuriuos, great service and the spa is fantastic with the pools and saunas. Luxury at it’s best and the service is something i have never seen as good.",5,2019,03,18
143,Amazing,"This hotel is amazing and the staff go above and beyond. The spa was unbelievable and was definitely the highlight of our stay. The food that we had throughout our visit was of the highest standard.

I can't recommend this hotel enough!!",5,2019,03,18
143,60th birthday weekend,"If you would like an experience to remember, a weekend at the Corinthia is highly recommended. The friendly, accommodating staff with the “nothing is ever too much,” approach makes this an unique experience! ",5,2019,03,18
143,Great Hotel,"Fantastic Service and great quality. Perfect location. need to spend more time next visit.
Kids really liked all the extras put in the room for them. Would of liked a bigger TV if i had been staying longer.",5,2019,03,18
143,Absolutely Amazing Experience,"Went to the hotel for a night to celebrate the wife’s birthday. From arrival to checkout, we couldn’t have asked for anything better. Alex at reception made check in nice and smooth, even though we were early, he sorted us with a complimentary glass of champers whilst the room was being prepared. The room itself was out of this world, fantastic facilities and great views of the Thames. The garden lounge, spa and breakfast in the morning had no faults and we were made to feel like royalty at every step of the experience. The location of the hotel is great, 30 second walk from embankment tube and a 10 minute walk to Charing Cross and Leicester Square. I cannot rate this hotel highly enough, and would give it 10 stars if this was possible! Will definitely be returning in the future ",5,2019,03,18
143,Sally Ross,"Soooo disappointing! The spa is beautiful and breataking, room very comfortable but that is where it ends. I asked for a quiet room and we were kept awake by traffic and sirens all night. The spa was ridiculously busy and very noisy. It was like a very luxurious centre Parcs ! There was nowhere to sit, with 70 per cent of users being day guests. It appears the hotel was being too greedy , which completely ruined what I really had hoped, would be a luxury Spa break.  Most people were in loud groups and very noisy. Even though the spa is over two or three floors, I couldn’t get a seat near the pool, near the hydrotherapy pool, even in a sleep pod.  I decided to have lunch in the Soa,  as there was nowhere else to sit.  I was amazed by a very loud staff meeting taking place behind me ! 

The service in the hotel was shocking. After sitting down in their restaurant I had to get up in search of staff, not once , but three times. There were plenty of them, talking to each other ! The coffee arrived but was not what we ordered. The second round arrived, stone cold ! Third time around it was fine , yet we had to ask for the biscuits. This sounds petty, but I love the great service we all expect in top luxury hotels. When it’s this bad, it’s so disappointing. 

 The breakfast echoed the spa. None of the staff showed any interest and sat us next to a very loud table, unnecessary as there were plenty of available tables. However. They are all very close together and it was a little like a gastro pub, not the elegant dinning room I was hoping for. Service non existent. I had given up by this stage. Such a shame as with great staff, far , far less people in the Spa, I would visit again. The doorman was fantastic.",2,2019,03,14
143,Fantastic hotel and perfect stay!,"Absolutely brilliant hotel, fantastic location, polite staff, wonderful spa and amazing food at Kerridge Bar & Grill, can not fault one thing!! 
It was an expensive one nights stay but was worth every penny. ",5,2019,03,14
143,Week end in London from londoners,"We decided to have our first night without our baby (after 2 years ...) while not far from home in case the grandmother would have some issues.
We picked the Corinthia hotel because it looked nice with a nice spa as well.
We had a great time. Staff was perfect.
Room was nice.
Breakfast very good and very relaxing spa with massage.
We will be back (we actually already have re-booked :-) ).

",5,2019,03,11
143,Great hotel- worth the money,Expensive but worth the money due to great facilities and rooms- high class service and plenty of entertainment options. Only problem is the actual swimming pool area is small compared to the large spa area so can get to busy for enjoyment ,5,2019,03,11
143,A night of luxury,"Beautiful hotel, amazing spa and fantastic staff. Worth a splurge for a special occasion!
The rooms are surprisingly big and from the moment you check in you are treated like a VIP. Be sure to make time for the spa which is excellent. ",5,2019,03,10
143,Birthday treat,"Stunning, beautiful, this hotel classic elegant style , lots of staff very friendly and attentive. The garden was beautiful, my husband loved it because he got have a cigarette in comfort and have cocktail. We had an excellent room , every thing was beautiful and tasteful, great mini bar. We had a great view of St Paul’s . 
Highly recommend this hotel , it’s also 2 minutes from embankment tube.",5,2019,03,10
143,Fantastic hotel in the heart of london,"This hotel was fantastic the staff were very welcoming and their check in policy of availability rather than times was brilliant we checked in and then taken to our room our bags arrive within 10 mins. The room was amazing with separate hall and dressing area. The bathroom was huge with a tv to watch whilst in the bath. We used the thermal spa floor which was free and had steam room , sauna and whirlpools and completely relaxing. We ate at kerridges bar and grill which was amazing the food was incredible and the service was excellent. Breakfast in the Northall restaurant was outstanding which so much choice. I would definitely recommend this hotel and will be going back again.",5,2019,03,09
143,Olivia,The hotel is beautiful. The flower arrangements are incredible all over the hotel. Service is great and the location is outstanding. Walking distance to the London Eye. Afternoon tea is a must. Spa is even better.,5,2019,03,07
143,An afternoon to remember,"As a birthday treat for my sister, we decided on afternoon tea at the Corinthia. Beautiful surroundings, delicious food and faultless service from Jesper made it very special. In fact each and every member of staff we came across in the hotel - even the man hoovering the stairs - was polite and welcoming. Well done to all - a fabulous experience!",5,2019,03,05
143,Fabulous afternoon tea! ,Jesper was our delightful waiter today for a delicious birthday tea! The atmosphere was welcoming and quiet and the new sandwiches delicious. (We had watched the TV program of the new developments so were eager to taste!) We were not disappointed and Jesper was so attentive! Thanks! ,5,2019,03,05
143,Fabulous......,"Have never stayed here, just had afternoon tea here three times.  Fabulous venue, although with the new management now, I think it’s a bit flash as opposed to English and Elegant.  I think it’s bern slightly spoilt, but I still love the place, and would love to stay there.",5,2019,03,04
143,"Great location, good service and decent wine","Visited recently for a meeting and had a nice lunch, nice decor would revisit again as the service was very good and the wine excellent. Good value, but the toilets could do with a bit of refresh as they a liitle smelly",5,2019,03,04

143,Majestic at the center of London,"This hotel is obviously pricey, but it has exceeded my expectations across the board. Service just stands out. Definitely  in the top league I have experienced globally. I was there twice on business. I do not know the exact price, though, since the company too care of it. They have great in-house restaurant and lounge. Walking distance to the famous squares and shops.",5,2019,03,03
143,An impressive hotel,A lovely building sympathetically converted to an hotel. A good location and a good choice if you want to splash out a little. Love the heated floor in the bathroom and the TV in the bath! Superb breakfast choice in a great room.,4,2019,03,03
143,Could not recommend this hotel highly enough,"I decided to bring my husband to the Corinthia after watching the documentary on the hotel.
I bought vouchers to give him for his birthday and booked for a 1 night stay. I then added on another night to make it a 2 night stay.
I emailed the hotel with my voucher numbers and let them know we were really looking forward to my husbands 50th Birthday treat. 
We valet parked and found the concierges to be fantastic and very helpful.
We checked in and we were  met by Szabina from guest relations. She personally welcomed us to the hotel and told us we had been upgraded to a suite.
We were shown around the hotel and taken to our room. It is absolutely stunning. We could not have been happier with the suite we have been given.
We had lunch in Northwood bar, which was lovely. We also booked a table in Kerridge’s for dinner. Our meal was stunning and we had a wonderful evening.
We used the spa today. It’s the nicest spa I have ever been to. 
I called in room dining this afternoon to ask for some ice and champagne flutes to be sent up. Imagine our surprise when a trolley arrived with a bottle of champagne and a chocolate cake. Compliments of the hotel for my husbands birthday. We were speechless, and still are! 
We are just about to go for afternoon tea and will be leaving tomorrow. I’m sure the afternoon tea will not disappoint! 
This has quite simply been the best stay at a hotel we have had and we can not fault a single thing.
We can’t wait to come back for another visit soon.",5,2019,03,01
143,I didn't want to leave!!!,"Stayed for the weekend and from start to finish the whole experience was sensational. Our room was absolutely perfect in every way, every detail has been thought of. You couldn't wish for anything more and I will now find it hard to stay in another hotel as once you've experienced this level of luxury and staff service nothing will compare. We also visited the spa which as expected was also magical, it was pretty busy though but I think that's to be expected at the weekend. I used the gym and the facilities were excellent with great equipment. I can't wait to return!",5,2019,03,01
143,Pleasant surprise ,"Just got back home from this amazing hotel. Located in a nice and quiet area of London.

The staff are amazing, attention to detail incredible. The rooms are well appointed, breakfast and the selection of food was wonderful.
We had a post theatre dinner in Tom Kerridges Bar & Grill. Again, the staff were polite and extremely helpful, nothing too much trouble and attention to detail was amazing.

143,Beautiful friendly hotel,"We arrived. Checked in but realized our room that we booked with a fireplace was just a facade. It was beautiful, but we decided we wanted a view   So we asked the front desk if we could pay a little more and get a room with a view and they pulled through. We got a beautiful upgrade and stayed for 7 nights. The beds are very comfortable and the service is impeccable, our friends that stay at the Savoy all the time are going to stay at the Corinthia now.  People are super nice Keridges is absolutely delicious I am sending people to eat their. Amazing ambience and food. Breakfast was great, with excellent service.

143,Great hotel in superb location,"Possibly the best located hotel in London and would recommend for couples and people wishing to have a special occasion in London.  The location is terrific and walk anywhere.  The spa is great, weights and machines in the gym are good - dumbbells to 34kg and a squat rack.
For me I found the hotel rather too “scented” bit a lot of people commented how they liked that.  Always nice flowers and arrangements.  Would definitely return.",5,2019,02,21
143,40th Birthday,"If you are looking for superior place to celebrate a special occasion or simply escape from the hectic city life, then do not look any further. Corinthia Hotel in London is the place in the city where you can let it go for a moment. This hotel has got it all, grand designs, high tech facilities, best spa in the country (see Elle for a massage ), timeless afternoon tea and most of all the incredible staff who are superbly  trained and know how to create a personalised guest experience.

Thank you to all staff and management, you are phenomenal!

143,A Perfect Ten,"We stayed at the Corinthia Hotel London for 3 nights from the 15th February 2019. When you enter the foyer you know you are going to be in for a special stay. Check-In is what you expect from a Five Star hotel. After registration you are escorted to your room by the receptionist. We were allocated room 631. The room was beautifully furnished and set out. They even had a welcoming gift to celebrate a special occasion. The room ambience is so serene and quiet, day and night.
The buffet breakfast at The Northall was excellent. Good selection of local produce.
The highlight of our stay was the ESPA and Thermal floor. The facilities are set out over four floors.
This is must do on your stay. It is an amazing and relaxing experience.
The Corinthia Hotel London is more than a hotel, it's an experience.

There are 2 minor improvements, 1) A bluetooth speaker/system 2) The full length mirror on the wardrobe door is inadequate (dark location and unable to use for dressing)

",5,2019,02,20
143,Just stunning,"We stayed on night at the Corinthia in London. Everything was perfect. Beginning from the check in to room service and the spa.
The was very friendly overall made everything possible what we have asked them for. 
The room was very tidy and no defects have been visible to us. Room service was very quick and the breakfast was delicious and more then enough.
The Spa at the Corinthia is the best of been so far in around London. It was not busy at all and therefore it was very relaxing and enjoyable.
We definitely will go there again to enjoy a special night out.

143,50th birthday treat,"Stayed here for 1 night for my 50th birthday celebration.  
Having been lucky enough to of stayed in some lovely hotels in the past, i have to say this compares right up there with the very best. 
Everything from the initial welcome, to a complimentary upgrade as we were celebrating,  to a lovely little treat in our room to the fabulous bars and service were spot on. 
The spa is amazing, take some time out to try it... it's worth it! 
Finally, Kerridges restaurant was amazing at night and a wonderful memory.
Cant rate the place high enough... we need  to save our pennies for the next opportunity to visit.  We'll find an excuse as soon as we can. ",5,2019,02,19
143,Excellence in every way,"This hotel definitely went above and beyond our expectation.

In the middle of every place we wanted to see, and perfect for taking walks. Loved it! ",5,2019,02,19
143,Two night break to celibrate my birthday.,"Fabulous hotel , high end with a service charge on everything, but you do get the service.

I would have given this hotel a five star rating, if it was not for a petty act of commercialism whilst enjoying drinks and sandwiches in the court yard bar on a Sunday afternoon, my wife and I were asked to put away my “birthday chocolates” that my daughter had given me - as it was strictly prohibited to eat “food not bought in the hotel”.

Having spent the best part of £50.00 on the drinks and sandwiches, IMO this was totally uncalled for, and will probably mean this visit will be our last.

Other than this incident the staff we friendly, and the hotel itself is in a great location, with excellent accommodations.",4,2019,02,18
143,Luxurious hotel with lovely staff,"A beautiful hotel that is immaculately maintained. Our room was so incredibly well appointed and felt like a suite (I think it was an Executive room).

We normally stay at the Connaught when in London, and what the Corinthia lacks is the uniquely ‘British’ feel that the Connaught champions, however the Corinthia has a different style and is no way less luxurious. 

Best breakfast in London (in my view!). 

Wonderful staff - truly friendly and happy!

Small complaint: we were asked what time we would like turn down at check-in, but received a knock at the door later that day before asking us if wanted turn down! Also, the remote control for the bathroom TV didn’t work. Minor challenges, and overall the room was beautiful and incredibly functional ie somewhere to do your hair and make up with accessible mirror and plug points. 

We also ate at Tom Kerridges (restaurant within hotel) and was disappointed. £42 for a bland roast beef dinner with tough and inedible potatoes. Way too much style and very little substance - save your cash and go elsewhere.",5,2019,02,18
143,Awesome hotel and wonderful staff,"We booked a stay at the Corinthia as we’d always fancied a stay there, and as we were celebrating a milestone, we took the plunge. 
From the moment you walk in, until the moment you leave, it feels like you are disconnected from reality. 
Awesome staff at every turn, beautiful building, no attention to detail spared, and very easy hotel to navigate. 
We enjoyed breakfast, afternoon tea and drinks in Basoon too and it was all excellent. From delicious fare to just good old fashioned people watching, this really is a fantastic place to stay. 

We also visited the spa and breathtaking doesn’t really do it justice. The place is huge with absolutely something for everyone. We had a massage each which was really very good. 

Well done to everyone at The Corinthia, a truly memorable experience, and thank you for spoiling us while we were there.",5,2019,02,18
143,Amazing hotel experience,"Everything about The Corinthia is of a very high standard. The service from arrival to departure was exceptional. The rooms are beautifully and tastefully decorated, fixtures and fittings are high end and the hotel takes your comfort and convenience very seriously!",5,2019,02,18
143,40th Birthday Treat,"We booked afternoon tea for a 40th birthday surprise and it was fantastic - not something you'd do very day but a very indulgent treat! Thank you to all of the tram at the hotel for making it a memorable afternoon.
",5,2019,02,17
143,A very special treat.,The hotel does exactly what it says and exactly what you would expect of a true 5 star hotel. Staff exceptional. Property is immaculate as are the rooms. Kerridges a welcome addition. Afternoon tea a real experience. All pretty expensive so prepare yourself and then relax and enjoy it. It really is worth it. ,5,2019,02,17
143,9th wedding anniversary bliss,"Arrived at the hotel with the immaculately dressed door men zipping our bags away... the check in was smooth and very professionally attended to by Juergen (sorry if wrong)! We were pleasantly informed that we had been upgraded to a junior suite and we were shown around the hotel and walked to our room! 

The room was massive, very classically dressed and is as good as it gets in Terms of quality and gadgets... with a lovely balcony looking into the courtyard below! Only minor feedback was the room was a bit dark.

The hotel staff were impeccable throughout we drank in both the bassoon bar and the northhall and once again staff were engaging and polite! 

Thanks for a great stay... this is now our new fav London crash pad!",5,2019,02,16
143,Afternoon tea ,"The best is London so far absolutely amazing food and service ! Really enjoyed it thank you. Staff were amazing. 
Afternoon tea food was served very good and the quality was amazing also. 

Decor and decorations amazing ",5,2019,02,16
143,Afternoon tea ,"We went for afternoon tea after seeing the documentary on BBC  with Thomas ,

From the moment of arrival to the goodbye we could not fault the high quality, friendly, relaxed perfection .
The afternoon tea was scrumptious and the goody bag , perfectly wrapped . 

Would highly recommend amazing place with history aswell . ",5,2019,02,16
143,Beautiful setting beside the Thames,"I have never been into this hotel but it was opposite the theatre we were going to so popped in to see if we could get a bar snack first. the staff were amazing and helped us find the bar that could serve us quickest. We ended up in the Crystal Moon Bar and had delicious sandwiches. The service was impeccable and fast and the fresh lime and soda the best I've ever had. A little slice of calm and elegance on the edge of the Thames and beautiful inside, especially with their valentine flowers. I will definitely be back.",5,2019,02,14
143,"Quality, Luxury and An Outstanding Experience",We spent a weekend at the hotel and from the moment we arrived until the moment we left we could not ask for more. A very personal and attentive experience from all of the staff. I would highly recommend to anyone who wants a luxury hotel to choose The Corinthia. Thank you.,5,2019,02,14
143,Special Lunch,"Tom Kerridge,5 star hotel setting, need I say more. Excellent meal, excellent service, all just what you would expect from an establishment like this. Prices also what you would expect, not cheap but for a special meal out worth it.",5,2019,02,14
143,"An exceptional hotel, well positioned for the tourist","We had the opportunity to stay in this superb hotel when we were invited to a family wedding there. We spent three nights and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The ambience was fantastic, staff especially helpful. Food was first class. Spa and pool was top notch. A great experience.",5,2019,02,12
143,Excellence across the board for any occasion ,"The Corinthia Hotel London, and more specifically the Crystal Moon Lounge, is truly an amazing location for an authentic afternoon English tea, as well as romantic celebrations. Our experience was simply outstanding. From the first sip of champagne to the last bite of dessert the food was wonderful.  The service was comprised of an amazing group of talented individuals that took care of each and every need and request. They offered and took our couples photos and dessert photos. They ensured that everything was wonderful! Thank you very much to the Crystal Moon Lounge for an experience that compares to no other when it comes to service. This is a must do when touring London. #nofomo",5,2019,02,12
143,Excellent Hotel,"A hotel who knows how to deliver a fantastic customer experience. Great location, excellent rooms and plenty of bars. Afternoon tea lived up to other reviews and was great value for money. Would highly recommend to fellow travellers.",5,2019,02,11
143,Wedding Anniversary,"We wanted to celebrate our 29th wedding anniversary at this amazing hotel.
Unfortunately, this time round the service was not up to what we expected.
My husband had pre ordered 29 white roses to be in our room on arrival as a surprise. When we got to the room they were the wrong colour, however the florist was happy to exchange them.
Looking forward to breakfast on our first morning it was a bit disappointing. Not the usual grand buffet on display when we previously visited in the past. No hot food but you are able to order a la carte. My husband ordered a selection of mixed toast which never arrived.
After our spa treatment we wanted to spend the last couple of hours in the lobby to celebrate our special day. Unfortunately, we were told there was no available tables till 4pm which was the time we had to leave the hotel. This was very disappointed for us, it seems the hotel will pre book afternoon tea reservations so in house guests are not guaranteed a table unless a booking is made.
We did leave the hotel on this occasion with a few let downs to what we normally regard as a very high standard hotel with excellent customer services.",4,2019,02,10
143,Terrible Management,"My wife and I chose to celebrate our honeymoon on November 29th, 2018 through December 3rd, 2018 at one of the most prestigious 5-star hotels in London, The Corinthia, or so we were told, but were continuously disappointed throughout our stay.  Immediately after checkin we considered canceling our reservation and moving to the Savoy as we very much regretted our choice. The staff did not perform to a 5 star level and we are writing to inform the management of the good and bad so things might improve for future guests. 

Arrival

Upon arrival we were greeted by Alex. We did not inquire about upgrading our room but Alex shared with us that were going to be upgraded from an Executive king room to a junior suite. Upon checking Alex then informed us there were none of the Junior Suites available. This set the tone for the stay. Being told that you can have something better but then not delivering was a huge and unnecessary disappointment. Further, no one at Corinthia made an effort to recognize this special time for us, our honeymoon, and the reason for our stay. 

The first room was nothing special and lacked a fireplace as advertised on the website. It was a standard room that you would find at any 3 star Hilton and not what we expected when staying in a 5 star hotel. We called the from desk and asked if there were other layout options available. They offered to show us another room on the same floor. We accepted the move and informed Alex our bags were ready to be moved. We waited for several minutes and no one showed up. We had to drag all of our luggage down the hall where we discovered our keycards did not work for the new room and we were locked out of our old room. My wife had to search for a phone in the hall and call the front desk. After finally arriving to the room to let us in, the lady seemed annoyed and also there was no one else with her, confirming our belief that the hotel was never going to help us move our luggage. Upon unlocking the door my wife and I were again forced to move all of our luggage into the room without an offer of assistance. 

Room Service

Room service was good. The food was very delicious and we enjoyed the wings and Mac and cheese. It was prompt and well displayed on the cart. This was the only positive aspect in our stay. 

Bar

We had cocktails at the bar. The toasted coconut old fashioned was superb. 

Restaurant 

We tried the hotel restaurant and while waiting to be say were told to hurry up and order because the kitchen was closing. It was clear that the staff only cared about getting us out as quickly as possible. I ordered the Cesar salad with chicken and received a nearly palatable bed of greens with a very sad and bland tasting whole chicken breast. My wife ordered fish and chips and received a heavily battered and greasy fillet of unknown aquatic origins. 

Concierge 

I requested tickets to be printed. I called the concierge one morning and was given an email address. Nearly an hour later nothing had been delivered to our room. We went down to the lobby to the concierge desk to ask for the documents but were redirected to the front desk. The lady had to search for the email and print the documents while we waited and watched as many as six Corinthia employees stood around not doing anything but talking amongst themselves. 

As of now we will not plan on staying at the Corinthia again and will recommend to our friends and family that they avoid this hotel as it does not live up to expectations. The stay at the Corinthia was proceeded by an amazing experience at the Plaza Athenee in Paris. Not only did they welcome us with rose petals and complimentary bottles of wine each day, they went above and beyond to exceed our expectations in every aspect. I would recommend tuning the Corinthia's guest relations to mirror this extraordinary service.",1,2019,02,10
143,Delicious Afternoon Tea,"First time visit and it exceeded expectations. Very friendly staff, attentive without being overbearing. Quality of the tea and food was excellent and we were given nice little bags to take away the items we couldn’t eat. I really cannot fault the experience, highly recommended and I would certainly do it again.",5,2019,02,09
143,A special treat,We were very impressed before we even got there with the communications and efforts to make it a special occasion with attention to detail. In reality it was even better than we could have wished for. The service and accompanying atmosphere was fancy without being snooty.,5,2019,02,09
143,Fabulous place at a noisy location,"I was really pleased with this hotel. Friendly service, very nice interior. Very good lobby for sitting and meeting and the breakfast is really good.

Just the kind of place I like. 

The only problem is the noise outside. Now, London is a noisy place but if you have a room at the “wrong” side in this hotel you have a musical playing every night next door (that you can hear very well) plus the trains at Charing Cross make a lot of noise.  I had a constant zoom tone in my room, waking me up almost every night.

Of course it’s not the mistake of the hotel but it is a bit of a problem for me.",5,2019,02,08
143,Best afternoon tea 7 🌟 ,"From the moment you step into this hotel it’s first class. The decor is beautiful and so are the flowers doted around on display.

We were early and therefor had a cocktail in the bar. Lovely friendly service. Our table was ready so a waiter came and took our drinks and showed us to our table..( Devine crockery) 

Sandwiches were fresh and well presented with delicious flavours and once our plates were finished more arrived if you wanted them and without having to ask. 

The scones were light and fluffy, best I’ve ever had and I have been to quite a few of these afternoon teas. ( lucky me)

Omg! The cakes were to die for so amazingly good plus they had flumbs/ marshmallows with different delicious flavours.

We really couldn’t eat it all but it didn’t matter as they boxed them up for us and put them into a rather nice bag 😑

I had hot chocolate with extra chocolate on top and tiny marshmallow.. yum o yum but you can only have a little of this delicious liquid so I changed to tea and what lovely choices we had and it was refreshed constantly. 

We had 7 star treatment the waiters were a delight and couldn’t of asked for a better service, also very knowledgeable about the teas etc. We also had a treat as the chef came out with the cakes and in his beautiful Italian accent (swoon) told us what they were.. 

One of the ladies had very specific requirements and this was met in every way with no trouble what so ever. 

Will I be going back ... absolutely going to book here for my daughters special birthday in June. ( maybe even before) 

I would put this in my top 3 this one being on a par with Burj El Arab in Dubai which was amazing too.  So they equal 1 & 2 place. The 3rd being The Conrad at St James, London

If in any doubt... just go it’s absolutely delightful 

",5,2019,02,07
143,Simply loveleh ,"Elegance and sophistication beyond compare. Mind you the prices reflect the level of service and the most spectacular location. With doors onto Northumberland avenue and out onto the road opposite the liberal club, the Thames is a stones throw away. Wondrous. ",5,2019,02,07
143,Five Star Luxury All the Way,"I took my husband to The Corinthia for his birthday and we were not disappointed.  The hotel is beautiful and the first thing that strikes you are the beautiful flowers and the welcoming faces of the staff.  Nothing is too much trouble here.  The spa is a dark paradise that relaxes you and makes you forget you're in the heart of London.  We had dinner at the recently opened Kerridges Bar & Grill which was fantastic.  There was a real buzz in the air that made it feel like the place to be.  The service was excellent, and the food to die for.  I had the crab thermidor which was delicious followed by rib of beef.  The wine list was excellent and I would heartily recommend you book a table here but you'll need to be ahead of the game as it's incredibly popular.  This is our fourth time at The Corinthia and we never want to check out.  A real gem!",5,2019,02,05
143,The best in London,"The hotel, food and service at the Corinthia are second to none. The attention to detail is amazing and the staff couldn’t do enough for you. The elegant and relaxing decor in all areas makes for a very comfortable stay. Superb!!",5,2019,02,04
143,Birthday Treat for Wife,"On arrival had to leave car in middle of road as no parking and busy in front of hotel ,  porters unloaded car and parked , very polite  porters , had to wait to check in as very busy but staff charming , not shown to room , room tied with frayed carpet around the edges and a little grubby although room as a whole very clean , safe didn’t work as batteries low but sorted within ten minutes , asked if I wanted a  complimentary newspaper on the Sunday morning which I accepted but didn’t show up although many rooms in  corridor had newspapers, again rang down to reception and sorted very quickly, had problems at breakfast as not down as breakfast paid for in room rate and attendants very confused at what we could and couldn’t have and at one point told had to pay extra for orange juice until the waiter came over and said I was right and I had paid for breakfast so could have what I wanted by which time I just wanted to get out of restaurant and get on with the rest of the day , shame , tried this hotel as visited most of the five star hotels in London and had seen this one on the TV and had high hopes but will probably be returning to one of the others next time - sorry Corinthia I know you have some great reviews but I’m just being  honest.",4,2019,02,04
143,the best hotel bar in london,"Outstanding hand crafted cocktails.  The lounge have a fantastic location, tremendous decor and very attentive servers. The bar manager was more than happy to sit and talk about the day's adventures and make recommendations.",5,2019,02,04
143,A Perfect Stay!,"Myself and my husband celebrated our 2nd Wedding Anniversary at the Corinthia and everything was perfect! We had afternoon tea to start which was amazing (much better than the Savoy afternoon tea by miles). The room was great and concerning the hotels location and service it was well priced. Nothing was too much trouble, all the staff where outstanding and the service was effortless. We also tried the Spa which was included within the room price and was brilliant, the breakfast was also included and was great. I cannot put into words how truly outstanding The Corinthia is easily best hotel we have every stayed at. You have to go to this hotel ! We will be back for our 3rd wedding anniversary next year! We have finally found our special hotel!! ",5,2019,02,04
143,Mum birthday tea,"Amazing afternoon tea with my Mum & sister, the food was amazing and we asked for nothing.
The staff waited on our every need from the moment we walked through the doors, it was a bit chilly on arrival so we were given heavy blankets to keep warm!
The background music was subtle and enough, on leaving the pianist started and he was amazing too!
Our experience was a 10/10 and we definitely be returning.",5,2019,02,03
143,Perfect,"Lunched at Tom Kerridge's Restaurant in the Hotel.
Wonderful Staff, wonderful food, great experience.
Good to see a great hotel doing it's stuff without fuss. When you asked for directions in the hotel they did not just point, but escorted you to your destination.
We did not stay the night, just had a meal.",5,2019,02,03
143,WONDERFUL HOTEL,"We celebrated our 34th Wedding Anniversary by staying at the Wonderful Corinthia hotel and was treated to a suite on the 6th floor, just stunning. We were also treated to a chocolate dessert delivered to our room. 
All the staff were attentive, professional and happy. A wonderful night and we will return.",5,2019,02,03
143,Amazing! ,"We have just returned from a wonderful stay at the Corinthia. It was everything we had hoped for and more. Fantastic service from every person we spoke to, they couldn't do enough for you. Breakfast was delicious, the best quality and choice of everything. The spa was just amazing, I have never been to one as luxurious before. The bed was so comfy and the bathroom furnished in glorious marble and underfloor heating. 
My only slight gripe would be to have a kettle in the room instead of having to use the coffee machine, I don't want to have to 'run the water through a few times' before making a tea and also to have fresh milk as opposed to the little long life ones you get in cafes. 
We also went to the Bassoon bar which is really nice for cocktails.
Have already booked to come back in March, thank you Corinthia ",5,2019,02,03
143,Weekend getaway,The hotel is absolutely wonderful. They were able to give us a lovely Deluxe room on the 6th floor away from the elevator (quiet) and with a very nice view. They knew we were celebrating my friend’s birthday and the little treat in the room upon arrival was amazing! Lovely staff and the spa is just wonderful... simply one of the best hotels in London!,5,2019,02,03
143,Worth every penny!,"This is our 3rd visit to the corinthia and initially we had thought that maybe we should try a different hotel for the pricey 3 night stay but with the location being where It was we decided to go again. I had actually forgotten how stunning the hotel is as it had been 2 years since the last visit! I actually enjoyed this stay more than any other trip I’ve had to London in any hotel ever! From the door staff on the arrival to the attentive receptionists I didn’t was to leave! I didn’t see one member of staff who didn’t smile and greet you with warmth at any time of the day. The quality of breakfast including service goes way above what you expect. The bar staff in all bars remembered exactly what we had to drink the day/afternoon before and kerridges restaurant finished off our last meal in London perfectly! Food exceptional and again I can’t stress how happy I was with the service of not just the managers but the serving staff also! Paying special thanks to Tom on reception who on our last day arranged a later check out for me. The weather in London had turned so cold and wet and our train wasn’t leaving till 5.30pm,I wasn’t feeling great from an awful head cold and sore throat and he sent me a pot of fresh ginger honey and lemon tea to the room completely at his own suggestion! A wonderful touch when I was feeling so lousy from day/night nurse tablets! It was the later check out that allowed me to perk up and pack up then go for lunch in kerridges which they reserved last minute for us! I don’t think that I will be able to book another hotel in London again and feel it will live up to the corinthia! They have definitely got me for life! Thank you for a fantastic 3 night stay to all the staff! ",5,2019,02,03
143,Loved everything ,"Such a warm reception on checking in, we were shown to our room and a bottle of champagne and a chocolate dessert were waiting for us because it was a 25th wedding anniversary celebration. The spa was amazing after a busy day exploring the sights. The location is perfect and in easy walking distance of many attractions. We ate at Kerridge’s Bar and Grill which was everything I hoped it would be, very welcoming and informal. You will not be disappointed if you choose to stay at the Corinthia.",5,2019,02,02
143,Most elegant hotel in London,"Rooms, service, amenities, food, everything... spotless! One of the few hotels I can say for sure it’s a true five stars without the ostentation. The staff are a credit to the hotel and the Concierge might be the best I ever seen.",5,2019,02,02
143,Always excellent,"Superb at every level.  Believe all the reviews.  Excellent well equipped, comfortable  rooms with wonderful toiletries.  Great service.  It is always sad to have to leave.  This hotel has an eye for detail and it shows.",5,2019,02,02
143,Birthday weekend ,"Just back from a wonderful 3 night stay at the Corinthia.  Beautiful hotel, especially the Crystal Moon lounge and the spa.  Service excellent from the doorman to reception and housekeeping.  Immaculate executive room with all amenities.  We ate at the new Tom Kerridge restaurant which was extremely good, followed by a nightcap in the lovely bassoon bar.  Great music on Thursday, not too loud that you couldn't hear yourself speak.  Nice breakfast selection, the granola was to die for.  On the Saturday at peak time they were very stretched for space and hot food took a while, but back to normal on Sunday.  The floral arrangements are stunning in the hotel and you can walk through the florists and see the lovely flowers ready to be arranged.  Would certainly stay at the Corinthia again. ",5,2019,02,01
143,Corinthia Hotel stay & afternoon tea,"Stayed for one night which included afternoon tea with champagne. 
I booked this as a surprise for my wife and was not disappointed.
Hotel experience was excellent, staff were very professional and friendly, exactly what I would expect from a high end hotel, they made our stay for our wedding anniversary very special.
The afternoon tea with champagne was superb.

143,Beautiful ,"
In London staying at another hotel across the road . Went in to this hotel to eat and have a class of champagne at lunch. Stunning hotel really friendly arrival from the staff in particular the gentleman playing the piano. Next time we go back will book a room this is now on my list of places to stay. Fab location for attractions and theatres. ",5,2019,01,30

143,PERFECTION!,"The Corinthia Hotel exceeded our expectations!  The hotel and spa are amazing and the service was impeccable and very friendly and professional.  The restaurants catered to our dietary restrictions and the food was excellent.  The location is fantastic, walking distance to many great areas and tourist destinations.  We would definitely stay here again!",5,2019,01,28
143,Very good but with a few minor issues,"Fell slightly short of expectations when compared to other luxury hotels at this level. Overall we had a wonderful stay and I would stay again but there were just a few things that made it appear to not run as seamlessly as other equivalent luxury hotels that I have stayed in. Main pros and cons:

Pros:
1. We arrived very early (9.30) as had spa treatments booked in for 10.30 and were able to get an early check in with no issues.
2. Our room was very spacious with a separate walk in wardrobe/dressing area.
3. Our spa treatments were exceptional - definitely the highlight of our stay.
4. Bed was very comfortable.
5. The sandwiches and warm scones during champagne afternoon tea were exquisite - absolutely delicious.
6. Cooked breakfast was very tasty and all arrived nice and hot.

Cons:
1. Pool and thermal spa area are relatively small especially as there were a couple of large groups in who were also quite loud and noisy - this slightly  ruined the spa atmosphere.
2. Rang down for an iron and ironing board which never arrived.
3. Our tv and media centre were not working in our room, after calling down twice (beginning 16.00) and being told an engineer would be with us shortly - it was only after mentioning it again to housekeeping during our evening turn down service that an engineer finally arrived just after 20.00.
3. Service at breakfast was quite slow - our toast did not arrive for quite a while after the rest of our food and hot drink took a long time to arrive.

Overall a lovely stay but just missing a few finishing touches to service levels.",4,2019,01,28
143,Amazing spa,My partner treated me to a massage for my birthday - it was amazing and felt so relaxed. Staff were friendly and the whole experience was one of luxury and relaxation. I would highly recommend treating yourself to the spa here.,5,2019,01,28
143,London Travel,The hotel staff is very courteous and attentive to detail. The room was clean and comfortable. I stayed on the lower floor and traffic noise was an issue. The location of the hotel was very convenient for my stay. ,4,2019,01,28
143,Very nice breakfast,I did not have a chance to stay but visited there for breakfast. First  the menu is perfect. You have three different choices of open buffet or a-la-carte menu. The buffet is perfect. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. Food is very good and the restaurant is very comfortable and elegant with high ceillings and nice furnutire. I really want to stay there nex time.,5,2019,01,27
143,Amazing !!!,"Just discovered this hotel through the documentary on the tv. So we decided to give It a try. 

We certainly weren’t disappointed. 

The staff and service overall was just outstanding. We feel it’s the most wonderful and all round hotel we’ve ever stayed in, in London. Possibly worldwide. 

The 4 levels of spa which is complimentary for residence is just beautiful and really made our stay so relaxing. 

A blow dry was rather expensive at £65 and the stylist was so miserable. But that was my only complaint. 

The afternoon tea was sublime. Every detail is outstanding. The hotel also has its own florist which allowed us to purchase some beautiful flowers as a gift for a friend. 

Breakfast although rather busy at weekend was wonderful and all the food the best quality. Drinks were plentiful and you could have anything you liked. 

Our room was amazing also with its own walk in wardrobe and huge big marble bathroom. 

Thank you to everyone at the Corinthia for making our stay so special. And a special mention to Paolo in the afternoon tea section who always went above and beyond to meet our requests. 

We will definitely be back.",5,2019,01,27
143,Afternoon tea ,"If your looking for a little indulgence , luxury, and the very best afternoon tea, then this is a must, the sandwiches were delicious , scones, cakes etc were amazing , service was first class , extremely friendly, ambience perfect , the pianist, the flowers, all wonderful. ",5,2019,01,27
143,could have been better,"we checked in to Corinthia after paying £800 per night for a family room. unfortunately the comfort of our stay was not the best and in the end we checked out early and moved to another hotel. First the room wasn't ready on time, then there was a dirty slipper left in the room from a previous guest (!) We had dinner in one of the restaurants to be served cold mashed potato. it was changed, but by the time a fresh portion had been brought to the table i had already eaten the fish, so i was sat there eating a bowl of mash on its own. £185 for the privilege. The quality of sleep was also poor, with the duvet being too small for the cover. i spent most of the night with only a hollow, cotton cover on me. The room was cool and the air conditioning wouldnt stay on a high heat setting, so i was awake half of the night. sadly we will not be returning and i can recommend some much better hotels such as The Langham or The Ritz.",3,2019,01,26
143,Great Christmas break,"Wonderful hotel, great staff, great location - amazing spa. Stayed here before so decided to spend Christmas - nice of Christmas stocking full of treats hanging on door Christmas day morning.will be back next christmas!",5,2019,01,25
143,Outstanding Stay,"This is our preferred hotel in central London. The location is great with walking distance to all my meetings which were in the center of town. Soho and Covent Garden are minutes away. The hotel is gorgeous, we stayed in suite 324 which is has a well appointed living room that includes an arched settee and 2 armchairs. Perfect for meetings or to relax. It also has an Nespressp marching and separate doors to isolate the bedroom. The bedroom comes with everything including another cofffee machine. I used the aitrum for meetings which always impresses my guests. Last but not least the staff who make you feel special and offer 5star service as is expected. Have no problem showering praise at this hotel as it is truly out of this world. ",5,2019,01,25
143,Excellent luxury hotel in London,"Had an excellent stay at the Corinthia this week, along with several clients and colleagues.  Outstanding service; great rooms, beds and bathrooms.  The breakfast buffet was good, as was room service.  Really like the gym as well. ",5,2019,01,23
143,Weekend in the city,We enjoyed an excellent weekend in London using the Corinthia as our base.  Facilities are top class in a very relaxed atmosphere.  The staff were friendly and professional at all times and the concierge teams recommendations were excellent. I'd stay here again if the opportunity arose.,5,2019,01,21
143,Great Stay,"Having stayed in several 5 star hotels this has to be one of the best, The hotel and it's amenities were excellent. They upgraded us to a beautiful suite. Tom Kerridge's  restaurant is amazing. Afternoon tea is a must.",5,2019,01,21
143,"Chic, sophisticated, luxury & more",A fantastic hotel to stay in London if you really want the classic 5 star treatment. It’s a great hotel on numerous counts and the spa with its thermal pool is a gem to unwind after a day in the city! ,5,2019,01,20
143,The Bar,So I visited this place because they shot some scenes from Red Sparrow here. I visited the bar because I already had accommodations elsewhere. The atmosphere is stunning and the Italian bartender was very personable and well versed in cocktails: American and international. The entire staff was polite from the doormen to the hospitality crew. I would love to get a room here sometime. ,4,2019,01,17
143,Wow,What a beautiful place. Rooms are with the view of river. Michelin star restaurant. Highly recommended. Very professional staffs and management. You must try the spa. I would say that best in London. It was a surprised from my wife and i just loved it.,5,2019,01,16
143,A Master Class in running a hotel.....,"This  lovely hotel in the best location possible is perfect in every way. Its spotless, the staff are all polite, the rooms are all fitted out to a very high standard, We had an executive King, with great bed and  a very powerful  'rain' shower in a well fitted out bathroom.
Its not cheap, and is on a level with the Connaught, but  if you are happy to pay then its guaranteed to deliver  what it says on the tin.
Excellence.",5,2019,01,16
143,fantastic experience,if you want to truly endulge yourself try this hotel. facilities are second to none staff are brilliant. location spot on. while we were there everyone did their utmost to help us enjoy our stay. afternoon tea;- magnificent. need I say more.,5,2019,01,16
143,Truly an amazing hotel,"We stayed at the Corinthea on news years eve. on arrival the staff were extremely helpful and although we arrived early our room was available for us to use. 
Once settled in we explored the hotel to get our bearings and were amazed at just how knowledgable and helpful the staff were, nothing was too much trouble.
We had a very dined a Tom Kerridges restaurant for lunch which was very enjoyable and again the staff were professional and accomadting. Our meal was truel you fantastic and lived up to expectations.
The spa is a must and provides a wonderful experience of relaxation and luxury, attention to detail has been applied in all areas.
An unexpected, but a lovely touch, arrival of a complimentary bottle of champagne and nibbles were provided to help us celebrate the new year. Also wrist bands were made available on our arrival to ensure we could watch the nights fireworks. 
Our room provided us with all we wanted, even a television in the should you require it, and was clean and well appointed.
I have stayed in a number of five star hotels in London and around the uk and beyond and I can honestly say that this hotel is, on my opinion, up in the top few.
Thank you to all the staff for making our stay so memorable",5,2019,01,14
143,Outstanding experience,"If affordable, it's a good choice for a central London stay: good location, good ambience and excellent staff.The staff were obliging to our needs (we're not fussy people and had reasonable requests). We did have to requests for room tea items to be replaced a couple of times.A garden view room ensured us the quietness that was essential to our vacation.",5,2019,01,14
143,Afternoon tea ,"It was perfect, from start to finish, the drinks, tea, sandwiches the cake were amazing, ambiance was sublime, can’t wait to do it all over again. Went to kerrigies for drinks first and the service again impressive, ardderchog.",5,2019,01,14
143,Very enjoyable experience,"Like some previous reviewers I had watched the TV programme on this hotel.  A lot of care and attention was directed to establishing an ""afternoon tea "" experience.  It was very much as I expected from a 5 star hotel.  I didn't get a woah factor but it was very, very good.  Quality and quantity of sandwiches, scones and cakes were faultless with an of excellent choice of teas.  Service was very attentive and with a glass of champagne made the afternoon very relaxing. The unusal rubarb jam (along with strawberry) was actually delicious.  I certainly recommend spending a couple of hours at Corinthia.    ",5,2019,01,14
143,Fawlty Towers at a five star hotel!,"Tom Kerridge’s restaurant here had been recommended to us and so I decided to take my husband there for his birthday and stay for two nights in the hotel as well.  The restaurant meal was the highlight of our stay. The rest was farcical!

When I had booked our stay online back in October I had taken advantage of also booking their champagne afternoon tea package but there was no option to choose the day or time and so I had had to ring the hotel to book a table. 

Check in was fine and our room was a good size for Central London. We unpacked and then went for our afternoon tea in the Crystal Moon Lounge. On arrival there I said we had reserved a table and in a condescending voice we were told that this was for afternoon tea. Our table had a shelf under it and so we could not put our legs under it and so had to sit sideways in our chairs half leaning on the wooden central area of the lounge, not very comfortable. We ordered our champagne, food and tea. We drank our champagne and our sandwiches then arrived. We were asked if we wanted our tea now and we said yes. We slowly ate our sandwiches waiting for our tea, our mouths getting drier and drier! We stopped eating our sandwiches and someone asked us if we wanted more sandwiches and we said no as we were waiting for our tea. My husband then asked for some water. Another person then came with more sandwiches!
Eventually we got our tea. The scones were really nice and the cakes were interesting. There were lots of staff. One served our cakes putting them on a cake stand, another then moved them onto a side table, another then moved them onto our table and another then rearranged them on our table! We were asked if we wanted some more tea at one point and I said yes. This again took about 15 minutes to arrive. When we were ready to leave I asked for the bill. It arrived but was for the price quoted on the menu and not the package price. I attracted the attention of a waiter and explained showing them the confirmation email. They did not understand and so went to get the manager. He came and I explained again, he went off and then came back saying he’d never heard of this before and assumed reception would sort it out. He then turned to leave so I had to ask if that meant we did not have to sign for anything and could just go, to which he said yes. So we did. 

We then went out to the theatre, had a cup of tea using the only English Breakfast tea teabag provided and the Nespresso coffee machine to heat the water and went to bed. The following morning when we were getting ready to go to breakfast, I reached for what I thought was a scarf hanging from the towel rail above the bath to find it was a pair of male underpants (and definitely not my husband’s)!!!! After breakfast we went back to our room and our room had been cleaned but the teabag not replaced. I was still trying to decide what to do about the boxer shorts in our bathroom. My husband wanted to see the spa and so we were shown round what we could see in our clothes by a very helpful lady. I then sent my husband back to the room and stopped at reception to talk about the underwear. The receptionist got her manager and when I explained about having seen what I thought was a scarf to keep hair dry when we first arrived in our room but on closer inspection this morning found it was some stranger’s underwear, she was very apologetic. She offered to move us to a better room which I turned down as we’d already unpacked and stayed there for one night of our two night stay. I also asked her for a kettle and some more teabags explaining that housekeeping had not refilled them. She said that she would send someone up to our room to investigate the underwear and bring some teabags and a kettle. I went back to the room. 

I had only been back in our room a couple of minutes when there was a knock on the door. It was the housekeeper checking our room. I showed her the underpants and she was shocked and gingerly removed them saying she had had a day off the previous day. She also went off to get a kettle and teabags which she then brought back. Then a few minutes later the reception manager arrived to see the underwear and so I explained that the housekeeper had just removed them. 

I then went to make some tea with our kettle and teabags to find that when our room had been cleaned earlier our used cups had been removed and not replaced. I then rang housekeeping to ask for some cups and also thought I’d ask for some milk as we only had four little long life milk containers which would not last us the rest of our stay. A couple of minutes later room service rang to confirm that we wanted cold milk and some cups. These then arrived a short time later with plenty of fresh milk. A little while later someone came with a paper bag containing more teabags. Later again someone else came trying to deliver a second kettle!

As we were getting ready to go out for the afternoon I noticed that one of the dressing gowns had disappeared and so on our way out we stopped at reception to ask for another one. 

We came back to the hotel late afternoon, the dressing gown had arrived, and whilst my husband watched football on the television I went to use the spa. It was very nice and I found it very relaxing. The thermal floor was quite busy but the sauna and steam room in the ladies changing room were quiet. When I’d arrived in the changing rooms at the start of my spa visit I’d noticed that the shower rooms in the changing rooms all had used towels and robes in them but just thought my timing was bad. At the end of my visit when I wanted a shower the used towels and robes were all still there even though I had seen staff in the changing rooms. I ended up using the shower that only had one used towel and robe in it!

I went back to our room and we then got ready for my husband’s birthday meal at 8pm in Kerridge’s. This lived up to our expectations and I would recommend dining there, the garlic roasted cabbage was lovely and the staff were very friendly and helpful. 

We got back to our room after 10pm to find a letter from the reception manager apologising for the incident earlier together with an Espa box containing hand wash and lotion - a very nice touch. There were also some cakes, which was interesting timing since they knew about our reservation at Kerridge’s! However I had seen people leaving afternoon tea the previous day with boxes and so the following morning at breakfast I asked our waiter for a box and he kindly got one for me so we could take the cakes home. 

When we came to check out the receptionist asked if I wanted to see a copy of the bill to which I said yes. It did not include our afternoon tea package and so I pointed out it was missing. She asked if we had had afternoon tea and signed for it and so I explained what had happened. She looked very puzzled at that and checked the computer and said we had stayed for two nights with breakfast. She seemed confused that I was trying to pay for more. In the end I gave up and paid the bill she gave me. 

I have stayed in numerous luxury hotels in London and other countries but never experienced this level of incompetence. It spoilt the luxurious birthday treat I had planned for my husband.

143,New Year Break,"Fantastic stay at the hotel.  Staff very friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble.  Breakfast was lovely with plenty to choose from.  Spa & pool area was lovely and clean with a great areas to go off on relax with a book.    Would recommend as a very special treat.",5,2019,01,13
143,business trip,"Classy hotel in great location so long as Embankment clear. Kerridge’s is a great addition and well worth a visit . Spa is top notch . Overall quality without fuss, you feel better after a visit than you did when you arrived ",5,2019,01,12
143,BAD STAFF DOOR MAN,"That terrible door man ignored me to pick up my book when I dropped I asked pick up but he ignored and other disguising door man insulted me for nothing.    that not professional staff at door man no respect people who nearest door area at Corinthia hotel when I come out from tea last Wednesday afternoon. 
NOT WORTH THAT HORRIBLE DOOR MAN NOT VERY NICE AT CORINTHINA THAT VERY ASHAMED NAME OF HOTEL.    he need learn how to respect !!!!!",1,2019,01,11
143,Wow- what an amazing hotel experience!,London is a city known for fine hotels and the Corinthia is the relative new kid on the block but wow have they learned quickly! The staff greets you and earnestly tries to ensure your stay is perfect without being overbearing. The room is delightful and spacious and modern for London standards. Like a walk in closet! Large shower with rain head. Wonderful bed and sheets. Valet stand outside your room for your morning paper. And the list goes on. But that is only the start of the experience. The spa/sauna/steamroom/pool has to be top 5 in the world and I travel 250 nights a year for work. The hotel restaurants are truly amazing and he original cocktails- try the avocado cocktail- are sublime.,5,2019,01,11
143,Not a place that I want to stay for another time ,"We chose this hotel to stay this time in London instead of the Ritz or Conrad where we actually have top status based on online reviews and the desire to try something new. What a disappointment. On arrival, nobody was at the door to help with our four luggages until I carried one into the lobby. Service in the bar and restaurant was average at best. I had to ask for a server after patiently sitting for 10 minutes. Also, we paid for an executive room but were given a deluxe instead without informing us. I mentioned this during checkout but didn’t press because we were in a hurry for the airport. Nothing was done about it. I do have to say that the room size is very decent for a hotel in London. Bathroom is great. Love the thermal floor.",2,2019,01,10
143,Not a place to celebrate your special anniversary,"My husband book the this hotel to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. He booked a package including breakfast, room, a bottle of champagne and he also booked the restaurant for dinner. My husband  asked at my request if we could have a glass of champagne with our dinner from the bottle he have purchase from the hotel to celebrate our 25th anniversary and they said that we would have to pay extra £50 to do that.  My husband complained and at the end of the dinner the manager of the restaurant gave us an explanation (he more less blame the reception for it)  I did not want to complain at that point I was concentrating in celebrating my anniversary but it was really disappointing. We took the bottle of champagne home and remains unopened. We also decided to go to the spa to relax. I was in the pool when a man with a mobile phone got into the pool, very stressing. I also when to the steam room and soon after the man entered the steam room and actually was talking on the phone. The spa experience was not relaxing at all. Don't they have rules about mobile phones in the spa?
We when to breakfast in the morning and we were explained that we where entitle with our package to English Breakfast. I did not want an English breakfast but and Omelette. In the menu it said that it would be £2 additional for the Omelette. This menu is really unnecessary and confusing. If I buy a breakfast i don't want restriction like that. What is wrong with wanted and omelette instead of full English breakfast. I had the omelette any way.
The surroundings and the service from people serving the food were those expected from a 5 star hotel but management needs to less petty. The manager send and send an email apologizing for the dinner incident  3 days after we left the hotel but they did not do anything about it. At our departure the receptionist did not even asked us if we had a good time. A hotel experience is not only defined by the surroundings and the good service of the people but by how management treats the guest.",1,2019,01,10
143,Afternoon Tea at its best... ,"The title says it all! Fantastic, fresh and flavorsome sandwiches, freshly baked scones with scrummy clotted cream and two types of homemade jam and then the cake trolley...! An experience in itself and such a superb range! You dont know where to start. One of our party is a vegetarian: our server said that they would remind the chef as some products contained fish extract - that’s care and service! The ultimate experience is the tea! One of our party said that they had never had such a fab pot (x 3) of tea! There is a pianist who asked us if we were enjoying our experience and would we like tune to be played... Overall a highly recommended, special experience that will last and last... ",5,2019,01,09
143,Corinthia best of London as usual,"It’s my best choice in London , amazing services from Concierge, reception, waiters, reservations I keeps coming back to this hotel every time I visit London weather it’s for business or pleasure Corinthia is my only choice ",5,2019,01,08
143,Weekend stay,"Great roomStaff generally very goodExperience tarnished by receptionist's in flexibility to bend the rules. E.g we were unable to drink the wine provided in our room in the restaurant, unless we paid a charge of £50.00",4,2019,01,07
143,Great place to stay,"A beautiful facility; great staff; terrific spa; comfortable room. Choices for breakfast were endless and wait staff were very gracious. Concierge staff were outstanding helping us plan trips, getting us tickets and most important arranging dinner reservations at many sought-after restaurants. ",5,2019,01,06
143,My arrival experience was completely overturned by the way I was taken care of afterwards!,"I was recommended by my travel advisor when I was planning a trip to London for New Year’s firework. 
Frankly speaking, my initial impression to the hotel was not so good, considering what perceived from the staff on my arrival day. I made the booking three months before my arrival with a program of AMEX that offers a room upgrade when it is available. I specifically requested a high floor room while booking. However, the lady that checked me in didn’t even tried to find one for me, let alone a room upgrade. This room, located on the second floor, not only had a non-functioning light bulb in the bathroom, but the duvet cover was also placed inside out! The main reason I made up my mind to call my trip advisor to complain, is that I find there was entirely no phone reception in my room, since the room was facing the small central garden. I also made a call from my room to book the afternoon tea in advance and it also turned out they couldn’t find my record when I went to the lounge for afternoon tea! Fortunately the found one table for me right a way.
The next day, the managing director came to me while I was having the breakfast, confirmed my room number with me and told me about what he heard from my travel agency. He offered to find another room for me ASAP. The minute I went back my room, I got a call from the lady manager on duty and invited to have a look of the room she found for me before I decide if I want to move. I liked the new room very much and mostly importantly, the attitude they value guests’ experience, so I moved. 
One day prior to Dec. 31, a kind black gentlemen surprisingly delivered wristbands door to door for the guests to make sure we have no problem leaving and entering the neighborhood considering it was a controlled area for the fireworks. It was a very sweet gesture. The gentlemen was also very keen to assist us at the door for all kinds of needs. I do appreciate a lot! All of what they have done for us just overturned my initial impression and actually, has perfected my memory of this trip!",5,2019,01,05
143,Afternoon tea treat,"As a birthday treat for my 14 year old daughter, we booked for afternoon tea. We travelled from Cheshire for the day especially for the tea and it was certainly worth the trip. The beautiful setting,  the sandwiches, scones and cakes and of course my glass of champagne were great. What set the experience apart was the personable warm service we received. Not just from one person (although I did catch the name of one, Arris) - the whole team were so welcoming and genuinely wanted to make sure were having a good time. Thank you so much for making my daughter and I feel like V. I. P s. We got back on the train on a high with our box of cakes that we just couldn’t squeeze in during the tea! ",5,2019,01,04
143,Stay at the Corinthia,"Excellent hotel, with great staff and attention to details.  Location is also fabulous.  My wife and I had a great time - was everything we had expected and hoped for.  Received an upgrade to a Junior Suite, which was spacious and extremely comfortable.",5,2019,01,04
143,Great to come back to Corinthia,"This was our second time staying at the Corinthia Hotel in London as we had stayed there early December in 2016 and had very fond memories of the hotel.

This time we booked the hotel  via “What a Hotel” as we had used this site previously and had been very impressed with the additional benefits that that they had provided for us.   Check in was quick and efficient and the one new thing we had heard was that the hotel is no longer doing standard check in times, that if you advise the hotel  the approximate time of your arrival your room should be ready, which was great as we had arrived well before the standard check in time.

We were greeted with “Welcome back Mr & Mrs Dobson” which was lovely (good database) and were given an upgrade of Executive King Room. We also asked for a later check out as our flight four days later was not leaving until 10.00pm at night – on check in they could offer us to 3pm  but advised they would  come back to us the day before check out to confirm if they could do 6pm (which they did and we received our 6pm check out time).

The room was very spacious and provided a welcoming walk in robe which was huge,  we know the Corinthia Hotel has the largest hotel rooms in London and this one was no exception.  The hotel knew it was our 34th wedding anniversary trip and a lovely “Happy Anniversary Cake” was in our room as well as a stunning flower arrangement.
The Hotel was decorated for Xmas and looked stunning, although I personally felt the Swan lake theme and ice sculptures of 2016 were more stunning

 Xmas Morning we woke to find gorgeous xmas stockings on our door filled with an array of quality goodies which took us back to our childhood as we opened the stocking.  

Xmas lunch was at Kerridges Bar and Grill and what a lunch it was,  great food, great service and we had a wonderful  time, yes it was expensive (particularly when you then converted it to Australian Dollars) but it was Xmas and we had a wonderful time.

Two minor issues
We had a little issue with the service in the Northall at Breakfast the first day as no one came to take our order and we did mention this on the way out and the next day the staff apologised and the service was exceptional.

We had drinks on the afternoon we were leaving at the Basson Bar and the service was very good but the music was just to loud, we did ask if it could be turned down (We were the only ones in the bar at that time) but were advised they could not, so we did not stay for a second drink due to the music  being to loud ( may be okay for later in the evening or if more patrons there but at around about 5pm it was just to loud to talk over or to  be enjoyable).

Overall an excellent hotel with a wonderful staff and we had a great Xmas at the hotel.",5,2019,01,03
143,Really beautiful place for a romantic escape!,"It was a really nice experience! SPA is the most beautiful of London, and the SPA team is so nice and helpful. I really recommend this hotel for a romantic and relaxing escape. We will come back really soon!!",5,2019,01,03
143,"Great hotel, great place, needs more professionalism","The Corinthia is a great hotel, best location. The service needs to be improved. The room was not 100% clean, the extra bed for my daughter was just bad, she had back pain after our stay, restaurants and bars are completely booked, no chsnce to get dinner without reservation. No extras, no welcome, no new years greetings. The hotel is under German management, did not fulfilled his mission till now!",4,2019,01,03
143,Wow- wish we could have stayed longer,"If I could give 6 stars we would. I hardly know where to begin-let’s start with the staff. From the wonderful doormen to the front desk staff to the concierge staff, EVERYONE we dealt with was so kind and helpful. And I mean everyone. Two people on the concierge staff, Laetitia and Shay were quite helpful as well as others whose names I cannot remember. We were upgraded to a smaller inside suite which was one of the nicest suites I have ever seen. We loved the vibrant colors as well as the general layout of the rooms. The bed was divine and one of the best nights sleeps we have ever gotten. The cleaning staff were kind, considerate and did a great job. 
Now, the restaurant and service staff were also great. We only had breakfast at the hotel but found it to be amazing. I strongly disagree with the review from I think RW. The staff was very attentive, quite professional and the food came out quickly and prepared to perfection. In fact, breakfast was one of our favorite times because of the staff. 
We did get to use the spa area briefly and found it to be one of the nicest we had ever seen at an inner city hotel. This was our first stay at a Corinthia hotel, but will not be our last. 
Finally, the location cannot be beat as it is close to many attractions, but off the beaten path enough to be an oasis itself. Thanks again for a perfect vacation. ",5,2019,01,02
143,Family trip to London ,My family of 5 and I came to the Corinthia for New Years and had an average stay. The hotel service was pretty good except for the restaurant by the bar area was slow and the spa area was not kid friendly and the workers were slightly rude. Other than that the stay went very well. The rooms were nice and the hotel gave us special wristbands that allowed us to see the New Year’s Eve fireworks up close!   ,4,2019,01,02
143,Afternoon Tea,"After seeing the TV programme and as my wife's birthday was soon I booked afternoon tea at the Corinthia Hotel and we had a lovely afternoon with a beautifully presented tea in a most luxurious surroundings. Like most of the hotels the staff are always coming round if you require more sandwiches, scones, tea and cakes and if you cannot finish them they suggest you take them home. If you have a special occasion I can highly recommend their afternoon tea.",5,2019,01,01
143,Fab New Year,"This is not the first or the last visit to the Corinthia hotel. What an amazing New year and thank you once again for making it such a special time for both my friends and family. 

Food and service constantly exceed all  exspectations. Looking forward to our next visit.",5,2019,01,01
143,Worth every penny ,"The hotel, service and room are worthy of the acclaim of the hotel. We spent a weekend here and it was a fantastic experience with everyone being made to feel special and valued. The breakfast is an experience in itself with beautiful food and a great variety of dishes to choose from. As expected the service was outstanding from the doorman through to the service staff at breakfast. ",5,2019,01,01
143,Mr RC,"Great location for NYE celebration.. we came out around 23:45PM and still able to have a great spot to view the fireworks.. the staff is very good in making the guest comfortable during the peak time of NYE. The only thing that is flaw is the breakfast.

 We came from Pullman St Pancras before coming to Corinthia.. service in breakfast far more efficient in Pullman and the spread of the breakfast is equal and somehow better than Corinthia. For example, the teapot in pullman are ceramic, so it does not sting our hand from the boil tea/coffee. No need for the foods to come to our table.. the variety of the food that is include in the breakfast are the same. And even Pullman have a better spread of hot food.

Advise for traveller, for location especially during NYE and summer time: Corinthia. For better and efficient service: Pullman. (No Air condition, only air cooling. Not a problem during winter and spring) The cost in Pullman also only a quarter of Corinthia.",3,2019,01,01
143,Fabulous hotel ,"What a great stay!!! 

Decent afternoon tea. Fabulous rooms - we were upgraded which was a lovely surprise. Gorgeous gorgeous room with every amenity that one could possibly think of! Fantastic showers. 

The best bit though was the spa. Oh my goodness- a true oasis! I’d stay again just for that! 

Superb way to spend some time between Christmas & new year. ",5,2018,12,31
143,Christmas Stay at The Corinthia,"I had booked Tickets to the Theatre opposite the Hotel to see the Musical, Caroline Or Change. We are a family of five and I decided to treat us all by booking a Night's Stay at The Corinthia! We had an excellent time. Every member of Staff was highly professional well trained, warm friendly and efficient in discharging their duties. The Sommelier at the Northall made a recommendation which was much appreciated and the wine, enjoyed!  We look forward to returning to The Corinthia again in the future.  Best wishes to you all for a very successful 2019 and beyond.  Archie Riby-Williams ",5,2018,12,31
143,Masterclass and Afternoon Tea,"I was attending a cake masterclass which took place at the Corinthia. We were welcomed into the lovely tea room and asked what breakfast drinks we would like. I had a delicious hot chocolate accompanied by little bowls of marshmallows, chocolate flakes and cream...lovely. We then went off to a lovely room to do our masterclass. Half way through we had lovely biscuits and tea and coffee. At the end of our masterclass we sat down to a beautiful table laid out for afternoon tea. The service was great and the sandwiches and pastries were delicious!! I would definitely return!!",5,2018,12,30
143,Our new Christmas tradition. The new BEST in London,"We switched from our usual, The Dorchester, to spend the weekend before Christmas at The Corinthia. We’ll be honest, we never knew much about the hotel before the BBC TV show but - OMG - aren’t we glad we discovered you!

As two Midlanders we always book a couple of nights in a grand London hotel just before Christmas so we can get into the spirit. We usually stay at the Dorchester or Savoy as they’re so famous, but we were intrigued to stay here. We are so glad we did. The service (like all grand hotels in London) is beautifully attentive, very polite and gracious but the rooms here are among the most generously proportioned we’ve stayed in, in fact, friends of ours who have stayed here say they are the biggest in London, so a stay here also represents great value. Every part of our stay was perfect. We had a courtyard room, which - upon being told this at check-in - was initially a disappointment but once we got into the room, we realised the courtyard (which is huge and designed beautifully with a view of the atrium below) is actually a wonderful view. The Juliet balconies, which every room have, also help.

What the owners of this old Whitehall government building have done is incredible. I’m not sure how much of the interior is original, but the whole scheme - inside and out - is not just stately, it’s MAJESTIC.

Thanks for the most fabulous stay. A stay with you is our new Christmas tradition.",5,2018,12,30
143,Outstanding Service,"We called into the bar of this hotel for a pre lunch drink.
Omar who served us was so polite and we really enjoyed talking to him- a great start to our Christmas holiday.
We also decided to have breakfast there on Christmas morning but didn’t know it would only be open for residents which we weren’t.
The gentleman that greeted us was also very polite in the way he had to explain that we couldn’t be accommodated but offered an alternative to sit in the lounge and have something there and would just check with his manager.
On his return he told us that we could in fact eat in the breakfast room- very impressed with this indeed.
All the staff were so polite and friendly and the breakfast was amazing.Thanks for making our Christmas special.

143,Christmas Afternoon Tea,We had a really lovely experience here on the Saturday before Christmas. We had booked for 1pm but arrived early. This wasn't a problem in the slightest and our table was ready for us. The food was delicious and there was a huge selection of teas to choose from. We did not feel rushed at all and even had a little break after the warm scones to stretch our legs and listen to the beautiful piano music being played by a very talented musician! Of course it was expensive to have this experience but it was such a lovely treat in a beautiful hotel with welcoming staff that it was worth the money.,5,2018,12,27
143,Ms,"This hotel is stunning,the service is as polished as the Xmas decorations especially the room service team who on Xmas eve & day were remarkable & friendly although working tirelessly! This is our second visit the hidden spa is like a swanky oasis in the heart of London where stress melts away . The door knob has a lovely Xmas stocking full of gourmet treats from Santa. The suite we have has a homey high end lounge feel to it . With a powerful shower, tv in bath spa products & cloud pillow. Best of all it’s the quiet. Checking out will be hard in the morning. Kerridge s was 10 out of 10 for Xmas day. Thank you ",5,2018,12,26
143,Our Christmas Dinner,We went to this hotel for our Christmas dinner. The internal decorations were fantastic the meal was good I would have expected better considering it was a top class hotel. I am unfortunately gluten free and made to feel as though I had the plague. I informed them in advance that I was gluten free but this was totally ignored the main meal had gluten in.   We were fleeced by the waiting staff who charged us for 14 bottles of water which we never had they came to the table regular with about 2 inches of was her in them we asked for house wine for which they wanted to charge us 104 pounds for. I had three teaspoons of ice cream for dessert as this was the only gluten free dessert which they had sprinkled brandy snap over again not gluten free. I would have loved to have recommended this hotel to friends. I would not put them through the trama I went though. They really made me ill.,2,2018,12,26
143,"Great location, lovely rooms, good food, brought low by inept concierge service","Loved this hotel's location close to Trafalgar and the National Gallery as well as the theatres and Somerset House.  Its proximity to Embankment Underground station means it's a quick hop to other parts of town.   The spa is first class-I had a great massage- and the thermal bath and saunas are well executed.  The Breakfast buffet is good and service is helpful and fast.   My biggest complaint is the concierge service.  It is awful.  I have a list a page long of things they screwed up, but here is a sample.I emailed them several weeks in advance to ask whether we should hire a car service or take public transportation to get to a museum located outside of London.  I received an email back saying the museum was good and we should go!  That was it in terms of responding to my question.  It took several more emails and two phone calls for me to get transportation booked for this outing.We were leaving to go to return to the US on Xmas eve.  The concierge told us to take the Heathrow Express from Paddington on that day to avoid traffic.  The train wasn't running on Xmas eve which I discovered by double checking the times myself.  We could have missed our plane!If you need the concierge service, I would recommend another hotel, like the Langham.",4,2018,12,25
143,Amazing hotel but poor lighting controls and poor movie selection in room,Fantastic ambience in lobby area and spa. Really good spa. More attention to giving customers better control over lighting in the room needed. Also in room movie selection poor and very expensive. Breakfast buffet election quite limited for the price ,4,2018,12,24
143,Kerridges - First Class for relaxing Dinner,"Visited for business, on arrival quick seated and ordered drinks and food.

Very busy evening, however service was excellent.

Good menu and the food was excellent, had some Beers over the evening which were very good.

I would recommend for a good relaxing evening in a chilled out atmosphere.

Will be returning again.

Highly recommended for business or pleasure.",5,2018,12,24
143,Perfect,We started here with our teeenage son for a week and loved it. The two bedroom suite was spacious and the service great.  The location was great.  I would recommend ithis hotel to anyone staying in a London. My favorite part was the tea service! ,5,2018,12,23
143,Our favourite hotel in London,We spent two days at the Corinthia visiting London and Christmas shopping.  The service was excellent and the staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome.  We recommend tea in the Crystal Lounge.,5,2018,12,23
143,Christmas dinner,"The reason I chose The Northall; my wife & I booked here before......we had cocktails in the Bassoon Bar.....a wonderful evening with superb & exciting cocktails......& I thought on this occasion it would be the same. I’m afraid I was utterly wrong. The Bassoon Bar was full so we were ushered into the Northall Bar. It was awful. A selection of 5 cocktails. I ordered the Tropical Sazerac cocktail.....served in a wine glass with a slice of lemon balanced on the top......it was so distasteful I ordered a G&T and returned it; it was terrible.........& with the gin revival currently dominating the UK one would expect quite a selection. Wrong. Dull. Boring. About 8 gins to choose from. Mine came adorned with lemon, how ‘traditional’ & utterly uninspired........!!! The thing is......my review here is subjective, of course it is.......but if you’re paying £17 for a G&T anyone would expect it to be a little ‘different’.......& if not, go to the Sherlock Holmes opposite & pay a third of the cost & enjoy an ‘old feel’ London pub.....!!! If my first experience of the Corinthia Hotel had been like the second, I would never have bothered to book a second visit. The Northall Bar was awful. Uninspired. Utterly lacking in anything special. Staff were switched off & clearly uninterested, there was no offer of ‘nibbles’, I had to ask & when trying to get their attention I felt invisible; that really annoyed me. I asked if I could select a cocktail from the Bassoon Bar but was informed I could only order from the bar I was in........!!!!! I was staggered.........I felt like I was 18 and on a package holiday and in the ‘wrong’ bar.......truly unsophisticated & utterly lacking in ‘customer awareness’. It was meant to be quite a special, Christmas occasion but I’m afraid it wasn’t really worth the effort of getting from deepest Surrey to the excitement of central London.........there are so many more fine dining restaurants in London that give a more exciting drinking & dinner experience.......but, to be balanced and fare, the food was beautifully presented and thoroughly delicious.........but at nearly £300 I would expect that.........I feel a visit to The Corinthia should be exceptional, worthy of recommending to friends & family and absolutely, special........it just wasn’t any of those things in the slightest, it was unexciting, uninspired & very, very expensive..........

143,First Class Hotel and Beyond,"Incredible service and accommodations.  From the front desk to the concierge, to the housekeeping and the doormen, we could not have asked for more.  On the whole the entire staff made this trip to London spectacular!  So many amenities!",5,2018,12,20
143,Vibeless Bassoon Bar,"As review indicates no vibe, we were there between 8 and 9 pm Staff lovely, drinks expensive but to be expected. Terrible piped music. Going to Rosewood live music
Some arriving as we left about 9.30.",2,2018,12,20
143,Second to noone,"Yes, location may not be the greatest compared to Mayfair and Knightsbridge but we are probably in front of the most wonderful atmosphere and staff in the entire city. 
We were curious to visit after the tv documentary, and while we may not belong to the ""super rich or famous"" category :), we felt threated like royalties from the moment we did step in. 
Some of the member of the staff are very young but they lead the show like veterans. 
We had afternoon tea and was certainly worth the price together as an immaculate room. 
Next time will be the time to check the SPA and the recently opened restaurant.",5,2018,12,20
143,Classy and fussy hotel,"Will start my review with pros and cons this time
Pros:
Classy and elegant
Very good  location : easy access to underground station just across the hotel Embankment station,bus and taxis. walking distance to Trafalgar square, Thames river and London eye. Also Covent garden and Seven dials around 15-20 minutes walk.
Heard about the very good spa which unfortunately I did not get access to them for an appointment throughout my stay.
Friendly Doorkeepers and bell men and housekeeping staff.
Ms Nicole was a very approachable and helpful Front desk assistant manager, she tried her best to make us comfortable during our stay.
Very nice ambiance and odor of the hotel
Very good amenities like the shampoo, shower gel and lotion.
Kind of them to attach a hand shower in the bidet for us .
Good pressure of the water in the shower.
Turn down service was very good of the housekeeping.
Efficient Engineering service.
Cons:
Not very friendly Front office staff,Concierge and In Room dining (IRD) although some of the IRD staff were quite helpful.
Fussy and not hospitable rules and policies of the hotel in spite of explaining to them that I am a Platinum member and have come with my family for our wedding anniversary. With great difficulty was offered the upgrade to deluxe room after changing maybe three times which is explainable due to the high season time and demands of in-house guests.
I fell sick and needed to have a lemon each day with some cinnamon powder which the IRD initially said have to charge me for the equipment which consisted of an empty tea pot and 2 coffee mugs.I complained this situation to the duty manager at night and it was kind of him to arrange a complimentary daily delivery of the mentioned stuff. Honestly then what is being a Platinum member mean if even this is not offered complimentary to their guests.
They lacked the fine turnings of guest services like in spite of mentioning to them that it was our wedding anniversary unfortunately nothing was offered as a gesture to celebrate the occasion.
Nowadays even if you go to an ordinary restaurant they offer a cake with a mini celebration, honestly that really disappointed us a lot.
The state of curtains , carpets and lamp shades seem very overused and need upgrading.
The quality of tea bags very old fashioned which is not compatible with the standard of 5 star luxury hotels nowadays. Preferable to  use organic tea leaves in sachets and have more herbal tea choices.
The housekeeping need to concentrate more on thorough cleansing and clearing the dusts around the room.

Other wise overall it is a great place to be in and will really want to be back again here provided they have better recognition for their valued guests.
",4,2018,12,20
143,Luxury for the family in the heart of the capital,"From our arrival at the main entrance, to our departure at the same door, there was nothing we wanted for. As we checked in (a very smooth experience) our luggage was being labelled with our room number, and delivered there within minutes after our own arrival.  
We ordered room service from an extensive menu; it was delivered promptly, and lived up fully to its description in the menu.
Full black out curtains and exceptionally comfortable beds ensured sound sleep, and heated marble floors were a delight during a cold London night.
Breakfast offered a range that must have covered any guest requirement, and staff were numerous but unobtrusive, ready to clear the table ready for the next course.
Our only complaint was that we didn't have sufficient time in London to make full use of all the facilities offered at the hotel.",5,2018,12,19
143,Excellent Luxury Hotel,"The room/suite and amenities were amazing.  The staff were extremely friendly, polite, and knowledgeable (very hospitable).  There was a good variety of food that was delicious.  In room dining was excellent with an extremely polite and accommodating staff - I would recommend an inclusive English breakfast, especially for those that love breakfast in bed. The location was perfect for attractions, shopping, restaurants, pubs, and transportation.  I would recommend Uber for cost to/from the airport (unless for prefer the Tube and connecting trains).  It was hit or miss whether you find friendly and knowledgeable Black Cab or Uber (speak English?) drivers; nevertheless, some will please you with their knowledge and conversation (if you enjoy that like we do).",5,2018,12,18
143,Buffoon at the Bassoon,Anticipating an exemplary experience where the patron is never told no... we were confronted with a surly and unwelcoming monosyllabic employee in the Bassoon Bar at around 18:30 on Monday 17th December. A could do better report would not adequately describe my disappointment.  Sadly Germanic precision was lacking.,1,2018,12,17
143,December 2018,"I have stayed at the Corinthia over the last several years both by myself & with my family. It is always my first choice hotel whenever I go to London. The location is great, London finds you & you don't have to hunt around for something to do. The rooms are excellent, the spa is excellent & I have zero complaints - zero!",5,2018,12,17
143,Tea at the Corinthia. ,"Definitely tops the Ritz. 
This is the place to have an elegant and excellent tea in London at the moment. 
Everything goes beyond expectations, the sandwiches were delicious, the scones probably my best ever, the pastries a delight. 
I found the champagne a little too crisp for my taste, but the lychee vodka martini was perfect. 
Service faultless. Attention to detail beyond perfection. 
Will return. ",5,2018,12,17
143,Didn't want to come home,"The Corinthia was everything and more than we could of hoped for.  My husband and I had a wonderful night away in absolute luxury.  We had a wonderful late lunch in the North Hall restaurant, was in walking distance of the Royal Opera House where we saw Carmen in the evening and topped the evening off with lobster club sandwiches from room service.  The bed was so comfortable and we had a perfect sleep with no noise disruption from other guests.  Would definitely recommend.",5,2018,12,17
143,Weekend stay in December,"Great in all aspects. Absolutely superb quality and treatment. Wonderful rooms. The bathrooms were fantastic (great idea the tv in front of the bathtub and the warm floors). Service was perfect at all times.If anything, keeping in mind that this is the holiday season, I would have welcome a warmer christmas decoration. It is an opportunity to move from a good entry/hall to a great one.",5,2018,12,17
143,Outstanding Afternoon Tea - Highly Recommend,"I visited with a friend for the Festive Afternoon Tea and I have to say it was one of the best afternoon teas I've had. The surroundings of the Crystal Moon Lounge has the wow factor with a stunnng  Baccarat chandelier. Every part of afternoon tea was perfect. The sandwiches were delicious, especially the egg mayonnaise and truffle. The scones were served in a box to keep them warm. The pastries arrived beautifully presented on a dessert trolley. There were a nice selection of pastries and also marshmallow in three different flavours. The hotel has good disabled access. We loved our afternoon tea, it was a truly special occassion and highly recommend it.",5,2018,12,16
143,Birthday treat,Great night. Brilliant bars and breakfast. Just remember not everyone coming sees a night in the Corinthia as an everyday occurrence! Those who save up for months also should be treated the same overall,4,2018,12,16
143,The best lunch in town ,"We popped in for lunch having seen the programme on tv and were so impressed we cannot wait to go back. We were in the bar and had a table right next to Thomas (I do have a little thing for him 😍). The squid was absolutely delicious and I washed it down with the gin cocktail 🍸. The service was top notch and the Christmas decorations were so beautiful. We loved our little snack, I’m hoping to convince the husband to treat me to a nights stay as I think we cannot judge the hotel properly without staying. We highly recommend the bar and will definitely be back!",5,2018,12,14
143,Beautiful hotel-wonderful location,Beautiful hotel with spacious beautifully decorated well planned rooms featuring custom closets and bathrooms with fabulous walk in rain shower. Very convenient & wonderful location. Fabulous well trained and caring staff.,5,2018,12,13
143,Best service ever in the best hotel ever!,"We have stayed in luxury hotels all over the world, but this one is definitely the best we’ve been to, both in terms of the hotel itself, and more importantly, the service. We were made to feel like ‘VIPs’ from the moment we walked up to the front door. The doorman was so welcoming and ensured we knew where to go. We actually arrived 4 hours before check in, merely to leave our bag to go Christmas shopping. The reception lady not only assured us that she’d take care of this, but also she was desperate to let us in our room early (even though we didn’t even ask for this). We said we didn’t mind waiting until 3pm but she was still apologetic and offered us free coffee or tea! She additionally asked what time we would like turn down (never been asked that) - a really nice touch. As promised, we got an SMS about two hours before check in to say the room was ready. This was really handy, as we were able to go to our room before the Corinthia afternoon tea we’d booked at 2pm. After having been greeted by the duty manager, we were shown to our room by a lovely lady. The room was one of the new ‘garden suites’, complete with beautiful lounge, bedroom and bathroom with huge bath including a tv at the end and a walk in wardrobe. The suite was outstanding. It was lovely to receive a welcome card from the one and only Thomas Kochs! We also loved the afternoon tea in the moon lounge, my wife was particularly pleased to have been given one of the gold cups! The moon lounge is beautiful, beautifully decorated for Christmas as was the whole hotel. The afternoon tea comes up in stages, making it stand out from the competition, offering a more refined experience. The champagne glasses are top notch. The sandwiches were the best we’ve had, particularly liked the salt beef. After partaking in a second round (with a choice of sandwiches) we had our tea served (we were asked when we wanted it). There was a vast choice of tea and we settled for the medium Corinthia blend which was the best tea we’ve had. The scones came up in a box that keeps them warm, and then the beautiful patisserie style cakes with an additional Christmas plate. The service at afternoon tea was the best we’d had, the staff were so attentive. We also made use of the spa which was very opulent and modern. Everything was there you could want and it was all top notch. We had room service in the evening, again all perfect, superb service. For breakfast we went to the main restaurant, there was a buffet and a la carte main. Very good food, beautiful dining room and very good service. We were able to leave our bags at the hotel after checking out to do more Christmas shopping. This, along with getting a taxi for us when we collected the bags, was of course done with a smile. Other hotels could really learn from Corinthian London. Whilst the hotel is beautiful and luxurious, the perfect blend of modernity, tradition & luxury, it’s the service that makes it, and from the many luxury hotels we’ve stayed at, the Corinthia is way ahead. Will definitely be returning. Really well done to Thomas & his excellent team. ",5,2018,12,11
143,Will def be back ,"I have stayed in a few places in London and this by far is my favorite. There was not one thing I did not like about this hotel!  The rooms were handsome. The rainfall shower is a pleasure to use every day.  The service was wonderful and the facilities are great!  It is in a great location as well. The splurge for breakfast buffet is well worth it.  The best cooked eggs in town!  It is a classy hotel and if you need guest services to help you with anything (like a proposal) , Isabel is just wonderful to work with!  The decor of the hotel lets you know they take care of details. Can’t wait to go back. ",5,2018,12,10
143,Simply the best of the best,"Although pricey, you get what you pay for here.  The staff are always looking out for your best interest and well being.  The property is beyond the word magnificent.  Excellence abounds in everything this hotel embarks upon.",5,2018,12,10
143,The perfect Christmas venue,"The hotel itself is just amazing. It was very tastefully decorated for Christmas. We had a special birthday party with welcome drinks and a sit down 3 course meal. The food was just incredible! The lobster starter was delicious and the beef was to die for! It would be interesting to know who the chef was...

The standards and the quality of this venue are very high and I would love to go back again!",5,2018,12,10
143,Stunning Five Star Luxury Hotel In London,"We have just spent two nights at The Corinthia, London to celebrate my daughters 16th birthday. We stayed in a family room.

If your looking for a world class hotel in an outstanding central London location then there is only one hotel - The Corinthia.

143,Afternoon Tea: The Very Best That London Has To Offer,"This review is solely about the Corinthia's champagne afternoon tea. I have neither stayed at the hotel nor dined there.

There are many London hotels and restaurants that offer champagne afternoon tea. In fact, this has become quite a competitive market in recent years, probably because it's also a very lucrative one (for places that manage to get it right).

In December, I needed to organise a champane afternoon tea for myself and a guest  to mark a very special occasion. I was determined to choose the best possible venue. To this end, I spent a day traipsing round London on foot, visiting a number of prominent venues that pride themselves on their afternoon teas. 

It's probably against the rules of TripAdvisor reviews to name specific places and competitors, but let's just say I visited all the well known places that people tend to mention when the subject of 'afternoon tea' comes up, and a few others besides.

Some of these places had very cramped afternoon tea facilities, with guests crammed elbow to elbow and enjoying very little sense of personal space or privacy. Others offered inescapable live piano music that was far too loud and intrusive. Some offered good service but rather drab, disappointing decor that didn't really provide a sense of occasion.

I had no doubt, after my 'grand tour' of London's afternoon teas, that the Corinthia was the best option. I am pleased to say that they surpassed even my highest expectations.

Bars: If you want a quite drink or a cocktail before your afternoon tea, the Corinthia has two lovely bars with slightly different personalities: the Northall and Kerridge's.  

Room: the Crystal Moon Lounge is a lovely, warm, quiet, inviting and relaxed space in which to enjoy an afternoon tea. It's beautifully decorated and well lit. It's spacious enough for all guests to enjoy a sense of privacy, and you have the choice of sitting within the main lounge or, for a bit of extra quiet and privacy, one of the four or five 'window' seats with elegant, tan-leather, high-backed chairs. My guest and I opted for one of these window seats.

There is live piano music for most of the afternoon, but it is at precisely the right background level and not intrusive at all. The piano is adjacent to, rather than in the middle of, the Lounge, and this makes a very positive difference. We could hear the piano, distantly, but it never threatened to drown our conversation (as happens as two or three other places I could mention.)

The menu is excellent: finger sandwiches, scones with jam and cream and then, to finish, an array of sweet treats and amazing creations from the patisserie. There's not much to say about the food except that it's all good, all thoroughly delicious and tasty, and all beautifully served and presented.

You choose the tea you want (they have a good selection) and, if you're adding champagne to the mix, they can offer white or rosé as you prefer. (I recommend the rosé.)  

So far, so good. But what really makes The Corinthia distinctive, and the very best afternoon tea the city can offer, is the quality and style of the service. It's not easy to get this right. Too little service and you leave guests feeling ignored and overlooked - leading to the familiar syndrome of 'trying to catch the eye of the waiter'. On the other hand, too much attention can easily lead to a feeling of being unnecessarily fussed over. 

At The Corinthia, the service that my guest and I enjoyed was absolutely perfect. Simply perfect. Our main server, Lars, was always there when we wanted anything, but never there when we didn't. He was the epitome of perfection: friendly, helpful, dazzingly efficient, good-natured and a pleasure to talk to. All the other members of staff that attended to us from time to time were also a pleasure to deal with.

I've given five stars for this review, but I would willingly give six or seven if I could. I wanted this particular champagne afternoon tea to be something special for my guest and myself, and it most definitely was, thanks largely to the brilliant team at The Corinthia and how hard they work to make sure everything is as close to perfect as can be. 

Nobody booking a champagne afternoon tea at this sort of venue can be too concerned about the price. It's clearly not a 'cheap' option. However, my feeling is that you can't put a price on perfection. For the service we enjoyed, and the level of attention to detail, I thought The Corinthia provided excellent value for money.

It was simply wonderful!",5,2018,12,09
143,Afternoon tea,"Excellent service very friendly staff, food was amazing , this was my daughters birthday and they enjoyed every minute, will definitely visit again, the hotel looked amazing as the Christmas decorations were up, beautiful thank you",5,2018,12,09
143,Perfect celebration setting ,"My fiancé brought me here for afternoon tea and it was beautiful. The sandwiches were delicious, the cakes and pastries were equally good. Service was friendly and welcoming. It was overall a lovely experience. Would highly recommend ",5,2018,12,09
143,"Awesome hotwl, only one complaint","We have stayed here quite a few times and decided to stay again for our wedding anniversary. And how nice it was to see a familiar face to check us in, yet to ask his name but from the management team of the front desk. Our rooms were almost ready, infact one was ready as we were speaking so got our bags taken to that room. We later got a text to let us know our room was ready. We had turned up at 11am. Corinthia always tries to accommodate you night or day. 'No' is not in their vocabulary. 
We had drinks and light food in the lounge which is such an awesome place to sit and chill. Maybe play spot the celebrity. Since the BBC program it appears more interest has been taken in this hotel, and also some of the staff have become quite famous. 
The superior king room is lovely, spacious, everything in perfect order, clean and tidy. We were fortunate enough to get an upgrade for our anniversary and put in the luxury room which felt a touch bigger and we also had a view of the Thames. Amazing. 
In the morning we had breakfast which I will come back to, and then went to the Spa. Sectioned off, male and female changing areas on different floors both with huge changing facilities. The Spa has different sections including a lovely silver lined swimming pool, steam room, thermal floor etc. Truely an experience you should.not miss
So what was my complaint? 
At breakfast we got seated straight away and then were explained the menu and how the buffet worked as well as the a la carte. All good so far. Ordered drinks and got our food. About half an hour in we wanted more drinks, one tea and one coffee. We finished our pastries and waited. And waited. A good 20 minutes passed and so we have up. I spoke to our server as we left and his answer was ' it is busy'. Yes it was quite busy at 10am but not heaving. Also I noted that on another table, they were sat after we had ordered our second drinks, and got theirs within ten minutes. Was this because they were being served by a suited 'possible manager' ? I hope not. We should all get the same attention whether you pay £600 a night or £ 3000. £600 to me means as much as someone paying more for their room. 
Anyhow it was very poor. I have not marked the Corinthia down on this as overall i love this place and will come back. But I do feel this should be looked into as less lenient people will not have the same attitude. 
So all in all, amazing place. 99%",5,2018,12,09
143,Out of this world.,"What a fabulous hotel. From the welcome to checkout we were treated wonderfully. The staff really make this place and the improvement since we last visited in 2016 was noticeable. Bars, restaurants all get busy so make sure you book tables where you require them. It’s prices are on a par with other 5 stars in London but in my view it’s worth every penny. Looking forward to returning.",5,2018,12,09
143,6 star plus,"We have been to Budapest,st Petersburg,Malta, but London tops them all despite the fact that the ambience,hospitability,personnel  service are exceptional everywhere, always a step ahead of the competition",5,2018,12,09
143,Rather disappointing in many areas.,"Room was very good except that our fridge did not work but the restaurants and bars were disappointing.
We went for a shopping weekend early December. On arrival, we could not get an afternoon tea in the lounge as it was fully booked.
When We went to the bar instead we had to wait for table to become free.
The main cocktail bar was fully booked both before and after dinner had to delay dinner to get a booking in the bar.
My dinner was spoiled with an inedible side dish and  had to wait half an hour for a pot of tea with breakfast the next morning. It seems that residents arriving and expecting five star service and facilities are being treated as second class citizens with outside visitors being given preference.
I would not go back.",3,2018,12,08

Overall disappointed, food was certainly not exceptional. Staff nice enough but service not sharp.
Wouldn’t rush back.",3,2018,12,01
143,Absolutely wonderful,"We visited here after an emotional morning at Remembrance Sunday. We were greeted lovely and made to feel special and very comfortable. We only popped in for a glass of wine and ended up staying for lunch and several wines. The wine and soda I really don't know how they made such a simple drink taste so fantastic. The flavours, the closed glass and wine were utterly amazing tastes. The lunches with the accompanied bread and butter made such a lovely treat. Simple dishes of a cheese board and a ploughman looked, tasted and were served to the point we have booked our parents in for the same treat. This is one hotel I cannot wait to come back to and perhaps stay. It looked sublime with plush, decadent furnishings with staff that make you feel so special and take the time to show you to different places within the hotel and also talk to you. Thank you a day we will never forget. xx",5,2018,12,01

143,Anniversary heaven,My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights as it was our special anniversary. I have never stayed anywhere as special and unique. I didn’t want to leave to come home. From the moment we arrived it felt special. Our room was spacious and spotless. Food and service was faultless. Thank you to all the staff that made our stay fantastic.,5,2018,11,30
143,great place,"one of the best places to stay and eat and relax  in London. That was my 3rd visit .
good standards of service, very attentive staff. the bed was very comfortable and the rooms are spacious and very nicely presented",5,2018,11,25
143,Enchanting five star hotel in the best location in London ,"Seven days were beautifully spent at this exquisite hotel.  The lobby and tea area (with an impressive baccarat chandelier) were lovingly adorned with fresh roses and Christmas decorations.  The staff of the hotel were uniformly knowledgeable and warm hearted.  They made the stay magical.  Now the piece de resistance...the Michelin rated hotel restaurant, Kerridge’s.  We ate there two evenings, (one of them thanksgiving day).  Every morsel was delightful, the wine was out of this world as was each entree we consumed.  We highly recommend the duck liver parfait, the stuffed quail and venison entrees, and the brown butter tart with buttermilk ice cream!!  All accompanied with a smart bottle of Paulliac.  Make reservations if you can.  They squeezed us in both times, but we considered ourselves very lucky.  Thanks Corinthia, we will surely be back to stay!  ",5,2018,11,24
143,The perfect afternoon tea experience!,"There are no words to describe the afternoon tea experience we had at the Corinthia Hotel. The ultimate feeling of luxury and minimalism. Delicious sandwiches to start with, traditional scones to move on and finally the desserts!! Perfect to accompany an afternoon tea. The staff was extra polite and attentive. What to say about the piano music!! Exceptional place to experience the tradition of the “afternoon tea”.   ",5,2018,11,22
143,Mesmerizing,"Without a hint of doubt, one of the best hotels I've stayed. If you can afford it, you won't regret it. 
Excellent service, delightful food, great bars, cozy and tasteful rooms, convenient location and special treats.
Highly recommend!",5,2018,11,18
143,Can't wait to go back,"This hotel was amazing. Location, design, service, spa.  I have nothing but wonderful things to say and I hope to stay again!  Many restaurants and lounges to choose from. The bathroom products were really nice. Overall, fantastic hotel!",5,2018,11,12
143,The flagship of our Company,"First time I visited and stayed in this fantastic hotel.  Proud to say that this the flagship of Corinthia Hotels, the company I work with.  Having the Maltese flag in central London is an honour.  Every corner is luxurious, rooms are spacious and very clean, staff are fantastic. Breakfast is fulfilling. Enjoyed Basoon bar very much.  Fantastic stay.",5,2018,11,11
143,Breakfast ,"Overnight in Corinthia Hotel last night . This is probably our 9th annual visit to the hotel . ( run business events each year ) generally the accommodation and facilities are really good. However since the first time we organised the event( in 2011 shortly after the hotel opened ) from then and each time since the breakfast service and staff ( with attitude ) have been shambolic with a complete lack of understanding of customer service , at least 3 couples walked away this morning , waiting way too long . A pot of tea for two which after 25 mins and two reminders came with one cup , the second taking a further 5 mins to arrive . I could go on for longer but I think enough said , I’ve stayed in many hotels across the world and this has and is the most consistently poor breakfast service I’ve experienced. 
To be honest I think it’s the style of service thats the issue , maybe the F&B Director needs a second look , mind you it’s been 7 years in the panning !!",3,2018,11,10
143,ESPAciouly Good spa day,"My husband booked me the Time for Tea spa day For my birthday, which comprises full access to the spa and gym facilities, 90 minute personalised aromatherapy massage and champagne afternoon tea. On arrival I was greeted with a beautiful Espa birthday gift and lead down to the most magnificent spa I have visited to date. Plush, very cleverly lit, and every toiletry you could need is available either directly or a request from the reception desk. Private shower rooms and well stocked dressing tables are an added luxury. There is fresh fruit and water in all rooms, grand fire installations and fresh towels everywhere. The spa facilities themselves are to a very high standard and better than most I have visited. The massage was superb, as was the afternoon tea. At a £235 price tag some might think that is on the steep side but you really do get what you pay for and I cannot wait to return. Relaxation 10/10. Arrive early. It gets busier after 11:30.",5,2018,11,10
143,Fab U Lous a 10 from Craig,"One of our favourite London Hotels such a lovely property, staff are terrific and this stay more memorable by bumping into Aljaz from Strictly and had a bit of a chat. Lovely guy, my wife very impressed with him and our upgraded room. Happy days and one we keep coming back to. ",5,2018,11,09
143,As Pleasure as always,"Thank you for the service, we really happy staying here. The food was terrific.
I have recommended many friend to stay here. Everyone love the place and insist to go back.
Hope we have a chance to come back again.",5,2018,11,09
143,Amazing hotel on great location!,"Just came back from Corinthia Hotel London.
Hotel location, service, rooms, restaurant and spa are superb. Location is great , right across London eye and walking distance to all downtown attractions. Service is absolutely amazing, very courteous and professional. Rooms are specious and clean. Lobby restaurants are really specious well appointed with great breakfast and afternoon tea . Spa is gorgeous and amazing stretching on 4 levels absolutely great for an evening swim , sauna or massage.",5,2018,11,06
143,Glorious Afternoon Tea ,"What a superb hotel! My first time visiting and it won’t be my last. My daughter and her friend and I experienced a wonderful afternoon tea here. The food, service and ambience was excellent and I highly recommend a visit.  What I particularly liked was the space between tables. You felt you were not sitting alongside/almost with the other guests which at some hotels in London these days you are!  Getting as many customers in by making them sit together! 

At the corinthia this is not the case.  There is a lot of breathing space between the tables and you feel that it’s the experience that is valued to the guest rather than getting bums on seats and packing as many people in. 

Thank you Corinthia Hotel for a wonderful afternoon tea. ",5,2018,11,03
143,"Spa only review, painful and overpriced.","We only came here for the spa which was one of the best rated in all of London. It turns out that the spa experience is way way way overpriced for these facilities and service. We booked massages and use of the day spa. The locker rooms were cramped, crowded, and lacked enough showers and lockers to accommodate all guests. The “sleeping pods” were incredibly noisy as hotel staff allow people to leave luggage in those pods all day long and guests would come in and out of the sleeping pod room constantly making noise and talking full volume without being respectful of people wanting quiet. The massage was the worst massage I have ever had. My masseuse had very long fingernails and would scratch me with every stroke of her hand. I seriously had scratches all over my body and my partner said my back looked like bark from a tree afterwards. Not only was this painful but also incredibly unprofessional grooming for a masseuse. Because of her scratching I developed several cramps before the massage was even over. The bottom floor of the spa was ridiculously hot and poorly ventilated, reeking of chlorine which I guess means the pools were chlorinated which is good... except that chlorine gas is poisonous... which is bad. The downstairs area was very dark and there are a surprising amount of random steps and stepoffs, which together with poorly fitting sandals and wet floors creates hazardous tripping conditions. My partner fell getting into one of the pools and still has a banged up and bruised knee 3 days later. The mixed spa area was too crowded and had too many children running around for my comfort and was too loud to be peaceful or relaxing. The spa attendants seemed overwhelmed and understaffed and gave off the impression that they couldn’t care less about you. Since we were in Britain for a vacation we tried to be polite and not complain, to do as the British do, but now that our vacation has ended we do feel the need to warn you the TripAdvisor community. If your looking for a nice spa in London definitely look elsewhere.",1,2018,10,28
143,Lovely Afternoon Tea,"Arrived a little early but wasn’t a problem as we were was taken to seating area next to the pianist who was excellent so enjoyed some lovely music while we waited for our table. The staff were attentive and very friendly a big thank you to Larz who looked after us throughout our experience he was wonderful regularly checking and refilling our chosen teas he is a credit to the Corinthia. The roast beef sandwiches one of our favourites were lush and as you would expect  food was unlimited but you would be hard pressed to want more as servings were plentiful The pianist played throughout our sitting which gave a very relaxed ambience, would highly recommend afternoon tea at the Corinthia Hotel",4,2018,10,28
143,I really wanted to give them 5 stars but I can't,"Despite my giving them a 3 star rating, I will go back to them first because there are so many things about this hotel that are 5 stars and a few of the things that were not are fixable, but not everything.

Like the song says, let's start at the beginning.

I initially booked the Corinthia about 6 months before our arrival.  The concierge (who had some problems while we were there) was extraordinarily communicative by email with me.  They were excellent in helping me set up our tour and horseback riding at Hyde Park.  So before we even arrived, I was pleased with the service we had received.

When our taxi pulled up, the doormen who wear tails and top hats came and opened the door.  What a great start to our arrival.  Check in was simple and they walk you around showing you the hotel before taking you to your room.  Bell took care of our bags and it arrived a short time after our arrival.

At first blush, the room was lovely.  Big bed.  Big room.  Plenty of space.  When you first walk in there is a small ante room.  From there you can go to the left to the bedroom or to the right to the walk through closet with hanging and drawer space on both the left and right and through the closet to the enormous bathroom with dual sinks, stand alone bathtub, shower and toilet.   The closet also holds the safe which is large enough to hold a laptop computer.  That night, we did notice that the curtains did not shut all the way so light did shine in the following morning.

The bathroom looked fantastic but sometimes looks can be deceiving.  The bathtub looks like it will be a great bathtub but it's not.  It fills super slowly.  The bigger problem is that it is very slippery.  Also, there are no places to put your hands.  Also, the tub is actually so big that it is easy for you to slip and slide forward.  It's so big, that you can't put your hands on the top to hold you steady.  So if you try to lean back and relax, you are likely to slide forward and there's really no way to stop you until your feet hit the other end.

The rest of the hotel has a lot to offer.  It has two bars that also serve food plus a restaurant as part of the hotel and a second restaurant attached.  The hotel restaurant serves both traditional English food as well as some American staples.  For breakfast that had both french toast and american pancakes.

There is also a large room where they serve afternoon tea.  We did this once and while my wife had one of the teas, I had hot chocolate and it was decadent.  If you stay here with children, you best go to afternoon tea at least once and get them hot chocolate.

One of the main reasons I chose the Corinthia over many other 5 star hotels in London was their spa, and the spa truly is excellent.  People staying in the hotel get access to the spa facilities. While we did not use the exercise equipment, there is a full size gym.  But what made the spa so wonderful was the bottom floor (the spa goes down, not up from the mezzanine).  Steam room, sauna (which was so hot I could barely stay in it for 15 minutes) and two pools.  One standard pool and one with a series of massage jets throughout it.  We did have a problem with the waterfall jet for water to flow down onto your head and shoulders and that will need to be fixed.  They also have shower facilities and a huge bucket of ice that is constantly being refreshed if you want to take an ice bath.

So, if everything is so wonderful, why did I give them only four stars not five.  Housekeeping.  As with most English hotel rooms, the Corinthia uses a bottom sheet and then a duvet cover as the blanket, no top sheet.  My wife cannot sleep without a top sheet between her and the blanket.  So no problem, call down and get one which I did.  Housekeeping comes up and brings me the sheet and we go to sleep.  

Next morning we leave and come back later and the bed is made but the window is left open.  That should have been a clue that there were problems with housekeeping.  That night when we went to go to bed, we realized there was again no top sheet.  So again we had to call down and get one.   We spoke to a manager/supervisor and it was noted that we wanted a top sheet.

Unfortunately, it was not to be.  Each day housekeeping took the top sheet back and we had to ask for it each day.  The straw that broke the camels back was our last night.  After calling down for a hotel supervisor because speaking to housekeeping was useless, two people from housekeeping show up.  WITHOUT THE TOP SHEET asking what the problem was.  We tell them to go away and bring the top sheet back in 30 minutes after we have left.  We never get a phone call back from the hotel supervisor despite asking for one.  And instead of 30 minutes, housekeeping came back in 15.  To make matters worse, the day before, my wife had spoken to management because a housekeeping supervisor had come to our room to ARGUE WITH US AS TO WHY WE DIDN'T NEED A TOP SHEET.

The only other issue we had was the people above us on the 7th floor kept making noise and the hotel was unable to figure out what was going on and quiet them. At times it sounded like furniture was being moved and other times like people were sumo wrestling.  It was very annoying especially since it happened at all hours.  Sometimes at 5 in the morning and sometimes at 3 in the afternoon or 11 in the evening.

So you can imagine what type of bad taste this left in our mouth.  In fairness to the Corinthia, they did their best to make it up to us but unfortunately the room had been prepaid and we were leaving the following morning.  But because everything else was so good, I am willing to give them another chance.",3,2018,10,26
143,Beautifully British!,"Had a superb night's stay at the weekend - just what was needed in the busy world we all live in. From start to finish the staff could not have been more accommodating and nothing was any trouble. Although we had an early arrival, due to booking a matinee performance of 42nd Street, our room was ready and we were settled in very quickly. Considering we were in the middle of central London, there was no noise and the room was perfect. Perfect position to wander the sights of London and we look forward to returning in the near future.",5,2018,10,22
143,"Very good, not quite great","I like the Corinthia. I use it quite a lot. It is a very upmarket hotel with lots of offer. I always find the service amazing and should particularly compliment the concierge desk  whom are super helpful. The smallest rooms are pretty small, so it’s worth asking for a room upgrade, for which reception is often obliging. The rooms are beautifully finished, if slightly old fashioned for my taste. Beds and pillows are super comfortable. I only really have three gripes; 1) the rooms are perennially hot and stuffy and the air con doesn’t work well (on a recent visit I had to open large sash windows which then made the room very draughty), 2) there is a lot of marble flooring in the bathroom area leading to the bedroom area which can get very slippery and a touch dangerous and 3) so sad that Massimo disappeared, which was a fantastic Italian Restaurant rendezvous. Overall, very good... but not quite great. ",4,2018,10,21
143,Superb hotel,Had my daughters wedding here and had a fantastic stay here as well. Beautiful building and service to match. Have been back on many occasions for tea in the foyer and it really is a lovely experience. Just love the place.,5,2018,10,19
143,Our home away from home,"I can't believe it's taken me this long to write a review for this amazing hotel. We are a family with 3 kids (11, 9 & 4) and we have been visiting every Christmas for the 6 years. A long weekend to enjoy the festive period. The location is fabulous, with the tube opposite. The service, food, hospitality is first class. Rooms are spacious and kept in pristine condition. The breakfast is always something we all look forward to. If you can treat yourself I would highly recommend this hotel. My only disappointment is that I have still not used the Spa!!",5,2018,10,19
143,Excellent,"The best stay i ever had in a Hotel so far. The room generously and comfortable, the bed pure Heaven, a spacious Bad-room, no noise from the corridor, excellent service.
My only disappointment was the First Flush Darjeeling served with the leaves in the Pot, like the English Tradition, so it got way too strong and bitter. The waitress apologised,she just didn't know...next Time...",5,2018,10,16
143,"Great location, amazing Spa, 5 star hotel, very expensive",If you're looking for a high end hotel in London and cost is of tertiary importance then the Corinthia is for you. The Spa and Thermal floor is excellent. Fun for families and kids (note: there are some adults only hours). The restaurant for breakfast is good though can be a little slow when busy. The rooms are excellent and the location is superb for tourists wanting to go sightseeing. All the main City of London attractions are within walking distance.,5,2018,10,15
143,Just ok,"I have been staying at the Corinthia regularly for the last 6 years, so I clearly like it. But I was surprised that despite my loyalty, I got a very poor room and had to complain to the manager. I was checking in during the early evening, so I would have thought a reasonable room would have been set aside. I travel alot and the customer loyalty treatment is better in every other instance.
I also think the rooms are looking a bit tired and in need of freshening up.
The Spa remains a first class treat.",4,2018,10,15
143,Afternoon tea,"7 of us came here for afternoon tea.beautiful setting , service slow and relaxed, no rush, food amazing and plentiful. Expensive but worth every penny. Management apologised for slow service but we enjoyed it and thought it was great that we weren't rushed. Would definitely recommend",5,2018,10,09
143,Beautiful Hotel with friendly staff.,"Just back from 5 days at the Corinthia.  This hotel is perfect, the rooms are spacious and beautifully decorated, the lobby and restaurants also lovely and the spa is not to be believed.  My favorite thing about the Corinthia is the staff.  They are kind, friendly and go out of their way to help you.  Especially Guillaume Le Gal, the concierge, he knows everything there is to know about London and he is so helpful he made sure we had a perfect visit.  Thank you Corinthia!",5,2018,10,09
143,Fantastic ,"I stayed for three nights. Had a couple of little hiccups but the night duty manager and director of rooms were fantastic. All hotels have hiccups and it's how they are dealt with that sets aside the good ones. This is a truly fabulous hotel on every level. 

The breakfast in Northall has come on leaps and bounds and is now world class. I found checking in to be fine personally but I try never to be in a hurry anyhow. 

The rooms are spacious and quiet. The bathrooms luxurious and the beds comfortable. 

This is my must stay hotel when I am in London. ",5,2018,10,09
143,"Generally five star, but some blips.","I stayed at the Corinthia for a conference. I generally found the hotel delivered the five star experience. My room was a decent size, well maintained and nicely furnished. There was no obvious area to work, so I ended up sitting with my laptop on my knee, but I guess most people are there to see the sights. The room was quiet (despite being in central London) and I slept well in the bed.
I had a meal in the Northall Restaurant and a drink at the bar. Both of these were excellent. The service was very good - speedy and attentive without being intrusive - so five stars here. I would also say, although I'm from London so I wasn't sightseeing, the location is excellent.
The blips came in administration. Check in was very slow. Although there was no queue, it took at least five minutes to get my room key. Some problem with the computer, apparently. I then found that I'd left my credit card at home (my bad), but the hotel had a system for taking remote payment. I was asked to fill out a form (emailed to me when it would have been better to give me a printed copy) and to upload pictures of my card and another ID to a secure website. This I did, and although it was a bit clunky, I was grateful to be given a way out of a difficulty of my own making. When I checked out, I double checked they had the right card on my account and reception said that they would email my invoice. No invoice arrived, but I got a survey to fill out. I filled out the survey, commenting on the lack of invoice, and the manager emailed me to say that my invoice would arrive shortly. Reception then emailed me the invoice of another guest with a similar name. I replied immediately, waited a couple of days but got nothing back. I contacted the manager direct, and then I got the correct invoice.
So, in conclusion, nice hotel. I couldn't call it value for money, but then if you stay here you're not worried about that. The real let down were simple mistakes in administration, which might be understandable elsewhere ... but not here.",4,2018,10,08
143,Excellent hotel,"I’ve been there with friends. The cocktails are really good. They have good selection on whisky and the service is outstanding. I would like to mention Martina, who was looking after us. They have live music and the atmosphere around the hotel is very relaxing. Definitely we will come back soon.",5,2018,10,04
143,It is a fabulous hotel!!,"The decoration, marble and modern chandeliers, it's just fabulous!
It is a combination of modern and classic at the perfect location. Walking distance from the London Eye, Big Ben, London Bridge, Trafalgar Square. Location can't be better. Great to come back in the afternoon and make it to tea time in the lobby. The service was absolutely amazing. The rooms are fantastic, the best bed ever! towel warmers, tv in the bathtub, just great! This hotel made me want to stay in my room more than I usually do when traveling. Lovely experience.
",5,2018,10,02
143,A must visit,"Amazing rooms would be an understatement. Luxurious, attention to every detail and world class staff. An excellent food selection, best high tea with a bar worth visiting. Family friendly without an impact on those here for business. Good gym facility. SPA a must even if not staying in the hotel. ",5,2018,10,01
143,Excellent,"Excellent hotel. Service, location, food, wine, cognac, conference facilities- everything was great.

The rooms are luxurious as you would expect. So is the washroom.

Service is so good that sometimes you feel that you in a dream.

Location is perfect. Next to 10 Downing Street, Whitehall, New Scotland Yard. A Starbucks is right next door. And if you fancy running outside you can run on the Embankment.

",5,2018,09,27
143,The “it” Place,"I just spent an absolutely fabulous weekend at the Corinthia Hotel London.
The Hotel is stunningly decorated in white marble and iridescent modern chandeliers who will leave you gaping.
This mixture of modern and old classic London is a winning combination, a detour  from the old style properties and the very modern soulless ones.
Afternoon tea in the lobby is sophisticated and easygoing at the same time.
I came to London to attend a costume party with some of my dearest friends.
The concierge hooked us up with a fun makeup artist, we spent a whole evening getting made up while sipping Veuve Clicqout in my beautiful room. 
The service was absolutely impeccable all around the hotel.
My room, an executive one, was lovely and quite  with fabulous bed linen and the trademark marble bathtub with the tv screen..

We had the pleasure to experience Tom Kerridge newly opened restaurant, I must say it was a treat..
The restaurant has been newly renovated and you could definitely feel the energy of the staff. 
The food was exquisite and the atmosphere was amazing.
I can’t wait to come back for more.
",5,2018,09,26
143,Tom Kerrdige's Bar & Grill - an absolute foodie treat,"We were having a meeting at the Corinthia hotel, then realised that TK had just opened his new venture a few days previously.

The food centres around two or three items with tremendous flavours without being overly fussy. Soem dishes come with a signature carrot which tastes like no other carrot any of us had ever tasted.  Luckily Chef indulged us with a round of carrots so we could all try one.

Friendly staff, very attentive and well informed, even better they were good fun.",5,2018,09,23
143,Wonderful hotel.  Lovely spa,"Full disclosure.   We had a fabulous suite which was huge, luxurious and comfortable.   The hotel is lovely.  Modern but without losing its elegance. Location is fabulous. Walking distance to three stops. 
The hotel staff were all very helpful and friendly from the concierge to housekeeping.  
The spa is pretty amazing.  I did not have any treatments but the facility is probably the nicest spa I have gone to 
My visit was too short.   Hope to go back",5,2018,09,20
143,Luxurious,"One of the best hotels i have ever stayed, i really enjoyed my junior suit, very comfortable and elegant room, the breakfast was exceptional with many chouces however i was surprised that they dont serve oatmeal which is a standart option for buffet breakfast. I really liked a chocolate cookie i found i my room, i would like to buy same cookies for myself but i never found any similar :(",5,2018,09,20
143,The best hotel experience of our lives.,"I am certainly not great at writing but will do my best to share my experience.  The beauty of this hotel is not easily expressed in words.  Gorgeous, luxurious, incredibly well thought out.  Did I say gorgeous!?  The service that we experienced is unlike any other European luxury hotel we visited in the past 10 days.  The front desk, room service, housekeeping and the turn down service... They don't miss anything.  I consider myself to be extremely critical and could not find anything about the room that wasn't absolutely perfect.  World Class.  It was difficult going home.  In addition... check out took no more than thirty seconds, huge smiles and deep appreciation for our business.",5,2018,09,18
143,Class act in Central London,"The Corinthia is located in a grand building in the very heart of London, close to the Strand and Trafalgar Square, and yet it manages to be serene, even quiet. I was truly impressed by how it strives to maintain a personal, warm touch despite being such a large hotel. 
Everything during our stay was impeccable, and not because everything was perfect (we had an issue with the air conditioner at first, for instance), but rather because when it was not, it was taken care of immediately and with great elegance. Every member of the staff was solicitous and kind, and every detail was thoughtful. To give you an example, the turndown service left a special treat on the pillow, every night different, always interesting. One night it was a pouch of lavender, and another, a spray with an aromatic essence to help your sleep. 
You’ll hear that the better rooms are on higher floors but, after being shown two or three, I actually chose one on the second floor, facing Whitehall. It was perfectly quiet. I wouldn’t choose a room facing Northumberland Avenue, however, because it might be noisy. There are high-floor rooms with a view of the Thames, but they are more expensive, The view is not direct, and I didn’t feel the need for the upgrade.
The gym is excellent, with small separate chambers for those who want to practice yoga out of sight or use special equipment. There are also a spa and a pool area, although I did not use them. Restaurant in room service are good and reliable. So is breakfast.
Even though I don’t usually stay in that area when I’m in London, I would consider going out of my way to stay at the Corinthia again. It is an excellent hotel.",5,2018,09,18
143,Luxury Hotel Experience with Excellent Customer Service,"When we visit London, we only stay here. This is by far the best hotel stays we've ever had. When you walk towards the hotel, you see luxury in every detail. The street is lined with some of the most expensive cars you could ever find. Lamborghini, Maserati, Rolls Royce, Bentley...you name it, we've seen it parked here. When you walk into the hotel, the luxury continues with their detailed decor and style. There is a large table that is beautifully decorated with fresh floral arrangements in vases. To the right is hotel check in, the left is the concierge. Both with a desk of people waiting to help. If you walk straight into the hotel and go up the stairs, you can go to the restaurants or sit down and have a drink beneath a large, gorgeous round chandelier. It's a wonderful experience just to walk in and see the hotel.

What makes the Corinthia great isn't the views or even location, it's the staff. They are so friendly and helpful, everyone is eager to direct you and wish you the best day. Having my daughter in a large, American stroller made it hard to get around at times...and through the small European doorways. There was always someone to help open the doors, hold the elevators, offer directions, and hail us a cab. The hotel is located in Central London; steps from Big Ben and the Houses or Parliament, Westminster Abbey, the Thames River, London Eye, Cleopatra's Needle, Trafalgar Square, National Gallery, etc. Its a great location to see some of London's most famous attractions on foot or short cab ride. There is also an Underground stop just across the street from the hotel (we never used the subway system though).

The spa is incredible and voted as one of the best spas in all of London. It was hard for us to use as they have limited pool hours for children. Our hotel room was beautiful and had nice city views. It had a comfortable king size bed with a crib for my daughter. The crib also came with a Burt's Bees bath set and little stuffed animal for her. The bathroom was huge and had the most amazing rain shower head. The room was cleaned in the afternoon, looking as perfect as when we first checked in each day. In the evening, we found the turn down service was lovely. They would have slippers on each side of the bed for us with a chocolate on our pillow, or lavender scent bags/spray to help calm us for bed. We've stayed her twice and have enjoyed our stay both times. We can't wait to go back!",5,2018,09,17
143,Five star Corinthia Hotel delivers the dream,"Over the fifty odd years visiting London we've enjoyed all the London five-star Hotels many many times but this was our first stay at the Corinthia. How we missed it I'll never know. We were booked in for two nights arriving midafternoon midweek. A happy "" lovely to see you""  concierge had our cab door open and our bags moved before we could even pay the cabbie and he had them in our room waiting for us. This was a full-on star welcome that even though we are an elderly retired couple, made us feel as though we were valued, exciting customers. The royal treatment didn't stop there for it was the smoothest registering in we've ever experienced.  We were shown to our rooms by a young lady called Zabina Futo from guest relations who really enthused about the hotel giving us a detailed tour of the facilities. This Hotel has something glowing about it that you can't quite label but its probably a sense of being a part of a culture built on pride in providing nothing but the very best for their guests. Every detail that could lead to a better experience was explained with a gifted eloquence. We really did feel that this was not only different from other hotels but that it was fuelled by genuine pride. Each and every one of this staff team really does want you to have a great experience and that that's exactly what we had. We were also intrigued by the description of the Spa pool which when we ventured down in a separate lift near our room delivered in abundance. This is the best spa I have ever experienced. There is much more going on in this hotel than just accommodation and dining and I believe it is at the forefront of a new style of hotel service valued by experienced customers who will always return for such wonderful facilities and service. Congratulations to the Managing Director Mr. Thomas Kochs as his amazing leadership style drizzles care and charisma like addictive honey throughout this amazing hotel. We just can't wait to find an excuse to go back.",5,2018,09,15
143,Beautiful hotel with quality food ,"Back after 5 years and had another very comfortable stay.  On check in I was upgraded to an executive room which faced the inner courtyard garden. This was an unexpected bonus! 

Would highly recommend the breakfast spread in the North Hall. Everything was of quality and the service was attentive but not intrusive. I could see that some of the servers had built up a good rapport with the longer staying guests.

As this was a work trip I had several rounds of in-room dining and can recommend the cold mezzo and club sandwich for evening meals that aren’t to heavy.  The courtyard garden is also a relaxing space for a light lunch. 

The concierge desk can helpfully recommend restaurants and other activities nearby for the time pressed (thank you to Guillaume Le Gal).

143,"Luxurious hotel with friendly, professional and helpful staff.","I decided to take my partner here for her 40th birthday weekend. The experience from start to finish was wonderful and we would not hesitate to return. Our room was extremelt well equipped and comfortable, and shortly after arrival we received a complementary bottle of champagne and a birthday brownie which was a very lovely gesture. The room was very comfortable with a separate bath and waterfall shower. The hotel bar was very good with live music on the Saturday evening. I had also booked treatments at the spa for my partner on the Sunday morning whilst I had a wet shave in the salon there. 

All in all a great experience that I would highly recommend to anyone.",5,2018,09,06
143,Our fab stay.,"Really lovely stay last week. Food so tasty, staff cannot do enough, spa fabulous, bed, O so comfy, in fact my daughter travels the world and the Corinthia is her very favourite hotel and will not stay anywhere else in London. She books up as soon as she knows she is visiting London otherwise you cannot get a room. it is even so handy for everywhere and plenty of public transport very near to see the sights. 
Many thanks everybody for another fab stay, kind regards Anne Russell.",5,2018,09,04
143,Beautiful!!,"We stayed here for the last leg of our two week visit to England and Scotland and it was the perfect choice. Sincerely, this is the most comfortable, luxurious room I’ve experienced anywhere in the world. Expensive - true, but worth every cent for a special occasion.",5,2018,09,01
143,Best Anniversary Stay!,Everything about our return visit to the Corinthia was 1st class. We received a warm welcome on arrival and upgraded to an executive room! We were celebrating our 10th Year wedding Anniversary and there was a nice cake waiting for us as we entered. Breakfast in the Northall is always a delight and the staff throughout were so warm and courteous. The Corinthia is the best hotel in London in our opinion and have pretty much stayed in most of what Mayfair has to offer. Thanks Corinthia ,5,2018,08,27
143,Beautiful hotel with exceptional staff,"What a beautiful hotel with every need and want met. 
We had an extremely warm welcome and felt truly special from the moment we arrived . We started with a beautiful afternoon tea which had one of the best sandwiches we have ever had, egg and truffle oil ...... The floor manager Nigel was a superb host and a delight to speak to and it was a lovely unhurried afternoon tea which us for the hungry. We had a few cocktails in the Basoon bar which was fun and lively with good cocktails too, our suite was totally amazing and a real treat it was a real Oasis of calm from the hustle of the city . A nice touch to have access to the beautiful Spa which we spent many an hour in. Thanks Corinthia you made our weekend special ",5,2018,08,26
143,"Fantastic location, excellent staff, Nice room and a magnificent spa","For what we like to do , West end shows, Westminster attractions and being across the street from the underground makes this a great location. The hotel exudes class without feeling stuffy. And the spa is the best I have ever seen for a hotel. If I lived in London I would be strongly tempted to be a member. The room had high ceilings and was well insulated from street noise. Highest recommendation",5,2018,08,25
143,Pure Luxury,"This is one of the finest hotels in London, and occupies a fantastic position, close to St James Park, The Palaces, Trafalgar square and theatre land. 
The scent as you enter the hotel is instantly relaxing, the atmosphere is serene, and the staff are professional, helpful and polite. 
The style of the hotel is pure Elegance, from the silver and black pool and spa area, to the muted cream lounge areas.
The room was perfect, and the bathroom spacious with every amenity you could need. The ESPA bath salts are divine.
The bedroom has all the facilities needed, my only request would be for some complimentary biscuits for the tea and coffee.
Turndown service was a nice touch, with scented pillow sprays and delicious chocolate.
We enjoyed a sumptuous breakfast, there is a magnificent selection to choose from.
The bar serves some lovely cocktails that are a little different from the norm, very modern and fresh.
We often mix business and pleasure in London and this hotel is high up on our list.",5,2018,08,24
143,Wonderful Hotel and Staff!,"My husband and I chose to stay at Corinthia for the first part of our London trip -- what a wonderful experience! The hotel is an easy walk to many points of interest, room is well-appointed and the thermal floor is luxurious! Service was impeccable too.  For the second part of our London trip, we stayed at The Langham Hotel....we missed the Corinthia experience!",5,2018,08,23
143,Gorgeous ! ,"This was one of our first trip with my partner, and we felt in love with the Corinthia. We had the chance to upgraded to a Suite and it’s beautiful Italian white marble bathroom.
The room was amazing, the service too, you really feel the service (they come 3-4 times a day, to open curtain, place slippers next to bed etc..)
We had an issue with the Bluetooth sound-system and a technician came in about 10min and solved the situation quickly.
The tea time was amazing placed under the Baccara Chandelier, you have the impression being royal! 
At the end of our 2 nights stay we got this amazing surprise to see David Beckham, we have not dared to talk to him as he was surrounded for work, but wow, you really feel being in a prestigious hotel ! 
Concierge service booked us a great table at the shard restaurant (Aqua).
Not speaking of the Spa, the best of London, so intimate, relaxing, and modern, just go for it, this is an amazing property, maybe THE hotel that represents the best London. (perfectly located!)
Just go for it and experience ;)",5,2018,08,23
143,Absolutely Wonderful Experience!,"My husband and I stayed here with our two teenage boys before flying out of London. These people were amazing! Our room wasn’t quite ready so they gave us another room in which to freshen up before we checked in. Upon getting into our room, we were thrilled to see how large, comfortable and elegant the room was. Not a detail was missed. We were greeted by a bottle of Champagne and chocolate cake as we were celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary. It was delicious and such a wonderful way to start our short visit in London. The bathroom had the nicest shower we’d encountered the entire trip and again, very spacious with good lighting and amenities. We had an excellent lunch experience there. The service was impeccable and the food was delicious. The hotel is well situated for walking to many things which was convenient. Everyone was friendly and really helpful throughout our stay. My husband and I agreed, it was our best stay abroad. We’ll definitely be back, these people understand five star service! So thankful we found Corinthia Hotel!",5,2018,08,21
143,High Tea at the Corinthia a Must,It was my first time in London and friends said that high tea at the Corinthia was a must-do.  They were right!  The gorgeous hotel produced a memorable experience.  The best parts (everyone was great) included the scones and the vanilla tea.  Will go every time I visit London.  I even got the red teacup!,5,2018,08,21
143,Lovely Hotel shame about the room smoke...,"I booked a Junior Suite at this hotel at a price of £810.90 for 1 night for my birthday. We arrived early as wanted todo some shopping in London, checked in and put our bags into hold as the room was not ready yet said we would be back around 2ish. Came back at 2pm room was still not ready to be fair checkin stated was 3pm, waitied around then sat in the lobby. Guy came over at 3:20pm and said he will now take us to our room. i was staying in room 226 (2nd floor) on Aug 18th. We walked a few feet from the lift and he opned the door, as soon as we walked into the room there was a drastic change in smell, the guy seemed embarrsed after waiting around for over an hour we just wanted to get into the room.

He left and both me and my wife said at the same time it smells of smoke. The room smelt like an old London pub like everything had been sat in a smoking room for a few days, that musky nicotine smell you just cant get rid of. Instantly we opened the balcony doors and turned the fan/aircon to make to try and make it go away.

Hugley disapointed after paying over £800 for 1 night in this room to be presented with this.

We arent really a moaning couple so decided that maybe with the doors open the smell would go+aircon. Decided to get ready for a birthday dinner out. After coming back the smell was slightly better but it was late and just wanted to go to bed.

In the morning we both woke up with sore throats, and our new clothes which had been hanging in the room smelt of smoke.

It seems that either people smoke in this room due to the balcony or being on the 2nd floor the smoke from the courtyard goes into the room (maybe the aircon sucks it in or something)

Another gripe was being so close to the lift shaft you could hear the lifts going up and down all night long....Again not something i would expect to be placed next to for £800/night in a 5 star hotel.

I travel allot so have a good view of what a decent 5 star £1k/night should be - Sadly this wasnt it.",3,2018,08,20
143,A night stay full of fun :),"Nearest train station will be embankment which is a district line service just a 2mins walk from the station, upon entering the facility we were greeted by a server from there restaurant cos my friends who came and picked me up in the outside area was confused where the lift are so he helped us with a warm greeting and smile :), we managed to find our room.  Finding the room grand, we tried using there facilities such as the espa (indoor swimming pool, sleepingpod, sauna, steam room,jacuzzi)and the northhall restaurant during our breakfast...we also acquired there room service which was really nice it came with a table and a hot plate so that the food can be still hot.we tried the rib eye steak which was lush, there fried squid, and many more. Inside the room that our friends booked it came with a bathtub, refrigirator, coffee machine which i love as im a coffee lover :), plus the rain shower was amazing...over all experinece on thia 5 star hotel was just amazing..truly is a 5 star hotel, well as for me this is yet the best hotel ive ever stayed in :)",5,2018,08,19
143,Very pleasant hotel,"I want to stay at this hotel again. This hotel has a nice look, beautiful lobby, fancy room, gentle and hearty service.Especially afternoon tea was the best. We were able to receive special arrangements and the best service.
このホテルにまた泊まりたいです。
素敵な外観、美しいロビー、お洒落な部屋、そして、心のこもった優しいサービスがありました。
特に、アフタヌーンティが最高で、特別なアレンジや最高のサービスを受けることが出来ました。もちろん、美味しかったです。",5,2018,08,19
143,Terrific Atmosphere!,"Had a meeting here and stayed for a drink at the bar after. It was a warm summer evening and the staff went out of their way to make us feel special. They took photos for us, explained a little about the hotel and the drinks were wonderful! The hotel itself i stunning with many restaurants on site, fresh flowers, gigantic and impressive chandeliers and an outdoor garden space (where we had our drinks) which makes you forget that you're in central London. Will return for afternoon tea here soon!",5,2018,08,18
143,Just find Yannick!,"We traveled to London for business and pleasure.  Our business commitments took us to the Corinthia Hotel.  It appears to be designed for catering to business travelers.  Our room, an executive suite, was well appointed with all the essential features.  The common spaces ( lobby, lounge, dining spaces, etc.) were elegant.  The location was convenient, not far from Trafalgar Square.  

By far, the most special experience of the hotel was getting to meet Yannick Rousseau.  Yannick was a member of the concierge team at the Corinthia.  I got to know him over the phone when I was making our dining plans.  Not only was Yannick knowledgeable and resourceful, he was an absolute pleasure to work with.  From the moment my wife and I arrived, we felt like we had a true friend in London who did everything possible to make our visit perfect.  We recommend the Corinthia as a fine hotel but if you truly want to take advantage of what it has to offer, be sure to find Yannick.  I am confident that you will appreciate my recommendation.",5,2018,08,18
143,Wonderful afternoon tea!,"My daughter and I had booked afternoon tea here and had a terrific time! From the moment we arrived, we were treated with warmth and graciousness. The staff was very welcoming and sat us at a lovely table where we could see the full room and stunning chandelier. We had just flown into London so were both tired and excited and the tea was the perfect way to spend the afternoon. The staff explained the menu and we first enjoyed a lovely assortment of sandwiches - both veg and meat. We were offered seconds which we gladly took! We then had a box tray of delicious scones and my daughter loved her first taste of clotted cream. Next were beautiful and tasty desserts. The tea was also excellent. The staff were attentive and helpful throughout, there when we needed something but not overbearing at all. We stayed for about two hours, and left full, warm, relaxed and happy! We loved the food, the service and the hotel. We look forward to returning and highly recommend!",5,2018,08,15
143,Didn't Get to Stay but,Wow - what a stunning hotel.  We took tea in the lounge area while a wonderful pianist played and then moved on to their spectacular restaurant for perfect service and food (everything was delicious - but don't over order as the homemade bread and butter will fill you up!)  ,5,2018,08,13
143,Very Disappointing Service at Afternoon Tea and Bassoon Bar.,"Had 2 bookings one for afternoon tea and at the Bassoon bar. The service at afternoon tea was frankly atrocious when we got there the man in a checked suit looked unsure if we had a booking even though we had one. We were seated and no one came to us for about 35 mins. The bald guy who gave us the menus was also extremely unfriendly barely cracking a smile at us. A couple who came after us were served before us and seated in better seats. We then asked if we could move to the sofa despite no one being there they said no as they had a booking but no one came there in the end. I then had to approach someone for us to be served. Most of the staff never really smiled apart from the young polish woman who to be fair was lovely. The service in my opinion was not 5 star there was a lack of warmth. The food was generally good but I would certainly not recommend or go there again. 

We then went to the bar again initially the manager was friendly but we on numerous occasions had to get the bar attendants attention. On one occasion they were just chatting away despite us looking at them for service. I have to say this was again very disappointing. 

Afterwards we went to the savoy to the bar there and the level of service there compared to the Corinthia was night and day. The Savoy employees were smiling and always willing to accommodate us they provided us with fabulous seats at the bar despite us not having a booking and would come around us regularly checking up on us. They had genuine warmth whereas the employees at the Cornithia didn't i'm sorry to say.",1,2018,08,12
143,Tea Time ,I went to tea at the Corinthia lobby yesterday with a few friends and the experience was exceptional. The food and service is top notch and the portions are very generous. Highly suggest others attend the afternoon tea.,5,2018,08,12
143,Disappointing,We had afternoon tea on a Sunday. It was poor. The start was underwhelming when we along with 2 or 3 other groups stood waiting for some staff to come. In the end I went on into the dining area to find someone and say we had a table booked. The food was ok but for the price quite ridiculous. Service continued to be indifferent. There are very much better afternoon teas in London.,2,2018,08,08
143,One of My Favorite Hotels in London / Anywhere,"What amazing attention to detail this hotel has. True care for each and every detail and a real warmth in terms of service. This is not only one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in but also one of those places that I think gets better and better with age.  
The SPA is wonderful and a massive treat - a real oasis of calm in the city. It is a wonderful location and we will be back again and again and again I hope.",5,2018,08,07
143,Top notch hotel!,"Beautiful lobby, luxurious rooms, impeccable service and amazing spa! Concierge was really helpful. The hotel is nicely located for travel to some of the best sights to see in London. You won't be disappointed!",5,2018,08,06
143,Superb service again and again,"We like to stay here when in London, the service is always very good and the concierge have always managed to fulfill our demands.
We have sometimes come with our young children and they love it also. The spa is  fantastic and children's swimming times are very helpful as you don't feel you have to keep trying to keep them quiet!
Breakfast is always very good and never found it too busy.",5,2018,08,06
143,Absolutely first class hotel,"The rooms in this luxury hotel are just wonderful---the beds, the bathroom, the dressing room are so luxurious, you feel great walking in. The breakfasts are the best of any hotel we have stayed at. Everything is first rate, although the lighting in the room is quite complicated. Concierges are all very helpful. Staff is wonderful. It's a great hotel.",5,2018,08,05
143,Best Concierge Help for London,"The hotel is beautiful and frankly more lavish than we needed. But the location was great- very convenient to the tube and short walk to Westminster Abbey and Big Ben/Parliament.  The best part was the concierge team was incredibly helpful. It wasn't just 1 person who was great- the entire team worked together the help each other out for the guests' needs.  When I was talking with 1 concierge, another would overhear the conversation and offer another suggestion or coupon for a discount at a museum.  They would ask how our day was and look for feedback too so they could help future guests.  Everything about the stay was great.",5,2018,08,05
143,Beautiful hotel for our girls weekend in London ,"Beautiful rooms in a great location. The spa is incredible. At least do the pools even if you don’t book a service. 

Lobby is nice for a drink and/or tea. Concierge was helpful, but some of them were more helpful than others. We had all of our restaurant reservations booked by hotel concierge. 

Location was really convenient for walking everywhere, riding underground, or uber/London taxi. We took heathrow express train to paddington from airport which was fast and easy. 

Loved it and will definitely return!!",5,2018,08,04
143,Perfect for a family lunch,"As always in tourist spots, very hard to find a place for quality lunch that isn’t a rip off. Top hotels are usually a safe bet and the Carinthia did not disappoint. Solid menu and wine list (we had 10 out of 10 sole) and also a very good children’s menu with all the favorites. Top service and all in very good value for the money.",5,2018,08,04
143,A lovely stay - but service has dropped a bit. Summer holiday teething problems?,"Stayed at the Corinthia as a treat after a work summer party. Lovely as always, and the rooms were beautiful and we were very lucky to have an upgrade. I am a huge fan of the Corinthia and their team usually deliver time and time again in terms of attentive and friendly service. I hate downgrading this review but this time they did however seem to be struggling - both when we visited the Basoon Bar at 10.30pm (once our drinks had been delivered, the team seemed more interested in getting the glasses cleaned for the next day and forgot to provide any olives, even after being asked, and then we and others had to chase for the bill).  With breakfast service in the morning, the quality of the breakfast buffet remains wonderful and first class but it seemed the busiest I had ever seen it, and this was causing problems in terms of speed of service, keeping things restocked (whether fruit, glasses or juice) and remembering orders. We weren't in that much of a rush but you could see that others were getting annoyed. Perhaps a problem due to volume of guests due to the summer holidays or just a coordination problem that day, but worth noting.",4,2018,08,03
143,Brunch Buffet,"Went here for Brunch, a truly amazing experience. The endless buffet of exotic fruits, cheeses, meats and everything else you would expect.  Service was top notch, and taken seriously (unlike what is found in the US).  
Highly recommend that you check it out. The building architecture is beautiful too",5,2018,08,01
143,Afternoon Tea of Dreams ,"I'd booked afternoon Tea here for a treat for myself & my mum on a recent girls trip to London. From the minute we turned the corner to enter the hotel until the minute we walked out of the doors we were so impressed. It was pure luxury! We had afternoon tea in the Crystal Moon Lounge, with a grand piano playing in the background. The waitresses were professional and made us feel were welcome and nothing was ever too much bother. They looked after us so well. The food itself was delightful, great selection of sweet and savoury, and the added bonus of the sweet trolley just made the whole experience even more memorable. Although it was expensive, it was well worth the service and food that was offered. Highly reccomend!! ",5,2018,08,01
143,Efficiently and nicely in the best location!,"The summer of 2018 will go down as one of the hottest ever. And London's been boiling most of it. That's one of the things I admire with all those men in uniform helping you out in a wink without even the tiniest sweatdrop on the forehead. A couple of them you'll find in-and outside The Corinthia as well as sharp-dressed women as well, all there to help you. This is such a lovely hotel in every way: the marble, the flowers, the staff, the interior, the bar, the restaurant - if I forget to mention anything, you can be sure it's top notch. It's a hotel with many rooms, but it still feels quite cosy in an upgraded way. I love the short distance to the National Portrait Gallery at Trafalgar Square as well as the sight of the London Eye. It's easy to go anywhere in London from here with any convenient transportation. I'll for sure get back here next time in London!",5,2018,07,31
143,great biz hotel,room was clean and well appointed.  the hotel is lovely but HUGE. the front bar is super and the staff are amazing - Omar was a gem.  the breakfast was ample and well served and displayed.  middle bar is quite big.  feel this is a super biz hotel and would return  but not on holiday.  spa is huge and well done.... feel it was just a bit massive for my tastes. staff and service were super.,4,2018,07,30
143,Stunning,"Went to the corinthia on Saturday 28th July at 7pm for the pre/Post theatre special. £32 for three courses and glass of champagne. I was blown away.
Upon entering it was clear we were going to be impressed. The place is beautiful, spotlessly clean, and very spacious so you dint feel your eating on the table next to you.
The staff member who greeted us, was a lovely young man with a really nice persona and fab smile. He really made us feel like we belonged there.
We were taken to our table where our seats were pulled out for us. Our menu bought to us by the young chap who explained what we had the choice of, and he went away to bring our champagne.
This was poured and we were left to choose our meal.
There was no pressure to order straight away to hurry us out, nice and relaxed we chose and as if by magic along came the young man to take our order.
As our starter came out we were greeted by another couple of young men who simultaneously placed our food down in synchronisation. Same with the main and pudding.
We were never rushed along,
 never made to feel like we didn't belong or treated any different to the folks who were staying there overnight.
We followed our meal with a visit to the bassoon bar for a cocktail to round off our friends big birthday in style and again were treated like royalty. The cocktails are amazing and I can fully recommend going in there. 
I can honestly say if your doing the cheaper menu like we did, you are treated just the same as the millionaires sat on the table next to you.
The staff here are so lovely, the food amazing and the place very impressive.
I shall definitely be returning when I go to London next, even if its just for a drink in one of the bars. ",5,2018,07,30
143,Five Star Service!,"This was a special birthday treat for two nights. The staff are impeccably trained to give 5 star service and the foyer and reception areas of this hotel were stunningly beautiful. Breakfast is expensive at £35 a head but then it is a 5 star hotel and the buffet and breakfast menu are extensive and superb. Can’t fault it. So why has it dropped one point? Firstly, the receptionist chatted about our stay as we checked in and I mentioned my birthday. We were offered an upgrade on the room to have a better view etc but then we were charged extra for it. Silly me, I thought this was going to be at our original cost! The room was a good size with a very comfortable bed and spotless bathroom. View of the river and top of the London Eye. Lovely towels, slippers and robes, bottled water and turn down service as you would expect but no fresh milk for a cup of tea! Also, the bedroom carpet was stained. I mentioned this when they asked about my stay via email and I did get a courteous response but I didn’t expect to find that at all in a 5 star hotel. However, it was a special treat and as I said, the staff were all superb, so I had a wonderful birthday!",4,2018,07,30
143,But Where Is The Charm?,"This hotel is not one of the cheaper 5 star hotels in London. The price we paid led me to expect a hotel experience like that of The Connaught or The Ritz, but our overall experience fell a good bit short of that.

First the good: our room we very good indeed. Excellent in fact. It was the Executive King: very well designed, with the bathroom across the little hallway from the bedroom and a nice walk-in wardrobe between them. Plenty of space. The bed and the aircon were top notch and we had a good night's sleep.

The public spaces, however, were not as pleasing. When we first arrived I was struck by the dullness of the reception area. There was something Soviet about its bland austerity. The Northall Bar is a very large, empty over-lit space which would be great for performing surgery on large animals, or even as a slaughterhouse, but for a bar it lacks charm. If only The Bassoon Bar were open all day, and not just in the evening, then guests would have a decent alternative watering hole. The Crystal Moon Lounge has the potential to be like One Aldwych in its hay day, which had a good mix of people and social buzz, but only customers taking afternoon tea can sit at the larger sofa groupings. This limits the mix of people as well as guests' choice of where to sit and, along with that, our feelings of belonging and experience of hospitality. 

In short we found the public spaces charmless, for a host of reasons. We met friends there and we all commented on this and that the staff were often a little too stiff and not very happy. I wonder if they were understaffed and stressed?

The location of the hotel was good in that it was so central. But it is very difficult to find the hotel, which became a little irritating! The entrances need more than a few flags to help guests. A nice feature, perhaps, or an entrance canopy.

I feel I have been a little strict in this review. But if the hotel wants to charge over 500 pounds a night, it really has to be better than this.",3,2018,07,26
143,"Lovely hotel, but an intense, busy part of town","The Corinthia is a lovely hotel with all staff generally eager to please.

Big impressive building, gorgeous public spaces, Impeccably clean, full range of services, multiple restaurants, fast room service, new spa, spotless small gym, etc.

A huge hotel but very well staffed.

We chose an inner courtyard ""garden suite"" which was recently, completely, and beautifully renovated, but was below grade of the garden with its windows starting at about chest level. 

Our suite had a generous sized parlor with every possible amenity, but a very small bedroom and bath, which was however also lovingly restored with no expense spared on the renovation.

Our room was perfectly, blissfully quiet , which we really appreciated given what awaited just outside the doors of the Corinthia: LONDON IN JULY! 

Only tiny observations: breakfast staff occasionally forgetful of requests; breakfast buffet selection could be a bit broader, especially as regards hot and cold cereals, cold milk, cheese selection and bread selections. Coffee was consistently delivered lukewarm.

We likely won't return to the Corinthia, because the neighborhood is seriously intense for us old retired, but on the other hand, the hood could be great for a young family or couples new to London.",5,2018,07,24
143,Luxury in London,"Beautiful king room with amazing toiletries from ESPA.  Perfect location to walk to attractions such as Westminster Abbey, National Gallery, Buckingham palace, and across the bridge to Southbank with attractions such as Shakespeare's Globe and the Tate museum.  Also right by the embankment train station.",5,2018,07,23
143,Venue stunning - food underwhelming,"This is a beautiful hotel and stunning interiors, we are in Northall menu slightly limited, they had run out of the wine we wanted, slightly confused by that as this is the one we were recommended by the sommelier. We had a gluten free bread as well as the sour dough on the table arrived 10 minutes apart so awkward with friends. Starters were fine, main course we ordered 2x fillet steaks one medium and one medium rare, the waiter misheard and we got one medium and one medium well, they were going to replace it but we were on a timescale as going to the theatre so kept it, they did remove the service charge due to this, dessert menu was underwhelming so we didn’t order. This isn’t cheap and I expected more!",3,2018,07,22
143,Room 136 - view of Embankment area w Tube and Rail noise,"Room 136 is large and spacious, with exterior view and sub-arctic air conditioning which was great to return to after a hot, non-AC day around the city.

If Tube/train noise bothers you, ask to be moved.  Only other noise heard was the shower drain in room above me on 2nd floor.   Maids come in at numerous times during the day which is great, but if you don't want to be disturbed, be sure to push the DND button adjacent to the door. 

Breakfast is supposed to be included in rate (at $750+ a night it should be) but upon check out it was itemized on my bill as ""extra.""  Note to self - always ask up front at arrival, and pull and review bill the night before departure.  As I was in a hurry to get in car to go to airport did not have time to dicker, and desk staff could not seem to locate any information regarding breakfast being included, or not.  They said they would check into it and email me later.   

Tip:  Avoid second floor which is busy with film press junkets, and lots of people loitering in the hallways.",4,2018,07,21
143,Incredible Hotel,"You will feel like royalty the second you are greeted at the Corinthia hotel.  The lobby is filled with beautiful decor, fresh flower arrangements and stunning light fixtures. The exceptional service from the concierge, front desk, bell staff and housekeeping ensured we had a perfect stay. The restaurant and lounges are comfortable and inviting offering delicious food, cocktails, wines and sweets. The bar staff are fun and attentive mixing creative cocktails and serving delicious snacks especially after a full day walking around London.  Our room was comfortable, kind bed was perfect, felt private and always cleaned whenever we returned. The English Breakfast is unreal with the restaurant offering classics for anyone who's hungry or just wants a coffee & pastry.  The afternoon tea is not to be missed.  The Corinthia is centrally located in Whitehall near the River Thames, Westminster, and Trafalgar Square.

143,Re: A Pretty Penny for a Pretty Place ,"This is an OUTSTANDING hotel with plush surroundings, in an ideal location in Whitehall with a flagship service.
The spa is one of the best in London and we were made to feel so special throughout our stay.
It was a surprise birthday present for my mum and they put out all the stops. Birthday platter in the room, complementary upgrade to a Delux Room and a bottle of bubbly - my mum was so happy with it. Breakfast was very tasty - especially the home- made granola.
The highlights in the room were the rainforest shower, tv in the hot tub and exceedingly cosy beds. Well done Corinthia - a real asset to the London experience. Worth every penny.",5,2018,07,20
143,Amazing hotel,"Amazing hotel absolute luxury from the minute you step in, the spa here is very new and with no expense spared. 1st choice every time when we are in London, it is expensive but you really do get what you pay for here, the location is ideal also",5,2018,07,19
143,Worth every penny !!,"Superb hotel - worth it, big time.

First impressions ...
- Excellent and professional doormen 
- Fantastic Decor, lovely lobby. 
- Great check in at front desk
- Excellent room size and amenities 

We then spent first night ..next impressions ; super comfortable bed, great shower pressure, super service from housekeeping .   AND 7 Min’s walking distance from Leicester square, 15 mins from Soho for superb restaurants .

I’m in love !  This hotel has it all.

Well done Corinthia, well done . ",5,2018,07,19
143,Wonderful Aftenoon Tea,"We enjoyed a lovely afternoon tea at the Corinthia Hotel. The food, service and atmosphere was perfect. Nigel, Gulrukh and Boram looked after us exceptionally well. They ensured that all of the sandwiches and pastries were described thoroughly, displaying their knowledge of the  product, and best of all our champagne glasses were never empty! Thank you for looking after us so well and making it a great experience. ",5,2018,07,15
143,Central location for a family of 5,"Excellent breakfast.
Clean and tidy executive king rooms. Advsnce request for connecting rooms is required. Extra bed for child was made available at short notice.
Rooms were serviced very well and were quiet.
Concierge was knowledgeable and helpful.
Front door team very friendly and helpful.
Afternoon tea was delightful.
Lunch at the Crystal Moon was delicious.
Dinner was very good.
International staff & team for a very international audience!
Great indoor pool children. Children make this hotel truly warm and inviting for families.
Laundry is very expensive.
Dignified service with friendliness.
Elegant but down to earth.
Great location for National Gallery, Chinatown, Lego Store Leceister Square, Scotland Yard,  Covent Garden & Big Ben.
Hamleys , British Museum and New Bond Street via short taxi ride.",5,2018,07,13
143,Average hotel food,I’ve eaten in both restaurants and had good food the first time but can not recommend the Northiam. Very average food at very high prices. Only reason I would go there again is if I couldn’t find anywhere else near to the Playhouse Theatre. ,3,2018,07,09
143,Prize,"Our visit was a prize won at a function earlier this year. Our prize was Sunday Brunch for two. 

On arriving we found the hotel to be pure luxury. Situated just a few yards from Trafalgar Square it is ideally placed for access to the West End. 
We only visited the Northall Restaurant. Pure elegance. The staff were superbly uniformed and very polite and attentive. 

The menu for brunch was small but gave a wonderful choice of lighter lunch dishes. 

Being a fish lover I thoroughly enjoyed a Dressed Dorset crab starter followed by a Lemon Sole. The meal was rounded off with delicious home made ice cream. 

Certainly a treat I will not forget. 
",5,2018,07,08
143,What a cocktail master!,"We were three female colleagues who visited for a pre-dinner cocktail. The decor is stunning, love the flower arrangements throughout the hotel and everyone very pleasant. The bar tender making the cocktails was a true artist who took such pride in his work. We ended up having two as we were enjoying the atmosphere so much. The cocktail waiter was the hardest working member of staff ... he was busy all the time and it is easy to see why. Obviously the prices are not cheap but it was well worth it for a lovely evening  in beautiful surroundings sipping delicious and pretty cocktails.",5,2018,07,07
143,"  Very strong choice","The location was within distance walking to many sites.  Very close to high end shopping. The room was well appointed, well decorated and the staff was on point, especially the front desk staff. Concierge was average. We found the restaurant staff to be a little cold and unfriendly but that didn't discourage us. The food itself was good and cocktails well made. Housekeeping was also very good and attentive. Happy with our choice here. ",5,2018,07,06
143,"Very, very good but have stayed at better. The spa is top notch","Not much to say really, does what it says on the box. Amazing decor and wonderfully friendly staff. The bar is wonderful. The restaurant we found ok and the rooms very comfortable if a little unexciting (compared to say the Rosewood where they're just a little more edgy and cool without losing the comfort factor). The breakfast delivered to the room was the only let-down. I mean it was fine but we've had better at this type of hotel. The spa is another level and we spent hours there hanging out after treatments. It's pretty pricey but the spa might just make it worth it...just.",4,2018,07,05
143,Wonderful Stay! Awesome Staff!!,"We stayed here last week for 6 nights and our stay was perfect!  When we checked in late at night, Tom immediately took care of us.  His warmth and help was evident all week.  Thanks Tom!  

The rooms are very well appointed and clean, as well as the bathrooms.  The showers had amazing water pressure, which is rare in hotels nowadays. The turn down service every night was very good as well as room service.  Breakfast was brought on time each day perfectly.  The lobby area is spotless with beautiful flowers that are rotated. We even ate in the lobby on our arrival and the food was very good!

The head Concierge - Darren- is there to make sure your stay goes to perfection.  May thanks to Darren for all of his help.

The pool/spa area is one of the nicest for any of the hotels we have been to.  Quiet, serene, peaceful and not crowded at all.  It was the perfect way to spend an end to the long sight seeing days in London.  

We did go to the 2 hotel bars, listened to live music and had some very good drinks.

The hotel location is great- walking distance close to many of the sights.

The hotel staff at the Corinthia goes out of its way to make sure your stay is beyond perfect.  We had one or two minor issues with the room, but that was taken care of immediately.  

When we are in London again, we will definitely be staying at the Corinthia!",5,2018,07,05
143,Outstanding,"We recently stayed with our friends and what a delight all round. We could not fault the Hotel or any of the staff. They are welcoming from the time you check in to the time you leave. A special shout out to Davida in the bar and hope to be back again sometime soon..

Jason and Tanya Viola ",5,2018,07,02
143,Fantastic Experience,"Where to begin? The lobby is extremely impressive, the rooms are very large with everything you could want, and the spa/pool is top notch. I always looked forward each morning walking through the flower shop within the hotel on the way to breakfast. It just brightens your day! Above all else, their staff were always professional, engaging, smiling, and helpful with every request I had (and I had a few). No matter how great a hotel looks, it only takes one bad experience with one staff member to ruin an impression, and the Corinthia likely avoids this trap. I always judge, would I return to the hotel or look around. No question, I will not even look at other hotels for my next visit to London. Corinthia or nothing.",5,2018,07,01
143,Fantastic afternoon tea experience!,"Thank you Nigel!
Nigel was in charge of front of house at  Corinthia overseeing the crystal moon dining area. I took my friend for her special birthday and wanted to treat her to afternoon tea.  Soon as we walked in we  greeted in a very friendly and welcoming manner by one of the members of  staff. We were shown where to sit and  to be quite honest every inch of this place looked inviting to sit. 
We were given a few minutes to settle in and then greeted again and explained how they were going to serve which was really nice. The young lady was very knowledgeable about all the teas and helped us with our choices. We opted for the champagne afternoon tea. The champagne was served in the most beautiful elegant crystal glasses which was made out of the same crystal used throughout in the dining area.
Nigel then came to greet us and made us feel so special. It was great that he made the time to greet all his guests and this is what makes a difference. Nothing was to much trouble and they even packed some cake that we couldn't eat to take with us. 
The hotel itself is beautiful and the relaxed atmosphere in there sets you at ease. We weren't rushed at all and I didn't want to leave but all good things come to an end.
I highly recommend this place and hoping to go back again.
Thank you Nigel  for explaining a bit of history of the place and making it a truly amazing dining experience.what a gentleman!",5,2018,07,01
143,Wow...,"I had to make a quick trip to London for business and needed to stay somewhere close to my clients. Corinthia not only exceeded my expectations but made me think twice about staying at my favorite hotel down the road. 
The service is very good and the rooms are large and accommodating. While it seems like it’s better for business I will definitely be back to try the spa!",5,2018,06,27
143,Perfect for Afternoon Tea!,"We went there for afternoon tea and it was incredible! The ambiance was gorgeous, the service was brilliant, and the tea was delicious. Make sure you have a reservation though! We made one and it helped so much. We got seated about a half hour after our reservation time but the staff was so kind and apologetic they gave us 2 free glasses of champaign each! Would highly recommend to anyone wanted to experience a true, British High Tea!",5,2018,06,26
143,Luxury at its best,"Nothing much to say about this magnificent venue except opulence in its purest form from the moment we went inside to the time we hated most....when we left.
Excellently located, impeccably clean, magnificently decorated... simply the best.
Prices are not cheap but considering the overall product offered, we found it extremely reasonable in relative terms and in comparison to similar venues. Highly recommended. Please do not leave London without visiting at least eating or afternoon tea at this marvellous venue.",5,2018,06,24
143,My favorite among a top 3,"Great location, perfect service, perfect room. Highest quality bathroom and amenities. Super professional front desk, room service and room staff - I met and spoke with each one - always friendly, pleasant and forthcoming. As compared with the Langham and the Savoy, I have decided I like the Corinthia best. Even had a little view of the Thames and St Paul's out my window. Oh and the pool, therapy pool, steam room and sauna and incredible too. Thank you so much!",5,2018,06,24
143,Cutting corners?,"We often pop in here after a night in town en route to the train home. As always, the hotel was elegantly and beautifully decorated and presented and, as always, the service was impeccable. The quality of my drink, however, seemed to be of a lesser  standard and I wonder if corners are being cut to improve profit margins. I always order hot chocolate: normally it is creamy and delicious but tonight it tasted watery and smelt a bit soapy. The mini marshmallows tasted very cheap and like plastic, and the chocolate shavings were like cooking chocolate. When you pay £7.50 for hot chocolate you want it to be a real treat. ",3,2018,06,23
143,Birthday ,"We arrived by car ,I don’t recommend the traffic is heavy. There is no on site parking but concierge will park your car for you at a local car park which is great after a long drive. There is tube station right next to the hotel very convenient. 
 On entrance to a grand lobby where afternoon tea and snacks are served is very impressive and gives you good impression of style. Plenty of staff to accommodate to your needs every where you go. Very clean and stylish all part of the hotel. We had an evening meal which was fab and cocktails later on at the bar which was also excellent. In the morning had breakfast there also got to say the best I had in a London hotel. The best bit of this hotel is the spar facilities , it is second to none it is a must try! It is also i a very good location for shopping to site seeing. 
 The only thing that I would say that I found the room a bit basic and ordinary was expecting more from the price tag. ",4,2018,06,21
143,"Awesome hotel, housekeeping staff, and concierges","This was my second time staying at the hotel.  Corinthia is absolutely fantastic and worth every penny. 

The entire staff is awesome but the true unsung heroes of the hotel are the housekeeping staff.  They keep the hotel in an immaculate condition.  Our room was perfectly cleaned everyday of our week long stay.  I accidentally left a couple of hundred dollar bills next to the TV in my room.  I came back at the end of the day and found the money untouched which speaks to the honesty and integrity of the housekeep staff.

Lastly, the concierges are knowledgeable and a wonderful resource.  Sahil in particular was helpful to us at the concierge’s desk. ",5,2018,06,21
143,Oasis of elegance in the city,There is something very special about the Corinthia hotel. Something special about everything from the exquisite peace of the courtyard to the courteousness of the staff. It’s a curoisly private and quiet space in the busy bustling city.,5,2018,06,18
143,Such a special weekend,"I want to say a personal thank you to Ana Maria and her team at the Corinthia. Thank you for making mine and my boyfriends stay so special. Ana arranged for balloons and champagne to be in our room to celebrate my boyfriends birthday. The room we stayed in was gorgeous and overlooked the main hotel chandelier. We spent half a day enjoying the spa which was absolutely amazing. 
I really can't wait to stay again in the near future.",5,2018,06,18
143,Amazing Afternoon Tea!,Went for afternoon tea today as a treat. An incredible experience. Beautiful food and tea. Had lots of time to relax in the foyer area in lovely surroundings. Staff were very attentive. Would highly recommend.,5,2018,06,17
143,"Gorgeous hotel, great location ","5-10 minute walk to Big Ben (although currently the clock tower is under renovation), Westminster Abbey and Buckingham Palace. Beautiful hotel. Very comfortable beds. Szabina was kind enough to upgrade my family to a suite for our anniversary, along with champagne. Also welcome gifts for the kids. Much appreciated. A splurge but worth it!",5,2018,06,12
143,The hotel to beat all others.,"On arrival at the Corinthia you immediately feel special. The doorman is friendly and professional. Our bags and hangers were politely taken from us and put on a porter’s trolley. We checked in and were warmly welcomed. 

A young Romanian woman took from reception to our room. She enquired if we had visited the hotel before. When we said no, she pointed out some useful places such as the Northall restaurant and the Bassoon bar. She also showed with some pride the Baccarat chandelier in the main lobby area. She told us that it has 1000 bulbs and one is red. This is called the heart of the hotel.

We were told on check-in that we had been upgraded to an Executive King room. When we were shown the room we were thrilled. The room had a large walk-in wardrobe and a large bedroom. The bedroom had a large dining table and a smaller table with fresh fruit on it. There was a chaise lounge to the side of the bed and a seat at the bottom of the bed. She explained the room facilities and showed us our impressive bathroom. It had double sinks and a wall-to-wall marble top. The bath had a television at the end, and had a waterproof remote control. There was a separate shower with rainforest head, and a separate toilet. There are plenty of ESPA toiletries and plush bathrobes and fluffy towels.
There is a coffee machine and we asked for a kettle, which was promptly brought. 

There is a great TV with lots of channels including Sky Sports. The lights can be controlled from beside the bed and offer mood lighting, which is great after a long day in London. The air conditioning was perfect and kept the room nice and cool, as I like it.

We slept better than we ever have. At home we have a great quality Vi-Spring mattress. I don’t know what the hotel uses, but I can only assume it is clouds from the sky!

On both mornings we went to the Northall restaurant for breakfast. This is a feast to behold. In fact, on the Sunday morning we spent nearly 2 hours having a long breakfast/brunch.

There were a number of people having afternoon tea in the lobby area, we had gone to the Waldorf  for afternoon tea before arrival at the hotel and wished we hadn’t. The set up in the Corinthia is on another level. The champagne flutes are Baccarat to match the chandelier and it all looked incredible. 

We used the spa on the Saturday afternoon after a long hot morning at The Trooping of the Colour for The Queen’s Birthday. We were exhausted on arrival at the spa, which we went to in our swimsuits and bathrobes, as there is a dedicated spa lift. 

We found the spa to be extra special. It was dark blue on the thermal floor and quite warm. The swimming pool was beautiful. And the Vitality Pool had great jets to relax all our overused muscles. There was an abundance of towels for your use. There were sumptuous sofas to relax on whilst having a chat. The heated beds were great, but the highlight has to be the fireplaces. There are two fires between the hot beds and the Vitality pool and again at the sauna. They are very long, about 4 metres at a guess. The feeling they give is beyond your expectations.

Our checkout was the saddest time we have ever had leaving a hotel.

If you are thinking of booking this hotel, then think no more, book it! You will not regret a moment you are in the hotel. Every member of staff seems genuinely happy to be at work and even happier to help.

If there is anywhere better than this hotel I am yet to find it.",5,2018,06,12
143,Just arrived but all needs met,"I took a red eye from Boston to London, but due to late departure, I barely got two hours of sleep on the plane. The very kind staff took pity on me when I arrived. Somehow, they magically produced a room at 10:45am, and they upgraded me to a sweet suite. I could have kissed them just for the effort of find me an available room! 

I’m fresh up from a great 3 hour nap! This place is so tranquil. I didn’t hear a sound on the street or the halls. They have a high tech coffee machine that helped perk me up, and I’m definitely taking a dip in the super deep tub. Great tubs are hard to find in hotels, but this one rivals the New York Plaza! I just can’t remember if the plaza has huge TVs mounted above the tub like they do here. I’m tempted to spend my trip in the bathroom! 

The hotel is in the middle of everything! And the staff is very helpful with my questions. I’m so, so grateful I spent a bit more to stay here. Even if it’s for one night, I recommend you stay here too and get a taste of the princess life.",5,2018,06,12
143,Best in London,Best hotel experience in London.  No pretense.  It is expensive but you get what you pay for.  Great service/friendly professional staff.  Location is fantastic: convenient but quiet. This is our “go to” hotel when in London for business or pleasure.,5,2018,06,11
143,Corinnthia Experience,"Excellent location. Whether sightseeing or theatre going, this location fits all the criteria.
Staff service could have been better at breakfast and in the bar.
The leisure facilities are of the highest standards.
Otherwise a reasonable experience.",4,2018,06,11
143,More than we expected,"My husband I just returned and cannot rave enough about the wonderful experience at this hotel.  Many of the reviewers highlight the ESPA spa which is extraordinary but the best part of this hotel is its dedication to service and the quality of the staff from the lobby attendants to the waitstaff at the Northall Restaurant. The experience is one of being pampered while feeling very much at home, a royal treatment for sure.",5,2018,06,11
143,Quality beyond compare,"This hotel offers pure luxury. Staff are attentive without being intrusive. The location is superb and within easy walk of Embankment, Covent Garden, Leicester Square, Trafalgar and Soho. Close to underground and lots of excellent restaurants close by",5,2018,06,11
143,Be careful of proposed upgrades!,A grand experinece but disapointed on arrival as upgrade offered that turned up to be expensive and not at all worthwhile (just an on-suite office!). In the end though the problem was resolved to our satisfaction but be careful about this upgrade philosophy that can turn up to be a disapointment!,3,2018,06,11
143,Out of this world spa!,"Went here for a spa weekend and highly recommend the spa and more moderately recommend the rooms!

The spa is fantastic. Cannot fault it.

The rooms are slightly corporate and anonymous but the standard is very high. 

The bars are good albeit quiet. However, the excellent central location makes it easy to find alternatives.

The service is great.

I’d highly recommend staying - especially to make use of the spa.",4,2018,06,10
143,Spa Day ,"This is by far the most luxurious and private spa in London. From the for floors to all the facilities. Whirlpool, suna, radiation, the relax room is so cute. I had a full body 90min massage which I didn’t want to end. The staff are very nice and welcoming. 

Everything was 5 star. Go go go!! ",5,2018,06,10
143,A 5 star experience,"All staff very well trained and that excellent combination of friendly/professional. Best shower any were...volume, consistency of temperature and water softness!  Magnificent flowers! Excellent location. ",5,2018,06,09
143,Great room and great bathroom,"What a fantastic hotel.  i just have two small complaints.  One the hotel smells of cheap perfume.  The breakfast at £46 is appalling - its cold, undercooked, not worth the money and all round is simply dreadful.  Don't order room service whatever you do.  On the 3rd floor the kitchen must be simply miles away.  NO NO NO BREAKFAST.   GREAT GREAT BATHROOM",4,2018,06,08
143,Afternoon Tea - Amazing Experience,"A friend of mine told me to do tea right, go big.  This place had the highest thought of tea I could find.  I'm a blue collar guy from Chicago but was treated like a high profile individual.  The service itself was exceptional.  It was the most surprising thing of my trip, how much I enjoyed it.

The smoked salmon was outstanding.  The desert cart is loaded with amazing little treats.

The staff, Nigel especially, treated me like family come to visit and it was very much appreciated.

Thank you.",5,2018,06,06
143,Dinner with my family ,"My sister, my brother in law and their two teenage kids came up to London and stayed here with the Make a wish foundation as my nephew had had recurrent brain tumours. His wish was to get to stay at a fancy hotel that had a doorman.
I went to meet them for dinner in the Italian restaurant that is part of the Corinthia Hotel. The food was great, the Service was top notch as you would expect. They weren’t snooty with the kids like some places can be. 
Was a great evening.
They were also looked after tremendously during their weekend stay. 

Recommend the visit to the restaurant for a  romantic couples or if really treating the family. 

",5,2018,06,03
143,Hope this is not a downward trend?! Some issues this time!,"I’ve stayed at the Corinthia in London the last several times I’ve been to London. It is usually exquisite and lovely on every level, but this time, not quite so. 
I booked an executive king room, but it was small, very tight and had only 1 vanity in a small bathroom. I really doubt that that room was an executive king room category. But, really, how can one prove that? 
Our room was changed, but in that one, the shower was very small, and the shower water was leaking and seeping through the floor into the floor of the toilet. This was a nasty sight, and certainly not conforming with the previous attention to detail this hotel has had in the past.
I hope this is not a downward trend. It makes me somewhat wary of the current standards of this hotel. 
I may consider staying in a different hotel on my next trip to London.",3,2018,06,02
143,Beautiful hotel but a few issues,"We were so excited to stay at this hotel after reading such a good reviews. We had decided that after the wedding we wanted a few relaxing days at a Spa hotel in London to start our honeymoon. 
I will start by saying that the hotel is absolutely beautiful and the check in was faultless. We had an issue with the London Marathon being on, which meant there were road closures, however when we rang the hotel explaining the issue, they sent one of the staff to come and meet us at the barrier, to organise for our car to be let through. 
Naomi at check in was fantastic and as our room wasn't ready provided us with a glass of champagne each whilst we waited. Once our room was ready she provided us with a detailed room tour, which was very helpful. The one thing we really liked about the Corinthia was the size of the rooms. Our junior suite was very spacious and the bathroom was lovely. At most of the other top hotels the rooms can be quite pokey and worn, this is not the case at the Corinthia! The breakfast was fantastic at the hotel and the room service they provide is very different to other places, which we really loved. Our cooked breakfast was the best we had ever had at a hotel!
Sadly though there were a few issues with our stay. We came back to the room after going to the spa at about 3pm to find that our room had not been cleaned. My husband rang reception to ask if someone could come and sort out the room, however two hours later when we went back to the room and our room had still not been sorted, so my husband had to chase up again. Third time lucky when we came back from dinner in the evening it had been sorted, but this isn't something I would expect from a top London hotel.
Our other issue was to do with the Spa, I will add that all the other staff we dealt with were lovely at the hotel, however the Spa staff looked miserable and were not friendly in the slightest. This was the case on both days that we visited the Spa. The Spa have rules in place regarding children but this is definitely not adhered to. There were children screaming and shouting as well as going in the pool areas and sauna where it clearly said they weren't allowed. Again not what you would expect from a top London hotel. Overall we did enjoy our stay at the Corinthia but it was a shame there were a few niggles.",4,2018,05,30
143,Spa day,"My mum and I had just been lucky enough to be gifted a voucher by a friend for the Corinthia Spa, and so rather than let it go to waste we ventured up to London and stayed for a couple of hours. In our package we received lunch, full access to all of the facilities, a massage each and nail treatments. The staff were lovely and welcoming and there is so much to do that there is even 4 floors of the spa!
There are sleep pods to relax in, a gym, a pool, multiple saunas, a particularly entertaining bubble pool and heated relaxation chairs! (Although after around 3 minutes you start to melt)
The whole day was definitely worth it, however we had to buy some extra add ons because the voucher although said for 2 people actually turned out to be for one, so check that. Ps the massages are crazy expensive so make sure you really want one! 
Would love to come again, 5 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",5,2018,05,30
143,Well located with an excellent staff,"This is one of the best hotels in London.  Upscale without being too fussy.  The hotel is in a great location, close to pretty much everything one may need - tourism in Trafalgar Square, good museums, the tube, the river, good food, literally anything you could want is near by. The staff was also excellent.  The hallways smell great and that perfume doesn't leak into the rooms.  I'll definitely be back.",5,2018,05,30
143,What does 100% Best Rate Guarantee actually mean?,"We decided to spend a couple of nights in London as we often do  with my two grown up children. 
They say first impressions make all the difference so I was very unimpressed really from booking the rooms onwards 
I booked on line with a well known web site  - which was cheaper than the hotel’s own web site.  Yes, we had to pay up front with a cc but the booking was cancellable and refundable and still cheaper than their pay up front but not refundable rate and only made this booking a couple of weeks before our stay. 

Looking at the hotels own web site - with its 100% rate guarantee- I approached the hotel to match it.   

“on this occasion we are not able to match this rate offered by this online travel agent”

 Then I sent them a copy of their own 100% Best Rate Guarantee promise. ....

So, WHAT  does a 100% best rate guarantee mean?  

“The rate that you booked with - is a special members rate which requires full prepayment to obtain the discount” 
No, it was just hotels.com ! 
 “The rates that we offer on our website are offered to public and do not require payment in advance.
 On this occasion as a goodwill gesture we will be able to match the rate with no prepayment “ 
 
Because we had paid upfront and their best rate guarantee did not apply.  Hummmmm ?????? 

The reason I wanted to go direct is that they advertise  “priority room upgrade “ if you do book directly subject to availability) 
So, I moved my booking direct with the hotel after they price matched. We had 2 rooms.  On checking in - we were NOT offered an upgrade until I asked.  They replied they were full which was not true because I had checked availability for that day already.   We did get an upgrade on one of the rooms when I pointed this out - I shouldn’t have had to point this out !  Yes, we had asked for an early check in but that shouldn’t have made any difference to the booking.  It would have been nice to have been greeted with a lovely welcome and to be told our rooms were upgraded on checking in.   

So, my experience with the corinthia was disappointing before we started our break.  
We booked deluxe rooms.  If you are taking family and want to book their standard rooms they do not have twin beds so you need the next level up.  
The deluxe room was nice.  Not very large.  The bathrooms were very lovely. Identical in the deluxe and executive.  Rooms very clean With plenty of gorgeous soaps etc.   But, the towels and dressing gowns were old and frayed.  Why would I want to pay over £500 /night for tatty towels. 
The executive room was a nicer room.  Slightly bigger than the deluxe with the same walk in wardrobe which was a good size but the bed was hard and gave my husband a back ache.  

Breakfast - we had full breakfast package. 
Breakfast in the room was brought in exactly how you would expect in a 5* hotel on a trolley with a heated section.  Why then - when there are two people only give 4 little breakfast pastries not even one of the same each? Yes, you have to tick if you want but at the Savoy we always get presented with the most beautiful and generous basket of delicious breakfast pastries . 
Again corinthia. When my family went to the breakfast buffet - why would you even think of charging £2 for an extra something that should have been included in the buffet - are you so short of money?  After all our 2 night stay including treatment each totalled almost £2,600 and that was with £150 taken off for a medical pedicure which nipped my toes and caused an infection.  

The spa is beautiful but on a really warm day was far too hot and really unpleasant to sit by the small pool and enjoy  - so I would say to use the spa during winter and not when the weather is lovely outside. 
There actually is no outdoor space to sit if the weather is nice - no the lovely roof terrace you see on their web site is part of a suite! and probably that’s the only way to get a great view over London from the hotel.  Certainly no view from our rooms. The deluxe room overlooked a courtyard  .......this courtyard is an open smoking area but this gets no sun and no good if you don’t smoke.  So, you need to go over the road to a park if you want to get some sunshine.  You are just a walk to anywhere.... and their doormen were lovely.  

Also, the odd £10 in the final bill that related to nothing.  Yes, you knocked them off the final bill.   The spa too had an extra £175 but again this was removed when we pointed this out. 

We live in London but often stay in town for a break. Sorry Corinthia, we won’t be back.   Our last few London stays were at the Savoy which is divine and the Ham Yard modern and gorgeous and both with fabulous service - were so much better in every way.",3,2018,05,28
143,"Classy, good experience if you have deep pockets","Lovely decor, wonderful service.  We popped in for drinks pre theatre and were treated wonderfully with all the bells and trimmings.  We were in the bar, but I noticed in the dining area people enjoying amazing trays of sandwiches and cakes for their afternoon tea.  Definite return require to sample some more delights, but probably have to save up first.",5,2018,05,28
143,An elegant way to enjoy London!,"I would highly recommend the Corinthia.  It is a lovely hotel whose staff are to be commended for their warmth and helpfulness.  Given that it is in the hub of so many historic places, the Corinthia is the place to slowly and luxuriously unwind after a full day of sight-seeing and shopping.  Our stay, of eight nights, was delightful.  The room was spacious with exceptional housekeeping staff.  I continue to miss the surprises left on our pillows every night!!!",5,2018,05,26
143,Top class hotel,"Great location, easy access to all amenities, very friendly staff! Rooms are spacious, had a nice relaxing bath whilst watching TV! Will definitely recommend to family, friends and clients in the future. ",5,2018,05,26
143,A stunning venue in the heart of London,"We went to the Corinthia for drinks and dinner- What a wonderful evening.

The venue is elegant, the staff attentive and charming, the bar serves beautiful cocktails ( highly recommend The princes tipple) and the food from the fixed price menu was beautiful. 
Impeccably presented, good choices, and tasted great.
Would definitely go again.
",5,2018,05,26
143,Great Service,"We arrived very late but still received a warm and friendly welcome. We really appreciated the great service after a long trip. The room was superb as well, everything was spotlessly clean and comfortable.",5,2018,05,25
143,Honeymoon,"Absolutely love this hotel. Special dessert on our nightstand was great. The breakfast and late night snacks was fresh and tasty! Very close walk to the London eyes and underground metro train. I love the morning walk on the bridge. Very convenient to Japanese ramen noodles, Vietnamese, and local express sushi place.",5,2018,05,21
143,Outrageously rude!!,"I visited London for one day, and wanted to stay overnight and relax in the spa at Corinthia hotel. As I live in another town, I didn't have my passport with and offered the receptionist a scan. That was not sufficient, which was already strange as I had never had problems checking in using a scan in a passport scan in the past (including later that day at Langham Hotel). 

Based on my past experience I didn't not need a passport to purchase a one day pass to the spa (I visited it quite frequently a few years ago). Indeed, the spa receptionist didn't ask for it, and I began to fill in my personal details in the questionnaire, when three (!) security guards appeared, literally grabbed me by the shoulders and threw me out through the back-door without offering any explanation! I advise everyone never to set foot in this horrible establishment (I can't even bring myself to call that place a hotel after this encounter) and will never do that myself again.",1,2018,05,20
143,What an amazing hotel...,"Recently stayed at this hotel and all I can say is wow... normally stay at the Dorchester but had heard good things of this hotel so thought I’d try it... food was amazing, Spa is one of the best in London and the rooms were spacious and well laid out. The service was impeccable from all the staff, from door man to waiter.
On arrival we were greeted by one of the senior reception staff who offered us a seat and checked us in very speedy. She then proceeded to take us up to our room and show us around it. We had been up graded to a junior suite which was a lovely surprise.
We decided to try the Spa and wow what a treat... 4 floors to pamper every part of your body... having tried most of the Spa’s in London I have to say this is the best...
Lunch we opted for the restaurant and the did a 3 course set menu for under £30. This was very good and extremely good value for money...
The following day breakfast was nice although as they say avoid busy times as you may have to wait for a table but this was fast and the took my order and prepared it...
In the afternoon I got chatting to the door man and I was invited to look at the penthouse that on the previous week a ex US president stayed in..  we’ll this was over 2 floors with a lift... very impressed..
To round up, This hotel really impressed me and I can see what all the fuss is about. The manager here use to be the manager at Claridges and you can see that he’s brought a wealth of knowledge with him and this hotel is going places. Nothing was too much trouble.. on the first night I wanted extra milk for my cup of tea before I go to bed so I thought I’d leave a not for the turn down staff.. when I got in a 2am there was my milk and the room was turned down lovely... thank you Carinthia for keeping the high standards and exceeding mine.",5,2018,05,20
143,Breakfast in Style,"It’s the week of the Royal Wedding and London has wedding fever. The Lobby of the hotel was beautifully decorated with wedding flowers- so pretty. The dining room we had breakfast in is stunning- tall pillars, gold ceiling, lots of mirrors. It wasn’t very busy and we were well attended to by friendly staff. You can go a la carte or buffet style. At first we thought the buffet was very limited then we realised there were other choices in the adjoining dining rooms. We enjoyed beautiful pastries, a nice selection of fresh berries, fabulous fresh squeezed juice, a very good granola, Bircher muesli, there were continental options of meat and cheeses too. From the kitchen I loved my poached eggs with avocado and my husband had a huge eggs benedict which had enough on a plate for two! Being London it is expensive though but a relaxed and chilled atmosphere and we didn’t feel under any pressure to hurry through our breakfast. ",4,2018,05,19
143,Still a Highlight,"My wife and spent 5 nights at the Corinthia earlier this May. We had stayed there five years ago and vowed to return if we went back to London. The Corinthia did not disappoint.  It is in a wonderful location, the quiet Whitehall area, yet close to Trafalgar Square, the Embankment, Jubilee Bridge and thus in walking distance to many of the sites you may want to visit.  The hotel itself is beautiful, rooms quite generous, and well equipped. The breakfast is too good. Sometimes you do not have room for lunch. This time we only ate at Massimo but it was one of our better meals. The staff is friendly and helpful, and when our phones didn't work or some other minor issue arose. someone was at the door within minutes of a call down to the front desk. Yes the hotel is pricey, but staying there is a large part of what made the trip so memorable. You can't go wrong at the Corinthia.",5,2018,05,17
143,wonderful Hotel,"We stayed at this Hotel for a weekend with friends.
The Hotel is beautiful, located in a very central London location, very close to the London Eye and Westminster.
Beautiful common areas, our room was spacious and elegant, equipped with every comfort.
All the staff was really very kind and smiling, from the reception to the concierge, and also the staff in the restaurant for breakfast (the breakfast buffet is fantastic!)",5,2018,05,16
143,Top notch,"This hotel oozes quality.

Staff are efficient, polite and friendly without being sycophantic.

Rooms are fabulous with lots of space, lovely clean bathroom, decent usable furniture well set out.  Nice comfy bed.

If I was to be a slight bit critical I think the electrical sockets for charging iPhones, iPads etc could be better set out but this won't change just because it doesn't suit me.

There is an air of class around this hotel and it is well worth paying for.  This is currently my favourite London Hotel.  For a special birthday or anniversary just go for it, you won't regret it.",5,2018,05,16
143,"Company Christmas Party - beautiful place, disappointing service","I would like to say in advance that I am not rating the rooms or hotel service with this review, only an event.
We had our Christmas Party in this fantastic building, hiring the ballroom for our event. A very beautiful environment but sadly, the staff was a real disappointment.
Started by the door - as we entered there was no friendly welcome just a short word of a grumpy guard which way we need to go... 
The canapes were amazing, however, I haven't had the chance to taste most of them as we arrived a bit later than the starting time (15 minutes). I really wanted to try a particular one of the canapes as I was told it was amazing and I saw them collecting and taking the trays away right in front of my nose. So I approached one of the waiters in a lovely manner to ask if I could have one as they just took it away. He kindly tried to help me and asked the manager of theirs but he said no.... 
When the dinner started, it was all very theatrical and pompous (as I believe the reputation requires), yet they failed to provide me a simple bottle of beer as it was only wine on the list paired with the menu. Later I found that some of our tables had champagne, cocktails and also beer as a choice.... I probably asked the wrong person.
Real shame of a lovely evening....
I am unfortunately unsure whether it was the hotel itself or an events company to organise the party but I believe flexibility and meeting the guests' needs should be a main goal for any types of service provider.",2,2018,05,14
143,Fantastic Professional Hotel right in the Heart of London,"Fantastic professional hotel.  We had a family room, which had 2 double beds which was big enough for a family of 4.  Service was excellent.  The breakfast was full English or continental and there was everything you could think of, everything was exceptional quality.

There was a concierge service to park your car off site, for a small charge. 

Location was perfect - 5 minute walk across the bridge to London eye, Dungeons etc..  5 minutes the other direction was the Houses of Parliament, Big Ben.

This is an excellent hotel on a luxury budget to see the sights of London!",5,2018,05,13
143,The best 5-star hotel in London,"The Corinthia is a historic gem that has, for the past 6 years and for the pleasure of all connoisseurs, been ranked as a 5 star luxury hotel in London.
This imposing Victorian building, with can be accessed from two major streets in the prestigious Whitehall district, is a perfect combination of old-world splendour and contemporary modernity.
Its location in the heart of London makes it ideal for visiting all the main sites.
Whether by taxi, tube (Embankment station ), train (Charing Cross, Waterloo, ...), boat (Thames Clippers), or by foot you are near  the Jubilee Bridge at the end of which is the famous London Eye as well as the pleasant South Bank. On the Northern side you will find Trafalgar Square and the National Gallery, the theatre district, China Town, Covent Garden, the Opera House, the Strand and its many buses allowing you to go practically everywhere.
In this chic and quiet neighbourhood, you are just minutes from Westminster Abbey, the Houses of Parliament, Buckingham Palace, the Banqueting House etc… This is really a place of choice whatever your plans for sightseeing, shopping, culture, entertainment…
With London all around you, this superb classical building with carefully renovated architecture creates a very British atmosphere that emanates from the government offices nearby.
Whichever entrance you choose, this hotel invites you to discover a prestigious world of history and elegance in the heart of London. You will be pleasantly welcomed by a helpful and competent staff. On the Whitehall side, the porter opens the door to a refined decor combined with a touch of contemporary art that perfectly reflects the current energy of London style with its extraordinary buildings punctuating the skyline.
In addition to these modern touches, the traditional decoration of this historic palace shows luxury and grandeur with the marble floor, the woodwork, fabulous floral  arrangements here and there, highlighting the majestic central dome with its magnificent 1001 Baccarat crystal bubble chandelier.
The Crystal Moon Lounge is a magical place of breath-taking elegance where the classicism of furniture meets the refined contemporary.
This lobby popular for afternoon tea is surrounded by a walkway with elegant ""bergère style"" cognac-leather armchairs that invite you to enjoy an impromptu tête-à-tête in great comfort.
This indoor walkway overlooks a Garden Lounge used as a smoking or rest area with comfortable sofas around open fires with blankets available and garden umbrellas. You can enjoy a late evening sipping your brandy by the light of the many lanterns and candles.
All these subtle amenities are meant to seduce a demanding international clientele in search of omnipresent luxury.
But behind this abundance of services, this 5-star hotel is proud to provide a very personal touch to your room such a bouquet of roses, a basket of fruits, champagne, chocolates … and answers all your requests, even the most unusual ones and that with discretion.
Every detail counts ... even the pleasant and soothing scents permeating throughout the hotel.
The flower arrangements of the hotel's florist leave you in a contemplative state, facing a rare talent to transform the simplest table into true splendour.
A large and attentive staff constantly ensure the perfect maintenance of places: as soon as you get up someone taps the cushions, gives the newspapers etc…
The lifts in the lobby area have a look of yesteryear with a needle indicating the floors while being covered with contemporary bronze casts made of leaves reminiscent of those strewing the pavement outside the hotel. The reception desk is also covered with bronze with the relief of the Thames that winds along the city.
These are details that reflect the aesthetics sought during the renovation of this hotel.
The hyper-luxurious spa area is spread over 4 floors and is a must-see relaxation break after a day of shopping or an extended evening in the nearby theatre district. (See ESPA Life at Corinthia Tripadvisor)
The hotel has about 300 rooms. They all seem to have been decorated as an extension of the neighbourhood's charm. They are spacious and modern but do not obscure the magical and intimate side of the place.

The rooms are fitted with all types of  multimedia devices: WIFI, UK, EU, USB, TV, alarm clock, iPod dock, multi-function telephone, PC safe, multi-function switches on night table. Dimmable lights, air conditioning, drinks, Nespresso, tea, fruit basket, etc…
The king size beds are very comfortable.
Staff will inspect the rooms several times a day to replace towels, empty bins, tidy up the bathroom etc... all while you are out.
As in all establishments in this category, a caring staff will take care of preparing your room for the night with delicate touches like a lavender sachet on each pillow, blanket, a bottle of water and a drink on your bedside table. Slippers and a bathrobe await you in a refreshed bathroom all with a subdued light, soothing background and information for tomorrow's activities.
The hotel has 2 restaurants (see Tripadvisor): The Northall offering full English breakfast and other British dishes and the Massimo with its Italian cuisine revisited.
They both offer different styles but share the same level of excellence.
Their decorations reflect the elegance and refinement of the hotel as well as the uncompromising commitment of a know-how of the cuisine offered with impeccable service.
The Corinthia also has an extraordinary bar: the Bassoon Bar (see Tripadvisor).
The Corinthia is one of the best 5-star hotels in London, a luxury address where luxury is omnipresent. The reflection of refinement, guarantee of quality and luxury, comfort, the harmony of places, the infinite attention to detail, the services proposed seeking excellence will make you feel a privileged guest.
In an exceptional setting of great elegance and perfect refinement, the staff proved incredibly warm and helpful, anticipating requests and responding with great skill while keeping the required discretion.",5,2018,05,11
143,Weekend at the Corinthia,"My DH was able to get an executive room for the weekend and we were most impressed.  The bed was very comfortable and the room size was more than enough.   Service was topnotch as to be expected, the front desk, concierge and even security were very competent.

The breakfast buffet was delicious with a wide selection of breads, fruits and cold dishes.  Coffee was ok but order the hot chocolate that comes with marshmallows, white chocolate slivers,  whipped cream.

The only problem we found was on the lower floors, the room can be noisy with the street traffic.  But we were moved to a higher floor after we requested a change.   

Overall, it was a most impressive hotel and We would love to be back soon.  ",5,2018,05,08
143,Best value in London for a luxury hotel,"I try to stay at the Corinthia whenever possible.  The staff is terrific and the rooms are outstanding.  The public spaces are very lovely and it is worth having at least one meal in the dining room.   If you are a cigar smoker, a bonus is the ""indoor/outdoor space"" with a full humidor.  I can't recommend it more highly.",5,2018,05,02
143,‘The Best Place to Stay in London’,"I never cease to be impressed by this hotel !!! 
Set a minutes walk from the beautiful Thames Embankment it not only is the most ‘super glamorous’ hotel in London, it has unquestionably the ‘best day Spa’ in London, the staff are impeccable in their attention to detail and the lengths they go to make your stay personal and perfect !!! Have stayed in several of their stunning suites and totally understand why it’s the number one place for Royals and A-Listers ! ",5,2018,05,01
143,Night with my lovely daughter,"Stayed here before and it doesn’t disappoint, outstanding staff. Very comfortable room and spa is to die for, early morning swim was divine.  Very attentive staff ready at every point to help and advise, truly wonderful xx",5,2018,05,01
143,Tried to have a drink ,"This hotel is incredibly beautiful and having stayed here once before I often like to pop in for a little glass of something at the end of a busy week.
I was very disappointed to find that on my last visit I had become almost invisible to the bar staff. I waited for a menu or to be acknowledged and nothing happened. My partner then got up and approached the bar at which point he was told someone would be over- nothing. By the time we were approached, we had decided to leave and go somewhere else. Such a shame",2,2018,05,01
143,Best Hotel I've Ever Stayed At - Impeccable!,"After looking through countless hotels to surprise my husband for his birthday, I found the Corinthia and was completely drawn into it (possibly the 1,000 light iconic chandelier was the reason). The reviews looked stunning, the hotel rating was high, and the price was very reasonable, so I figured i'd take a chance.

I am SO happy I did!

The moment you enter the hotel, the sights and smells are relaxing and luxurious with a very spacious, yet cosy atmosphere. We arrived early at 10:30 since we figured we'd drop our bags off, then walk around. Low-and-behold, our room was ready and surprisingly upgraded since it was my husband's birthday (without even asking). The lady at the front desk asked if we had been to the hotel before (to which we responded no) and she kindly walked us from the front desk to the elevator while giving us a tour of the location with very useful information. She showed us to our room, gave us an overview of our amenities, timings, etc.. and then asked if there was anything further they could assist with.

Bravo.

I've never had this sort of first-impression services, but it made us feel so incredibly welcomed! However, this was only the beginning...

The room was beyond stunning, they left a card wishing my husband a happy birthday along with a slice of beautiful chocolate cake, and the mood was set with incredibly relaxing spa music in the background. Again, setting the standard for excellence.

We used the pool area in the morning and were blown away by the quality. I couldn't believe we had access to this! It was stunning!

When we had breakfast the next morning, the staff always appeared to be smiling and very willing to help. We didn't request anything at breakfast, but just noticing them assisting other tables it felt like no request was too inconvenient for them to assist with.

The cherry on top with location was their impeccable service. Even something as simple as coming across a guest in the hallway, they always made it their duty to reach out and greet you.

When we checked out, they asked how my husband's birthday was, how our time was, and further assistance (e.g. can I book you a taxi or is there anything I can assist with?) and it just goes to show how stellar their quality is.

I'm so so happy that we decided to go to this location and I feel as though I may have shot myself in the foot because now any future hotel I stay in will always be compared to the Corinthia. Thank you for setting the bar for excellence!",5,2018,04,30
143,Faultless,Stayed here for two nights as I was running in the marathon.  The hotel is immaculate. Our room was spacious with a lovely walk in shower and sunken bath.  The staff were all incredibly friendly and helpful and I cannot speak highly enough of them.  Thank you to all for making our stay so enjoyable.  I would return without hesitation.  ,5,2018,04,27
143,Gorgeous!!,"I booked the Northall Private Dining Room for a private work afternoon tea function and it was absolutely fantastic.  The staff where so attentive and professional but also very friendly and chatty, which was lovely.  The afternoon tea itself was great.  Lovely selection of sandwiches, I love that each person is given their own plate of sandwiches.  The cakes and scones were also exceptional and any dietary requirements were dealt with perfectly.  Thank you so much for making our event so lovely.  We will be back!",5,2018,04,26
143,An amazing stay!,"I cannot fault this hotel!

It was my first stay here over what was one of London's busiest weekends and it was just amazing.

The service you received from every single member of staff was amazing from the moment you arrived outside of the hotel to checking out was pure bliss.

Check in was easy and fast and taken straight to our room which was fabulous. 

The bed was the most comfortable I have ever stayed in.

We had a room that over looked the lovely and open air court yard.

The facilities within the room are the usual things you would find, however the within our room, there was a complete coffee making machine and a variety of coffees and teas to choose from.

We also had two robes and slippers that you were able to use for the duration of our stay and if used, they were replaced with new ones each day.

The bathroom was kitted out too with complimentary toiletries that of course you were able to take away if not used during your stay.

Fresh towels were provided everyday if required. (Usual towel rules apply).

Shampoo, Conditioner and body wash was provided too and these were products that were linked to the in-house spa, which sadly I did not use within my stay.

Rooms are cleaned every day and maids are also able to come back during the evening to make your bed (If you want to do this, there is a button near your door that you need to press) You also receive a delightful little gift and every night there is a new and different one.

Although I didn't use the spa, I did however use the pool, sauna and steam room which I think was my favorite part of the hotel.

The pool area is absolutely stunning and provides all the leisure and relaxation you may need after a tough day roaming the streets of London. 

The breakfast, that was included within our stay was also delightful and was made to a very high standard indeed.

You were able to choose from an a ray of different foods from all over and were able to choose a full English to set you up for the day. 

my partner and me also went to the saloon bar within the hotel and this was a lovely relaxed setting with a mass menu of drinks to choose from and bar snacks were provided. 

All in all, such a fantastic hotel and management should be very proud indeed of their hotel and most of all, their staff and would highly recommend this little gem situated in the heart of London",5,2018,04,24
143,Junior Suite was perfection,"My wife and I stayed for just one night and had the pleasure of a Junior Suite.  I cannot find fault with the hotel. From the moment we arrived early to drop our bags and were offered valet parking by the door man, though we only needed to drive around the corner to the car park we had already booked.  My wife used the Spa and highly recommends it.  We didn't dine at the hotel in the evening, but we did have breakfast which was sublime.  The staff at breakfast were eager to please and always attentive to any requests.  The food was cooked well and the poached eggs were exactly as we asked for.  Our room was a Junior Suite which boasts a very large room, comfortably and well furnished, with a dressing room and enormous bathroom.  The bed was very comfortable.  The only fault was the air conditioning vent was a load enough to be aware of, but this was a minor point on what was a wonderful room.  I have been disappointed by other hotels that claim to offer luxury and fail to deliver.  I can confirm the Corinthia delivers, at every turn.  Simply superb.  Highly recommended.",5,2018,04,23
143,very enjoyable stay,We have been at the Corinthia for 2 nights during my wifes birthday and had a very enjoyable stay. Very friendly and helpful staff. As per my request prior to our stay the flower bouquet was arranged and the breakfast table exceptionally reserved inspite of the weekend. On top the management did take care of excellent weather during the Marathon weekend...We will soon be back.,5,2018,04,23
143,Faultless ,"This was our second visit to the Corinthia in London, and just like our first visit it was superb. The staff are so professional and friendly, the rooms are fabulous. The breakfast selection is one of the best we have ever had. The location is great, if you are looking for a 1st class hotel with location and service to match then this is the hotel for you. We will definitely return. ",5,2018,04,22
143,Rude staff,"My friend took the private room here last night for twenty people spending multiple thousands as a treat for his husband’s 50th. He is and was incredibly polite, chose superb wines yet was treated poorly throughout the night by supercilious and rude staff. Open and offhand patronising comments littered the evening. He didn’t complain as he is too nice and didn’t want to spoil his husband’s night but the evening was capped off by him not being allowed to take us to the half empty bar at 11pm as we were too big a party and we had to wait in the lobby. Never going back.",1,2018,04,22
143,Elegance at its best!,"A class of its own ..Located just off Trafalgar Square & close to the Embankment , a walk away from the
Mall , Buckingham Palace & Piccadilly.
A Stunning 5 star hotel. 
Fabulous attentive staff. 
Beautiful Spa..total relaxation !
",5,2018,04,19
143,We keep returning,"The Corinthia is a beautiful hotel.  The public spaces are elegant and filled with fresh flowers.  The rooms are large and well decorated.  The bathrooms are decadent with heated floors, double sinks, large stall showers and tv above the bathtub.  But what makes The Corinthia special is the staff - the doormen, the people at the desk, the housekeepers. And then you have the Concierge staff.  They are the best!  They know all the new and wonderful restaurants, give ideas for each days activities, secure tickets and provide maps with full directions on how to get to any place in London or environs.  This is our home in London and will be for a long time!",5,2018,04,18
143,"Classy Hotel, Great Location and Fabulous Spa","The location is great. I love the lobby and spa which is arguably one of the best in London by far.

Another plus for the hotel will be that if your a tourist you will find the location great as its close to a lot of attractions ie No. 10, Trafalgar Square, Buckingham place etc

The room, walking shower and bath tube with tv is great too.

I will definitely stay here again 
   ",5,2018,04,14
143,A Favorite in London,"This was our fifth stay at the Corinthia - obviously we like it.  This trip was another great stay.

We had booked an Executive King and the room was not our favorite so we asked for other options.  We were offered the Whitehall Suite for a small additional amount and we loved it.  Far larger that we needed but it was fun.

Unfortunately they changed the breakfast a bit.  It was fine but we preferred the prior buffet.

We definitely recommend the Corinthia.",5,2018,04,10
143,Great stay,We wen´t for a weekend getaway to this hotel and we are so happy with all aspects of it. The service was great and the room was really nice with a balcony. The spa is beautiful and all in all an outstanding experience.,5,2018,04,09
143,Disappointing Room,"Stayed here around a month ago for my birthday. Have stayed here over a dozen times and everytime ive been before I couldnt complain. Everything has been perfect. However this last time was totally different. Im not sure if they were having an off weekend but it was dissapointing to say the least.

Starting with the room, we were granted early check in which was great untill we made it up to the room. Housekeeping were still in the room which there must have been some miscommunication there that the room was ready. She quickly scurried out, we settled in and realised that the room was'nt finished and had not been cleaned properly. Mini bar and food draw was a mess, hadnt been restocked and wrappers left in there. Beds had been rushed and not made properly. I was dissapointed. 

None the less we had lunch and gave the cleaning staff the benefit of the doubt that they would return and clean the room properly whilst we had lunch but no change once we made it back up. We told concierge and they had it resolved by the time we got back. 

The evening was great and had a great time in the spa which I cannot fault. Dinner was also superb. A good night sleep was also great and enjoyed the extremely large bath and telly.

After a good night sleep breakfast sort of ruined the stay. We went down at 9:45 for breakfast and got greeted and told to take a seat. Me and my step brother asked if we wanted to wait for our family or sit down straight away and we said sit down straight away. The lady told us it would be a 5 minute wait. We then saw 3 families come in and get seated in the north hall before us. I asked why and she said because they are a table of 3 and we were 4. I then checked there table and the table fit 4. So I was a little bit heated at this point. We then waited 20 mins and she decided to seat us in the corner of the main area where other people were being waited to be seated. We asked if we could go in the North Hall. She rolled her eyes which I thought was extremely unprofessional and I was highly offended. She eventually seated us and breakfast was satisfactory. Waited far to long for a yogurt. I mean come on how long does it take to prepare a yogurt. 

It would be great if you could get in touch about the night stay.

143,"Beautiful, elegant & wonderful service","I met a colleague here for afternoon tea and the whole setting in the open foyer area is beautiful, elegant and incredibly tranquil.  The service was wonderful, with staff being genuinely friendly and professional.  I'm always happy to see wonderful non-pretentious service in luxury hotels like the Corinthia and it made my afternoon a wonderfully relaxing affair.  It's a great place for an informal meeting.",5,2018,04,09
143,"Very good but for the price, it's not perfect","The Corinthia is a very nice hotel indeed. Why not give it five stars?  Because it is very expensive, and for that kind of expensive I expect closer to perfection and for them to be a bit more generous about what might be included. It was the small things that added up here. So you have to ask if you want a kettle to make tea in your room. Then you only get four little UHT pots of milk for the coffee machine - of course you can call and ask for more, but when you're charging £400/500 a night upwards, why not just put a little bottle of fresh complimentary milk in the fridge? And the ""double bed"" was in fact two singles pushed together with a topper so you could feel it if you rolled into middle (this is a particular bugbear of mine, but again, £400 a night upwards... if I book a double I expect an actual double, not the hotel trying to maximise it's room configuration options at the expense of guests). And the mini bar prices were ludicrous. I know hotels always over charge for these things, but again at that price a night, you might expect a couple of free soft drinks (I've certainly stayed in other very nice hotels which would do this and possibly add things like complimentary cake, biscuits, wine as well). Fyi you do get complimentary water, although ours wasn't in the room on arrival and had to be brought up separately.

So explaining the lack of the fifth star aside, it is a very nice hotel. I've been there before for afternoon tea (which was lovely) and the foyer where you eat is very impressive with a beautiful crystal chandelier/installation. The check in staff were helpful and quick, although I couldn't help but overhear the couple checking in next to us being upgraded as they had availability and them telling the receptionist that they'd been upgraded on their first stay too and how great it was, which did make us feel slightly like the poor relations! Of course they may have been very regular travellers to the hotel and so received this benefit as a reward, it was more the fact they were right next to us so it wasn't very discreet. 

The bedroom was again very nice, with a separate bedroom, dressing/wardrobe room, hall and a separate bathroom which had a toilet cubicle and shower cubicle off the main bath and sink area. The dressing room was a nice touch as it doubled as somewhere to put luggage rather than tripping over it in the bedroom. The bedroom was thoughtfully furnished with individual pieces like ornaments or art, it felt bespoke. The bathroom had a TV in it and a good selection of toiletries too (shower gel, body lotion, shampoo and separate conditioner, bath salts...). We also had a partial view of the Thames despite having a standard room. Complimentary wifi was included and worked fine. 

We ordered late room service which came reasonably quickly given the hour and the staff were very helpful, although they didn't bring many condiments so my husband asked if he could have vinegar for the chips and they had to go back to the kitchen to fetch some. By which time the chips were quite cold. The same thing happened at breakfast the next day with ketchup needing to be brought up.

We ordered breakfast in our room the next day and the lady at check in had made a point of saying it was all included so no extra charge whether in room or we came downstairs. In fact when I checked the bill later they did add a charge for both room service and a second charge. I'd have expected to pay tray service (and our decision to dine in-room wasn't made on the basis it would be free) but the staff should be clearer if they are telling people there is no charge for in-room breakfast. I'm not sure what the second charge was for (we didn't have anything bespoke about our breakfast) and I only noticed when I got home so wasn't going to follow it up. The bill itself wasn't particularly well itemised but I suspect they assume if you've got the money to stay there you won't quibble about £10 sundries. 

My husband used the spa (I didn't try it) and they were able to fit him in at reasonably short notice ( for a massage although he didn't book before arrival. He said the massage he had was great and the whole spa area itself was very calming. 

Overall we had a very nice stay and a good night of sleep (other than the dip in the middle of the bed!). The small things mentioned above shouldn't detract from that, but I feel quite strongly when you are pitching for the price bracket used by the Corinthia, really everything should be just about perfect.

143,Spa visit ,"My friend and I booked a 2 
hour spa session in the ESPA spa of the Corinthia hotel. OMG total indulgence. The hotel is Stunning and the spa decor is exquisite. Wonderful treatments , immaculate facilities and very friendly staff ",5,2018,04,08
143,Proper English Tea,"Proper English Tea that was pure elegance, opulence and sinfully delicious! The service was impeccable, staff was so kind and helpful. The room so gorgeous and everything was 5 stars. You could even have as many glutenous refills!",5,2018,04,05
143,Proper Elegance,Divine..... Sheer luxury! The grandeur and sophistication of this hotel is eminent. The location is perfect for viewing prominent tourist attractions as well. Having tea or cocktails  downstairs is wonderful. The atmosphere is beyond relaxing.,5,2018,04,05
143,Luxurious hotel for both business and pleasure,"Knowledgeable and friendly staff.  This place is in walking distance to the Trafalgar square, Big Ben, London Eye etc.  One of the most luxurious hotel that you can stay at in London.  The pool and the spa are fabulous.  Restaurants are excellent.  Room that I stayed in was nicely decorated.  The bath and the showers were just absolutely fantastic.",5,2018,04,04
143,Dropped in for dessert,"I live in London so never need to stay in one of our hotels, I just dropped in here for dessert as there was a gas leak at the pre-theatre restaurant I was using, we were all chucked out, and I missed my pudding!  Popped into the Corinthia and ordered their Eton Mess and Churchill Tea.  The tea was a lapsang souchong, loose leaf and served in white china - totally perfect.  The Eton Mess had meringue like a rock, tinned fruit, and, am pretty sure, canned cream.  Ah well, at least the theatre afterwards was very good. Maureen Lipman, you are a goddess!",3,2018,04,04
143,Over delivered in a big way,There was not a single part of the experience at this hotel that we were not happy with.  The service was a 10 out of 10.  The hotel room service was excellent.  The breakfast was exceptionally good at the hotel.  Our kids swam one day and they had a really cool pool in the hotel.  They were accommodated our family in every way.  From a flexible late checkout to walking us anywhere in the hotel when we asked for directions.  The culture of service at this hotel was something to be taught in business schools.   ,5,2018,04,04
143,Afternoon tea,"Booked afternoon tea for my partner and I as a treat for her birthday, the hotel didn’t disappoint. Wonderful surroundings and very attentive staff coupled with delicious sandwiches, cakes and scones made it an afternoon experience to remember, would highly recommend",5,2018,04,04
143,Wonderful stay!,"Stayed at Corinthia Hotel London with my girlfriend over a weekend and we had an amazing experience, everything was absolutely perfect. 
The location is central and very convenient in the heart of Westminster, just 1 minute away from the Embankment subway station and 2 minutes away from Trafalgar Square. 
The staff is very friendly, helpful and professional at the same time. Our room, an Executive King was superbly decorated, very spacious and well furnished. The bed was huge and so comfortable! Loved the heated floor and the large bathtub in the bathroom.
The breakfast was delicious and offers everything you can think about, the home-made granola is my go-to and couldn't get enough of it.
The spa is gorgeous!! The best in London. The gym is also very well equipped and modern. 
The restaurants are beautiful and the food was amazing. We had the afternoon tea and enjoyed it all, the service was very efficient, the food delicious and the setting is magical. 
Can't wait to come back!",5,2018,04,02
143,Amazing Easter Weekend,"My partner and I just spent 2 nights in Corinthia Hotel for Easter. Our executive room was gorgeous, with complimentary chocolates and a big Easter egg as a surprise. Staff was extremely nice and helpful, we forgot some toiletries items and they provided us with some immediately. 

Breakfast buffet was beyond imagination, with high quality homemade products and perfect service. We had the English Breakfast Buffet with turkey bacon and sausage as we do not like pork. Afternoon tea in the lounge was surprisingly filling and tasty, they had special treats for Easter as well. 

We also had access to the Spa for the 3 days and had such a great time relaxing in the jacuzzi, sauna, hammam... The gym is also well equipped and spacious, with a personal trainer who can give you some advice. 

In summary, we had a wonderful relaxing weekend and were honestly gutted to have to go back home! Looking forward to our next trip to London to stay in Corinthia again.",5,2018,04,02
143,Wonderful in every way ,"A wonderful experience.  The hotel is one of the most luxurious I have ever been to and definetely has one of the best spas in any hotel certainly in London.  
We also did the safari dining experience which was fantastic as we got to experience each resturant and bar area.
The entire hotel is just fabulous.  
The staff are exceptional being very professional but also very friendly which made us enjoy our stay even more. The staff also knew a lot about the hotel and it's past which I found very interesting. Will 100% return for this unforgettable london experience ",5,2018,04,02
143,Rude non-welcome,"Was looking to enjoy an afternoon tea here, having visited before. Stood in the beautiful atrium for a good five minutes where a succession of hotel staff chose to avoid our eye and walk off in the opposite direction. Finally we spoke to a staff member who was bringing coats etc to a table that was just leaving. We asked politely if we could be accommodated for tea, when he said, without even a hint of sympathy or regret, in fact with some apparent satisfaction, that we would have to wait at least ten minutes (despite the fact that this table had just become free). We were dressed smartly and were behaving extremely politely, so the only explanation I imagine could be laziness coupled with a general disdain for the public. Not what you expect from a hotel of this calibre.",1,2018,03,31
143,Northampton Bar Exceptional Cocktails,"We visited the Northall Bar in the fabulous Corinthian Hotel for a drink before dinner.
We decided to sit up at the bar and were served by Nick who makes the most wonderful cocktails. In our opinion we had the best experience in our seats as we were able to talk to Nick as he was mixing the extensive range of cocktails on offer in this bar, it was nothing less than a master class watching Nick doing his job and taking such great care with the presentation and finish of each drink. All the staff we met in this hotel were lovely but Nicks knowledge and customer service is outstanding and he is a great asset to the team of staff there.  We will definitely return and would recommend to others",5,2018,03,25
143,Fantastic stay,"Visited this hotel with my daughter at the weekend. It was my first visit, but my daughter and son-in-law are regular visitors there. I can't praise it highly enough. Our room was fabulous, and lacked nothing. The restaurant, bars and public areas were spectacular. The staff were friendly, welcoming and extremely efficient. Yes, it is pricey, but you get what you pay for, and I would say it is worth it. I would definitely recommend it, and can't wait to go back.",5,2018,03,21
143,Oscar winning location and ambiance,"I arrived just as the biggest snow storm in the U.K. was coming to an end. The Corinthians Hotel didn't miss a beat. As the travelers tracked in the salt and slush from the sidewalks the staff quickly wiped it away. Umbrella were offered without asking, and the friendly staffed warmed up the cold coming through the doors. My room, 140 was smaller than their average room but oh my, the bathroom made up for the difference. Oval white marble walls separate large shower and a deep long tub free standing in the middle of the room. Nice size TV is postitioned perfeclty so you can soak and catch the news or relax with a movie. Room service efficient, well presented and delicious. The Corinthia's location is central to attractions, museums and the theater district. The views are fantastic.  Jennifer Lawrence photos for her new movie Red Sparrow were taken at this faboulous hotel. If you have a little extra time, the spa worth a visit. One of the best in the city.",5,2018,03,19
143,Truly Outstanding World Class Hotel; Recommend Executive King Room,"My wife and I spent four wonderful nights here and enjoyed every aspect of it.  The staff was highly professional and welcoming.  The Northall Restaurant had exceptional food and service for breakfast and a pre-theater dinner.  Massimo was over the top for dinner. High tea was superb.  Suheil, the chief concierge, and his staff were always available to help and did so well.  The spa and gym were among the finest I have seen in any five star hotel.  

And the central location means that many of the key tourist sites were within comfortable walking distance (e.g., Churchill War Rooms, Parliament, Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, the National Gallery and the Globe Theater).  

The executive king rooms are especially luxurious.  They have a very thoughtful floor plan and beautiful furnishings.  The walk-in closet was great for a long stay and the all marble bathroom has the best rain shower on earth.  We had asked for a room facing the inner court yard, but one was not available.  That said, there was little street noise in the fourth floor room, probably because of the solid walls and double windows.",5,2018,03,17
143,Greatest experience ,"Loved my stay here! I stayed in the king executive suite after having a really terrible experience at another hotel. 
The friendliest staff! And the room has everything you could ask for! I was so relieved that everyone was so nice and cooperative 
You definitely get what you’re paying for (: totally worth the stay.. whenever I’m in London I plan on staying here every time ",5,2018,03,16
143,Re: Service is EVERYTHING ,"From the moment I started emailing Reservations (Anna and Gabrielle), I was made to feel that nothing was too much bother. I was planning a suprise 70th birthday luxury escape for my mother.
I took advantage of the Mothers Day package, which exceeded my expectations.  
We were upgraded from the Superior King to the Deluxe - complementary. What a great suprise.
From the TV in the large bath tub to the tropical rainfall shower - this room was simply divine!
The spa was a absolutely gorgeous! From the beautiful scent which greeted us to the abundance of robes and towels - we were made to feel special and relaxed. The pool and hydropool was a perfect temperature and the steam and saunas were not too volatile. 
I had the massage treatment by Priscilla who was outstanding! The individual tailoring I experienced from it gave an exclusive feel.
Breakfast was yummy with quality ingredients. I particularly loved the home-made granola and mum asked for a separate serving of avocado, which arrived immediately!
The doormen were very professional and helpful. They paid special attention to detail in handling our bags and putting our minds at ease. Also they were great with information on local amenities.
Location - literally across the road from Embankment tube - perfect. Easy access to Westminster, tourist attractions and theatres. We went to see Dramgirls at the Savoy, which is a 10 minute walk away.
This property is 5 stars at it's best with a real celebration of British luxury.
A pretty penny to stay here but the experience is well worth it! Go get the Corinthia experience! Highly recommended and will certainly be back.",5,2018,03,16
143,"Centrally located, stylish with great afternoon tea","Went to stay in one of its suites for a weekend at Corinthia Hotel London, which is one of the best hotels we've stayed at.

What's good with it?
- family-friendly (cot was available for our toddler, complete with some toys, organic baby toiletries, child's robe)
- suite was perfect size with an array of international plugs
- great selection of TV channels
- afternoon tea was fab featuring seasonal ingredients
- friendly service
- luxurious
- great spa
- fab restaurant with great portions; some meat are halal
- strong WiFi signal
- breakfast had a great selection, they even had century egg
- the little Harrods bit was cute and a nice touch
- so close to major London attractions especially London Eye and Trafalgar Square

What's not so good?
- the suite we were at needed a tiny bit of TLC (bathroom door was broken, rug was a tad tired, some of the skirting board were peeling) - but they are really so minor and the service was so good therefore trumps everything else.

Highly recommended for those who wish to have luxury during a staycation.",5,2018,03,14
143,Must stay hotel,"One of the best hotels that I have experienced. Very comfortable, luxurious and amazing water pressure - key for business travelers that need to wake up! Impeccable service, convenient location in London. ",5,2018,03,13

143,Weekend,"I spent a weekend at Corinthia’s recently together with two of my Friends. I’m overwhelmed over the level of service. Wow! Regardless of where we came, Breakfast, SPA or by just strolling around in the hotel we got approached in a very friendly way always with a high level of service I mind. Their breakfast is definitely my key highlight of the visit.
",5,2018,03,11
143,Best breakfast ever ☀️!,"Went to Corinthia with best friends over the weekend. And WOW! Service 5 out of 5. SPA 5 out of 5. Location 5 out of 5.
The breakfast was my favorite... So fresh & healthy - strawberries, homemade granola, fresh juice, blueberries, waffle from heaven. Egg benedict... Freshlybaked fantastic bread!
All i wanted was there ☀️! Fantastic way to start a new day with your friends in London!
We are coming back!",5,2018,03,11
143,Best hotel in London,"Amazing hotel with kind, helpful and friendly staff. Feel like royalty from the moment you walk in. Location of the hotel is something else, with a 10 minute walk to Covent garden. The spa at the hotel is also the best in London with the ESPA product and the staff working very hard to deliver the excellent customer service. 
Definitely my favourite hotel!",5,2018,03,10
143,a hidden gem,the hotel is big..BUT it never feels like it.public rooms are well laid out and cozy....beautiful flowers and lighting..the bar is great..rooms are very spacious and well equipped..loved the heated bathroom floor..the Conceirge service is outstanding as is the hotel driver  who is from Somolia and looks like Obama...he goes the extra mile for guests.. staff is very observant and efficient..can walk to 29 theaters and many pubs.great location and outstanding hotel,5,2018,03,10
143,70th birthday celebration,"Our overall impression of the hotel, including decor and amenities, was good. Dinner at Massimo was acceptable except the Dover sole which was priced at £42 but tasted stale and rubbery. Had I been told that it wasn’t fresh I would have chosen something else on the menu.
My main issue with the hotel was that, despite having paid my bill in full, they failed to cancel the £642 pre authorisation deposit as most major hotels would have done. When I complained, they added insult to injury by slapping on another £642 which decreased my available credit by a whopping £1284! Almost a week later, this figure is still showing in my credit card account and, had I not been vigilant, could have caused me exceed my credit limit at great embarrassment. It’s extremely unfair that a top hotel should not cancel immediately the check in deposit when a bill has been settled in full. This whole incident has left me with a bitter taste.",3,2018,03,08
143,Luxury at is finest,"I fi would have to describe the hotel , i would say Luxury at is finest ... First of all location is great ! Amazing raception hall. A nice terrace is on the ground floor. Here below the positive and negatives points i would have :
POSITIVE:
- Great Location
- Amazing decor and buidling
- Very Clean-
- Staff is exceptionnal from reception, to restaurants , to conciergrie to cleaners. Perfect
- Great Breakfast 
- Rooms spacious and very clean and cosy 
NEGATIVE
- The room ventilation might be a bit noisy
- Price of the restaurant but again you are in a 5* hotel so logical",5,2018,03,07
143,What a great hotel in London,"Well, london is a city where you can find the best and also the worst hotel bit it's not always a question of pricing!

Corinthia is ideally located in the heart of London near the Thames in front of London's Eye (need to go there for the sunset).

Rooms are decorated in a classical style (not old fashioned) and all the hotel is based on this thema. From my point of view, the public places in this hotel are charming and cosy what give you a warm atmosphere. 

Last but not the least, the Breakfast is amazing with a lot of of quality products and it will be a nice starting point to visit London.",5,2018,03,03
143,A wonderful relaxing evening.,"Staying in one of the river view suits in this hotel was a wonderful experience, room service was as good as to be expected, dinner in the hotel restaurant was fantastic, also the hotel gym is very good, obviously small, but as hotel gyms go it was very good.",5,2018,03,03
143,Whitehall Suite= best laid out room,"People inbox me from time to time wondering how I can afford to stay in such grand places. I use points 80% of the time, amassed over 6 years from flying and staying in smaller hotels in Australia and China. And I'm smart with my money which helps. 

I had never stayed here before and heard good things. I asked what was available and the Whitehall suite was for my 3 night stay in January. I booked it with points and $600 AUD. I can say this room was laid out so perfectly it felt like my home. interior design was nice as well, not heavy on colors and such.

I used the thermal floor quite a bit as I was recovering still from a shoulder surgery and the heat worked it's magic. Almost all staff I encountered in hallways, restaurants and the lobby were genuinely nice. Shows their managing director is doing their job right.

If you buy and use points like I do, this hotel is in a central location, close to taxi's and the tube. Please just book it now!",5,2018,03,01
143,Small Wedding Occasion,"Me and my now Wife have celebrated our wedding at the restaurant within the Corinthia in January. 

The experience is fantastic. It was a small event having only 7 guests but we really did have a great time. The service at the restaurant was outstanding. We had a team of waiting staff as well as our personal sommelier. These guys were really willing to go an extra mile for clients' satisfaction. 

We had food from one of the set menus and the quality was fantastic. Starting from starters ending with deserts it was all made with passion.

We will be coming back with regular visits for dinners with friends now. Look forward to visiting again.

PS. Location is best it can be - at the very heart of London.",5,2018,02,28
143,My Honey moon Hotel,"I will never ever forget this hotel, the best of the best and i loved it a-lot.

Its the best hotel in london by far and you will never forget the experience with them.

Am planning to have my honey moon with them very soon this year and am sure they will make it very nice  ",5,2018,02,27
143,Excellent!,"Difficult to review a hotel of this class, especially when everything you want to say has been said before, and every adjective you can think of has already been used.
Location - centrally located and close to everything you need to see in London.
Service - World class, the staff literally go out of their way to make you feel special.
Rooms- Fabulous - especially when you get one with a balcony which is a bonus.
Spa - Best in the country.
10/10 by far, and perhaps even more.
Thank you for an amazing stay, cannot wait to visit again!!!",5,2018,02,25
143,Very very disappointing Afternoon Tea.,"On Arrival 
When you arrive, the staff barely acknowledge you, regardless of what entrance you enter the hotel, there is no clear 'check in' point at either side of the afternoon tea lounge to present yourself and enquire as to where you are to be seated. We were left to wander around the tables and waited quite a few minutes before a member of staff came over to us. We stated the name of the reservation and we were seated at a table for two, even though our reservation was for three! The member of staff apologised and said she had so many bookings and got confused! We were then shown to the right table. 

Food and Teas
The majority of the sandwiches brought out were very dry and hard. We sent a few back and they were replaced. They were not much better the second time around and quite tasteless. 

The pastries and cakes were not very nice at all. All very creative with strange pairings of flavours. Very disappointing and you also don't get one of each cake for each person, you had to share them amongst yourselves - very odd.

There is nice selection of teas to choose from, however, they obviously do go cold very very quickly. We spent about three hours there and the tea was only refreshed once for us. When they did bring out fresh tea, I had half a cup of cold tea in my cup and they tried to top this up with the fresh tea. I had to ask them to take the cup away and bring me a new one. Why would you top up cold tea with fresh tea? Terrible! 

One positive is that they did give me a birthday cup cake which was a very nice touch and was delicious.

Venue
The lounge is quite plain, it's basically a standard lounge where most people staying at the hotel have their drinks and snacks. It was also very very cold. We asked for blankets as did other guests but these too so long to come out that I ended up putting my coat on!

In comparison to the Ritz, Fortnum, Claridges, this place is to be avoided for afternoon tea.

They did remove the service charge from our bill as a way of an apology but far too many mistakes to put me off going back again.",1,2018,02,25
143,Splendid hotel,"I stayed here recently for 2 nights. The hotel and the customer service was really excellent. Check in was efficiently done by Paolo, who then took me to my room. There was only a Nespresso machine and he asked if I would like to have a kettle as well to make tea, which I did. I asked also for an iron and board. All was brought to the room quickly. The room itself was nicely decorated. The bathroom was very big and had a rain shower and a separate bath tub. As said the service was good, breakfast was also really nice and the  bar in the hotel had a wide range of drinks. 

I went twice to the gym which is very modern and big. The location of the hotel (Whitehall, close to the Thames and Embankment station ) is fantastic. The only remark I have is that the bed could be a bit longer as for me as a north European is was just a bit too short. 

Summarized, a great stay, very helpful staff , so if you have the opportunity to stay here, do it!",5,2018,02,22
143,Dr P,"Fantastic customer service and facilities at the spa. I will most definitely visit again. Without doubt the best spa I have visited in London.

Very close to embankment tube station so travelling not an issue.",5,2018,02,22
143,World class spa,"I travel all over the world and always make time for the spa and so my expectations are high. I was delighted with my experience. One of the most beautiful spas I've ever seen,beautifully designed. I had a small request for a friend's birthday that was with me and we were really looked after by sheila. She gave wonderful care towards us,made us feel very special. Only negative I have if I was  pushed is that spa food is a little limited and nothing indulgent on menu. I will be back and highly recommend anyone looking for a world class spa to head to Corinthia.World class facilities with world class service.",5,2018,02,20
143,Perfect weekend away,This was a wonderful experience from start to finish. The staff were excellent. We had a room upgrade and it was lovely. The spa is incredible. We stayed for my 40th and couldn't have enjoyed it more.,5,2018,02,19
143,La Dolce Vita,"Probably simply the best hotel! I am particularly in love with the humidor and Garden Lounge. The service is impeccable, the food is an epicurean's delight and you will find the most beautiful cigars and whisky to end the eveining before retiring to your room. Perfect bliss.",5,2018,02,13
143,Family treat,"We stayed for my wife’s birthday with our two boys and it was amazing. Make time to go to the Spa, I think it’s probably the best in London. Breakfast was also exceptional. Staff were super friendly with lots of little touches that made the stay special. We will be back. ",5,2018,02,12
143,Perfection,"The Corinthia is an exquisite hotel with beautiful, spacious rooms. After running around London all day we’d look forward to decompressing in the rambling, palatial spa. The service was impeccable at breakfast, housekeeping, the spa, concierge and the doorman. I have no complaints. Perfect location near embankment, Trafalgar Square and Covent Garden. ",5,2018,02,12
143,Awards Night at the Corinthia,"Very lucky to have stayed in several great hotels in London over the last 2 months including the Savoy and the Rosewood. The Corinthia tops them both. The hotel is in a great location, the staff are very welcome and friendly. Room was superb and the details were lovely. Small selection of handmade treats on arrival and handmade chocolates on each pillow as we went to bed. 

The room was very quiet and breakfast was also excellent. 

My girlfriend and I both think this must be London’s best kept secret where hotels are concerned. ",5,2018,02,10
143,New Year’s Eve ,"Amazing time! They continue to be professional and friendly. The rooms are big, clean, stylist and homey. Great location to watch the fireworks! We got free tickets to watch the London parade, a great treat. ",5,2018,02,08
143,Dinner and theatre trip,"This is a very nice hotel and tastefully decorated .We went to the Northall restaurant  and had a lovely 3 course meal with champagne before going to the Charing Cross theatre which was just round the corner.The service was good and I accidentally left a make up bag in the Ladies.When I phoned them up ,it had been handed in and they were so helpful and returned it to me by registered post.Will definitely return.",5,2018,02,06
143,Sophistication at it’s best,Came across this exquisite hotel near Charing Cross as was out celebrating my birthday and wanted a nightcap before heading home.  Spent a delightful hour in the bar listening to the most amazing and beautiful singer Megan McConnell sipping our expresso martinis.  The bar bill was nearly as expensive as our dinner at L’Escargot in Soho but it was a wonderful end to a brilliant evening 💞,5,2018,02,05
143,CFO,"Impeccable service and beautiful venue.  Received an upgrade to the top floor, where the skyline view of the eye was memorable.  Understated elegance of the highest quality.  Location is extremely central to many places (The Tate modern, Coventry Garden, shopping ...)",5,2018,02,05
143,Drinks and nibbles,Absolutely amazing hotel. Very plush high end and pricey hotel. The excellent staff make you feel very comfortable. The food and drink are also very good. Will definitely return. Location is good for West End theatres. ,5,2018,01,30
143,Excellent Hotel,"The staff is amazing with smart uniforms, the room service menu is excellent, the bars are great and the place is immaculately kept. The room was extremely well appointed and the bed was very comfortable. The room service was very good, as well.",5,2018,01,30
143,Top class hotel,"The location of this hotel is wonderful, right next to Embankment tube station, and a very short walk from Trafalgar Square. 

I booked this hotel under an American Express offer, which entitled me to lots of additional benefits. We had a bottle of champagne on arrival in our room, £125 of food and drink credit and breakfast. 

We were upgraded to an executive room, which was amazing. We were shown to our room by a very friendly man called Alex, who said that the bathroom in our room would be very memorable. He was quite right, it was fantastic, with lots of marble and a huge bathtub in the middle of the room. Definitely the best bathroom I've seen in a hotel!

The bed was huge and extremely comfortable. There were plugs by the bed and the WiFi worked well. 

We used our food and drink credit for a lovely meal at The Northall restaurant. The food was superb, with lots of great British dishes on the menu. The service was very good, as it was throughout the hotel. English breakfast in the morning was also very good, with lots of options.

We had complimentary access to the spa, which is absolutely amazing. It has a huge amphitheatre sauna, a steam room, standard pool, hydrotherapy pool and more. It's definitely worth checking out, it would cost non guests nearly £100 for 3 hours!!

I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are looking for a top quality hotel in a good location for exploring London. Whilst the price is high, the hotel definitely does as much as it can to justify the cost. If you have an American Express, search ""Amex Corinthia"" to find out more about the great offer that they currently have.",5,2018,01,29
143,Exceptional Service and exceptional comfort...WOW!,The location was perfect. The hotel itself is stunning. This is one of those places where every detail from check-in to check-out is seamless. I highly recommend staying here and I cannot wait for our return!,5,2018,01,23
143,First class,"Probably my 5th stay at this property.  My go-to London hotel.  Excellent location for theater buffs.  Steps from major historical sites, the National Gallery and the circle line tube.   Each room is unique, so some can be cozy and others spacious - room size is cheerfully reflected in price (see room layout in attached photo). So you may want to request a specific room.   Breakfast is excellent.  Concierge desk was incredibly helpful with advance reservations and very well informed.  Smiles abound.  ESPA soaps and shampoos are lovely, as are the heated bathroom floors.  Excellent prix fixe pre theater dinner in their dining room.  This property is a bit challenging to get to from Heathrow (a car may be your best option) and bar prices are a bit steep, but I am already looking forward to my next stay.  ",4,2018,01,22
143,Breathtaking,"We went to The Corinthia Hotel for Afternoon tea and it was one of the best experiences we have had with Afternoon tea. The sandwiches and scones were very tasty but the cakes were so beautiful and sophisticated that you almost could not get yourself to eat them, but it was the décor and setting that took our breath away. All the wonderful flowers was just the icing on the cake and added perfection to an already superb afternoon. ",5,2018,01,22
143,One of the most Beautiful Hotels in the World,"The Hotel is Exquisite. The Architecture, The Interior Design are with out equal in the London area.  The service is the BEST that I have experienced.  The food is of the highest quality and flavor.  The Chefs need to have have a standing ovation.  
The spa is Beautiful, The men's steam room, sauna and lounge are superb.  Such a wonderful design was the men's  spa.  That I booked a second stay within a month. 

The staff and upper management was attentive and very well trained.  I must put a small comment in.  The General manager was a bit out of reach.  I needed to speak to him.  He did not contact me.  I requested an audience with him and apparently was refused.  In spite of this very poor decision  made by the General Manager.  I still give this hotel my highest compliment.    

Sincerely Kenneth Bordewick",5,2018,01,21
143,Sheer magnificence,"Think luxury. Think Corinthia London. As soon as you enter the hotel, you feel like royalty. This is one property which has gone all out to impress its guests. And it has everything going for it too. To start with, Corinthia London’s biggest advantage is its great location. With Trafalgar Square, River Thames, London Eye and House of Parliament being just around the corner, the best of London is literally at its doorstep.

Corinthia London is opulent. As soon as you walk in, you are welcomed by the grandeur of the Crystal Moon Lounge, illuminated by a spectacular Baccarat Chandelier.  With hypnos beds, Loewe TVs and Italian marble bathrooms, the rooms are as modern as they can get. The penthouses are mindblowing! 

One of the biggest strengths of the hotel is the food. The Northhall is all about the Great British Cuisine. The setting is plush, the menu is vast and the taste is excellent. Whether it’s breakfast, lunch or dinner, your taste buds will be satisfied. The other restaurant, Massimo is brings the best of Italy on your plate. The fine dining restaurant has the most delicious Italian food infused with bold flavours which is created with passion. The Crystal Moon Lounge is perfect for afternoon tea and yummy cakes.

The biggest attraction of Corintha London is the ESPA Life spa. Spread over four floors, the spa features 17 treatment rooms, a private suite, a Margaret Dabbs London nail studio, a Daniel Galvin Hair Salon, a thermal floor with an indoor swimming pool, vitality pool, amphitheatre sauna, ice fountain, private sleep pods… phew! Haven’t seen a relaxing space as vast and expansive as ESPA Life. This is de-stressing mixed with indulgence.

Our stay at Corintha London was a memorable one. The friendliness of the staff made it even more special. If you are planning a trip to London, highly recommend this hotel for your stay. This is the one of the best the city can offer.",5,2018,01,21
143,Wonderful city centre hotel near Trafalgar Square,"We have stayed in this hotel more than once now and we regard it as one of the best we have ever stayed in.  Despite the size of the hotel, the service remains excellent and the rooms are spacious, comfortable and beautifully appointed.  The facilities are wonderful, without doubt one of the best spas we have ever used, there is a lovely bar with great cocktails and we enjoyed both restaurants.  We would recommend this hotel for business travel, for couples on a romantic break or for families who want to be within walking distance of all of the sights.",5,2018,01,20
143,Excellent staff and good hotel in london,"We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights and everything's was perfect, spacious and clean room, WiFi, good breakfast, good location and above all the staff. The manager and his crew was amazing friendly and ready to solve any your requests. ",5,2018,01,19
143,Without question the BEST hotel in London!,"I have been fortunate enough to travel across the world staying in some incredible 5 star hotels and its very very rare to find one that actually does meet the grade.  Corinthia is one of the hotels that is without question a luxury hotel.  From the minute you are greeted by the superb doormen, to the extremely knowledgeable concierge staff, who will literally cater for your every need.  I have visited this hotel now on many occassions because Ive been spoilt and no where else will quite match up!  A good example of a true 5 star hotel is how they will deal with something that isnt up to parr and sadly our 1st trip had a couple of issues but I am delighted to say that nothing was too much trouble and the staff went out of their to make up for it.  Its the attention to detail that makes a real 5 star hotel and thats where this hotel thrives. The public areas are beautiful and adorned with incredible floral displays.  A visit for afternoon tea is a treat in itself.  Also this hotel one of the few left that doesnt make you feel a leper for smoking.  But its the Spa that really is out of this world, and quite probably the best spa in  London!  The only problem I have with this hotel is we never want to leave! Going back in 2 days to celebrate my sons and my birthdays, no other way to celebrate. Londons number 1 hotel!",5,2018,01,18
143,Continues to Excel,"We returned to the Corinthia recently for a four-night stay and the hotel hasn't missed a beat since our last terrific stay. The staff was as attentive as we wanted them to be (and totally accommodating/reassuring when the card we'd used to check in with got fraud alerted back in the States), the room was well-appointed to the point of luxury, and the common areas were beautifully decked for the holidays. The location is excellent but it's all the extra touches and attention that will keep us returning here as often as we can.",5,2018,01,15
143,5* Hotel and 5* Service,Thank you Corinthia Hotel for a unforgettable stay at your hotel. We took advantage of everything the hotel has to offer including the amazing ESPA and restaurants. We ate in the Lobby yesterday evening for drinks and bites very good! The room was beautiful and extremely comfortable we certainly felt at home. We took advantage of the breakfast which was very good thank you to the chefs! Please thank Bellen from the Lobby who made us feel very welcome and gave a great 5* service. Hope to stay again soon.,5,2018,01,14
143," Very nice stay - 5 nights","We had a good time at Corinthia. We stayed 5 nights in an Executive Room. The room was smallish (which is to be expected when you aren’t in a suite) but the bathroom was enormous. I initially felt the water wasn’t hot enough but by the third night I either got used to this or the issue went away!

Room service and turn down service is good. Every other night they left a small chocolate on our pillow. 

There is an odd noise you hear all the time - bzzzzzzzzz...bzzzzzzzz...bzzzzzzzz (its soft and it happens every 15 seconds or so consistently - in room 422) - it was fine for me but could be distracting for ppl who need complete silence to fall asleep. 

There was a small separate walk in robe type area for our bags which was very helpful and ensured the bags didn’t clutter the space in our room. 

They supply dental kits without you having to ask for them which was great but the sinks in the bathroom are reeeeeaaaallly shallow. Because the water drains very slowly, the sink quickly fills up with all your gunk (eg tooth paste you spit out)while you are still using it and starts to look gross. I learned to overcome this, also by day 3 by opening the taps only very slightly so that the sink has time to drain. 

Also - the hotel might want to consider changing the decorative mirror. It’s a beautiful mirror and reminds me of the big  chandelier in the lobby - but it’s too hard to keep clean and better a simpler decorative ornament than a beautiful one with grime all over the tiny mirrors cause that can make the rest of the room Feel unclean even though it isn’t.

There’s a beautiful restaurant Massimo on site and tea in the lobby area - we tried both and they were good to have for the times we didn’t want to go out. The hotel bar has good service .. its nice but it’s got a slight canteen feel to it - I’m not sure why.. I think it has to do with the tables they use (which by the way are quite high compared to the seats so watch out if you are short!).

The concierge was good in our dealings with him which involved him booking us a car to take us to the airport and the driver was very sweet and stopped over at my old home along the way so we could take a photo. He was great and the car was also extremely comfortable and luxurious.

All in all it was very good. Yes I’ve pointed out a few niggly little things but it must be so incredibly difficult to run a place like this and keep it consistently good every day for every person in each of their experiences. They’ve done very well in meeting that brief!

",4,2018,01,14
143,New Years Eve,"Fabulous stay. Sheer luxury and with VIP position for London fireworks you couldn’t ask for more. Food fantastic, not cheap by any means but great value for money. Really must be best hotel in London, all future stays in London will be the Corinthia from now on. 
Staff are very attentive and enthusiastic, a rarity now days. Can’t speak highly enough of this wonderful hotel.",5,2018,01,12
143,Wonderful Hotel,"I was at the Corinthia in November and it was an inspired choice. The hotel was decorated for the holidays and was truly beautiful.
The location was superb for me as it is near Trafalgar Square and I could walk to the theatre. I could also walk over the bridge to the Southbank to get to the Tate Modern and the National Theatre - two of my favorite places.
Service was excellent as well.",5,2018,01,09
143,Fabulous Hotel,"Fabulous 5 star hotel!  Beautiful, clean & great location! Abundant extremely courteous staff always willing to help & please. .Experienced concierge personell who recommended great restaurants  &arranged for theatre tickets.Great food &terrific spa & gym! Would return in a heartbeat!",5,2018,01,08
143,Superb,"One of the best hotels in the world. Classy, well located, great staff, great rooms. Italian restaurant not as good as North Hall. Great bars. A place to treat yourself, and someone you care for. Although ones instinct is to walk the river, explore behind the hotel. The palaces and Downing street are next door.",5,2018,01,07
143,Beautiful hotel,"We stayed at the Corinthia over Christmas and had a very pleasant time here! 

All staff was very friendly professional and helpful and the rooms spacious, elegant and well equipped. Since we weren’t able to enjoy the breakfast downstairs, which was mainly because of the perfect mattresses, we enjoyed it directly in our room which was simply define. 

The spa is suburb and the gym is one of the best equipped hotel- Gyms I have ever seen.

Overall another wonderful london experience surrounded by a luxurious ambient.
",5,2018,01,07
143,Drinks and bar food,"My friend and I have this hotel bar as one of our stops on our Christmas cocktail crawl. 

The setting is great, the staff wonderful and the food is amazing. 

It’s not cheap but worth every penny for a special occasion in my opinion. ",5,2018,01,07
143,Palace Royal,"If you have not experienced the Corinthia hotel you are missing out.  It is 5 star bonus. Incredible location across from the London Eye just minutes from Westminster and the West End.  You are basically a street away from Trafalgar Square so you have the National Gallery, endless great restaurants, and tons of theaters.  Then the hotel itself is spectacular.  Just when you walk in you will go ""wow"". The décor is fantastic.  Lots of professional staffing to meet, greet, and fill all your need needs.  The rooms are spacious and clean!  The best though are the heating floor and towel bar in the bathroom.  Pretty great.  If you have time the Spa is world class.  Heated lounge chairs and incredible pools, steam and Sauna.   You will feel like royalty during your stay",5,2018,01,05
143,Beautiful Hotel & Ideal Location,"There are so many great hotels to stay in London but we were so glad with our choice of the Corinthia Hotel for our spring break. 

Every element of the hotel is absolutely beautifully designed and classic. The spa, pool and health facilities are top notch. The restaurants and in-room dining were also very enjoyable. And the room itself was very spacious, clean and extremely comfortable. Every staff member made an effort to make us feel like welcomed guests. And the concierge team was incredible and were successful in helping us secure  restaurant reservations. 

We recommend the Corinthia to all of our friends who are traveling to London.",5,2018,01,04
143,Amazing New Year!,"Just want to say a huge thank you and ""Happy New Year""  to ALL of the staff who made our New Year stay so special. Everything and everybody was superb. The staff must have been so tired, but it didn't show. What a memorable New Year!",5,2018,01,04
143,A STAY CHOICE WELL MADE...REWARDING EXPERIENCE !!,"WOW...yes that's what comes to mind the moment I think about our stay at Corinthia hotel in London...A super value for money hotel...an amazing experience right from the word Check in...Smooth check in...gracious bell service and above all cozy rooms ! A great grand lobby area which takes you back into the colonial era of luxury living.
A super and Sumptuous spread of buffer breakfast with alteast 7 to 8 kinds of eggs to order...an Asian box on order and 8 types of hot / warm drinks to choose from. What could one ask for more from a hotel where you are just being pampered like a star or a celebrity. 
A definite stay...however the budgets have to be taken into account while choosing to stay here....but as they say...who said that luxury was ever cheap ?? Happy Staying and keep it up all of you at Corinthia !!!!!!",5,2018,01,03
143,Beautiful hotel with great service & spa ,"Stayed in January 2018 for a one night stay after going to the Ballet. Beautiful hotel with immaculate service. Everyone we met was very professional and the stay was without any problem. Breakfast is slightly over priced but expected at a lovely hotel. 
The views are great and the rooms are huge. Tvs in the bath is a bonus - ours didn’t work but the staff quickly sorted it out. 
Lovely from start to finish. Would definitely recommend.   ",5,2018,01,03
143,Worth a stay,Beautiful hotel with beautiful spacious rooms and friendly staff. Breakfast is also good. Would stay there again if and when I visit the city again. Lovely Christmas decor too. And most of all beautiful bathrooms .,4,2018,01,02
143,"Fabulous hotel, amazing Spa!","I was fortunate to stay at The Corinthia hotel for three nights over New Years 2017. This is a fabulous hotel - although quite compact in size which is a little surprising from the outside. 
The rooms are fantastic, amazingly luxurious and well equipped (although an iPhone compatible speaker or bluetooth speaker would be a nice touch and was a surprising non-addition). The bathroom was amazing and both the shower and the tub are hard to get out of.
Very odd bar system on NYE in the main room where you had to pay in advance for drinks in a queue system - as one other guest pointed out, for a hotel of this standard it's odd to have to pay for each round of drinks in advance!
But aside from this, and a slight hiccup we had with servicing our room on time, the hotel is amazing and I highly recommend it. 
For NYE in London it's perfect!",5,2018,01,02
143,Lovely hotel,"Me and my wife were treated by friends, easily one of the best hotels I have stayed at. Great service, a Spa that was something I had never seen before. Luckily we stayed on the night of the GGG and got to meet some celebrities as well. They had their Christmas decorations out as well which was really nice.",5,2018,01,02
143,AVOID AFTERNOON TEA!,"I wouldn't usually write a review unless the experience was totally amazing or totally disappointing. I am sad to report that in this instance it's the latter! 
We visited the corinthia hotel for afternoon tea on a Thursday afternoon before Christmas as a get together and to celebrate a friend of ours birthday. There were five of us and my 18month old baby.
On arrival I came up the slope entrance and had to struggle to open the big door because there was no one to help. This didn't bother me so much at the time, but on reflection, in a hotel like this I don't expect to have to do this, especially with a baby in tow! 
I then had to approach the doorman on the main entrance to ask where the baby changing facilities were; I was told they were in the ladies toilets. They weren't, they're in the disabled toilets. They were actually good facilities when I found them, very clean and as to be expected in this calaber of hotel. 

When the other guests arrived, we were seated on low level seats which looked very nice but aren't practical when there are more than two of you sitting closely together, and most definitely not with a young child. I had requested a high chair when booking, but had to ask twice before someone brought me one! 
When we were asked if we would like some water, we had waited already, so we asked for champagne whilst we were looking through the menu, at this we were told we'd be brought water and then can order with the menus! 
We all opted for festive tea with champagne, with various tea selections. I did enquirer what the chocolate tea was, and was told it tastes quite like chocolate. There was no recommendation or conversation with the wait staff. Our champagne arrived, about an hour later our sandwiches were plonked down, no explanation of what was in them or anything. Half of everyone's were left, we were not asked if everything was ok, and had to go and find someone to clear our plates. The sandwiches were left because they were pretty tasteless and unexciting! And yes, a sandwich is a sandwich, but we've always gone to the ritz for Christmas tea (this was to make a change) and we do get plate after plate of beautiful sandwiches there! 

When the sandwiches were finally cleared away, we did complain to one of the guys briefly to say service had been super slow and that the food wasn't nice, the guy just said ok and left! Our cakes were then brought out, but in all honestly by that point we were just fed up of waiting and beyond hungry. The cakes were ok, nothing amazing, but weren't bad. 

Getting our coats back from cloak room was difficult because the staff all did their best to rush past, avoiding eye contact at all costs! When we did get someone, my pockets had been emptied so them had to wait some more whilst they looked for the contents! 

They did refund our champagne on the bill, but no apology or recognition that it was a sad excuse for a London Christmas tea!

I left with a really disappointing experience and a hungry belly! My daughter, was never acknowledged or catered for, and this I can understand had we not called ahead and asked if it was ok to bring her! Couldn't recommend you avoid afternoon tea here enough! 

Did want to write to hotel to complain but their response was so bad in person that I can't see an email doing better! 

Too many disappointments!",1,2017,12,29
143,Expensive but not meet our expectations ,"My husband and I choose to stay in this hotel because of our previous experience. But this time, the hot didn’t meet our expectations. 
This hotel is in a prime location. However, if you are muslim, consider that the bidet pipe inside the toilet not working in most of the rooms as we were told by hotel’s technician. Also all the sinks have drainage problem. 
Though they changed our room, but we had sink’s drainage issue till last day of our stay. 
All staffs are very nice and friendly. The hotel’s room service was amazing. They clean every morning and re check in the evening. If you are staying in this hotel, you should try pool, Jacuzzi and sauna. 
Though, it was not as clean as our last stay. There was lots of dirt on the back side of jacuzzi. 
Breakfast buffet has lots of variety. However, it is expensive and you should be careful when you get the bill. Every day we had issue because of wrong calculation. 
Also it took very long to bring my boiled egg and I had to cancel my order. we complained to manager mr. Nicholas and he was so nice to consider and gave us a complementary breakfast.
When we wanted to checkout, I asked for late checkout because of our flight time and they were nice to extend it till 2 pm instead of 12. However, from 1:30 they keep calling and come to the room and asked us when we will checkout.
Since it is a luxury 5 star hotel and it is an expensive one, I can not accept these issues. It is not worth the money we paid. ",4,2017,12,28
143,Great hotel!,"I stayed in 4 times in this hotel and can only recommend it!

Great, spacious and modern rooms. Amazing level of service from the hotel and banqueting staff. 

One of the best hotel gyms I’ve been to. The hotel offers good quality spa and hairdresser. 

",5,2017,12,25
143,Exceptional!,"I stayed at this hotel on a week's business trip and am very happy I did.  I found everything I needed and wanted.

Several good restaurants allowed for several on property dinners while having choice of variety.  Breakfast was perfect, a plethora of choice, well prepared, delicious and well presented.

The rooms are spacious and well appointed and the bathrooms big and luxurious.

Regarding service, housekeeping stood out for me, delivering great service, but in honesty, all interactions with the staff were great, smooth and pleasant. Nothing was too much or too difficult to handle for them, great team!

The cigar lounge and garden is a great spot to kick back and relax.

The concierge team and business centre also provided excellent service, very efficiently.

Finally, the spa is nothing short of impressive and the location worked out very well, close to everything and easy driving access.

Easy to recommend and book again.",5,2017,12,23
143,The last word in luxury.,"The Corinthia London is simply in a class of it's own. And if I could leave the review at that, I would. 

Situated minutes from Piccadilly Circus on leafy Whitehall Place, and with rooms offering a breathtaking view across the Thames and to the London Eye, you couldn't wish for a better location.

Walking into the Corinthia, you instantly feel at home, even though you are surrounded by wealth and opulence on all sides. Check-in is a breeze, and you will soon be whisked through the lobby, past the peaceful, log-fire-heated atrium and up to your room.

The rooms are large, with floor to ceiling windows allowing you to take in the views. The lighting and air-conditioning controls let you tailor everything about your space and set the temperature ""just so"". The beds are supremely comfortable and I challenge anyone to wake up and not feel like they have just had the best night's sleep of their life. 

The staff, as you would expect, are top notch. Never more than a moment away with all the answers, they are a highlight of the experience. 

If you have deep enough pockets, the Corinthia London will undoubtedly be an unforgettable experience.",5,2017,12,19
143,Great stay at the Corinthia,"We had a wonderful stay at this luxury hotel. It's not super central in terms if you want to be near knightsbride, mayfayr. But it's not more than a 10 min walk and then you are close to the areas. You are right by trafalgar square. nice restaurant and nice staff. beautiful rooms and wonderful service. would stay here again. luxury at its best.",5,2017,12,19
143,AMAZING!!!!,"Me and my husband have stayed in some really nice hotels but booked this for his 30th birthday. What a place! They surprised my husband with a slice of birthday cake and a bottle of champagne when we got up to our lovely room to which they upgraded as an extra treat. The service is excellent, staff are lovely and it’s amazing value for money in such a lovely, classy hotel. Plus room service was fabulous! From now on we will only ever stay at the Corinthia when visiting London. Mrs Stonebank.",5,2017,12,19
143,"Lovely spa, great location","We stayed for a weekend in December.  Location is great, 2 mins walk to Trafalgar Square.  The rooms are very comfortable and I love the door which separates the sleeping area from the main door into the room, why don't all hotel rooms have that, to drown the corridor noise?  The spa is gorgeous, and the pool warm, which was blissfull.  The only downslide would be the service... the concierge seemed not to know when the bansk are open or where the nearest one is, which is kind of part of the concierge job description I would think, and the wait at the check-in was a little annoying.  Apart from that, lovely hotel.",4,2017,12,18
143,Lovely lunch,Had lunch with friends in the Northall Restaurant and it was really lovely.  The restaurant itself is absolutely stunning.  The food was delicious - we had a 3 course set lunch with glass of champagne for £32.  The staff were attentive without being too intrusive.,5,2017,12,18
143,The best hotel in London. ,We’ve stayed in many of the top hotels in London but you must treat yourself to stay here. Spacious suites and the most expensive comfortable bed you will ever sleep in. We stayed last New Year’s Eve which was superb. ,5,2017,12,17
143,Friendly and helpful staff,"I had dinner in the northall on Saturday evening. I just want to say thank you to the gentlemen in lobby who were friendly and welcoming and to the gentleman who offered to take photos of my friends and I in your stunning lobby. 

It was truly a memorable visit. ",5,2017,12,17
143,BEST HOTEL IN LONDON,"Positives: Great Location, Great Spa, Amazing service, Luxurious Room, Top quality food, Brilliant skyline views.
Negatives: Very Expensive, For me there were not any more negatives.

£400 for a night here is dear. However you pay for what you get. You will not find a more elegant, classy hotel in london like this, with such good service.",5,2017,12,15
143,Fantastic hotel!,"This hotel was amazing. The service is really good, the rooms are big and comfortable, the spa area is a big ""don´t miss"", and the breakfast was just wow! Best egg benedicts I have ever had. The location is also great, close to a lot of restaurants and walking distance to a lot in the area.",5,2017,12,14
143,Nicest hotel I've ever stayed in,Beautiful hotel.  Rooms have every comfort you could possible want.  The amenities are top notch.  Staff bend over backwards to help you.  Great location.  I felt like a rock star staying here.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat.,5,2017,12,13
143,Best in London,Spa day and dinner - I took 5 friends to the Corinthia for a Spa day (2hrs of treatments then time in spa) and then dinner at Massimo restaurant. I had not been before and can honestly say that it was one of the best days I have had in London. The levels of service and warmth from staff are far above what I expect from a 5 star location. I look forward to booking it all again,5,2017,12,11
143,Not a weekly treat but not a one off either ...,"Super handy location for each of us four friends trying to arrange a neural but different Friday night! For the length of time we were there and what we had = brilliant value ! Started at 5.30 with champagne cocktails and left at 23.00 @ £125 a head. Starters (pics below ; crab and Avocado plus terrine with brioche) steaks and venison, sides ; excellent Bottle of Gavi and two cote du Rhône. Will definitely be back ! (& as I said to one of my friends walking to the station, we’ve spent loads more than that, quicker, on worse nights & bet we will have felt more dusty in the morning! ... i was right! 😂) 🥂",4,2017,12,10
143,Lives up to its reputation ,"In the midst of the hustle and bustle of business travel, it is nice to spend even a few moments in the oasis of the Corinthia. The room is spacious and divine, the personnel attentive and if you can spare even a moment for Christmas Cheer, try the hot chocolate. It is worth every calorie! ",5,2017,12,10
143,Exceptional,"My wife and I spent a night here. We arrived at 10am and the room was available. On top of that, they gave us a fantastic room upgrade!
The hotel is beautiful, modern but classic. The room was excellent with lots of space and nice touches, like a tv to watch in the bath, a Nespresso machine and separate walk-in wardrobe.
The breakfast was very good and without exception every member of staff was professional and helpful.
In summary, we loved it. Having stayed at many of the top hotels in London, this is definitely up there with the best.
",5,2017,12,10
143,"Great location, excellent service","i stayed here on business for two nights last week. It was my first visit here, having previously stayed at the Royal Horseguards and other local hotels.

The service on check in and check out was first class and my room was nicely furnished, although pretty small (two people would have been tripping over each other).

Would definitely stay here again.",4,2017,12,10
143,Lovely hotel,"Lovely hotel in a very convenient location for a stay in London whether just for business or a mixture.  Within walking distance of Covent Garden but also close to the Houses of Parliament and other worthy institutions.  Staff are well trained and friendly, public rooms beautifully decorated and bedrooms comfortable if a little on the small side. Would certainly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,12,08
143,Top choice! (but do something about the staircase),"It is very difficult (or very easy) writing a review on the Corinthia as everything, from the decoration to the service, and from the size of the rooms to the completeness of the amenities, is simply great and could be a reference to other hotels.  
Only one issue: between the reception level and the lobby / elevator level there is an 8-10 steps staircase. I had a small carry-on, so that was not an issue for me.  But there was an Asian lady with a luggage the size of a small car and there was nobody there to help her bring it up.  She waited for several minutes and at the end I felt obliged going down and help her carry it.  Again, no hotel personnel was there to help us. And over my 3-day stay, I’ve witnessed the same situation several times.
Other London hotels (eg the Mandarin) have staircases between entrance and reception or elevator but also always available people to help one with the luggage.",5,2017,12,07
143,Spectacular,"First class hotel.   Beautiful lobby, rooms, restaurants and wonderful staff.  We stayed there for 6 nights and it was wonderful coming back at the end of every day!   Loved all the restaurants there, food was fabulous!   Location is also great.  Across the street from Tube station, walking distance to many great sites.  I can't imagine staying anywhere else when visiting London!",5,2017,12,07
143,Excellent 5 star hotel in a great location,"I selected the Corinthia for its quality and location in the city: the river is very close, and a lot of hot spots are within  walking distance. The hotel itself is also a gem: a nice mix between the classic London style and modern chic. The staff was genuinly nice during my whole stay. 

The room (Executive suite) was wonderful. Nice layout with a hallway, walk in closet, large bedroom and separate bath room. The dressing had plenty of space for storage, and a built-in safe that was free of charge. The bathroom has a walk-in shower with rain and hand-held showers, a separate toilet and a large bath.  I really appreceated the heated floor. The bath has a wall TV with floatable remote control: what a nice feature! The bedroom had a very large and comfortable King, small table with two chairs and a separate lounge chair. There are enough electrical outlets for charging phones, tablets, ... and there is one US and one EU outlet available (in case you forgot your adapter): all hotels should have this. Lights-off or on can be controlled at bedside. Internet was included and was good throughout the hotel. 

The hotel spa is great and should be visited. The pool is rather small (more for lounging than actual swimming, I was told), there is a glass-walled sauna, a steam room and a very large bubble bath. The room is full of fire places, which add to the atmosphere. I also had a treatment which was very enjoyable. The dressing rooms have sleeping pods for those in need of some actual rest. There is a lounge that serves healthy food and teas. I had a very refreshing lemon and ginger tea. 

There is a gym, but did not use this during my stay. The hotel was nicely decorated for the end of year season. 

I did enounter a few concerns during my stay. 

The hotel breakfast buffet is expensive (£30) but does not deliver on choice. The basics are covered (croissants, jam, a few bits of cheese and salami, cereals, ...) but that's it. There is a big list of items on order (omelets, toast and avocado, ...), but these are not included in the price. The first morning we waited quite a long time for our tea and orders to arrive.  However, the quality and  overall service during breakfast are outstanding with a lot of local English products. 

I had lunch at Massimo (Italian restaurant) and loved the choice and quality of food, except one mishap. My main course (macaroni and ragu) contained some small shards of sharp bone. I think this was rather a problem of the butcher than the kitchen, but it was annoying. I reported this issue and the dish was comped.  

On the second morning we had no hot water in the shower. This was a hotel wide issue so not much could be done about it. I did receive personal apologies from the duty manager, and a compensation. 

All in all I would definitely recommend the hotel, for the quality of service, rooms and location. I would stay again.",5,2017,12,01
143,Wonderful attention to detail,"Where do I begin to describe this hotel, let’s start it’s not cheap nor is it extravagant. They have thought of everything down to the individual favor at turndown time. The room was elegant, bathroom on one side, bedroom on the other side, and both separated by the entrance hallway leading to the walk-in closet. The bathroom is elegant, dual sink, bathtub with in-bedded tv for those hard days. Separate shower with ceiling flow that reaches the proper temperature in an instant. Towels that have a thread count off the scale! Like I said, the details. This hotel is also in a very good location to just about everything. A block from the underground, a short walk from Westminster Abby, parliament, the eye, Big Ben, the Thames, China town, theater district in the West End, and on and on.

Worth every penny!!!!",5,2017,11,27
143,Corinthia London is the Jewel in the Crown of Luxury London Hotels,"From the moment the liveried doorman met our Taxi I knew we were in for a treat.  The Reception Staff were most welcoming and beautifully dressed in smart grey stripped outfits.  We were escorted to our room and had magnificent room service.  The Spa is the best in London if not Europe.  

Hotel just glistens with charm, ambiance and thoughtful surroundings.

Recommend it highly. ",5,2017,11,27
143,Drinks and snacks,"Met some friends here in the late afternoon.  The hotel is grand and beautiful.  A mix of contemporary and traditional.  The drink menu was very diverse and interesting.  Lots of unusual cocktails.  I ventured into the bar that features a piano built into the bar and was amazed.   Very cozy and intimate, however was not open at the time.  The staff inside was incredibly nice and volunteered to tell me about the history of the bar and hotel.  I would highly recommend this bar.  The staff was amazing!  Thanks for the history lesson!",5,2017,11,26
143,Amazing lunch,"We had a delicious lunch. Calves liver and mash to die for, pasta amazing and everyone thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Delicious Rose wine to compliment. Outstanding building and surroundings. Attentive staff. We will be back.",5,2017,11,26
143,Great experience!!👌🏾,"I had the pleasure of spending the night at this establishment and the experience was a fantastic one based on several people in specific. Firstly I had the pleasure of meeting the concierge who on seeing me as I happened to come in to the building from the back came up to me immediately offering assistance, offering to carry my bag and pointing me in the right direction (Swift response in customer service) 

Next was during the evening as I was experiencing the fantastic hotel I had the pleasure of meeting Aysun - Spa Director (Fantastic hospitality!!) made me feel extremely comfortable and relaxed, very tactful and informative and this was reflective in every meeting I happened to have (several times) during my stay. Very professional within her position!!

Lastly the service I received from the whole   In house service was secondary to none, extremely professional, made me feel and understand why you have a 5 star rating and completely on point!! 5 star all the way!! 

Great work!!👌🏾👌🏾",5,2017,11,24
143,BEST 5* HOTEL IN LONDON,"There is nothing negative to say about this amazing 5* hotel situated in Whitehall, London.
The hotel is beautifully decorated, spotlessly clean and has a wide range of facilities.
The staff are all polite, friendly, helpful and professional.
The bedrooms are spacious with all mod-cons.
I look forward to returning again in the future.",5,2017,11,22
143,Paradise,"Booked the hotel for spa and overnight stay, everything was just amazing from the checking , spa facilities and the room we was speechless for me and my other half we was in paradise, we definitely going back ",5,2017,11,21
143,My new favourite hotel in London - beats Mandarin hands down!,"Stayed for 1 night with wife last week, having never visited before.  Over the years we've stayed at virtually every posh / upmarket London hotel, but this was a new one for me.
Up until last week I'd've said that the Mandarin Oriental was the best in town, but not any more!
Exquisite - everything was absolutely exquisite.  Gorgeous architecture, lovely big room, magnificent drench shower, friendly & efficient service, lovely bars & restaurants.
What really tipped it above Mandarin was the people - the staff were all friendly and very human - not all stuck up and looking down their noses at you like Mandarin people tend to.  Made for a very enjoyable and welcoming experience.
We will definitely, definitely be back - thanks a lot!",5,2017,11,20
143,"If a Hotel was a potential life-partner, this one is a ""keeper""",Actually Love this place - second time here. pricey but worth it. Lots of luxury and mostly great service. Top location and luxurious rooms...and bathrooms!! I actually made a two minute video room - review. Here it is:,5,2017,11,12
143,Cocktails and lunch,"Dropped into the Corinthia for cocktails and lunch re a show over in the Playhouse and it was just fabulous.  Lovely, friendly service, the food was beautiful and tasty with a cracking bottle of wine recommended to accompany it all. Honestly couldn't fault it for lunch and dying to go back and stay over properly.",5,2017,11,12
143,"Corithian hotel, the best!","I usually travel to London 2-3 times per year for business and leisure reasons. By the past I had some negative accommodation experiences. This year I have discovered The Corinthian hotel London! Just....amazing!!! Overall just...excellent in all issues: rooms, housekeeping, front-desk, reservations, doormen, bars, breakfast, meals etc.! The most important is that all staff is smiling and professionally pamper you at all moments. You feel how much they enjoy their hospitality tasks and they make the difference. My most big congratulations to the Hotel Manager, Mr. Mirko Cattini-à brillant, effective, smart, hands-on and leader professional and to the company, too. Thank you all! You have made The Corinthian to be onwards my ""warm home"" each time I will be in London!!! Cheers!!!",5,2017,11,11
143,FABULOUS!,Absolutely stunning hotel! Beautifully decorated and amazing flower arrangements. Very helpful and friendly staff. Enjoyed delicious tea and scones at the Crystal Moon Lounge. Had a really enjoyable afternoon and my clients were very impressed,5,2017,11,10
143,Another wonderful stay at the Corinthia London,"Recently stayed at the Corinthia again, I believe it was my 10th visit overall. Love this hotel. Rooms are great, staff are super friendly and efficient.

Particularly like the Basoon bar for a cocktail in the evening and the delightful bar staff in there.

Looking forward to my next visit.",5,2017,11,05
143,Service unbeatable,"Always loved the Hotel. This was the first time we had been to Champagne Afternoon Tea. We were not disappointed. We were looked after Royally by Maggie. The armchairs were comfortable and the food, as you would expect from a Hotel of this calibre, was great. The Amuse Bouche to start was a nice touch, the scones included a Lemon Curd with the Jam and Clotted Cream. I love Lemon Curd.!!! The five varieties of sandwiches were very unusual and tasty, as were the sweet delicacies which again were creatively put together.  We were not hurried at all and indeed spent a couple of hours taking our time and enjoying the lovely Crystal Moon Lounge. The beautiful flower arrangements all over the Hotel looked and smelt great. A wonderful way to spend a couple of hours in London before seeing a show.",5,2017,11,05
143,"Excellent Hotel, Friendly Staff","We recently stayed at the Corinthia to celebrate our sixth wedding anniversary. It was a wonderful experience and we can't wait to return. The hotel staff and facilities are outstanding. 

We arrived before normal check in time and the staff were kind enough to offer us a complimentary glass of Champagne in the Crystal Moon Lounge whilst house keeping prepared our room. 

During our stay we really felt as though nothing was too much trouble.

We were delighted by the complimentary room upgrade we were offered, alongside the lovely cake and chocolates to help celebrate our special occasion. We enjoyed afternoon tea in the Crystal Moon Lounge (lovely!) and later that evening spent time in the Bassoon Bar which had live music and superb cocktails. 

Our room was elegant, spacious and extremely comfortable. The bathroom featured a large bath with television and a waterfall rain shower. The view of the Thames was superb. 

The hotel is ideally situated and within walking distance of Oxford Street and Piccadilly Circus.

We would absolutely recommend Corinthia to anyone staying in London especially if its a special occasion. Thank you to all of the staff for making our stay so special. We will be back!",5,2017,11,04
143,Exceptional everything in such a classy hotel 👌🏽,"What to say? 🤔 Perfect! 👍🏻

Here are our top preferred @Corinthia's
- Rooms
Since we were 2 adults and 2 children, we booked 2 executive rooms. The parents were upgraded to a junior suite with bow window (gorgeous) next to our kids executive room with their special amenities. The rooms were spacious and so luxurious with the perfect decoration and amenities (everything you can expect and more)

- Northall Breakfast
Everything you wanted from viennoiseries to eggs via dim sum with efficient service.

- Crystall lounge tea time
English team time is an institution and at Corinthia they respect the traditions! The tea (Corinthia's Welcome Tea...) is so tasty and so the pastries and scones and... 😋

- Bassoon Bar
Jazzy with singer and pianist the week-end. Delicious near the fireplace!

- ESPA SPA
Incredible luxury, the space is just amazing with water facilities off all kind for a city SPA. A must must thing to do one at the hotel. They just have very restricted child policies.

A special thanks to Yannick, the Golf Key Concierge who made our stay so perfect: He was attentive to everything from must-see visits to restaurant reservations (yes indeed you'd better go through a renowned hotel to book a Michelin restaurant since all of them have strict cancellation policies...).

Go without hesitation if you are looking for a luxurious hotel at a perfect central location in London and if you can afford it 😄!",5,2017,10,31
143,Corinthia-Never Disapoints,"Staying at the Corinthia, for us, is like having a home in London with all the services anyone could ever ask for.  The best and most pleasant staff from the concierges to the ""turn down"" people.  A location, again for us, could not be better a tube station across the street and the ability to walk to Mayfair, museums through beautiful gardens.  The restaurants and the food and service are very,  very good.There is no place better to stay.",5,2017,10,30
143,Superb hotel and excellent location!!!,stayed here for few days ... love it!!! the entire hotel is well managed and maintained. Room is definitely decent size and super comfortable. The gym and spa are excellent. Staff are all rounded well trained and attentive. Very impressed with this luxurious hotel standard. Highly recommend it!!!,5,2017,10,29
143,Fantastic ,"Second time at this hotel. Staff is fabulous, courteous, knowledgeable, professional. Lobby and restaurants very good and stunning. Spa is one of the nicest and most dramatic I have ever been in... Ask for a massage by Hezmat; he was incredible. Rooms - the showers are the best I have ever been in, white Calcutta marble everywhere. Spacious, quiet rooms, and hotel is planning a update which will be great. Location is great for theatre and Westminster, right across from embankment station. Hard to stay anywhere else!!",5,2017,10,28
143,Luxurious Weekend in London,"This was our second stay at the hotel and it continued to meet our expectations. On arrival, we were offered a complimentary room upgrade from Superior King to a Deluxe King. As our son was staying with us, we opted for a further room upgrade to Executive King at an additional cost of £60 plus £20 for breakfast. Despite a late check in, the hotel swiftly arranged an extra bed for our son and arranged for a small birthday cake for my husband, which was greatly appreciated. Our room was beautiful and we loved the bed, underfloor heating in the bathroom, the power shower and bathroom amenities (ESPA). My husband spent the entire day at ESPA Life at Corinthia London and loved every minute of it. My son and I joined him after a day of shopping and absolutely loved the Thermal Floor with their indoor swimming pool, vitality pool, amphitheatre sauna, ice fountain, marble heated loungers and private sleep pods. The vitality pool is my favourite part of the Spa and although sad to leave, I left relaxed and refreshed. As we had checked out earlier in the day, we used the spa Change and Chill areas and had access to a wide range of amenities to ensure a smooth stay. The hotel staff are friendly and helpful. A special thanks to Raphael at Reception desk for a smooth check-in and Sunny for assisting us during check-out/visiting the Spa. A very special weekend and most definitely will return!",5,2017,10,24
143,Corinthia doesn’t disappoint ,"We love the Corinthia. Our second time staying and it was as expected. Jacob again, was the ultimate host in the Garden Lounge. Superb cocktails and always a definitive selection of Havanas in their perfectly climate controlled humidor. Food, rooms and service make this on of my all time favorite properties anywhere. ",5,2017,10,23
143,Stunningly Superb Luxury,"A most beautiful hotel from reception, to bars, restaurants the spa and leisure. 
The floral displays around the hotel are truly fantastic.
The food in both the restaurants was excellent.
Our room was absolutely lovely, and the housekeeping of our room ensured it always remained so.
The staff are brilliant the service throughout the hotel was impeccable.
The hotel is located close to the centre of London, near the Thames, Covent Garden St James Park, Whitehall, Trafalgar square, West End Theatres and many more attractions but in a very quiet street",5,2017,10,23
143,"Definitely a must stay for London, one of the best! ","This was our third trip, the Corinthia London is a perfect 5 star and could be rated higher, the service is impeccable which is sometimes difficult to find in London, the food is fantastic and all the hotel has to offer is top notch with an a beautiful Spa in a prime location, it actually has everything you could want, the rooms and suites are beautifully appointed and very comfortable, it is currently our favourite hotel in central London and we will back and recommend to all, it's also very family friendly as well as being an ideal romantic stay or a luxurious base to experience the city, world class! ",5,2017,10,22
143,"Excellent stay, superb spa","This is a top quality hotel. Rooms are a good size and the service is perfect, from reception, to the bar and the spa. The latter is a bonus and gives it an edge over older hotels of similar price or quality. Bar areas lack a bit of charm and atmosphere than older more famous hotels, but not a complaint. ",5,2017,10,22
143,Fabulous evening! ,"Visited last night for dinner, we had such a lovely evening and we were so well looked after by everyone. The place felt so friendly and welcoming and is beautiful inside. The cocktails we had in the Bassoon bar before dinner were amazing and so well made. Our sommelier Giorgio was so friendly and helpful and made our evening very special :) Thank you! ",5,2017,10,20
143,Fantastic hotel to meet friends for cocktails.,"Fantastic hotel to meet friends for cocktails. The bar has such a great ambience with live pianist playing contemporary tunes. The cocktails are amazing - tasty and stunning presentation. The level of service is brilliant and worries of the day slip away. You should try the oysters! If you want fresh air the courtyard just off the lounge is brilliant (quiet and relaxing).

Notes from a wheelchair:
Access is great. Service is fantastic. ",5,2017,10,18
143,Beautiful London hotel,This was a beautiful hotel with first class rooms and service.  There was nothing that the staff would not do to help.  The bars and restaurants are nice and there is a garden courtyard that we loved.  The room had every possible thing you could need and was perfect.  The complimentary coffee with wake up call was greatly appreciated and a nice surprise.  There is a beautiful spa and hair salon too.  Loved this hotel.,5,2017,10,17
143,"Efficient, Elegant 5 Star Luxury.","We spent two nights here and loved every minute of our stay.  It’s a beautiful building throughout and our room was spacious, clean and quiet.  

The service is second to none - staff are well presented, attentive (yet discreet) and appear happy in their work.  Nothing is too much trouble for them.

What we really liked about Corinthia though was the whole ambience of the place - civilised, elegant, unstuffy, relaxing - and it’s run like a tight ship. Well done.

We were VERY impressed and will definitely stay again.",5,2017,10,17
143,Five Well Deserved Stars!,"This is an exceptional hotel.  I arrived in a cab from the train station and the bellman called me by name as I stepped out of the cab.  Clearly, he had read the tag on my luggage while getting the bag from the cab.  Nonetheless, this was an impressive bit of customer service that set the tone and carried through for my entire stay.  The check in process was perfect, with just the right amount of care and attention, including walking me to the appropriate elevator (contrast that with what is sometimes typical in other hotels, a statement similar to ""it is across the lobby and on the right.""

My room was spacious and very well appointed, with all of the latest room control technology.  A round table was a nice touch in place of the typical desk.  The tub and shower were separate and very well appointed.  The WiFi was fast and reliable.  The spa/fitness center is a bit oddly spread over several underground levels, but all are top class.  The gym has a wall size TV and ample cardio and weight machines.  The spa offers a pool, sauna and steam and standard spa services.  The late night room service dinner was quite good.  Finally, the location is very convenient, about a three minute walk to the Embankment tube and perhaps 5 minutes to Trafalgar Square.  I will stay here again.  I've previously stayed at two different Grange properties, the Andaz, and the Hilton Tower Bridge and this was vastly superior (and those other hotels are quite nice in their own right).",5,2017,10,16
143,"Fabulous, elegant and well appointed","This is a beautiful hotel - the restaurant/bar area near the reception always has the most beautiful flower arrangements.
The food here is excellent, as is the service - I have been to many, many conferences here and it is always excellent.
The rooms are gorgeous and very well appointed and you can't beat the location.
They have a great little outside area where you can have some drinks and sit by a fireplace - which is very cool in central London.",5,2017,10,16
143,Elegant Exceptional Hotel in Many Regards,"The reviews are spot on when it comes to this lovely property.  A very quiet hotel that is located close to the Thames, Covent garden and right around the corner from Trafalgar square.  I do not know how you could beat the location.  The breakfast is very good though the service was unexceptional.  The Italian restaurant on premises is simply magnificent.  Rooms are large and contain most every accommodation a business traveler or family could want.  The spa is to die for, perhaps the best in London, and the gym has every piece of equipment that you could every want.  The only hitch with this place is the front desk.  Nice girls but I cannot say they have that ""can-do"" attitude that you find at the best five star properties.  Nevertheless, this is a great hotel that will not disappoint, either for business of for family fun.",5,2017,10,14
143,One of the Best ...Every bit the 5 Star Promise ...!!,"Had the opportunity to spend 6 nights here recently for a conference with over 200 of our Staff , Agents and Promotors from Mexico ...

I have recommended this to everyone already as it was one of our best dining experiences yet! 
We will be returning soon to the bassoon bar, we both loved the vibe here the live music was amazing and cocktails beautiful thank you corinthia for this experience was definitely one to remember ",5,2017,10,09
143,"Phenomenal product, fantastic breakfast - you are up for a treat!","The hotel product is phenomenal with new thinking on so many levels.  The quality of the hotel product (furniture, decorations, art, wood details, beds, linen, shampoo/ soap...) is absolutely first class.  It is tranquil, elegant and sophisticated without being stuffy and dull. Our 8 year old daughter was amazed to find a bathrobe and slippers her size.  The breakfast is one of the best I have ever had - variety on offer and the quality of the poached eggs cooked to order.  I have a long list of positives, and here they are:  fresh flowers everywhere, you walk through the flower room to get to the breakfast room, lobby also has an outdoor patio with a fire place, an amazing spa, the complimentary and top quality olives served with drinks, the variety of fruit offered over breakfast, the quietness of the hotel room.  If you can, upgrade yourself to the next room type!  You are up for a treat.",5,2017,10,08
143,Elegant hotel with stunning interior and top service,"I've been here twice during my stay in London for business.
Having stayed in certain hotels competing on similar levels like the Dorchester and 45 Park Lane I must say this is one of my favorites .
Great for business , Solo or even couples.",5,2017,10,05
143,Special place,"Love this hotel! Stayed here on business and had a company conference here as well. The staff couldn’t do enough!

Helped with a conf call, rejigged equipment when needed; supplied plenty of coffee, sugar and snacks to keep us going!

Rooms are lovely as well and all in the heart of London.",5,2017,10,04
143,Loved this Hotel,"From start to finish everything was exceptional. We stayed 5 days and could not have been more pleased. Our room was beautiful, the common areas are beautiful with lovely fresh flowers everywhere, the staff are all very accommodating and friendly. We ate at Massimo for lunch and service was as good or better than any fine dining establishment. We took advantage of the delicious breakfast buffet every day. The drinks from the bar are made by a truly great mixologist. We took full advantage of the excellent concierges who arranged tours, car travel and dining. Arriving or leaving the hotel we were greeted like old friends. The location is very convenient for walking or touring London. Will definitely return.",5,2017,10,02
143,Exactly as we hoped!,"This hotel deserves every positive review it gets. We just got back from spending a week at the Chamberlain and I will happily recommend it to anyone planning a trip to London. Every member of the staff was outstanding (special kudos to Debra and Anika at the front desk and to the charming bar tenders in the pub) to the location of the hotel and the room itself ... it was all perfect. Our room was more spacious than I expected and housekeeping kept it looking clean and pretty. We had dinner in the Fullers Pub our first night there (delicious) and a nightcap there 4 more times. They even offer a FREE smartphone to use while you're in town. It's called Handy and it was pretty cool to have. I particularly liked the location of the Chamberlain. It's very close to the Tower of London (which was really fun) and to three underground stations. We used the underground to get everywhere. The neighborhood where the Chamberlain is located is real London, not Tourist London. It had great pubs and restaurants and we felt like we were in the heart of the city. In fact we were sort of amazed when we got to the part of town everyone recommended (near the Theater District and closer to Parliament and other attractions). It was soooo crowded and frankly overwhelming. As we walked around that area we kept remarking that we were grateful we didn't have to spend all our time in the tourist area. If we go back to London (and I hope we do ... so much fun) I will definitely stay at the Chamberlain again.",5,2017,10,02
143,Perfection in every way,"Living close to London a hotel stay is extra special and we were absolutely overwhelmed by this beautiful hotel. The decor, the architecture and the amazing spa were all outstanding and yet the welcome, the staff and the general ambience made us feel very comfortable. Location next to Whitehall and the river were also terrific. A memory I will treasure",5,2017,09,30
143,A Great Night!,"We booked at short notice for a cheeky night out in town without the kids!
The Corinthia sits in an excellent location in the heart of the West End close to theatres, shopping and the river.
The valet parking facility is well worth it and our car was well looked after!
Check-in was very welcoming and we were escorted to our room and shown around the excellent facilities in our room. We were upgraded to an executive room which met all expectations! 

The concierge was extremely helpful and found us an excellent restaurant for an after theatre meal within walking distance of our theatre.

Breakfast the following morning was varied and delicious.

The Hotel was immaculate and there is little to criticise. One minor criticism is the quality of the TV in our room. There was a poor picture for the short time that we watched but this did not affect the enjoyment of our stay. 

We would definitely stay again!",5,2017,09,28
143,Free flowing champagne menu at the Northall,"Wonderful dinner at the Northall at the Corinthia. Such a beautiful setting, fantastic staff and all for £45!! We are coming back for another celebration in October. Utterly stunning! The whole hotel looked absolutely flawless and right next to embankment station. Seriously, a no-brainer ",5,2017,09,27

143,Best hotel ,"Love this hotel. Been here many times when the price is normal.  I'm writing because of something really cool... I was the only one in the pool, it was dead calm.  As I lay floating looking at the ceiling the under water in floor lights had a picture on the ceiling of my head.  I could see my heart beat creating waves of water emanating from head.  Great trick, water has to be calm.

Love Corinthia!",5,2017,09,24
143,Best Hotel Ever ,"I will never forgot my visit to this hotel during my stay for 3 nights, i had the most exciting nights ever Great location Services and Staff 

All was perfect and i will visit this hotel every time i come to london.
",5,2017,09,22
143,Beautiful Spa & Location :),"I am writing this review quiet late, we stayed here on the new years eve and it was every bit wonderful, this is so wonderfully located and so central, London eye and the Big beg is walking form here, everything is right around the corner, the service is great from the door man to the reception you are treated royally, we got special bands to stand in the  Fireworks viewing zone and watch the majestic fireworks the whole area was closed to public, only the guests staying in the hotels inside the viewing area were allowed and these bands were the identification for the same. 

The spa is most wonderful and expansive , its got everything you can think of, the water jets the sauna ,the pools and the resting areas in the spa are very beautifully set up. 
The restaurants and the decoration during christmas is beautiful and the huge chandelier in the lobby is Iconic. 
However there was no view from our room, we also stayed at shangri-la at the shard and the view from there was Incredible. 
To conclude i will say, you should stay here if you want to stay central and close to the attractions and for there fabulous service.Do not miss the spa.",5,2017,09,21
143,Amazing !!,We have just stayed at The Corinthia for two nights to celebrate my fiance's 50th Birthday.  From check in to check out we were extremely well looked after and all staff were polite and friendly and always had a smile. We were upgraded to an Executive King room on 7th floor which had views of the river. The hotel also sent some complimentary gifts to the room to make my fiance's Birthday extra special. Thank you to all at The Corinthia for a wonderful weekend and we will definitely be back for the next big celebration.  ,5,2017,09,18
143,Lovely Long Weekend,"Booked this hotel for my husbands birthday and it was beautiful from start to finish.
We booked an Executive room which was lovely and the staff where always on hand.

We had dinners in both restaurants and they catered for us being vegetarians which we appreciated and the food was different and lovely.

Hotel is very well kept and staff were very friendly.

It isn't a cheap hotel - so something we could only do once and they do add service charge on everything.",4,2017,09,17
143,Number 1,"One of my favourite hotels in london. The location is amazing. Views of the London eye and the Thames. 
The Spa in this hotel is the best I've been in and I've stayed  in luxury hotels all over the world. The restaurants within the hotel are phenomenal, bespoke dishes galore. 
The rooms are very spacious and comfortable. 
I highly recommend this hotel regularly to friends and colleagues.",5,2017,09,17
143,I went to London 9/7/17 to spend four days trying to see as many plays a as possible in that period of time.,"My experience at the hotel was amazing as it has been many times before.
The location is very convenient to the theaters and the attractions of the city.
The rooms are luxurious and spacious .
The staff are friendly and attentive . I especially appreciated Lilly's smile and demeanor
at breakfast .
This is really my go to property in London .",5,2017,09,16
143,Gorgeous Luxury,"The Corinthia Hotel London is centrally located, employs a friendly and very attentive staff and has gorgeously beautiful interiors. Silly me, but it is also a great people watching spot. I have spotted celebrities walking through their lobby which is a fun extra touch. One can't go wrong staying at the Corinthia.",5,2017,09,16
143,Great hotel. Adequate food,"We loved the hotel and appreciated there being at least two people at the Concierge desk at most times of day.

We tried all the dining rooms and had adequate food in each.  Somewhat disappointing since there are so many excellent restaurants nearby.  Service was also quite slow in each dining room.

Excellent location.",4,2017,09,15
143,Epic location and decor,"I went to a function at the Corinthia and it was absolutely amazing in terms of food, drink, atmosphere, friendly staff, attentive staff and cleanliness. I didn't occupy a room within this hotel but the bar and staff overall, were super. 

Corinthia London combines grandeur and heritage with modern freshness. Featuring seven penthouses, two world-class restaurants, the award-winning ESPA Life at Corinthia spa and much more, the hotel is a destination in itself, minutes from the West End and the River Thames. Some of their facilities include:

24-hour gym, concierge, and in-room dining for all guests, and 24-hour butler service to penthouses
Ensuite marble bathrooms with Tropical Rain Showers and under-floor heating
Award-winning ESPA Life at Corinthia spa
Thermal Floor boasting experience pools and showers

I would definitely book a stay at this hotel!",5,2017,09,07
143,Central,Stayed here over night for a business trip. Nice and central.room spacious and very clean. Would stay again. Staff very friendly and helpful. Only stayed for a business meeting so didn't use any of the facilities.,4,2017,09,06
143,Lovely as always,"No matter how many times we visit,we always come away with a smile on our faces.The staff are second to none and are always so welcoming.The food is excellent and the ambiance wonderful.Well worth a visit .",5,2017,09,06
143,"Come as a Guest, Leave as a Family","The Corinthia hotel is a family owned hotel, in the old Ministry of Defence Building, next to Trafalgar Square. For all of us who visit London many times a year, it is a must stay hotel on your next visit. As it is only 5 years old, the regulars, may not know about it. 

The hotel is classic and yet so modern, everything is automated. The rooms are large starting at 44 sq ft. I still wonder re the fetish of staying on Oxford Street in a match box size rooms when you can stay 5 minutes away or 8 Pounds Uber ride away from Oxford or Bond Street in a gorgeous hotel.

I had the opportunity to view the suites. Some of them have private elevators. One is designed like a lawyer's study with books lined all across the walls. Another has bevelled mirror tiles adorning the walls. The private balconies with the panoramic views of Central London are perfect to propose to your girlfriend over champagne.

I have to mention the bathrooms - they are like luxury rooms - better than the rooms. So if you love a fancy bathroom, don't miss the Corinthia.

The 1 million pounds Baccarat crystal chandelier in the lobby will take your breath away. Yet it is so understated, that unless you are told that this was the 1st LED chandelier that Baccarat made, you would never know.

The fanciest Afternoon Tea with best best scones in town. The cream was just right, the jam home made. The eclairs to die for. The service - A Grade.

By the end of the stay, the team, knew exactly how to fold my clothes, how many bottles of water I needed, it was just like home, all in a matter of 4 days.

A special mention to the Front Desk - while straightening my hair, smoke came out from the electrical socket. So I mentioned the same to them. The Executive very calmly asked me, if my straightener was working or not. I would have thought, he would be more concerned with his socket. By the time I returned back to the room, the socket was changed, the straightener checked and put back in its place. The service was so discreet, that I only noticed as it was nicely folded back.",5,2017,09,06
143,Amazing staff.,"Stayed one night at this amazing hotel. The staff are so friendly down to earth and nothing is too much trouble. It was my mums 60th birthday surprise and we had afternoon tea there, which was brilliant. All the extras was much appreciated by us both. Dined in the hotel for the safari experience, which I would highly recommend. Can't praise this hotel any higher if I tried. Keep up the amazing work.",5,2017,09,03
143,Just perfect,"We attended a wedding nearby and came to stay here at the corinthia to treat ourselves and we were not disappointed. Everything from the decor of the hotel and rooms to the fresh flowers was just stunning.
We had breakfast in the morning which competes with the bestie ever had. 
We stayed in a suite and the luxury was just amazing. 
I would say this is probably of the best hotels I have ever stayed at and would highly highly recommend it to anyone!! ",5,2017,09,01
143,Luxurious hotel,"The Corinthia Hotel was a great end to our 4 week European tour. The hotel itself has a great location: being walking distance to Trafalgar Square, London Eye, Big Ben, Westminster, etc. The lobby is gorgeous. Flower arrangements everywhere, and plenty of seating to enjoy a cup of tea, admire the surroundings, and people watch. Staff all greeted us with a smile, and made us feel welcome.

We booked a family room for our quick 2 night stay and while the room was large with modern decor, the view was a huge disappointment. There was literally no view. It was a dark, facing a 3 other walls, and the only source of light was the tiny opening several floors up. It reminded me of a small elevator shaft. There was insufficient lighting in the room as well, and when combined with the dark furniture, made the room feel gloomy and alot smaller than it was.

We didn't have time to eat at the restaurants for lunch/dinner, but did have breakfast every morning and room service. Room service provided great quality food, and the buffet breakfast had a large selection. As well as more flower arrangements and a beautiful setting. 

My only issue with this hotel was the driver was had on both the arrival and departure. He was nice and made some conversation, but definitely had a sarcastic attitude, and was really annoyed me was how he handled our luggage when placing them in the van. He would throw them around like garbage bags, hitting them on the back of our chairs, having no care in the world. I don't recall his name, but on our arrival, we were praying we didn't get him again, but were sadly disappointed.

Reason for the 4 stars was the room view/quality and the service provided by the driver. And on top of that, nothing really stood out to make this stay excellent. Would I stay at the Corinthia again? Probably not. It's a nice hotel with good staff, but I could have/would have had a better experience at the Four Seasons.",4,2017,08,30
143,You deserve such a treat!,"One of the best pampering stays in the world. Rooms are spacious which is very rare for London.
Once you are in the hotel after the flight or train head immediately to their spa centre, with the warm jaccuzi pools. Mindblowing and stressremoving place. Breakfast are royal. Location is great indeed both for walking and travelling with public transport.",5,2017,08,30
143,Luxury treat ,"Booked 1 night stay for me and my daughter. From the moment we arrived we were warmly welcomed and they upgraded our room and it was just beautiful. We ate a lovely lunch I was craving caviar and it was tasty daughter had a burger which she said was lovely . Waiting staff just so friendly and chatty. We used the spa and expensive but treatments were wonderful. 
The bed was uber comfy and loved the tv in the bath. Will definitely be back to the hotel as it's so worth it. PS they change their flowers seemingly every day and the smell and look of the fresh displays just adds a special touch ",5,2017,08,29
143,Six star luxury. ,"Wow. Six star luxury a stones throw from Trafalgar square. Nothing was amiss in this newly renovated and top tier hotel. It's not cheap but you will feel like a millionaire and be treated like one. 

The hotel is beautiful to look at, the rooms designer (like the rest of the hotel), the food out of this world and the spa amazing. 

",5,2017,08,27
143,Family trip,"Spend 4 days in London with the kids. Fantastic hotel and very gentle staff. Can't say a bad word. The concierge did a fantastic job to find us last minute a diner with a view. 
Very well placed to visit London. Underground richt next door. Taxi's waiting in front of the door. Great pool and spa facilities. Superb",5,2017,08,24
143,科林西亞 - a convenient location...,"This hotel offers quite a good bargain if u do not need to stay in one of big International Hotels. Service is good, staff are very attentive & above all, its Location is good, a 5 min walk to the National Gallery, & a mere 1 min walk from EMBANKMENT station. But since this is not your 5 star hotel, the rooms are smaller in comparison, & u do need to call house keeping should u require standard supply of shaving kit & tooth brushes. The house keeping can be sloppy at times in minor details, such as no refill of the bars/fridge,  a slow pickup of calls by House Keeping, & i had a left-behind cleaning cloth yesterday.",4,2017,08,23
143,Lovely Experience,Great service. This was my first time visiting London and will absolutely go back because of the great experience I has at the Corinthia. The staff is amazing and the hotel is lovely. I could not have asked for anything better.,5,2017,08,22
143,Perfect wellness experience!!☀️,"Hotel Corinthia London, 5 stars Location and surroundings (great, close to all the tourist attractions, wonderful staff experience but more to the point one individual young lady who I remember because of the (outstanding, very helpful, knowledgeable, courteous, way she made me feel from the start until the end!!) Her approach and customer service is what I would expect from a member of staff at such a high end hotel when paying for a treatment and it's for that as to why I have even taken the time to write this. The management need to employ more staff like her and I will be telling my friends to request her in future as to receive such outstanding customer service so thank you Laura as it was a perfect contribution to my holiday to London!! 🇬🇧🥂🍽🛩",5,2017,08,21
143,Mix between Business and Joy ,The hotel and service are one of the top in Great London. I have a series issue with small room but this hotel has all size and you choose what fit your needs. The gym is amazing and trainers are available all time. ,4,2017,08,20
143,Mixed," Stayed at the Corinthia with my wife and 3 children during our stop over in London to watch the tennis at Wimbledon and the he cricket at Lords . The hotel is absolutely beautiful but our check was not good at all as we were asked to wait whilst our rooms were been prepared and this was after contacting the hotel and informing them that we would be arriving at 14:00pm and becos be we're travellimg with children would like the rooms interconnected. We were only taken to our rooms an 1h30 min later and the rooms separated and far apart . After some enquirers with the duty manger we then had to downgrade our rooms from executive to delux to have the rooms together . The stay after that was excellent. But checkout was a problem again . If  the check in and out was better I would have given the Corinthia a big 5 stars , but there is room for improvements.",4,2017,08,19
143,Another amazing stay at my favorite hotel in London,Once again the staff at the Corinthia exceeded my expectations from the moment I checked in.  Special recognition for Szabina Futo in guest services and Adam and Bence in the cigar lounge which is where I always close out my night...,5,2017,08,19
143,Beyond Cool Corinthia ,"Where do I start ? From the second you enter The Corinthia you are made to feel the most important people in the world , all the staff in this hotel go above and beyond for their customers , the service is superb, Cristina on reception looked after us when we arrived , Julia Eccles was fantastic and made us so welcome , The Spa was as usual fabulous , Marta at Breakfast was lovely , everything was top notch yet again , this is the best hotel in London and I will carry on recommending you to all my family and friends, until we meet again thank you ",5,2017,08,13
143,Five star treatment year after year.,"I visit London every year for work and holiday and its such a comfort in knowing that I feel at home here. The hotel is stunning as always. This trip, I did encounter some issues but they were remedied immediately by the professional & courteous staff. 

The hotel itself is stunning, the exterior and interior. The rooms are well appointed with beautiful bathrooms complete with rainfall shower, comfortable beds-which are hard to find while traveling. Nespresso machine and large walk in closet are also great perks. 

A great addition this time was their brain food menu, as I am an avid health enthusiast & athlete, the food offerings & gym are very important to me when selecting a place to stay. I think they should definitely expand on this. 

The gym was remodeled a bit, the new machines are not my favorite but its still hands down the best travel gym I have ever used. Complete with bottled water, protein snacks and fruit.

The spa experience this time was really lacking. My usual person was away on holiday , so the treatment itself wasn't great but the ESPA front desk girls weren't very attentive either. They ignored me for a good while until I asked them to help. I addressed this after my treatment and feel as though there should have been a concession of some kind but they didn't offer. **I believe Espa & the hotel are separate entities. 

Every restaurant in the Corinthia is lovely, from the best Afternoon Tea service I've ever had at the Lobby lounge or the Northall to Massimos. Even room service is stunning. 

The Concierge is always SO helpful. They remembered my name from my last visit, which was nice, arranged show tickets for me and mailed a package back to the states for me.

Overall, I love this place & will keep coming back!",5,2017,08,13
143,Wonderful Hotel,"What a lovely Hotel, the staff were all so approachable ,friendly and really took pride in their jobs, I would say they made the whole experience most wonderful.
The breakfast Buffett was first class.
Highly recommend and would stay here for future special occasions.",5,2017,08,13
143,New Years Eve,My boyfriend and I stayed in a Junior Suite for two nights over New Years Eve and New Years Day. It was simply stunning. The standard of room was exceptional! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and I cannot recommend it more highly.,5,2017,08,12
143,"Elegant, beautiful just fantastic!","I stayed at the Corinthia with my fiancé and parents in April this year for my moms birthday. We travelled from Edinburgh to London and stayed for 3 days/2nights. This hotel is one of the best hotels we've ever stayed in. We arrived a few hours before check in and they had both rooms ready for us which was a lovely surprise.

The hotel is truly stunning with its large chandeliers and lovely architecture. We spent a lot of time at the outside area which is beautifully decorated. All the staff was extremely friendly and the service was flawless. The breakfast buffet is the best we've ever had!  We were also given vouchers for free cocktails/welcome drinks. All the shampoo/body lotions were high quality and the spa was small but very nicely laid out. I would say that this 6 star hotel is enhanced by the excellent staff they hire.

We would definitely recommend this hotel to other visitors and are planning to return for a stay soon.

Watson family!",5,2017,08,09
143,Simply Amazing...,"It cannot be overstated how great this hotel is.

We had an issue on arrival as our room was not ready, it really mattered not as the staff went above and beyond for us, which made the stay even more special. It says a lot when your treatment of a guest turns a negative into something very positive.

The room was stunning, the staff polite, professional and extremely helpful.

I can't wait to return. Perfect.",5,2017,08,09
143,Evening drinks ,We called here for evening drinks from waking in to walking out the service was impeccable also the hotel was stunning and impeccably presented. As stated we only had drinks in here quite expensive if you are on a budget but no dearer than any other 5 star hotel we have been in anywhere in the world great choice of drinks aswell. Next time in London looking forward to returning here and will definitely stay here ,5,2017,08,08
143,Elegant and chic,"We couldn't have asked for a more inviting and luxurious hotel stay. Professional staff, always pleasant and helpful, and stunning flowers everywhere as if the fabulous decor wasn't enough! And the dining in both restaurants was wonderful - 4 star. ",5,2017,08,07
143,"Fantastic, first rate hotel","Supelative hotel with beautifully appointed bedrooms and public areas. Staff cannot do enough to help, service is really excellent. 

Very well located and central to West side of London. 

Would stay again.",5,2017,08,06
143,Corinthia Hotel,"The best hotel in the world. When we went there, we saw this is excellent hotel. You can see everything that everybody needs. Restaurant, room service and others. We had good time there. And workers were very friendly. This hotel was better than other hotels. ",5,2017,08,06
143,Amazing hotel and service!,"The great reviews of the Corinthia are true! This was a lovely hotel with wonderful service.  My family of 5 stayed here for 4 nights and loved it.  The rooms were spacious and had soft, comfortable bedding.  The location was safe and convenient to most attractions. The hotel caters to adults and to children (little stuffed animals and treats were left for the children which was a sweet gesture). The pool/spa area was amazing (but keep in mind limited times/access for children). The floral shop was
gorgeous (I would pass by everyday just to smell the flowers). We will definitely stay here again
when we return to London.  Worth what you pay for.",5,2017,08,06
143,Overpriced?,"The hotel is..well very good,overpriced though. Garden bar excellent,rooms cozy,restaurants ok. Always check the pricelist..
Charging i.e. €12,00 for a shirt to be cleaned is way too much, as is the €4,00 for a bottle of water...",4,2017,08,03
143,Beyond perfection. Book it!!!,"Stayed here only a few nights at the end of our vacation and was sad to leave! From the staff, to the property, to the incredible rooms and turndown service, I can't say enough and can't wait to return! Warmly welcomed and toured our rooms. Amazing bfast in the am. The orchids decorating the lobby were insane. Troels in the Bassoon Bar was a delight. Friendly and knowledgeable, he was a doll. The cigar lounge outside with fireplaces, food,  drink and cigar offerings was a highlight for my husband and only made more delightful with Benny and Adam at the helm. The property is regal and over the top but in a good way. A quick walk from the Embankment tube stop, Covent Garden, T Square and Thames. Trust me, treat yourself and book this amazing property. You will not regret it!!!",5,2017,08,03
143,Consistently very good value for the money. Great Spa/Gym.,"I stay here every other month. Rooms are very efficiently laid out. A lot of very convenient features like a Nespresso machine, and wall outlets for all kinds of different plugs UK, US, European and USB. All marble, heated floor bathrooms are beautiful.
I can vouch that Massimo is one of the best Italian restaurants in London. Northall Restaurant is also very good, thumbs up for their fish & chips with mushy pees.  
Check in/out is always very efficient and the concierge is very good following up on your requests. 
Saving the best part to the last, the Spa is to die for. Also the gym is very well equipped and at par with expensive health clubs.",5,2017,07,31
143,Wonderful evening ,"What a glamorous and stylish hotel! We had an amazing evening exploring all the restaurants with their ""dinner safari"" .

We had the most wonderful antipasti & prosecco in massimo - atmosphere and service were superb and lots of dishes to try. Be careful not too eat too much at this course😀

Main course was in the northall restaurant - I had the chicken which was perfectly cooked. 

Dessert was in the crystal moon lounge which has the most stunning chandelier I have ever seen.

Finally cocktails in the bassoon bar with some live music.

An amazing experience which I would definitely recommend. All the staff were lovely and couldn't do enough for us - I'd go back in a heartbeat 

",5,2017,07,30
143,The Best,"Stayed here for business in July. The location is prime, nearby the Trafalgar Square. Plenty of transport around. The room was nice and clean. The breakfast was so good. The only downside is that the hotel is not ready with the existing technology whereby you need to charge your phones and gadgets using usb. So need some electrical outlet on the bedside. Overall is good. Will be back and Highly recommended!",5,2017,07,29
143,"Great location and facilities, but some basic misses for a top tier hotel.","This former hotel, turned government building, turned back into hotel is perfectly situated for touring London on foot or by car, The staff is friendly and courteous, and rooms are larger than many of the top hotels in London and include updated technology and amenities. We had a Junior Suite and two nearby adjoining Deluxe Rooms. Weaknesses observed lied in housekeeping and inconsistent dining room staff at breakfast, which should not be the case at this level property. That said, I have experienced similar issues in the past at Brown's and Claridges, so this appears to be a consistent theme among the London hotel experience. The afternoon tea offered in the Crystal Moon Lounge is solid, and a good alternative to going out for a pre-theater dinner. Additionally, the hotel kitchen did an exceptional job working around a severe nut allergy in our party, and all menus address potential allergens in the menu  ingredients facilitating choices. All factors considered, I would stay her again. ",4,2017,07,28
143,A very wet night,We didnt stay here (cannot afford it) but 4 friends and I had been on a night cruise on the Thames . After the cruise had finished we made our way in torrential rain (no coats on) to find a taxi . We didnt know exactly were we where - saw the Corinthia Hotel amd went inside and told them we were lost - saturated and in need of a taxi. They couldnt have been more helpful - sat us all down and within minutes a taxi arrived. They escorted us to the taxi with a large brolly.  Just wish we could have afforded to stay there.  We 5 Northern ladies thank you all very much .,5,2017,07,26
143,Above and Beyond,"This hotel deserves its 5 stars and more.  We arrived under difficult circumstances as the entrance road had been cordoned off for the F1 GP demonstration; the hotel driver who had fetched us from Heathrow handled the situation with calm and ease with no inconvenience at all to our arrival. This was the professionalism and efficiency evidenced by all staff and with all services during our stay.  The location is ideal, the hotel decor is superb, with the fresh flowers a joy and the spa is sublime.",5,2017,07,25
143,No stone left unturned,"This is a fantastic hotel.  Location wise, it is just off Trafalgar Square.  The service given is exquisite.  From the moment you check in, to the concierge, and the staff at the Spa.  The Spa, which is based over 4 floors, is impossible to explain in words, with world class facilities, a sauna with glass walls and a great service in the area.  The rooms are very well kept, comfortable, with excellent bathrooms.  ",5,2017,07,24

143,One of the best hotels in the world!!!,"We were back this year for Wimbledon and the hotel, as it was in 2016, was beyond our expectations.

It started with Ana greeting us at check in and telling us we had been upgraded to a Whitehall Suite--a spectacular 3 suite with a huge living room, wonderful bedroom and a giant bathroom.  (thanks to our amazing  travel agent, Kim Witherspoon  of Connoisseur Travel in Washington, DC.)   ESPA products in the bathroom--first rate  We were greeted by a very nice bottle of champagne and fruit plate--the fruit was very welcome after the long flight,The room was quiet and the bed was terrific.

As usual, the staff was amazing,  The folks in Northumberland knew our names by the second day we went to breakfast.   The wait staff was engaging and gave us lots of tips on how to spend a couple of free afternoons.  The concierge desk helped us find a pharmacy on short notice, dinner reservations before the theater and answered questions everyday with a smile and helpful information.

The food is fantastic.  From the lunch we had under an umbrella in the courtyard, to the endless breakfast buffet, and the room service after a long day of sightseeing, everything was fresh, tasty and reasonably priced.  Our room service dinner arrived in about 20 minutes at midnight and was piping hot.

The housekeeping staff was excellent. The young lady who did the daily cleaning was attentive to our minor requests, and was very pleasant the couple of times we spoke with her.

The gym has been redone since our last visit and while it has a lot of equipment, it does not have any true elliptical trainers, and that was a disappointment.

As you would expect, the spa staff was friendly and helpful,

The location is amazing.  You can walk to so many of the major tourist sites as well as the theaters in the West End.

The day we left, the area around the hotel was blocked off because of a major political parade.  When we got to the front door, we could not get a taxi because the street had been closed--no problem for this front door staff, who took the luggage    trolley down the street for two blocks to where another doorman was holding a cab for us--a typical example to the service at this amazing hotel.

Thanks for such a wonderful visit.  We cannot wait to return.",5,2017,07,23
143,Northall Restaurant,"My husband and I booked dinner at the Northall restaurant in June. It was the £35 3 course with cocktail deal. I assumed the Northall restaurant was the tables seated around the perimeter of the Northall bar. Imagine our surprise when we were led into a lovely room beyond, with leather chairs. Luckily we were suitably dressed. For £35 we knew we wouldn't get full access the menu, but there were still several choices for each course. It also came with an amuse bouche, so make that 4 courses! The food in each course was superb and we haven't witnessed such excellent service in a British restaurant in such a long time.  We made sure we thanked everyone who served us. Whilst it's great to post on TA for others to see, I think it is even more important to give instant feedback to those who have made your evening go so well.  We enjoyed ourselves so much, we have decided to splash out for a night's stay in the hotel for our birthdays and of course we will book a meal at the Northall restaurant again. And a few cocktails at The Bassoon bar I'm sure.",5,2017,07,23
143,EXcellent hotel off Trafalgar,"Recently refurbished this hotel deserves every one of it's 5 stars -should actually get 6 in my book.The staff are super efficient, some in the tea room area could be a tad more friendly I found,contrary to their colleagues in other areas of the hotel. The decor hotel wide is stunning and the room we had , a king de Luxe. was really comfortable-the bed was I am sure sent from heaven , the bathroom divine and the amenities, soap, shampoos etc  were a good couple of notches above great.
The only down side was there was no place in the cupboard to put anything.If you were a traveling exec on an overnight business stay you would just about squeeze your change of clothing and a set of gym clothes and evening out clothes into the cupboard.
As a tourist traveling for a few weeks and spending 3 or 4 nights you tend to live out your bag because there is NO space to unpack anything.Most UN-thought through by the designer and the ONLY negative I can give this hotel.
The gym, the spa  and the two restaurants were all simply put superb.
The food in the British restaurant/English restaurant ( the breakfast room) was excellent...we had dinner there one evening and it was really not your normal hotel faire , it was really very very good.Breakfasts were excellent, the variety and quality were top notch.
The staff as said were efficient and friendly, barring the tea room are staff that were a bit puffed up with some level of importance we are still trying to fathom out, albeit that they were efficient.
Overall a fantastic hotel, well worth a stay, very well located, the only down was a big down side and that was on the cupboard space-besides that superb",5,2017,07,23
143,Afternoon tea to celebrate twin daughters 21st Birthday,"From start to finish the afternoon tea experience ran on rails. Champagne, tea selection, the pouring of the tea, sandwiches, scones, cakes - and they even brought cakes with candles on for our daughters!.  Very discreet service, but very efficient - the drama of my eldest daughter knocking over her champagne was managed in a most professional and smooth manner.  Well done to all concerned",5,2017,07,22
143,"Everything was perfect! Elegant, modern and understated","The Corinthia is an amazing hotel that is perfectly situated near so much in London.  Everything was just as we had hoped.  It was Elegant, modern and understated.  The rooms were large and had amazing amenities in the bathroom including an awesome waterfall shower. ",5,2017,07,18
143,A true delight,"This was my third stay at this hotel. Every time I have stayed here, I have been delighted by the excellent service provided by the hotel staff. The room are spacious and very comfortable. Location is excellent, walking distance to most of Central London attractions, steps from underground. Restaurants are excellent. Fitness center and Pool, Sauna etc. are very very good.",5,2017,07,16
143,Third Visit -,"This is our third visit to the Corinthia.  The Hotel is beautiful and the people at the door,  the Front Desk and in housekeeping are true professionals.  The public spaces are amazing with flowers and so much light.  The rooms are elegant and very comfortable.  The Hotel is located in a very quiet area, but very close to many of the sights important to visitors.  The best part of the Corinthia is the Concierge Staff who make each and every visit an adventure.  The entire Concierge Team knows everything to do in London and environs, where to eat and how to navigate the city.  We will be visiting a fourth time!",5,2017,07,16
143,beautiful modern boutique hotel,"5 night vacation with 2 kids.  Stayed in the family room.  Roomy, big beautiful bathroom.  Morning buffet was lovely.  The chandelier and the flowers are breathtaking. Perfectly located, wish I did high tea!  We will be back.",5,2017,07,13
143,Our Second Visit ,"The Corinthia Hotel is a luxury hotel situated near the Embankment on Whitehall.  Our first stay last summer was perfect.  This time around, although it was lovely, there were a few outstanding faults that should be recognized.  First, the bedskirt was filthy and there were items under the bed, implying that a thorough cleaning was not done before we arrived. After voicing our concern, the bedskirt was changed but nothing was cleaned from under the bed. 
In addition, the handle on the bathroom door was broken and our robes, after being used and left on the floor, were just re-hung, not replaced. For 650 pounds/night, this is unacceptable. 
The Lobby Lounge is a lovely place to have afternoon tea or drinks/snacks, but if you are sitting in the chairs along the wall, be prepared to wait a long time to be served.
Northall is a beautiful restaurant and although the food was good, we became ill both times we ate there. This could be a fluke or, something else. 
Room service is lovely and the servers go out of their way to make sure everything is presented and set up to your liking.
Overall, still a satisfactory experience. ",4,2017,07,13
143,Great Hotel in the Whitehall Section of London,"We visited London during the first week of June.  Corinthia was our base for many trips in and around London.  The hotel was wonderful.  Rooms were excellent (we had an executive room) although a bit smaller than we have experienced in other European cities and smaller than those at the Shard, during our last visit.  Regardless, the room was appointed very nicely with a large bathroom and desk area (for work).  Great breakfast (included in our package).  Steps away from several underground stations and train lines to the south-west.  Dining in an around the hotel was fabulous.",5,2017,07,13
143,Nice but not flawless,"3 night business stay. Modern rooms and generous space. Friendly staff. Great location with lots of cafes, restaurants around and access to different transport

Was a bit frustrating on quality consistency. AC would range from doesn't cool to freezing cold, and wifi not consistent at all (on 2 nights you basically gave up trying to use it)

All in all very good hotel but at this price point you can also explore other 5 star options",4,2017,07,13
143,"Sensational Service, Quality and Class","This review comes way too late, we visited London a while back but have stayed at the Corinthia twice in London, both times in suites. 

There's nothing not to like. Yes you will pay but, you will get what you pay for. 

The pool is amazingly relaxing, gym is fine, breakfast was very good. The staff are well trained and exactly what you would expect from a hotel like this. They want to make you feel special and they do. 

The rooms are beautiful, classy, exceptionally appointed and large. 

Great job Corinthia, keep it up.",5,2017,07,11
143,the best in London I have stayed at,"Loved this hotel. this is the first time I have stayed here - the location of course is great but the service the food, the rooms, the bathroom, everything was flawless. Everything I had a question to the answer was yes or more. It was really a very nice experience. I am making this my destination hotel everytime i am in London. The breakfast buffet was awesome as was the bar in the evening. The lobby area is very nicely done. a picture is attached. One of the best gyms I have been to in a hotel. My workout was just awesome and the",5,2017,07,11
143,Please don't tell anyone about this hotel,"Because I want it to be available every time I go to London. It's incredible; the rooms are huge, beds are super-comfy, food is top-notch, location is incredible, and - my favorite part - the concierges make miracles happen. Seriously.",5,2017,07,09
143,Luxurious in every way!,"I piggy-backed on a business trip to London with some of my bosses and oh what a treat to stay at the Corinthia!  

The hotel is just oozing luxury, from the check-in area to the massive chandelier-donned lounge room.  And amenities galore, the gym is professional grade and, although I did not dabble, there is a floor or two full of spas and a pool.  There is a classy and plentiful breakfast buffet with cultural fare and treats from all over the world.  The night-time cigar lounge/bar is perfect for a smoke and a cocktail, with fireplaces and heat lamps for the cool evenings.  The hotel restaurant has quality offerings as well.  

Finally, the rooms.  Even the standard rooms seem more like bedroom suites -- huge bathrooms with separate tubs, huge walk-in closets and ample chairs and lounge spots.  Complimentary Nespresso, too.  Wifi is fast and fluid and the front desk is available for all of your business needs.  

I believe the location is solid, steps from shops and the like, but you really end up cabbing it around everywhere, which is an adventure in London traffic, but a separate topic nonetheless.  The airport is probably an hour and change away.  

You really get what you pay for here, which is richness, comfort and luxury.  If you can afford it, treat yourself and you won't be disappointed.  ",5,2017,07,09
143,This is the place to stay!!,"I am looking forward to coming back to London just to stay at this hotel. I have told all my friends and family not to waste their time searching for any other hotel. I can't itemize everything but simply, staff, room, gym,  breakfast, location all exceeded my expectations. 
To the manager, you should be very proud!",5,2017,07,08
143,Absolutely stunning in every respect,"Was here for 5 nights in May and was blown away. Room was outstanding, public areas were beautiful, service levels were spectacular, location was perfect. Beds were super comfortable to boot. Prices are not for the faint of heart but worth every penny. I loved everything about this hotel and would stay here again without hesitation. In fact, I would be excited about prospect of staying at the Corinthia again.",5,2017,07,07
143,Wonderful Hotel!,The Corinthia is a wonderful place to stay.  It is a high end hotel and the accommodations are excellent!  The staff helps in every way possible.  The location is perfect to see London and easy access to food and drinks.  Nightly strolls along the waterway (across from the Eye) were wonderful!  Next time in London - will stay at the Corinthia Hotel!,5,2017,07,07
143,Best hotel experience of my life!,"The Corinthia is simply the best hotel I have ever stayed at. The entire staff was warm and welcoming. The concierge staff took care of all of our needs. The breakfast buffet was 'best ever"" as were the showers and room amenities. I LOVED the Corinthia and will never stay anyplace else when in London",5,2017,07,07
143,Fabulous Fourth Visit.,"We had an amazing time here Monday to Thursday. Our beautiful room was perfect-flowers,fruit and instant hot water. We enjoyed breakfast in the Northall and dinner in Massimo each day. All the staff were wonderful,but a special mention to Helio. He made my husband's belated birthday celebration very special. Thank you.",5,2017,07,06
143,5 nights at the Corinthia,"Third time at the Corinthia. Perfect. All staff well trained, from the first greeting upon arrival, check in and everyone else. They say you only learn from what you do wrong so this review will not help. Everything thing from the modern rooms, great breakfast and friendly staff was excellent. We'll be back. Thank you Corinthia",5,2017,07,05
143,Great Historic but Modern Hotel ,"Stayed there for 10 days back in April/ May. Great hotel, perfectly located for a touristic stay. Rooms were ver comfortable and service was impeccable. Would definitely stay there again on my next visit. ",5,2017,07,04
143,A Fantastic Experience!,"Spent my birthday weekend at this lovely hotel, everything from the moment we checked in to the moment we sadly leaved the hotel has been truly amazing! The hotel is stunning, having afternoon tea in the lobby under the lovely chandelier is a must do! The room is great and we had a huge bathroom! The staff is truly attentive and always try to predict our needs and will go far and beyond to make sure we have a great time. Finally the SPA, it is by far the best hotel SPA I have ever been to, it is huge and just by walking in you already feel relaxed! 
I highly recommend this hotel for anyone staying in London and wanting a true luxurious and relaxed stay!",5,2017,07,03
143,Perfect 5 Star,Stayed at the Hotel at the end of June and from the moment you walk in you know the hotel is going to be something special.  The location is perfect 20 mins in a taxi from Euston train station cost around £13. The rooms are outstanding the staff are very friendly and cannot do enough for you.  The breakfast and the choice you have is also outstanding. We didn't eat in any of the restaurants but the choice and prices seemed fine for a  5 stat London Hotel. I would highly recommend this hotel and will be booking again.,5,2017,07,02
143,Amazing breakfast!,"My second stay at the beautiful Corinthia, and I wasn't disappointed. This hotel just has it all - amazing spa, amazing food (hats off to the chefs) and luxury rooms! 
There is nothing negative about this hotel. You are made to feel like a VIP. 5 out of 5 no question.",5,2017,07,02
143,Absolutely fabulous ,"This is my second visit to the hotel, the food and hotel are fabulous. 

I had the local deal £35.00 per head, three course meal and cocktail or champagne, I chose the Fine Touch cocktail which is a mix of gins and elderflower (picture below) it was lovely. 

For my meal I had the chicken to start, lamb for main and the strawberry and rhubarb dessert, all of which were absolutely fabulous. 

Good service and excellent wine and champagne choices. 

It's not cheap but the quality is well worth it. ",5,2017,07,01
143,Perfect London Hotel,"The Corinthia is a beautiful hotel. The rooms are spacious and the bathrooms are very well appointed. The bar in the hotel is excellent and the drinks are top notch. The staff was always helpful and courteous. The main draw for this hotel, for me, is the location.  It is within walking distance to many major sights. I would gladly stay at the Corinthia again.",5,2017,06,28
143,Worth the Price,"This is a classic hotel, remodeled from a government office in 2011.  It is located in Whitehall and accessible by walking to the theatres, the Portrait Gallery, the National Gallery, The Cabinet War Rooms, Parliament and Westminster.  While it is expensive, the service is beyond superlative, the gym is state of the art and the spa is luxurious.",5,2017,06,28
143,Beautiful hotel,"Recently stayed at the Corinthia, and what a beautiful hotel.  The location is excellent with many attractions within walking distance.  Our room was a good size, with a bathroom that had a separate shower and bath.  The room was also spotlessly clean.  But one of the main reasons we liked the hotel was how very friendly all of the staff were.  We were especially impressed with the staff in the Massimo restaurant, Geatano, Rosa and Raphaela who made us very welcome.
It is expensive but you get what you pay for,  
We will definitely return to this hotel.",5,2017,06,27
143,Fantastic London Stay,"The Corinthia is a beautiful hotel in a great location jus off of Trafalgar Square. It is close to attractions, theater and great restaurants. The rooms that we had were beautiful and the service excellent! I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay here again in the future.",5,2017,06,25
143,Proud to have the best Corinthia hotel in London,"When I was younger the first nice hotel I stayed in was the Corinthia in Prague and it became special to me, since then I have been back many more times over Christmas and to others around Europe. When I heard we were getting one in London a few years ago I was excited yet nervous about how it would be - I had no reason to be nervous it was perfect .
The quality was second to none and the rooms were airy and fresh and very chic .
The spa was lovely and staff were great .
I stayed in a standard room and was impressed but would love to justify being able to stay in one of the suites one day. ",5,2017,06,25
143,Shoddy cleanliness seems to be creeping in,Always loved this hotel but this last visit the rooms and toilets were looking well used and the drain smell from our room was dreadful. Three rooms later we finally got a decent room but lost 4 hours of the evening doing so.,3,2017,06,25
143,Birthday celebration,"We stayed at the Corinthia Hotel on 23/06/2017, as we were going to see a show, all for my husband's birthday. The staff at the Corinthia were extremely friendly and helpful. We would definitely go back.",5,2017,06,25
143,Top notch hotel in top notch very central London area,"Stayed here for 2 nights on recent trip - a great hotel, with spacious and well appointed rooms, excellent beds and huge bathrooms with every amenity.  During the heat wave, they also have great air conditioning which was essential.   

Hotel is walkable to many attractions, theaters and dining, including a short walk across the Thames to get to bustling Southbank area, and ITV London television centre which it was faster to walk over vs. taking a taxi.

Two things to note that will improve a very hard to improve stay:   

Avoid the second floor.  This floor is used by entertainment companies for media junkets and press briefing so you'll be greeted by a gaggle of people standing or sitting in the hallway.

During a heat wave, a duvet fit for a blizzard is not a great thing to have smothering you in bed.   Put a top sheet on the beds under the duvet so if you don't want to sweat all night, you have an option not to.",5,2017,06,24
143,Great rooms,"Rooms were great, entrance, bathroom and bedroom. Very nice. No real desk, need to use round table so if that is an issue, beware. Well located.  Was hosting a conference so did not have time to make full use of hotel but others at my company says its very good. ",5,2017,06,24
143,Afternoon Tea - Hidden Gem,"The Corinthia is a beautiful old hotel...that I have only just found in London.  Located in Whitehall, its a moments stroll from the Thames.

We are frequent Afternoon Tea goers and have sampled many, but the Corinthia is now firmly in the number two spot.

Whilst the Corinthia does not have the opulence of The Ritz, it does have a fresh and friendly feel.  The staff are efficient and welcoming.

We started with champagne - which wasn't overpriced when purchased with the Afternoon Tea.  An array of teas offered, with the ability to change teas throughout your sitting.  The a selection of 5 sandwiches on a variety of wonderful breads was very tasty - a replenish was offered (and accepted).  The scones were accompanied by a lemon spread, clotted cream and jam - delightful.  Again a replenish was offered (not accepted on this occasion).  Moving on to the fancies.  Five fancies between two guests...not wanting to miss out, we cut ours down the middle.

We were left to relax and enjoy the company and surroundings.

How I have never stumbled upon the Corinthia before now is a mystery.  Head and shoulders above The Goring (who have previously won an Afternoon Tea of the Year).  All of our group thoroughly enjoyed and will be dropping in again.

Delightful.",5,2017,06,23
143,Excellent hotel !,"Beautiful hotel with an incredible personal, we were upgraded! It was a pleasure to stay at this wonderful hotel with an incredible spa and quality services, great location we could enjoy a great holiday i would recommend anyone who wants to rest and be quiet! 

Thank you :)",5,2017,06,22
143,What a pleasant surprise!!,"I stayed in this hotel for a total of 7 days in June 2017 attending an office event. This is the most luxurious hotel I have ever stayed in the U.K., I felt welcomed right from the front of the hotel with prompt attention of the concierge who helped me take my luggages inside. The receptionist were also very nice and quite prepared for my arrival. I got checked in within a very short time and I was taken to my room as soon as checking in was done. My room was very lovely and spacious for a London Hotel, it had a small sized walk in closet, and a huge bathroom! The bathroom was like a mini spa room. A beautiful bath and a lovely shower cubicle. Double sinks were beautifully laid side by side. The room itself had a nicely laid double bed and it had a large tv with my name welcoming me to the room for my stay. Supplies were plentiful and it was replenished each day. Water was given complimentary every day too and nice treats of chocolate, pillow sprays and other nice treats. I had newspaper delivered to my room every single day and my room was well laid everyday when I come back. The breakfast was heavenly and there was variety to pick from. There is an Italian restaurant and an English one for dinner. I eat at the Italian restaurant and it was quite good. This is a hotel I would recommend to anyone coming for business and holiday as well. The location is great, near two train stations and surrounded by bus stops too and nice shopping area within walking distance. I will definetly stay again. The only downside is price point is on the high side but that is expected for a 5 star hotel with the level of comfort and luxury provided!!",5,2017,06,21
143,The New London Landmark,"Forget about the other hotels London is famous for, this is the hot property now and for few years to come if they keep going. In a nutshell, a Four Seasons-like atmosphere but more ideally located. Quite area within walking distance to business venues and touristic sites. The right place to meet and have a break at its lobby, and decent service (needs more swift responses). It has its own London feeling rather than a global chain which is a plus. ",4,2017,06,20
143,Perfect again,This was my second stay at the Corinthia.  We traveled as a family of 5 and enjoyed three wonderful nights.  This is an outstanding hotel. The staff are fabulous-- very professional while also friendly and welcoming.  The location can't be beat.  It's an easy walk to many sights.  I look forward to returning again.,5,2017,06,20
143,The complete deal and perfect finish...,"Only stayed for one night at the Corinthia while on a business trip but lucky enough to have a Deluxe room. 

The rooms are very spacious and the courtyard facing room was quiet and comfortable. 

The hotels location is perfect. right near Trafalgar square, the West End, Covent Garden, soho are all an easy walk from the hotel. The spa and pool are very nice, after a hard day of meetings this was perfect! 

To be fair there is many great hotels in the city but the Corintha Hotel really stood out, I will be bring my wife back very soon as the Corinthia is hard to beat on the location, and its fabuslous contemporary design, service, and amenities make this a great stay!

Well done and see you soon!",5,2017,06,17
143,Outstanding ,I normally stay at the Shard when in London but tried the Corinthia for the first time. Simply outstanding. The rooms are excellent but there is something intangible about this hotel. It has a quite cool charm that is friendly and welcoming yet very sophisticated. The staff are excellent. James Bond would definitely stay at the Corinthia. Can't wait to get back. ,5,2017,06,11
143,What else ?,"The perfect match: location, service and room size. All beyond perfect. At entrance the porters salute you with charm and inform recepction so that check in is smooth and quick and always with a smile. It's 2 minutes walking distance from Trafalgar Square and 1 minute from Thames River and Tube Station. The room should be one of the biggest i've ever seen in London: huge bedroom, big bathroom and a closet and hall even. Huge and confortable bed. All perfect honestly. The lobby is amazing chic and beautiful. The breakfast is of the best probably in town and all cames with 5 star service and smiles. Good but good. I had lunch at North Hall and it was divine. Just loved the Hotel. Would like to come back.",5,2017,06,10
143,The Hotel is Not Special for a Five-Star Place. The nail Spa is the worst,"My husband and I stayed at the Corinthia for four nights at the beginning of May. The Corinthia provides about what one would expect from a five-star hotel in London; nothing that special. Good location. The restaurant on site was excellent, the food superb. The service was a bit cool, even for the British. I had room service one night and it was fast and delicious, as good as at the restaurant.

Unfortunately, I received the worst manicure I have ever gotten at their spa, and that is what I will always remember about the Corinthia. The polish was applied so sloppily that I had to remove it and re-polish the same day. Worse, she over-buffed my nails and they are still thin and breaking. I now need to see a dermatologist to find out if I got a nail infection as well. Last time I will ever stay there.",4,2017,06,06
143,"Good, but not as good as we hoped","My wife and I stayed for 1 night in an executive room for a Birthday getaway. We picked the hotel because we wanted a historic property with bright, modern rooms.

The room was sizeable, with an excellent bathroom, but was much more old fashioned and dark that the room pictures on the hotel website. The television was also hanging off the wood stand it was attached to. Surprised that a hotel in this price bracket would allow such a basic maintenance issue to go unnoticed.

The bathroom was the highlight of the room - very roomy with underfloor heating. That said, there didn't seem to be a way of regulating the underfloor heating temperature & it was pre-set so high that the floor was almost too hot to walk on with bare feet.

We booked a rate with breakfast included & would suggest that to anyone booking here. The breakfast area is nice, but the prices are horrendous if you are paying as you go. My breakfast alone would have cost £80 on a pay as you go basis. Each item of the english breakfast is billed a £4. We saw the couple next to us ask for grilled tomatoes at £4 each only to be given two of the smallest cherry tomatos you've ever seen. Seemed over the top even by London prices.

Service in the Bassoon bar was also somewhat scratchy. We went there for an after dinner drink. There were only 8 guests in the bar with 5 staff in attendance and yet we still had to ask for attention - the 5 staff were more interested in chatting amongst themselves.

All in all we had a reasonable night's stay, but the hotel won't become the home away from from home we hoped it might be. Too many basic mistakes for a hotel in this price bracket to justify five stars.",4,2017,06,02
143,"Does the big things well, misses on the little ones","An impressive hotel with a premium location.  Expensive and exclusive and a bit stuffy.  We stayed here for a week and were most impressed with the large room and closet and beautifully appointed bath.  The Corinthia does the big things well.  Fine dining, high tea, crafted cocktails, custom sound system, beautiful marble bath, huge rain shower, comfortable beds and beautiful linens and a very nice staff.  The little things, not so good.  Sinks wouldn't drain, hot and cold water taps didn't work properly, shower door stop broken, and an ac unit that made weird random noises.  All small maintenance things that really detracted from the experience.  You want a custom chocolate in a fancy Corinthia box at turn down?  No problem.  It's complimentary.  You want a bottle of drinking water?  Get our your wallet for the mineral water in the mini bar or order it from room service or bring your own.  You want a rain shower that is the most luxurious shower you've ever taken?  They've got it.  You want the sinks to drain or the shower door to close properly?  Nope.  Beautiful flowers.  Lots of marble.  Doormen in top hats.  It was fun, but it felt to us that someone has fallen a sleep at the wheel.  They're so busy trying to impress you with the big things they do, they've forgotten to keep an eye on the little things that matter most.",4,2017,06,01
143,A fantastic hotel,"I was lucky enough to spend a night in this hotel and was suitably impressed by the experience!  The hotel is stunning, great location with easy transport links.  The staff couldn't do more for us, everyone makes you feel welcome without being intrusive.  The room was a good size and the facilities in the spa were a lovely way to unwind.  I would definitely recommend the buffet breakfast!
",5,2017,05,30
143,Sunday brunch,"I took my friend to celebrate her birthday to the Sunday brunch in the Northall Restaurant.  From entering the hotel, it was a fabulous experience and the brunch and impeccable service to detail was absolutely amazing that my friend will always remember.  Thank you to Janis for looking after us and making the day very special.  We will definitely revisit the hotel.",5,2017,05,29
143,Peerless!,"I originally stayed at the Corinthia some years ago on business, when it was recommended by the finance firm hosting my visit.  It is now my favorite in Europe!  The service is impeccable from check-in to check-out.  The rooms are great, the fitness center is well equipped and the staff goes above and beyond to accommodate.  This was my first time holding a [breakfast] meeting in the hotel, and would do so again.",5,2017,05,28
143,First Class at its best!,It was my second day in London and we had lunch at their Northhall Restaurant. I loved my experience. Amazing service! The staff were very attentive and we loved the food they served.The restaurant is decorated with beautiful flowers. Very fabulous! First Class at its best!,5,2017,05,28
143,"Excellent hotel, but it's the little things that count!","The Corinthia is one of the nicest hotels in London and definitely one of my favourites that I frequently visit. My very recent visit was for drinks and dinner. 

Drinks were in the Garden Lounge but sadly on this occasion I was a little disappointed at the service as it was slack. We ordered a bottle of champagne and when it arrived our waiter accidently dropped a glass. It didn't smash as it fell on to the chair, however, I was still given that glass. In most establishments of this level the glass would have been replaced, broken or not. When our champagne came, we were not given any complimentary bar snacks, and we had to ask for these. Finally, we are non-smokers but the whole time we were there we had a dirty ashtray on our table, and not one waiter removed this. None of these are major issues, but not what you expect from the Corinthia. 

Following our drinks, we had a fantastic meal in the Northall restaurant, where the service and food were excellent. Highly recommend!",4,2017,05,26
143,Superb hotel in an excellent location.,"The hotel is located within walking distance of all the ""big attractions"" of London - Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Parliament.  Also very close to a tube stop which makes for an easy ride to The Tower of London.  Our room was excellent and we dined at both restaurants, also excellent.  Only glitch is that they charged me for a ""car hire"" which I did not do and only discovered upon reviewing my bill after getting home.  I have contacted them and trust they will correct it.  Recommend you review your final bill thoroughly before accepting it. Also, there were two broken items in our room - the handle to a closet door and a non-functional desk pen.  They were quickly corrected when pointed out, but this is a pricey place and they could do better with these details.",5,2017,05,25
143,First Class London Hotel,The hotel's location is perfect for sightseeing.  The rooms are luxe but the beds are smaller than US.  We had a king size bed which turned out to be a bit larger than a US queen.  We were traveling with my daughter and they were able to squeeze in a rollaway bed but we had a suite. The restaurants were pricey but service was great.,5,2017,05,25
143,Central and Peaceful,"We have spent a nice long weekend at the Corinthia. 

We received room 120, which wasn't huge, but clean and modern. We loved the TV on the bathtub, the walk-in shower, mood lights and the warm floor in the bathroom. 

The breakfast buffet is very big and has a great choice and high quality. The flower arrangements in the lobby are beautiful. 

The spa is extended on a couples of floors and is very nice. The pool water is pleasantly warm. 

And the staff is very kind. Thanks for the lovely stay. ",5,2017,05,24
143,WOW,This hotel is simply spectacular.  This was our first time in London and this hotel is very conveniently located.  Very near Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey.  Afternoon High Tea with champagne was terrific.  The rooms are immaculately maintained.  Attentive service all around.  Will definitely stay there again.,5,2017,05,22
143,Cultural break,"A absolutely love this world class hotel, it is simply stunning. The attention to detail is faultless, beautiful dining experiences, all staff (and I've been several times now) are consistently attentive without encroaching on your privacy. An explosion of perfectly picked and presented fresh flowers. It is one of my favourite places to stay, not just in London, but on the globe. Exquisite.",5,2017,05,21
143,Wonderful Afternoon Tea,"We had afternoon tea at the hotel yesterday as a belated Mother's Day present.  The crystal room is bright, airy and filled with beautiful fresh flowers.  It's a stunning room.  Initially I was not happy with the table we had been allocated, it seemed to be a table for 2 and with an extra chair added.  I asked if they could find us another table and we were then moved to a table of 4.  Everything proceeded smoothly.  We were under some time constraints due to a matinee theatre booking.  We were given the very best attention by a delightful man, Jake.  He kept us on schedule and gave us just the right amount of attention.  Not intrusive but enough to make us feel we were experiencing something special.  He was informative about all the items on the menu and even proffered his own favourities.  The whole experience, setting, food and especially the service made this our favourite afternoon tea and we have tried many in London.",5,2017,05,21
143,Amazing hotel with attentive staff!,"Just got back from here celebrating my partners 30th birthday! What a treat! The arrival was smooth, check in informative and friendly and the room was spotless a! The rooms are a fabulous size especially the bathroom! You even have lavender bags and sleep spray on turndown, what a lovely touch! Breakfast was also amazing with lots of choice on the a la carte menu and the buffet option! We even went into the bassoon bar for a cocktail whereby live music is on in the evenings. This stay truly was memorable and I cannot wait to return. If you haven't been here already and you are unsure, book! You will not regret it! A final note to say a huge thank you to Laura S from events, she took care of our booking from the reservation stage and she made it that extra special for us!",5,2017,05,18
143,"One of the great hotels - , posh and exceeding expectations.","Located in Whitehall, its neighbors are 10 Downing Street, The PM's residence ,Trafalgar Square, Westminster Abbey and Parliament. Th hotel is a luxurious retreat while exploring the history and sights of London. The spa alone takes 3 floors with an indoor pool that makes you wish to have more time just in the hotel. Food offerings are excellent English food in one and a superbly elegant , high quality in for and service Italian restaurant.",5,2017,05,17
143,Superb spa...you will not be disappointed!,"In the middle of busy London you will find the most amazing Spa! The facilities are beautiful and huge. Excellent customer service at all times and their attention to detail is second to none. 

If you are thinking about booking a facial treatment, ask for Sara! she was fantastic and super attentive. Very discreet and professional. She knew all the issues with my skin and recommended great products. I will definitely go back to have another treatment with her. 

The sleep pods  the heated marble beds and the waterfall shower were superb. Water, fruit and nuts available for customers. Clean towels and bathrobes everywhere. 

If you are thinking about enjoying a spa in London...do not hesitate to book this one! you will not be disappointed :) and for the end of the perfect day go to the Bassoon bar for cocktails! the best in town.",5,2017,05,15
143,London trip,The hotel is fabulous. Location is convenient to all the main sites. The room was spacious and well appointed and staff very accommodating. The spa is truly first rate the pool and hot tub area after treatments was very nice. The wait staff and bar tenders made of feel at home. A for sure hit! ,5,2017,05,14
143,Stunning,"Arrived to the room to see a nice, compact but comfortable room with very good bathroom facilities and an incredible view of the whole city. Other amenities including the spa and gym were absolutely incredible with vast things to do ",5,2017,05,14
143,Wonderful experiance!,"Stayed a couple of nights ! Top notch hotel! Walking distance to the Churchill Museum (3 blocks or so), London Eye was within 8 blocks or so., Big Ben etc. Rooms were clean, large, Bathrooms had large tubs & showers.Breakfast was excellent also! Employee;s were always very nice! .",5,2017,05,13
143,Standard 5 stars hotel,"It was our second visit to the property.  Our first visit seemed lovelier.  I think the standard of service has gone down a notch.  The hotel is lovely but the service is not one that makes you special.  It is a standard five stars hotel.  The service was very impersonal.  We tried having breakfast and the selection was just okay, the service did not feel 5 stars.  I love that the hotel had many flower arrangements.  It seemed airy and bright.  The lounge is inviting.  But it is pretty much a standard five stars hotel.  Location is convenient.",4,2017,05,13
143,Exceptional Stay,"We stayed here a few years ago and the experience remained unchanged -- the stunning common areas, well-appointed rooms and service were just as exceptional. The high level of service from all of the staff really sets this property apart. Of note, the concierge team assisted us with a number of recommendations and reservations prior to our stay (via email), all of which were excellent and much appreciated.

This time, we enjoyed the ESPA Life at the hotel. If it is your first time at the spa, ask the spa staff for a tour of the facilities, which was helpful in getting oriented. As a hotel guest, it was very indulgent to be able to visit the spa and relax in the steam rooms and loungers at any time the spa was open. The treatments were very professional and highly recommended. 

Dinner at Massimo was wonderful. Again, the service was professional and exceptional. The atmosphere was more formal and beautifully decorated. Every dish we ordered was delicious, but a stand out was the ripe melon and prosciutto starter. Highly recommended.

There were just a couple of minor misses -- turn-down came much later than requested (the check-in staff asks for your preferred time so we thought that would be honored) and our morning newspaper was incorrect -- but both did not deter from the overall experience. Overall, we look forward to visiting again.",5,2017,05,11
143,Great food. Impeccable service.,"I work close to the Corinthia, so the Northall Restaurant is a handy location for a special dinner. I have eaten here four or five times now, and I cannot fault the place. I have enjoyed every single visit.

The menu is 'Modern English' with a good selection of changing dishes. I have eaten both fish and meat here and every time the dish has been beautifully executed. Desserts are of a similar standard.

The service is impeccable. The staff are friendly, discrete and extremely professional. On a recent visit with friends from Israel a request for a selection of different steak cuts for the table to share was turned around without question, and cooked to perfection.

Whilst not a 'destination' restaurant, everything about this place is high quality. If you want a really nice dinner, in a quiet place with top notch service you will not be disappointed.
",5,2017,05,10
143,Excellent Stay,"I have now stayed at the Corinthia a couple of times and absolutely love this place. The rooms are spectacular: modern and spacious. How many other hotels have a walk in closet? And, the bathrooms are the size of other rooms I have stayed at in London. 

The staff is incredibly receptive and helpful. I typically do not make use of the concierge service and prefer to manage independently, but both times I received great restaurant recommendations after only providing an (unhelpful) small level of guidance in my request.

The hotel is very well situated right near the Thames and Trafalgar Square. Many of the major sites in London are easily accessible on foot, or from the Embankment Underground  station very close to the hotel.

One item I can't review unfortunately is the restaurant. There are maybe 4 bars in the hotel, and I did my best to have a drink at most of them, but while the restaurant looked great, I'll have to save it for another trip.

I have stayed at a handful of other nice properties around London (Langham, Mondrian, Andaz), and while those properties were very good, Corinthia is my clear favorite and where I'll stay in the future.",5,2017,05,09
143,Excellent for families,"We stayed here for two nights in May.  We have two kids, ages 7 and 10.  I chose this hotel for the location and the pool.  It did not disappoint.  Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, London Eye, Trafalgar Square, and shopping were all within walking distance.  The pool area was amazing, and a great way to unwind after sightseeing.  There are special hours for kids (10-11:30 am and 3-4:30 pm)  that we had to work our schedule around, but it was worth it.  The staff was very kind.  The room was spacious and well appointed.  The kids were given slippers, robes, stuffed animals, kids bath products, and treats!  Wonderful stay!",5,2017,05,09
143,the best Post-Marathon experience,"Corinthia is a wonderful hotel worth every cent. I can hardly say this for every hotel I’ve been. But I can honestly say that for Corinthia. Location, interior, facilities are really top. Rich interiors and wonderful service make for an unforgettable experience.

I can’t describe how lovely it is to make your way to the restaurant through the delicate fragrance of freshly cut flowers in the morning. Talking about breakfast, don’t forget to ask for poached eggs. Wonderfully done.

And of course after London Marathon, spending all afternoon at the spa, between ice showers and jacuzzi, was the best post-marathon recovery treatment I could dream of.

Can’t wait to go back for another long weekend break in London.",5,2017,05,08
143,Sheer delight in the centre of London,"Having stayed a number of times now the hotel seems to get better with each trip.  The service is always of an excellent standard.  The rooms are all well appointed and the bathrooms are exceptional.

The spa and pool (with sauna, hammam, bubble pool) are excellent.  

Occasionally have had issues with staff not speaking English - the maids and various other staff just look embarrassed and shrug - which I wouldn't expect from people working in London.  We also had one who seemed frustrated we had our slippers on in the entrance to the spa when no one had given us flip-flops to wear.

Breakfast is out of this world and service is always sensational.",5,2017,05,08
143,Posh ,A very upmarket classy hotel in the centre of London.  Prices reflect location and excellent quality of all aspects. Clean and well restored. Outside is a bit scruffy but you will enjoy all it has on offer,5,2017,05,07
143,New Year's Eve ,Absolutely stunning hotel we had the best New Year's Eve ever. The staff were superb and the room was amazing. My partner and I couldn't fault a thing. This is the finest hotel In London that I have visited. We would both stay here again without hesitation and we look forward to returning in the very near future.,5,2017,05,04
143,The abbest fabbest spot in London,"Go during the day and gawp! This place has all the trappings of a top class hotel on display to the casual loitering ne'erdowell (which is how we classed ourselves). For the price of an expensive but nice cup of tea, we swanked it with the footballers, their wives and assorted glitterati in the hotels massive foyer. Only a few yards from my own club this really is the most splendid show in London - a couple of hundred yards from Trafalgar Square - a must go for any tourist!",5,2017,05,03
143,Perfection,"We stayed at Corinthia for a mini break and the hotel is perfection itself. Everything from the check in to check out is performed with perfection. The staff are extremely helpful and can't do enough for you. The room was everything you'd expect and more at this price range, good size, great shower with both rainbow and hand held options, good tv options and even a tv in the bathroom. We had cocktails in the evening before going out to dinner and again the suggestions were spot on. To top it off we had breakfast in the bedroom which was, for want of a better word, perfect. We popped into the spa area for a bit too which really is an oasis of tranquility in central London. The hotel is well located, 2 mins walk from tube and Thames clipper stops and 4 mins from a train station. We shopped, ate out in town and still came away completely relaxed and that doesn't often happen on a City break.  ",5,2017,05,03
143,Afternoon Tea - 18th Birthday,"My mother, daughter and I had a wonderful trip to London to see Phantom of the Opera and after the matinee performance we had afternoon tea at the Corinthia.  All this was for my daughters 18th birthday.  We were booked for 6pm and it was wonderful. Even though this was the last available slot of the day, the staff were still happy to serve us and nothing was too much trouble, we were made to feel very welcome.  Our lovely waitress was interested in our special occasion and was very sweet and kind.  We sat in the Crystal Moon Lounge which is such a beautiful and elegant setting.  Actually all we saw of the hotel was elegant and there was a wonderful perfume in the lobby as you entered. The food was gorgeous and I would highly recommend it for afternoon tea. Its only a short walk from Trafalgar Square.",5,2017,05,01
143,Great cocktails!,Spent an hour in the hotel bar having a cocktail listening to delightful piano music. Staff were very friendly and attentive and the whole atmosphere was very relaxed. Complimentary refreshments were plentiful  and cocktails reasonably priced considering central London hotel. ,5,2017,04,30
143,Luxury,"Underfloor heating in bathroom, HUGE bath and separate shower with rain shower and hand-held shower head, two washbasins, best hotel bathroom ever! Nespresso machine in room but UNLIKE Royal Horseguards however, a teapot and kettle is not standard - you must ask at reception. We slept very well indeed so bed must be comfy. Everything spotlessly clean of course. Like new.  

The staff are amazing and of course the public rooms and restaurants are fabulous. The flowers downstairs are simply beautiful. We didn't try the Spa because we were at a family wedding but I'm sure it's the best. I had my hair done at the Daniel Galvin salon next to spa and was very happy. I would highly recommend this hotel but remember to ask for a kettle at reception if you are a tea drinker. The Nespresso machine doesn't get the water nearly hot enough for tea. ",5,2017,04,30
143,Relaxing City Break,"The Corinthia will always be my favourite London Hotel. We returned again recently for a four day break and enjoyed every moment. Despite having so much to do in the city, it is lovely just to spend time at the hotel and take in the beautiful surroundings. They have the right balance of being modern and elegant too, with perfect attention to detail throughout the hotel. 

It is the first time I have made use of the Spa and was amazed at the space and wonderful facilities. It's such a peaceful, relaxing place.... I didn't want to leave! 

As expected, the standard of service provided by the staff is extremely high and not at all pretentious. They couldn't be more friendly or helpful.

There is nothing bad to say about this hotel hence we are sure to return again soon

",5,2017,04,29
143,"Locations, locations l, locations ","The number one rules in any successful retail is location of the shops and this is one of the advantages for this hotel. On top of that, the staff and service are awesome. If you are visiting and need a hotel near to most of attractions in London choose this hotel. ",5,2017,04,28
143,Famtastic,"Simply stated, this is a beautiful hotel with terrific rooms.  I would stay here again.  Worth every penny.  One negative comment is that the writing desk in the room was somewhat small and made working with a computer more difficult than it should have been. ",5,2017,04,27
143,Perfect upscale hotel in perfect tourist location,"The Corinthia is just wonderful.  It is in the perfect location for many tourist spots -- Trafalgar Square and the National Gallery, Parliament and Buckingham Palace.  Plus it is one block from the Embankment Underground station, so it is super convenient, yet it does not feel like it is on a very busy block.  It has a more quiet and exclusive feel.  The lobby is very pretty.  The rooms are quite comfortable and stylish. The bathroom in our room was luxurious, complete with a large tub,  separate shower with a rainfall shower head and heated tile floor  All staff was helpful and courteous.  The concierge was very helpful and made fantastic recommendations based on our interests.  The service, wine and cocktails at Bassoon were fabulous.  ",5,2017,04,27
143,Best Afternoon Tea In London,"The dining experience at this hotel is second to none and is truly an incredible experience.  Nothing is too much trouble for the staff and the quality of the food is exemplary.  I can not recommend too highly the Afternoon Tea which, I believe, is the finest in London.",5,2017,04,26
143,Simply stunning.,"If I could give this hotel 7 stars I would. If you are into design, architecture, flowers, detail and incredible service this is the hotel for you. The hotel is simply beautiful, incredibly luxurious with beautiful furnishings.
Bedrooms are out of this world, really big, huge bathrooms, total luxury.
Go for a drink in the art deco/art nouveau piano bar, absolutely fabulous.
Highly recommend and in a great part of London too.
We will most definitely be back!",5,2017,04,24
143,Absolutely wonderful stay,"The room was cozy, the bathroom to die for and the Italian resto very tasty. 
I suppose you get what you pay for. The service was impeccable.
We did have an issue with the heating in our room since the display broke and chucked out too much heat however, was solved in good time. We were upgraded to the Penthouse (though I preferred our smaller more intimate room).
Good location in Central London! ",5,2017,04,23
143,Always the best,"The Corinthia is by far the best business hotel in London! 15 minutes to everything and executive level service and amenities!

Spacious and modern rooms, great restaurants, amazing spa, and cigar terrace. A hotel for c suite level executives.",5,2017,04,21
143,Still the best hotel in London,"It is always a great pleasure to visit Corinthia Hotel in London. Exceptional rooms and always amazed with the rooms. The hotel is one of the best we've visited. If it is for leisure or business, it remains always the best. I'm always impressed with the staff and it is always great to visit.",5,2017,04,19
143,Beautiful hotel,"We went to this hotel for the buffet breakfast. We were seen to our seats and was offered coffee and toast. We then went to visit the buffet bar and the choice was huge. We started with waffles, strawberries and Greek yoghurt, moved onto a cooked breakfast, then onto cereal and finished off with pastries! It sounds a lot but we wanted to get our money's worth and also it would fill us up for the rest of the day! Delicious!",5,2017,04,17
143,Amazing !!,Amazing hotel and service! Greate location 5 minutes from Trafalgar square 1 minute from subway. Just across the river fron London Eye. Good selection for breakfast. Rooms very nice with big shower. Very clean.the staff very nice and helpful.,5,2017,04,17
143,Amazing,"Amazing hotel in a great, central location just minutes away from attractions such as the London eye. Ended up staying here a few more nights than anticipated as it was so nice. Will definitely stay here again when in London. ",5,2017,04,16
143,Best vacation,"We have stayed in numerous first-class hotels in Europe and US in the past, but Corinthia offered the best experience for us.

Classic decor inside and out, convenient location, delicious food, spa/gym amenities and the level of service are not comparable to any other. And they deliver all with ease without pretentious snobbery. Every employee seems happy to be working there, and that matters to us, clients.

We thank all the staff to make this happen, especially Sam at the Reception, who helped us with our rather peculiar request.
We are going to come back to this hotel whenever we visit London.",5,2017,04,14
143,A piece of heaven ,"This is our favourite hotel when we visit London. Fantastic location , beautifully appointed rooms, service second to none . Family friendly, adjoining rooms and family rooms available all really spacious . Attention to detail is their forte . The spa is fantastic and the treatments lovely . Beautiful pool, sauna and steam room .  Stayed here many times and can't fault it . Love this place , ",5,2017,04,11
143,A Home In London,"If you are looking for charm, class and service in one hotel, this is it.  For anyone who enjoys walking you could not ask for a better location, one can walk almost anywhere, and the best, most pass through a park.  Dining is convenient with choices and quite good.  Finally, you will not find a friendlier staff!",5,2017,04,11
143,Fabulous Stay,"I was in London for all of 50 hours last week on a business trip. I stayed at the Corinthia for two nights and, although I didn't get to enjoy all that the hotel has to offer, I did enough to give it my highest rating.

The staff were all extremely pleasant. From the moment I walked in until I left for the airport, everyone was gracious, hospitable and friendly. The room is well appointed and I could have slept in my bed there for days. I had a nice plate of fruit and some water waiting for me when I arrived. The lobby has an impressive chandelier that has 1,001 light bulbs (I was told; didn't count them myself) and beautiful floral arrangements throughout the hotel...but especially in the lobby area. 

I had dinner one night at Massimo restaurant which is located in the hotel and my meal was excellent. I also had an afternoon meeting in the outdoor cafe/sitting area. We had coffee and a light snack. It was very comfortable and relaxed.

The hotel is conveniently located within walking distance of Parliament, Big Ben, the London Eye, and many other tourist spots. If the opportunity presents itself and you can stay at Corinthia, by all means, stay there!",5,2017,04,10
143,My review ,"Loved the hotel interior design and spa area. It's a comfortable hotel. 
The only thing the people that serve in the lobby are not as nice as they should be or accommodating. 
The spa is over used in the weekends. The hotel guests feel like it's not their own. Many outsiders come and the pool is too small for laps. The massages are not that good in the spa. I didn't enjoy my massage at all. ",4,2017,04,10
143,Excellent hotel,"Excellent hotel with stunning surroundings and fantastic staff. Extremely clean, food is incredible and the smell of this hotel is even worth mentioning! Have enjoyed afternoon tea many times and always recommend to friends ",5,2017,04,09
143,Afternoon tea,"My mother and I had a lovely day in London recently for a belated Mother's Day treat, and enjoyed the fabulous afternoon tea as part of our day. The staff were kind, attentive but not obsequious. The tea was delicious- we loved the testers to smell- and the fact that endless refills were offered was lovely. Delicious delicate sandwiches were a treat, with unusual bread complimenting the fillings (we loved the radish with the cucumber). Being offered seconds was a rare treat.
The scones and fancies were beautiful, tasty and perfectly proportioned, although we found it a little strange to have an odd number of fancies for 2 of us. We were pleasantly full so didn't have more although again it was offered. The home made lemon curd with the scones was divine! 
We had champagne as well, so it made it a bit pricey, but worth every penny and I am plotting when I can go back! The setting is lovely and bright as we were lucky enough to have a beautiful day. All in all, definitely the best afternoon tea I have had.",5,2017,04,08
143,Excellent from start to finish !,This is my second stay at this hotel and it was as superb as the first time.  The service was impeccable from start to finish.  Our stay was to celebrate my husbands birthday and we were totally spoilt throughout with lots of lovely complimentary touches provided by the hotel.  Thank you for an amazing time and I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. We will certainly be returning.,5,2017,04,05
143,The best in London,"I live in London, but I keep coming back to the Corinthia as it's a little haven right in the heart of where I live - it feels like a holiday even when I stay just for the day. Everything from start to finish is excellent - check-in, the staff, the beautiful bedroom, the bathroom, the courtyard, the breakfast... and of course the spa - it's the best in London. The thing which makes me most happy about staying here, is that they value a returning guest. They haven't let their standards drop - and we're due to come back again next week - it will be the 6th time I've come in 2 years! Can't wait.",5,2017,04,05
143,Pampered treat!,"I traveled to London 3/27-4/4. Exceptional spa, efficient and highly knowledgeable staff, comfortable beds, delicious pillows, high water pressure showers, and luxurious tubs. Perfect location to walk.",5,2017,04,05
143,"Fancy, Classy, Exquisite Hotel","Fancy, tea party hotel. Fantastic location, service but tailored for the elder generations. The quiet environment demands the upper classes of the world to enjoy their stay and network. I was extremely impressed with the lunches and breakfast available - massive choices and fantastic cooking/prep.

The rooms are well built and you can enjoy nice a mellow environment. Definitely a must stay in London. Very close to tube station however the view from the hotel not great unless you are in the musician suite - you can see the famous River Thames and its' properties.",5,2017,04,03
143,Tip top!,"Have nipped in and had the amazing hot chocolate here many times - finally we stayed overnight too! The staff were impeccable, the breakfast excellent, the spa very, very good and the room/bed/bathroom spacious and relaxing. Breakfast had everything from noodles to fresh pastries to eggs Benedict. There were heated marble loungers, a really great sauna and the best jacuzzi chairs in the spa. The bed was huge and so comfortable and there was even a tv in the wall at the end of the bath. We also sat out later in the evening in the open courtyard by the fire with blankets, which was very lovely. Everything was SO good! ",5,2017,04,03
143,Elegance and 5-star class in the heart of London,"Would stay here over and over again if cost were never an option.  I absolutely LOVE this hotel.  Service is excellent, tasty food, good drinks, and afternoon tea that is to die for.  Even though this hotel is fairly large, hotel rooms still manage to have charm and are incredibly comfortable.  My favorite details of the hotel are the beautiful flower arrangements everywhere as well as the outdoor terrace where you can have tea, food, or an evening cocktail. Top notch gym and one of my favorite spa facilities in the world.  If you have time to pamper yourself, would definitely recommend booking a massage with Angel.  I have yet to find a masseuse that can ease muscular tension and stress like he can.  Corinthia hotel will not disappoint and you will feel like a celebrity every time you walk in that door.  OH and you will more often than not even see a celebrity staying there or lunching there during your stay :). Only downside is that the hotel is definitely pricey, but worth the splurge every now and again.  ",5,2017,04,02
143,Wow!,"I had the extreme pleasure of working with leadership on the sales and marketing side at this property just last week to host a group of VIP guests and a dinner. Flawless! Truly amazing treatment if my guests and myself both leading up to the event and during/after.

Despite having an almost buy-out group in house, the hotel managed to make my small group feel extremely important by upgrading their rooms, offering amenities, hotel transportation, and evening arranging special treatments for this interested.

The food during our private dinner - WOW! Cod can so easily be cooked badly but that was not the case. Same with risotto! And osso bocco. What a menu! And this was preceded by a traditional Italian anti pasta and served family style. The room, the service, the atmosphere - priceless.

I give the largest kudos to this property and cannot wait to return!",5,2017,04,01
143,Most favourite London hotel,"Visited Corinthia hotel earlier in the year .
Beautiful room great bars and excellent champagne flights . My wife and my most favourite London hotel.
The rooms are spacious and the Spa should not be missed.",5,2017,04,01
143,"Don't Bother With A Bedroom, Just Book A Bathroom","Having achieved perfection, the Corinthia management has very sensibly attached the same bathroom to every room and suite.  The only difference is that as the rooms/suites become larger, the bathrooms grow too.
At first sight the Corinthia bathroom is just a typical 5 star hotel production.  There are fluffy white towels, shiny chrome, mirrors, double basins, marble everywhere and the usual facilities.  You have to get wet to really understand the extent of this masterpiece.
As a shower enthusiast, I have never experienced or dreamt of a better shower.  It contains the largest ceiling mounted shower head I have ever seen.  As the song goes, it is like a tea-tray in the sky.  The controls are simple, large and require no effort or engineering acumen.  Then you have lift off.  You stand under a Niagara of incessant hot water – but without the distraction of any tourists.  Liquid fingers caress firmly everywhere and despite the extraordinary volume of water it all disappears with an enchanting chuckle.  The Espa toiletries are very enjoyable and well stocked.  I particularly like the citrus shower gel.  There is another movable shower head, but big brother was quite enough for me.  The only downside is that eventually you have to get out.
The other half is of the opposite gender and, of course, holds opposing views.  She prefers a bath.  In this instance I can almost understand her viewpoint.  I was firmly instructed that the bath is luxuriously comfortable.  Again it has a separate shower head.  However, I did have to agree that the waterproof TV at the foot was an excellent feature, even though I still do not understand the attraction of watching Eastenders etc. for hours.  The TV control unit is also completely waterproof and apparently you can play submarines with it or scratch your feet without damage.
I have tried hard to come up with any improvements.  My only thought is that those who like scatter cushions everywhere, might appreciate scented candles or a frosted Martini.  However, I am sure that a single phone call to room service would provide both very quickly.
This bathroom is a triumph.",5,2017,04,01
143,Afternoon Tea - absolutely delicious,"Went here for afternoon tea whilst we were in London for the weekend for my mum's birthday. It was very reasonably priced, lots and lots of delicious sandwiches and cakes and a never ending supply of tea! A great venue for a special occasion.",5,2017,03,30
143,Wonderful luxury hotel,"The Corinthia is a lovely hotel - expensive and luxurious, in an excellent location.  The rooms and conference facilities are great, the staff are knowledgeable, professional and welcoming.  Everything you would wish for in an upscale London hotel.",5,2017,03,28
143,Fifth Visit,"This was our fifth visit since the hotel opened.  GREAT HOTEL. I can understand why this hotel continues to be on everyone's top ten list. What we couldn't believe after five visits was we just discovered the Spa. We have been to many spas and it is difficult to surpass the spas in Asia, but this one does it.  The whirlpool is incredible. Do not miss the spa.",5,2017,03,27
143,Best breakfast!,"My family and I had a lovely weekend here.  Lovely spacious family room, the pool, steam and sauna were amazing!  We were limited to when we could access these areas as we were there with our children (only certain times you can enter with under 16's - but we understand this).
The choice at breakfast was lovely (hot, continental, Chinese and pastries) it is the only hotel we have stayed where you can have strawberries, blueberries and raspberries as-well-as the usual fruit salad mixes, a refreshing change!
Only 2 mins walk from Trafalgar Square too!",5,2017,03,27
143,Mother's Day afternoon tea,"My daughter booked the four of us for afternoon tea as my Mother's Day treat. We arrived nearly half hour early but were able to be seated early with no fuss.
The hotel is modern in decor with a beautiful centrepiece light fitting of glass spheres. The amount of flower displays were amazing giving a waft of a wonderful smell upon entering.
The staff are impeccably dressed and very attentive but not obtrusive.
There are about a dozen different teas available and to help you choose little test tubes of each are placed on the table for you to sniff , excellent idea!
Three levels of afternoon tea are available, with just tea, with champagne and with rose champagne.
Finger sandwiches are brought out first with some unusual flavoured bread all worked really well with the fillings. More sandwiches are on offer should you desire!
Then come the scones and little cakes, cream jam and lemon curd. Again as much as you want.
You are encouraged to try a different variety of tea, as many as you want.
Seating was comfortable and a strong duet played in the background ( a little too loud from where we sat but pleasant non the less)
All in all a wonderful experience.",5,2017,03,26
143,Most Beautiful Hotel In London,"The most beautiful hotel in London. The architecture is amazing. As you enter you feel very special with the welcoming and attentive staff and nice atmosphere. 
Recommend for staying the night, dining, simply going for an quiet drink, business meetings and highly recommend the spa! ",5,2017,03,26
143,Best Spa Hotel In London,"We stayed here for one night in January. Our room was very spacious and the bed was super comfy. Everything about the hotel is first class, service, food, drinks, concierge. We spent the afternoon in the spa which is the best I have seen in London. In the evening they have a pianist in the bar which made us stay and drink a lot more.",5,2017,03,26
143,Best hotel ever....,"I travel often for both work and with my family.  This is hands down the best hotel experience I have ever had.  The staff could not have been more courteous, helpful, or accommodating.  The room was incredibly, spacious, with a large bathroom and every comfort amenity you could require.  The tea room in the lobby was beautiful and always busy (make a reservation!) and the perfect quintessional English tea experience.  There is a beautiful high ceilinged room off the lobby where there is someone constantly arranging fresh flowers (which are everywhere you look throughout the hotel).  It is a special and lovely place.  I will come here again for work or with friends and family.  Convenient to all the tourist sites as well.  Thank you, Corinthia Hotel, for a memorable stay!

My only regret is that I did not have an opportunity to use the fitness and spa facilities, which I understand to be out of this world. ",5,2017,03,25
143,Amazing stay!,"We stayed at the Corinthia Hotel for our anniversary and what a treat it was. From the moment we arrived, every member of staff made us feel so welcome. Our room was gorgeous, spacious and comfortable. We enjoyed full use of the ESPA, which was the perfect way to recharge. We dined in The Northall, where the food was exceptional and the service impeccable. Cocktails and Live Music in Bassoon Bar was the perfect way to round off the day. We really couldn’t recommend Corinthia London highly enough. Elegant and luxurious, but with no stuffiness, and a wonderful team of staff. Cannot wait to return - hopefully sooner rather than later.",5,2017,03,23
143,Luxury treat for yourself ,"We stayed in a luxurious suite room. The room was very spacious, bathroom was perfect , especially loved the floor heating. The room service was prepering your room for the night also, preparing your bed, your water by the bed, a very warm touch. Also enjoyed having my tea at the lobby, the building has high ceilings, creating a comfortable atmosphere when it is raining outside....",5,2017,03,22
143,Luxury weekend,"Wow what a gorgeous hotel. Such a focus on customers from the small little details to the overall service. The room was spacious, modern and with all luxury amenities including a TV next to the bath tub :)
The breakfast was so vast and yummy. I loved the Asian section. My best time was however spent in the spa. Never seen such a massive jacuzzi. Bliss!",5,2017,03,21
143,A romantic treat in the heart of London," I stayed at the Corinthia for Valentine weekend in February. It is a true 5 stars hotel with minor things that could be changed for a perfect experience. The inside is marvelous, high ceiling, spotless tea area, excellent staff. One of the best hotel breakfast I ever had, in 2 beautiful massive rooms and with some original Asian suggestions for the more adventurous! Although the hotel is big, it always fell intimate. Our room was great with a warm atmosphere u didn't expect. I adored the heated bathroom floor. The bathroom curtain and blinds were broken though, and needed serious repair which fell strange for this level of hotel. Corinthia is very well located. Outside are your typical grand and classic London buildings, close to the river. But of course we went for the famous spa. It does get busy so be careful with the moment u pick to go (can't imagine what it's like on a Saturday). In an outstanding dark setting, incredible sauna, massive jacuzzi pool, perfect hammam, lovely sleeping pods. But its low point is its visible popularity. Some parts could get an update, a couple of broken elements, lots of towels everywhere. Could do with more staff inside to tell people to keep quiet also! But it is very impressive. We also tried the room service which was pricey and a bit slow but good. So I would definitely recommend the Corinthia for a romantic getaway. They could do with a little refurbishment but it definitely is a 5 star hotel!

143,"Incredible incredible hotel, spa & staff","Wowwwww what can I say.. my wife and I had the pleasure to stay here for 1 night in an executive suite. We were using some credit we had back from our honeymoon and decided to use it toward a night in london. I only wish we had of known about this place sooner.

Im from brighton but living in Mexico with my wife who's from New York. We wanted to be tourists for a couple of days in london but this place was so amazingly good we couldn't be bothered to use our 2 day hop on hop off tickets and stayed mainly at the hotel only using Uber and a bit of bus time to grab a bikini and shorts from Harrods because we'd forgotten to bring our swim stuff for the spa. 

I overheard a guy saying it's the best spa in london and I shrugged it off thinking 'yeh right' but worth checking out all the same. When we got down there after our little shop and coffee at harrods it was like stepping in to the most trendy lounge bar but it's actually a spa. It's super modern, the design is out of this world and the atmosphere and detail is amazing. I don't know who designed this place but you can see their passion has gone in to it down to the last shadow gap and floating edge to lighting feature.

The 360 glass sauna is as cool as it looks on the pictures and actually everything here is as good as its looks online. 

We have fallen in love with the place all round and would love to return (if we can find a good deal as it's not chap) when we return in the summer from Mexico.

The staff are well trained and excellent communicators and very friendly not snooty as you might expect at this end of the market. 

Nothing was too much or too difficult if we asked. They were very flexible with check out times and taking care of our bags etc. We were also allowed to use the spa before leaving to catch our train. 

The concierge were very helpful and tried their best and came through above and beyond what we asked them to help with. 

Nice atmosphere everywhere and cocktails might be pricey but well made and strong :-) 

Can't wait to come back (if we can) 

Oh and perfect location for everything we even walked from watching the changing of the guards at Buckingham palace here and only took 15 mins. Nice walk through the park. 

It's near everything you might want to go to in london but beware this place is so good you might not end up doing half the things you intended to do. That's what happened to us haha 

Enjoy corinthia, the best hotel in london if not the best in most countries of the world. 

5 stars !!!!! 

K and j",5,2017,03,18
143,Perfect location and relax,"I stayed in Corinthia twice and both times it was an amazing experience. The rooms are stylishly furnished and decorated. All was very new and fresh, it felt like at home. Bathrooms are cosy and you want to spend more time there. The cosmetic brand was also very good, I wanted to buy one at the Spa for myself, but they didn't have exactly the same the housekeeping put in the room. One of our rooms had a walk in wardrobe with a big window. 
The hotel is very well located. It is just one step away from the busy Trafalgar square on the one hand and few more steps from the Houses of Parliament on the other. But the trick is that you don't hear the noise from the streets. All food was good. 5 o'clock tea is served in the lobby - a round space with a dome shaped ceiling and a beautiful airy chandelier.",5,2017,03,17
143,1 of our favorite hotels,"We had an amazing weekend with big thanks to the Corinthia hotel. The place is just amazing. the rooms, the staff the breakfast, the location, the whole experience just blew us away. This is where we will be staying from now on when in London. Highly recommend",5,2017,03,16
143,Understated but unsurpassed high tea,"This is not the first time I have had the privilege of high tea at the Corinthia. I think the thing that I love about it is that it is casual and relaxed but in the most beautiful setting and with the most delicate and delicious flavours. High tea should be something that is both a treat but also something you would feel comfortable doing every day (as I am sure people would have done in the past - a daily occurrence) and that is what the Corinthia achieves with what seems like minimal effort. 

Particularly note-worthy on this visit was cucumber sandwiches on cranberry bread... and that is something to say as I am not a fan of cucumber on bread generally. 

The fancies and delicious warm scones are always a treat and we were even given a lovely little take home pastry case for the ones that we just couldn't manage to eat on the day.

It is a beautiful and indulgent affair that I wish was more of a regular habit in my life than it actually is... it is a time to be present, a time to enjoy the moment and a time to drink tea and eat the loveliest cakes..",5,2017,03,16
143,Hotel for all,"this is a hotel that soothes your quality because the hotel can give a high quality services, a superb breakfast. i would love to recommend this hotel to my friends. i love place of the hotel. it so relaxing and quiet.",5,2017,03,16
143,Overnight stay to celebrate my wife's birthday,As ever the hotel provided a superlative service and the staff remain beyond compare in London.  Facilities are wonderful and it is very easy to relax and enjoy the atmosphere.  Always my preferred option in London.,5,2017,03,14
143,Assured good service,The high quality of service at this hotel is consistent - The place to be if you want to be sure you are not let down over service and facilities. Visiting here is always a pleasant experience due to the diligent and attentive staff. Highly recommended.,5,2017,03,13
143,What a hotel ! ,"Simply Devine !! Would thoroughly recommend  a truly beautiful hotel, great location, superb service, breakfast was amazing. my son wanted a bath every night to watch the bath tv!! - which I really enjoyed too the bath was lovely and deep perfect after walking around London all day.
And the spa wow ! - one of the best, the design and lighting was stunning.
Will definitely be back. ",5,2017,03,13
143,Incredible ,"A perfect weekend break, this hotel is faultless.  Must be the best in London.

The hotel was running at full occupancy, yet we were made to feel like the only guests in the property.

We are both in the luxury hospitality business and had high expectations, which were surpassed.",5,2017,03,12
143,Comfort and Class,"We recently spent one week at this magnificent hotel. The best location for taking in all the sites- the london eye, big ben, westminster abbey, trafalgar square, and piccadilly circus were all within a 15 min walk or less. Buckingham palace 20 min walk.
We ate at both high end and moderate priced restaurants - all within 15 min walk, and great food and wines.  Finally, sooo many quaint pubs nearby and the hotel bars were very nice.  Highly recommend this hotel!!!",5,2017,03,12
143,Blissful stay,"This was the best hotel I have ever stayed in as far as attention to detail and customer service. The spa facilities are amazing in a very relaxing and therapeutic atmosphere. The stand out for me was the very indulgent breakfast! Everything you could ever imagine was on offer. 😊
I will definitely be recommending the Corinthia to friends and family.
5* experience and hope to return again very soon !",5,2017,03,12
143,Spettacoloso ,"Top Marks for Massimo!

We just spent a great weekend at the Corinthia. 

All the food in the hotel was very good, but our best meal was definitely dinner at Massimo’s. Everything was perfect!

We loved the stylish décor, friendly people and warm atmosphere, but most of all the presentation and taste of all the plates was amazing. 

For the top quality we had, I think the price was very good. 

Bravi!

143,The Family room,"I took my wife on our first vacation abroad with our kids, and I wanted it to be perfect; staying at  The Corinthia London actually enhanced our vacation experience.

Every staff member with whom we came in contact was attentive and kind including the Italian Receptionist at the check in and the Guest Services Team.

They offer complementary pram and room service food for the kids up to 3 years old.

We have already decided to return to the The Corinthia London for our next vacation in the near future.

We had a wonderful stay vacation, and I have recommended The Corinthia London to all of my colleagues, friends and family. Thank you again for such outstanding service.",5,2017,03,11
143,Two Glorious Weeks!,"We spent two wonderful weeks in an executive room.  Our stay was a true test of any hotel's quality and consistency. Elegant without vulgar flash, the Corinthia provided the best sort of service and luxury.  Perhaps most importantly for us, the staff were unfailing helpful, civil, and unobtrusive. From the doorman, who always knew where we were off to for the evening, to Pasquale at breakfast, who never let our tea cups get cold or our marmalade run out, our visit was relaxed and memorable. This is our new home in London!",5,2017,03,06
143,This must be the best hotel in London...,"Just returned from a weekend in the Corinthia and the experience was exceptional from check in onwards. The property itself is beautiful, great attention to detail with very nice restaurants and bars. As is widely known the Spa is also one of the best in the country. Overall, however, it is the staff that make the real difference. Unfailingly helpful, polite and genuinely friendly they play a very large part in making the overall experience so enjoyable. 

Having stayed in many 5 star hotels in London this was our favourite hotel to date and I think we will now become regulars of the Corinthia. This hotel seems to have the most positive reviews of any in London - and although I wasn't sure if it would live up to them - it was actually even better than expected. Not cheap but it feels like you are getting what you pay for.A very highly recommended hotel in a great location. ",5,2017,03,06
143,Sumptuous room in perfect location,"We stayed as a treat on my wife's birthday. Outstanding room, finished to a very high degreee. Very comfortable bed. Couldn't fault the facilities but the staff service - both in the bar that evening and at breakfast - was indifferent. After I had left for work, my wife had three trips up and down from reception to get a key that worked.",4,2017,03,05
143,Afternoon Tea in London,"We were delighted with the impecable service and delicious fancies and scruptious scones.The finger sandwiches were moorish and went well with a lovely chilled glass of champagne. Will look to return soon, as The Corinthia has a terrific location near Whitehall Gardens and perfect for Afternoon Tea.",5,2017,03,04
143,absolutely gorgeous hotel,This hotel is gorgeous hotel in the centre of London. The room is luxurious. The bed is big and comfortable. Even my 1 yr old loved this hotel and the wonderful cot that they setup for her. The bathroom is big with a huge bathtub. I just wished I could've stay here for a few more nights/weeks. The service from the entrance to the front desk and the restaurant was exceptional as you would expect at this price range. I will not hesitate to book this hotel for my next stay if it is within my budget and use some more of the facilities that I didn't get to try. But at least I was able to bump into Dezel Washington on my floor =),5,2017,03,02
143,Amazing staff,"This is truly one of the best hotels that I have stayed in so far. This is simple due to the amazing staff we have encountered here. Me and my SO needed a few days to relax so decided on this hotel based on the spa reviews . What a perfect choice for us as it turned out all the positive reviews were true . For me personally it's not about the room it's more about the people you encounter. Even though every member of the staff was absolutely great I just have to thank 3 people that made our stay truly special. 
Ana Maria at the reception desk . What a wonderful and truly professional lady. Check in was a breeze , made us feel welcome straight away took us to our room and showed us around the hotel. Recommended the spa and she was absolutely right - best spa in London ! 
She was very friendly and made us feel like we were in the right place. 
Doriane -  therapist in the spa. My girlfriend was absolutely please with her treatment she booked in the spa . This young lady made her day special. Friendly attitude , professional , there was nothing she could fault . 
Saviana - therapist in the spa. If you ever need a massage in Corinthia , this is the lady to ask for . Best massage I've had so far in a 5* spa . Friendly but professional attitude and very skilled . 
Our entire stay was amazing . 
The hotel is located in the heart of London close to anything you would like to visit .
Breakfast selection was great for us , Very good selection and the quality was premium as you would expect for a 5* establishment.
We will definitely be back to Corinthia as this is now our no 1 hotel in London. 
Again big thank you to the entire staff in Corinthia !

143,March 2017 Stay,"My husband and I stayed here for nearly a week.  Everything about this hotel is perfect from the bellmen to the room service.  Rooms are large by any standard with beautiful bathroom tub and shower, underfloor heating and large bedroom area with desk for working and very comfy bedding.  The main lounge area indoors and out is perfect for a cup of coffee or afternoon tea.  We used the gym which was recently refurbished.  We went around 7am and it was pretty quiet.  Very nice equipment.  The spa is amazing.  Great massages and jacuzzi/pool/sauna/lounge areas.  We've tried a lot of hotels in London, but this is by the far the best.  We've stayed here with our kids and parents too with adjoining rooms.  The breakfast buffet is one of the best we've had anywhere!  Massimo for dinner was also great.  Easy to walk in and grab a table on weeknight.",5,2017,03,02
143,Little details create large outcomes!,"Got an upgrade given to us to an executive room. Big thanks for that! On the way to the room, the staff member asked what we were up to that weekend. Mentioned it was my wife's birthday. Later on, we were surprised with a birthday cake in our room from the hotel. Really nice touch after such an innocuous conversation in a lift. Room was amazing and the oval bath something special.  Made use of the spa facilities which really do have the wow factor. After having a great breakfast brought to our room the following morning, we both had personalised massages which rounded off the weekend by leaving us both totally relaxed.  All the staff we met were attentive but not intrusive, which suits us perfectly. This is in a great location and I felt it was well worth it's cost. Definitely a place to give your other half a special weekend.",5,2017,02,28
143,Fab Hotel with Prices to match!,"Stayed here for a couple of nights in Dec16 , visited Hyde park's winter wonderland , 
not so much wonder as disgust really . another review if i get time .
But the Hotel was excellent , we ate out one night at the nearby Shades pub , well cooked basic menu. then ate in Northall (in hotel )for evening set meal . Cant fault the evening meal lovely well cooked and presented . worth every penny . 
Had a drink in the bar earlier that day and saw a few celebs. Alfie Bow , and Kev Pieterson , needless to say i didnt dare approach him to say hi . a week later he had a bust up with Dan evans(brit tennis player ) dodged a bullet there!
If you like cars pop along to see all the smart sports cars of the residents. 
Used the spar/swimming pool twice , very nice , changing rooms are amazing , an open fire? and sleeping pods . i only went for a little swim and a sauna , didn't feel i required a kip after all that exertion but help yourself . 
Prices are very high but service excellent as you would expect for £19.50 for 2 IpA brew dogs! or £34.50 for two gin and tonics! (should have shared the fevertree)£5.50 each bottle . oh well its more for people who don't care.
If you can afford to visit i would thoroughly recommend it , very close to London Eye and tube station .",4,2017,02,27
143,A great Lunch offer,"Had lunch here with an offer of 3 courses, plus a glass of Laurent Pierre champagne for £35. A great welcome, and all the way through the waiters were attentive, but not obtrusive. A good selection of food for all 3 courses, in fact I was so full that I didn't have pudding, so they put my coffee on the bill instead of the third course. Be warned, a glass of wine was SO expensive, but you really didn't need it, as the glass of champagne was a full one. Would definitely go again.",5,2017,02,25
143,One of my favourite London Hotels,"My husband and I like to try out different London hotels and after looking on the Corinthia hotel website and reading the positive reviews we decided on the Corinthia and I'm so glad we did! 

Firstly the location is fab, your walking distance from many of Londons great attractions such as St James Park, Big Ben, London Eye, Westminster, Trafalgar Square and Buckingham Palace to name a few. 

The hotel itself was everything we hoped it would be, the inside and decor is beautiful and has everything you would expect from a top class hotel, including fast wifi :) 

Despite having been out for lunch, on arriving back to the hotel we couldn't resist sitting in the lobby area for a coffee and trying a scone, which was definitely one of the best I've eaten! Would really like to do afternoon tea here next time we visit. 

I have to mention the spa - it's amazing and definitely has to be used while staying here. Unfortunately as we were travelling with a baby we wasn't able to have any treatments but we did use the swimming pool. The design of the spa was so modern & contemporary and every aspect was so well thought out, the whole thing was just stunning! 

The only slight issue i had with the spa area was there was no where with baby changing facilities, so in the changing room trying to get myself ready for swimming and the baby was quite difficult as theres no table or anywhere soft such as a little sofa/bench to put the baby down on. However once i went out to the pool area i found there was sofas next to the pool so next time i would use that to get the baby changed etc. 

Our room was lovely, we booked into a junior suite which was very spacious with a big walk in wardrobe and a bathroom with a tv in the bath. There was also a nice view of the hotels courtyard and a little balcony you can stand outside on. 

In the evening we didn't get a chance to eat in the hotel restaurant, all the swimming and walking around had tired the baby out so we decided to make the most of our lovely room, order in room service and relax. The food itself was nice but like many London hotels the room service was ridiculously expensive, although i would say Corinthia was perhaps even more expensive when comparing it to the other London 5* hotels i have visited. I still don't understand how anyone can justify £5 for a can of coke! Also as we were spending the night in the room we thought we would watch a movie, however the cost of watching one was £20! Once again i just couldn't justify that to watch a film, i could buy the film for half that price so out of principle i said I didn't want to hire one. I've been to many hotels that offer complementary movies, its just a nice little touch especially as it doesn't cost the hotel anything for a guest to watch it so i was disappointed that this service wasn't offered. 

Breakfast the next morning in the hotel restaurant was lovely, definitely up there with one of the best breakfast selections I've seen, there is literally everything you could possibly want for breakfast. We really enjoyed what we ate, however we did have a little issue with our order not coming out right and when we brought this to the waitresses attention she didn't even apologise and it took about 15 minutes for the rest of our order to come out (the breakfast was missing the sausage, hash brownand beans) however despite this little blip it was still a lovely breakfast. 

Overall our experience of this hotel was a very positive one, in general the staff were lovely and very welcoming, always greeting you with a smile and a 'hello' but something that i thought was particularly lovely was my son was left a present in his cot - a little soft toy and baby bath products. This was so thoughtful, please pass on my thanks to whoever would have arranged this. Its things like this that make this hotel a very special place to visit, and we will definitely look forward to returning here in the future.

143,Flawless Afternoon Tea Baby Shower,"The food, ambiance and service was the best afternoon tea I have had in London.  The tea selection was top notch and the wait staff was very accommodating to all the different requests we had of them. The food was fresh and if there were any substitution or top ups needed the staff was happy to do so.  This place is perfect of a leisurely afternoon tea and is best enjoyed if you have 2 to 3 hours to spend here.",5,2017,02,21
143,The best of the best!,"I recently stayed at the Corinthia hotel and my experience was wonderful. From the moment I stepped onto the premise I felt like everyone was helpful and kind, from the porter to receptionist to housekeeping. They do treat you like royalty to ensure you a most pleasant stay. The lobby atrium was gorgeous and the florist shop makes you dazzle with enchantment at the pretty bouquets. My room was extremely spacious with modern appointed furnishings that made you feel at home. The bed felt like sleeping on air and the bathtub with TV was to die for. I decided to pamper myself and used the ESPA and my massage was so relaxing. I almost wish I had more time there. I've been to some very nice hotels in my life and this might have been the best! Truly a five star hotel!",5,2017,02,20
143,Weekend break,"We spent two nights at The Corinthia and couldn't recommend it highly enough. The outstanding feature was the wonderful staff, so friendly and helpful. Also definitely the best breakfast ever!! Will certainly be going back for the amazing food and staff and feel we need to mention the chef who was so friendly and welcoming. Thank you for a fantastic weekend. ",5,2017,02,19
143,Spectacular,"This hotel has excellent service, quite rooms, great piano bar and the butler service we rate it as 5 stars service. The ESPA Spa its spectacular, the pool and sauna relaxing area is something not to miss. The location of the hotel is in London city centre, 2 minutes walk to Trafalgar Square, near Embakment tube station, it's walking distance to House of Parliament, London Eye and Embakment area (where you have different options to eat). We have stayed here aprox 9 times and each time its a better experience. 
We totally recommend it, book with enough time so you can get better rates. ",5,2017,02,18
143,Oysters & champagne,"I was born in the wrong era... can see myself sitting in the roaring 20s, all dressed up, eating oysters and sipping champagne at the Corinthia all day! Love the ambiance... need to save money to also actually spend the night there, to complete my dream picture ;-)",5,2017,02,18
143,London favourite ,"The bars and restaurants are amazing, the staff are excellent and the decor and setting are fabulous. 

In my view, the best hotel in London by far. Top tip: Eat in the Northall, the food is quite incredible. ",5,2017,02,17
143,Excellent ,"This is most definitely a top hotel, although there were a few more scuffs and scratches in the room than I would've expected, but that's being very very picky.
The room was very well appointed, clean and fresh.
Comfy bed, clean spacious bathroom.
Hotel staff are courteous and efficient.
I have stayed here before and will do so again.

143,The hotel is great; the spa is amazing!,"We spent 4 nights in a beautifully appointed room. The room and bathroom were very generously sized (especially for London) and had all the comforts one expects from a luxury hotel. There are a number of options for dining and drinks in the hotel, and, although we are not fans of buffets, the breakfast was delicious. The real treat is the spa, which is multi-level and has an indoor pool, large and incredible spa, etc. We are definitely returning.",5,2017,02,15
143,Awesome afternoon tea,"Had a birthday Afternoon tea treat at the lobby lounge this past weekend and it was incredible!

Fresh sandwiches, beautifully presented cakes and nice warm scones were the order of the day!

The staff are amazing (especially Belen who looked after us so good even thought we had a one year old running all over!) and I really felt special!

Thanks Corinthia!",5,2017,02,14
143,Corinthian Hotel London,"The Corinthian Hotel in London continues to amazes me. 
The staff is of the finest caliber as well as the amenities.
Enjoyed the outside lounge this time. Don't know how we missed it.
I highly recommend room service for the food is delicious!",5,2017,02,14
143,Excellent,"This is an excellent hotel just along the river Thames and Trafalgar square, the rooms are stunning the pool area is probably one of the most relaxing ones we have been to and the whole place is stunning.
Great location you can walk to most places from here",5,2017,02,11
143,Perfect,"The Hotel is excellent based on London standards, the location is perfect close to landmarks and transportation.

The Spa and facilities are one of a kind in London, and I will recommend the Hotel for holidays and definitely for Business",4,2017,02,10
143,Excellent service and afternoon tea with champagne,"Had a very enjoyable afternoon tea here. All of the high quality you would expect from this standard of hotel. Service excellent, food delightful. If you want a couple of hours out of the hustle and bustle well worth a visit.",5,2017,02,09
143,PERFECTION PERSONIFIED,"IT has taken many years and many spa experiences and holidays to finally say the experience from start to finish was perfect. EVery single member of staff we encountered, the food and every second of my experience at the Corinthia was perfect, without fault and beyond my high expectations.

This is now officially where I will be coming whenever I am able to treat myself.

The spa experience he beats the four seasons and even the Wynn and the MGM in Vegas.

From the stunning glass sauna with wooden ceiling sculpture and jazz music to the amazing treatments (I recommend the 2 hr espa facial and full body massage) and then the sleep pods, what a treat.

I do not know what else to say, the food and juices are amazing , the decor is lush, the rooms are small but clean and perfectly decorated.

One day I wish I can afford to treat my husband to this experience.",5,2017,02,04
143,所有景點的中心,"飯店整體設計走典雅英倫風，房內空間非常寬敞，無論什麼房型都會有自己的更衣室和玄關，備品使用知名spa品牌""ESPA""的產品，香味很舒壓，感覺也有助睡眠。飯店的地理位置太!棒!了!我們很喜歡走路，住在這裡，到哪都可以步行抵達。步行到Embankment Station只要1分鐘/Big Ben, London Eye只要5分鐘/白金漢宮, The National Gallery, National Portrait Gallery只要10分鐘/SOHO(chinatown), Regent St.不用15分鐘/Oxford St.約20分鐘內/Harrods, St. Paul教堂, Millennium Bridge約30分鐘/London bridge, Tower bridge約40-45分鐘。飯店的早餐很豐盛，還有中式區，有粥、油條、菜瓜，很酷，而且叉燒包非常好吃!如果旅程有長輩同行時，非常適合入住這間飯店。地下室的spa水療區是免費使用到晚上10點的，晚上一定要抽空去水療區休息，很值得體驗一下。",5,2017,02,03
143,Our favourite home from home,"Stayed once again in our most favourite hotel in our favourite City.

We decided to upgrade and what a fabulous room Maria on reception gave to us!
I didn't want to leave our room at all however we had guests/clients staying wth us too so we had to pull ourselves away although, not too far away as we ate in the Hotel plus paid a visit to the wonderful Basoon Jazz Bar that is located on the ground floor.  As always Dominique and his wonderful team truly looked after us as no one else can and we had our usual Apple Martinis that are the best ever!
Love the Corinthia, it's pure Class!",5,2017,02,01
143,The best Champagne Brunch in London,"I would just like to say a huge thank you to Cas and his wonderful team who looked after us yesterday in The Northall for the Jazz Champagne Brunch. 

I'm a regular brunch goer in London and I have to say The Corinthia is the best in town. 
The Laurent Perrier was flowing, the food was excellent and the addition of the Jazz band just made the whole experience complete. 
I hope by writing this review I haven't shot myself in the foot by getting a table again in the future. 

Thanks again Cas and Team. ",5,2017,01,30
143,An incredible stay - cannot wait to return,"Wow. I've stayed here a few times before but this stay surpassed all the others and, to date, is one of the nicest stays I've ever had anywhere in the world.
My husband had to change his plans and arrive very late at night so it was much appreciated to have late checkout, which was cheerfully offered, even insisted on :) We also got upgraded - even the basic rooms here are amazing, but this one was even better. The bed was very comfortable, the towels and robes - new, thick, and luxurious, and the barroom - large and gorgeous.
The concierge helped us with restaurant bookings. And when I mixed things up and missed a booking, I was promptly directed to an alternative that worked out very well (and we wouldn't have found a restaurant like this on our own, especially on Chinese New Year).
I could go on and on, but the point is that we have felt incredibly welcome by everyone we interacted with. The food was delicious - we had dinner, breakfast, and spa snacks here, the decor - beautiful, but most importantly, the staff went above and beyond to make our week-end truly special.
I cannot wait to return and am actually now checking out the list of other cities Corinthia has hotels in and may plan a trip just to try out another one :)
Finally, a special thank you to Jochem who was amazing.",5,2017,01,29
143,"Elegant and beautiful, exceeded my expectations!","I stayed in this hotel over the Christmas week. My usual place is the Four Seasons but this time it was super busy. So I chose a slightly off the beaten track place. A local friend recommended this hotel. I went in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. The room was beautifully lit and furnished. Loved the balcony. The hotel itself, lobby etc was decorated for Christmas in a tasteful way without being tacky. The swan lake theme worked well with the high ceiling and chandelier.  The decor was mostly pastel mixed with dark wood, spacious, soothing and tranquil. There were candles lit all over the lobby every evening. Live piano playing in the distance. Staff were unobtrusively attentive, true sign of a fine hotel. It felt like living in a tasteful and elegant house rather than a hotel. The commercial quality was absent due to little details where every thing was unique, one of a kind and not generic. Room service was prompt. I wish I had spent more time hanging out at the hotel. I did have afternoon tea at the lobby which was amazing. I highly recommend this hotel in London, especially if your visit is personal and not business. Enchanting!",5,2017,01,28
143,This was a real treat!,"Just checked out after a night in this fabulous hotel.  When checking in, we were asked the reason for our stay, and explained it was to celebrate a landmark birthday, so we were given a free upgrade of our room.  Later some cake appeared with birthday wishes.
The room was everything you would hope for from this standard of hotel, and a little bit more. Even a floating TV remote control to go in the bath!",5,2017,01,26
143,One of the best hotels in the world,"I have stayed in a lot of great hotels in many cities, but returning to the Corinthia is still special.  The public spaces are truly spectacular, but still comfortable, personal and welcoming.  The rooms are sophisticated but comfortable, having marble bathrooms with baths, and excellent beds and linen.  The service is (almost) always flawless and the spa pools need to be seen and used, although they are tucked away out of sight. We used all of the services including free shoe cleaning, and use of the hotel Jaguar for local trips like being dropped at our West End theatre, and the generous late check out policy. Finally the location is wonderful, a quiet street, yet close to everything. If you haven't visited it needs to be on your bucket list.  I will be finding some excuse to return again.",5,2017,01,24
143,My favorite London hotel,I have been staying at the Corinthia Hotel in London since it opened several years ago and I have never been disappointed.  The staff is friendly and professional; the hotel itself is absolutely beautiful; and the entire experience is always a pleasure.,5,2017,01,23
143,Spectacular spa...and people-watching,"Four floors deep into London, the spa at the Corinthia is nothing short of spectacular. I visited alone this time, deciding on a day devoid of too much chatter (sorry friends, ha!).

The spa is huge, complex, disorientating at first, due to its organic circular pods and layout. Seriously, there's barely a right-angle in the whole place. But this clever design means that even although there may be many people using the spa, everyone feels hidden - in a circular shower-area, a curved seat in the steam room or shielded by an infinity fire.

On this busy Saturday, the staff were polite, discreet and friendly. (More than could be said of some of the guests, one of whom refused to stop taking photos when asked, the other who refused to leave her jug of water safely at the entrance to the thermal floor. They, really, were the only slight sour note to my whole day there.)

The sleep pods are a dream, the heated marble beds outrageously soothing and the waterfall showers a blessing for knotty shoulders. Lemony-water, fresh fruit and clean towels are available throughout the space.

It's not cheap (well, I guess that part is relative)...but...it'll leave you feeling wonderful, even when you have to step outside and back to the real world again. Do it.",5,2017,01,22
143,Special night away x ,"My husband and I treated ourselves to a night away here as it is just across the theatre we were going to in the evening. We had a bright airy room with a huge comfy bed, warm bathroom and robes. Afternoon tea in the Crystal Moon lounge was delicious plus we had chocolate cake sent to our room as we were celebrating an anniversary, lovely gesture. Breakfast was plentiful in the Northhall, excellent service here too. Would definitely stay again and must try out the Espa facilities sometime too. Thank you Corinthia for a memorable stay x ",5,2017,01,21
143,The best Hotel I have ever been!,"We were celebrating our anniversary and we decide it to stay in this Hotel to celebrate. What can I say? It was  perfect, from the beggining, the personal is so kind and helpful, the lobby is unbelievable, it was new year's eve and the decoration was wordless. Definetely is a luxury hotel. The accomodation was great, the bathroom was perfect and big, the service they provided to us was incredible. Actually I do not have enough words to describe how good this hotel is. The hotel is located in front of the London Eye, so we had free access to the fireworks and it was an amazing experience, the price, its expensive, but its worth it. Our favorite part of this celebration, was the SPA. It is somethig we havent found in any other hotel. The Spa is so big, that you actually will find  4 floors just for it, 2 pools, saunas, sleeping areas , coffee areas, etc.
One of the bests experience in our lifes. Corinthia Hotel London.",5,2017,01,20
143,Man in the Hat,The northall restaurant was really good the staff for attentive the food was impressive and the Cigar Lounge and humidor were excellent I was there for lunch and it was a great afternoon looking forward to my next visit in May,5,2017,01,20
143,Just perfect!,"I was so surprised about this hotel, everything was perfect, the staff is wonderful! The rooms are perfectly decorated and new, the food amazing and the location outstanding, London Top 3 hotel for sure!",5,2017,01,19
143,Great Service and Friendly Staff,"Fabulous hotel, we thoroughly enjoyed our recent visit.

Comfortable rooms, superb Spa, good location and great food. Particularly enjoyed afternoon tea in the lovely lounge setting under that amazing chandelier.

Spoilt for choice at breakfast, lovely selection on the buffet.

Can't wait to go back. Really is a top class hotel, one of London's finest in my opinion.",5,2017,01,18
143,Perfectly lovely!!!,"We had the pleasure of staying at the Corinthia Hotel is October. We had an wonderful stay.  Terrific location, walkable neighborhood,  and close to the tube.

The staff is professional , extremely helpful, courteous, and friendly. They were very knowledgeable with guidance for restaurants, right on point.

The lobby is beautifully appointed with magnificent floral arrangements which they do on site. Stunning!

Our room was spacious and well thought out. Bed was very comfortable with great linens. We slept very soundly.

We will make the Corinthia our hotel of choice when we are in London.",5,2017,01,17
143,Another Wonderful Stay,"We had the pleasure of staying at the Corinthia for the 4th time over Christmas and we had a wonderful stay.

There have been some recent comments criticizing service and food.  I could not disagree more on either front.

First of all, I have to highlight how helpful and accommodating the hotel was to us.  Due to delayed flights, missing bags and attacks in Berlin, we changed our travel plans at the last minute and arrived in London days early - on Christmas Eve.  The hotel found a way to include us in the Christmas dinner which was fully committed.  We greatly appreciated the effort.  We were also able to get last minute spa appointments - again much appreciated.

Our room (a deluxe junior suite) was fabulous.  Spacious with an entry area, sitting area with table, etc. and then a large bedroom with walk-in closet and large bathroom (with dual sinks, separate shower and tub).  We even had a small balcony.  Note to the hotel:  coat hooks in the entry would be really helpful!

The Christmas dinner was delicious as were the breakfasts in Northall.  We also enjoyed the fish & chips that we had in the Bassoon Bar.

If I had to cite a weak point, it would be Massimo's restaurant.  We ate there on a previous stay and were not wowed.   We went for a drink on this stay and the service was less than spectacular.

We have stayed several places in London and we debate trying another - but we keep coming back to the Corinthia.  It is so hard to beat as far as location, ambience, pretty much everything.  We have now been at the hotel for Christmas (spectacular decorations).  We were there last year for NYE and had an amazing time.

Highly recommended.",5,2017,01,16
143,Sophistication redefined ,"This is not any hotel. This is ""the"" go to hotel in London. Everything that this establishment has to offer is 5 star and more. The staff are exceptional, the rooms immaculate with wonderful Espa products, and the spa is simply the best. It is pricey but it is worth every penny for a haven in a busy city.",5,2017,01,16
143,A perfect 5!,"I have stayed at many amazing hotels but this hotel was, by far, the best one. I give it a 5+. 

Location - right in the center of London, next to the London Eye, Big Ben, Leicester Square, etc. 5/5

Service - absolutely amazing. The staff had made the stay extremely comfortable and convenient. Concierge and reception were also very friendly and gave some good advice and tips. 5/5

Facilities - incredible interior design and spa. The lobby and restaurant are beautiful and create an amazing atmosphere. Also, there is a flower shop on the ground floor, which sends the amazing smell of fresh flowers throughout the ground floor. 5/5

Food - very tasty food and overall a great selection of food throughout the entire day. The afternoon tea was incredible. 5/5

Rooms - very spacious with extremely comfortable beds. Very clean overall, which is extremely important. 5/5

Price - the hotel is definitely a little pricey but absolutely worth it. You get exactly what you are paying for. 5/5",5,2017,01,15
143,Pure luxury in central London,"We stayed here for a long weekend in June last year. This hotel is very well presented and exactly what you would expect from a true 5 star in London. The rooms are super luxurious and the marble bathroom is stunning.
I loved the turndown service gifts, they were always very thoughtful (Thumbs up for the lavender sleeping spray!) 
We visited the spa which is probably the feature of this hotel with no doubt about that! The whole spa is so well presented and you will have a very relaxing experience. 
Location wise you could not be better located in the city. Tube is only a couple of minutes away (Embankment) and there is no shortage of taxis in that street. 
The bar was really nice but drinks were so pricy! We'll definitely recommend anyone to stay there when booking a trip to London you will not regret it! 
",5,2017,01,12
143,Great location for NYE,"Went to London to celebrate New Year. We decided to stay at Corinthia Hotel.
From arrival to departure, service was great. 

The room is well designed, clean, and quite big by UK standard. The breakfast was excellent. 

They have 2 nice restaurants, we tried them all and food was great. The tea time seems quite famous as we didnt get a chance to try it due to fullybooked on our last day.

The hotel is located inside the NYE ticketed area. So you can just walk out from hotel at anytime to view the firework from opposite London Eye. The tube station is just next door (Embankment).

Stayed for 8 nights and we had a great stay.
",5,2017,01,12
143,Weekend Break,"i honestly think this hotel is absolutely stunning, the rooms are amazing and the decor of the whole place is breathtaking. The food and drinks in The Northall and Bassoon bar are out of this world. The only things I would say would let it down ever so slightly would be the service in The Northall which I would definitely say needs a lot of work however I did make comments of this on departure and they did acknowledge that it wasn't what they strive themselves on. I would 100% recommend this hotel and I'm sure we will definitely return. It's very expensive but definitely worth it! We will be back.",4,2017,01,12
143,Simply stunning Christmas Decorations,"We booked into this Hotel for three days on our way to Europe ,our first experience with Corinthia Hotels and we had also booked one in Budapest. The hotel is centrally located near the Embankment Tube and within walking distance form  The London Eye, Piccadilly Circus and Trafalgar square.  On Arriving we were checked in quickly (we had asked for an early check in as had arrived form a long flight from Australia ) and they had accommodated this. The girls on the front desk asked if we wanted d them to show us around the hotel before going to our room which we did and it was very useful to see the hotel areas, which were decorated wonderfully ,in a swan Christmas theme, the whole hotel looked stunning and upon arriving in our room they opened the door and I looked straight through to this huge bathroom and massive tub, which was very inviting.  The bathroom had a separate shower area and toilet  form the bath and double basin area.  The little hallway down the corridor form the entry to the main room was also a nice extra space, The size of the room surprised us both as London rooms are not normally  this big.  .  The service during the hotel was very good particularly concierge.  Also we really enjoyed the  lounge/area that was in between the hotel and conference section, it was outside yet inside, and had lovely fireplace and heaters  (Shame that only one of the firs places was working) but also you could smoke in this area, yet it didn't reek of cigarette smoke like some smoking areas.   Breakfast was good, we ate in the restaurant  mostly but the second day they tried to insist we ate in the little bar area where the buffet was (which was not as comfortable or nice) and we insisted on using the restaurant as did others so they allowed us to (I think they just wanted to fill up the other area first  but this was not as nice to sit in as the restaurant area. All in all a very pleasant stay and a good size room, would stay here again.",4,2017,01,10
143,Wonderful ,"My husband and I have just had a one-night trip away and chose to stay at the Corinthia Hotel. 

We have had a wonderful time here. The spa really is fantastic (they did make an error and didn't have my husband's booking in the system but thankfully we're able to find him a slot an hour later). I spent several happy hours relaxing there. 

We enjoyed afternoon tea under the magnificent light in the lobby and a wonderful breakfast this morning. 

The hotel is beautiful and service is fantastic. Very difficult to fault. Grand without being stuffy. A perfect break away. ",5,2017,01,08
143,"Awful, disgusting laundry service!","Awful, disgusting laundry service! I gave a brand new dress just from the shop to be pressed, they returned it with the signs of iron and told me, that they were there!   
We didn't tell manager or someone else at the moment but now in the loundry I am told that the dress is spoiled with iron!!!",1,2016,12,15
143,Elegance - great for drinks for business or with family or friends,"Dependable meeting place.  Grand opulence, but relaxed enough that everyone is welcome, it's not too stuffy!  Three great bars to choose from.  Nice staff.  We tried the Italian equivalent of champagne delicious! ",5,2016,12,13
143,Excellent,"Booked it for the second time, despite rather substantial prices, and was not disappointed. Apparently there was some confusion over my booking, but we received a nice upgrate on an executive room. The rooms are excellent and spacious for London standards with a corridor seperating bedroom and (the beautiful) bathroom and an additional locker room. Room service came in rather late (after 5 pm), you better switch on ""make up my room"". Tea time in the impressive central hall of the hotel was truly a celebration. Breakfast is always a bit busy and staff seems rather challenged then, but all in all it was again a great experience.",5,2016,12,11
143,Lovely place,"I had a business event at this place and had a great experience. Starting from the location, staff, decor to food and other services, it was all good. A nice place, just perfect for holding an event. Location wise it 2 min from Embankment tube station which works well with guests.",4,2016,12,09
143,A truly 5 star experience ,You immediately feel welcome and relaxed with the greeting as you arrive outside this hotel and the experience continues from the reception desk and throughout the hotel. Excellent staff and great quality facilities. Really enjoyed the spa. Afternoon tea up with the best of London and breakfast as well. Two night stay but didn't get to try the restaurants. We had an executive room with a most comfortable bed  very quite and spacious .Congratulations to the management and all the staff. ,5,2016,12,07
143,Absolute let down,Oh what can I say lovely hotel ...but omg  food was absolutely terrible..i was just shocked that a hotel of this standard could serve up food of this quality ..and charge yoy so much .  I'm just lost for words. ..it was one of the worst meals iv ever had.. and also one of the most expensive. . Terrible experience.  Never again ..,1,2016,12,06
143,Everything was fantastic,"Very cute and sophisticated interiors with an excellent service and hospitality. The location is at very convenient place: subway within 3 minute walk and sightseeing places are within walking distance. We stayed in February and it was very cold outside, but there was floor heating in the bathroom and it was very warm:) ",5,2016,12,06
143,My experience with the Corinthia ,"I traveled a lot around the world .the Corinthia hotel in London among the few hotels that I couldn't find a mistake.
From the time of the check in till I check out the service and the staff are outstanding 
All the hotel staff are well trained the rooms are clean and large.
",5,2016,12,05
143,Quintessential luxury London hotel,"This hotel is pure class and sumptuous luxury. The staff are wonderful and the rooms understated beauty and luxury. It is an expensive hotel but it is one of the best. I wasn't paying as I was on a business trip organised by someone else, but I would save up to stay here. ",5,2016,12,03
143,Fabulous but a few things could make it perfect!!,"Weekend break with a friend-recommended this hotel by a friend so thought we`d spoil ourselves and give it a try!! Great location.Beautiful entrance and welcomed by staff. Room wasn`t ready so received a complimentary drink in bar whilst our room was prepared (lovely touch)but as it was going to be over an hour we decided to to return in evening. Due to an unforseen power cut in the West End that night-decided to have a bottle of prossecco and an in house movie-disappointed to find no champagne or wine glasses in room but ""Gabor"" our lovely porter obliged!! Disappointed to find that they were gone again the next day and not replaced! At bedtime we fancied a hot drink-quite astounded to find no hot chocolate -only tea or coffee - and no biscuits in room-granny smith apples only!! So healthy eating it was! Lovely pre-theatre meal in Massimo on Saturday however it was not plain sailing as on checking out our pre-theatre package for our stay for £60 was disputed by the receptionist-thank goodness I had kept the email(which the Hotel sent 3 days before confirming this)-it took almost 15 minutes, several phone calls and common sense eventually prevailed when I think a manager looked at my e-mail and stated thats what I had booked so thats what I should pay!! Very disappointing in a 5 star hotel.Keep all your e-mails potential guests!! Only other niggles were-no dressing gown in the executive room-had to phone for ones so we could visit the spa-which I must say in fantastic; also the lovely shower gel-ESPA-products we had used the previous day was not replaced which was very disappointing and meant we had to wash with shampoo!! Just little niggles which I found really annoying as in other 4/5 star hotels these are usually standard!! We will return again in the future and hopefully theses things may have been taken on board. Must say the Jazz champagne brunch with free flowing Champagne in the Northall was amazing in  in every way as were the 2 guys entertaining in Basson Bar on Saturday evening-WOW,WOW,WOW!!",5,2016,12,01
143,Fabulous venue,Having been to most major hotels in London I must admit that I had never heard of the Corinthia and had to get in a cab to attend a conference.  Since I have been a member of the Liberal Club I was surprised I didn't spot the hotel as it's across the road.  The conference was excellent and only further enhanced by the staff and the environment.  My thanks got to all and would certainly bear you in mind for my next overnight visit.,5,2016,12,01
143,Just as good!,"This was our second visit to the Corinthia.  Again, an all around outstanding hotel... The public spaces are filled with fresh flowers and the rooms and bathrooms are large and beautifully done.
The Concierge Staff is knowledgeable, pleasant and helpful. They helped us plan most of our days.  They even secured tickets for a 'sold out' show.  The Corinthia is a wonderful place to stay, but the help of the Concierge is what makes it so special.  We will make a third visit.",5,2016,11,28
143,The Best London Hotel Experience EVER,"I have stayed in many London hotels, across a range of prices and star ratings... The Corinthia is hands-down the best hotel in the city. The physical attributes of the hotel are impeccable: the public spaces are beautifully decorated, welcoming and functional; the rooms well-appointed, spacious and quiet; and the hotel perfectly situated for business and leisure travelers alike... All of this with personal service that is unmatched at even the most expensive hotels. On top of all that, the spa facilities are simply amazing. This is the place to stay in London and where I will be staying on all future visits when not staying with friends.",5,2016,11,27
143,Fantastic and futuristic ,"Came on a business trip
Excellent hotel
Private dining  experience was very good
Great room
Upgraded to  executive  room
Futuristic room
Telly in the bath
Expensive but elegant
Highly recommended
Not checked out the SPA....
",5,2016,11,25
143,Horrible Service,I have to let everyone considering this hotel know how awful my experience was.  I spent Thanksgiving week at the hotel while visiting London for pleasure. The different between a luxury hotel and a pretty building comes down to one thing... service.  The service was abysmal.  Housekeeping had to be called to service the room and it was often after 5p before anyone showed up.  No one ever answered the phone at any location or time of day.  And the worst of all is they carelessly took my daughter's special blanket with the sheets and are not able to find it.  This hotel does not deserve the rating that is has.,1,2016,11,25
143,Good,"Room is clean and spacious, bed is comfortable. What I like most here is their bathroom floor is heated. Breakfast is good. 
I arrived after 12am and left the hotel around 5am... I wish I could enjoy the hotel more. 
Service is not bad but not the best one I received either. Overall it is a good hotel. ",4,2016,11,21
143,Magnificent stay ! ,Stayed at the Corinthia Hotel for two nights. Service at the reception was warm and friendly. Our room was upgraded and we were totally delighted. Rooms are clean and spacious and luxurious. The bathroom with the tv is so cool ! The breakfast was one of the best I've had in a long time. Such a spread and it caters for almost all nationalities. I would rate this as one of the best breakfast spreads. Everyone was so accommodating. We needed to get to our taxi to the airport but the roads were blocked because of a race so the doormen walked with us and carried our luggage all the way to the taxi under the bridge. Felt like celebs ! An excellent stay and will definitely stay again ! ,5,2016,11,21
143,A mixture of feelings ,"This was a Christmas gift from a friend for work we had done together.

I've stayed in some wonderful hotels around Europe and a few in London and this was my first time at the renowned Cortinthia London.

Receptionist team where outstanding in explaining everything - a quick tour of the hotel and shown to our delightful room.

We then had the afternoon shopping and back to the hotel to prepare for dinner.

The room was incredible and watching tv in the bath whilst having champagne is a must!

Dinner was in the Massimo restaurant - overall this was outstanding.

So the niggles (and they are only niggles)

I'd sent a shirt to be pressed and had to chase for it's return.
On checkin reception asked when could housekeeping come to turn down the beds - they arrived an hour early when they caught us dressing.
I'd taken the sommeliers advice over the wine I'd had with the meal and it missed my taste requirements by a mile so a £120 bottle didn't get touched bar half a glass.
So many things are chargeable extras and the charges are incredibly high. Example 2 coffees and two mince pies £22

My nearest comparison would be the Conrad which I've used a number of times. The Corinthia is around double the cost and for me just didn't hit the target quite to the standard I was hoping for.

Would I return again - of course it's great and far better than most. Is it worth double the Conrad - sadly not on this visit.",4,2016,11,20
143,Gorgeous hotel. Loved the Location. ,"The hotel was gorgeous. The spa amazing!  The staff was spectacular. It was a perfect 30 minute walk to Harrods -(I do walk for exercise so they may tell you it's longer but it's a great walk by Buckingham Palace and great parks and sights) 
Loved it!",5,2016,11,19
143,Luxury in London,As usual it is the staff and service which really make a hotel and in this hotel the service is exceptional. Rooms are extremely comfortable and beautifully decorated. Location is great for getting around London and overall the hotel must be considered to be good value. We will be back on our next trip to London.,5,2016,11,13
143,Certainly one of the Best Hotel in London,"Great location, outstanding services and the rooms are  amazingly comfortable and set with taste.
I would highly recommend it... the only issue may be the price... quite expensive indeed. Enjoy your stay!",5,2016,11,12
143,Simply lovely,"This hotel is perfect in every way.  The staff are attentive, polite and helpful.  The word that comes to mind when in you're in your room is yummy.  The smell is welcoming, heated floors in the bathroom and mood lighting.  Loved it here and will definitely return.  ",5,2016,11,10
143,Return visit was amazing,"This is the second time this year we have visited the hotel. The first time there were a few mishaps so we were invited back to stay which was very kind. 

Upon arrival they gave us complimentary drinks while our room was being prepared and we were checked in from 10.30am which was a lovely surprise as we were just calling to leave our suitcase off before going out for the day. 

The room was beautiful and had everything you would need as well as a lovely bottle of champagne and a small birthday cake for my husband which were lovely touches! 

The spa is beautiful and worth a visit. 

I think my favourite thing about the hotel is all the beautiful flowers everywhere! 

Thank you for inviting us back and we will certainly be choosing Corinthia next time we are visiting London. ",5,2016,11,09
143,The best,"This is simply the best hotel in London, service, quality, comfort, style, surroundings and luxury.

We've been visiting now for the last 4 years and will not go anywhere else - well done team! 

Can't wait for our next visit",5,2016,11,08
143,Classy British hotel with international know how,"Corinthia has every facility you would expect for a hotel in this class but what impressed me most was the staff and attention to detail. Very helpful, very respectful and incredibly fast to respond to the guest needs",5,2016,11,02
143,Chic hotel in the city centre,"Amazing hotel with the perfect location and all that even possiblely your soul wants. When you enter you can't shake the feeling that you are unique. Lavender saches, special bath salt, fresh cookies - all for you will be prepared with love and respect in the room before night sleep. Divine experience.",5,2016,11,01
143,Nothing like it,"Visiting London had been on my bucket list for as long as I can remember, so finding the perfect hotel was very important. I had seen advertisements for the Corinthia and decided to try it. I have rarely made better choices. The hotel was everything you could want in a luxury facility. It was elegant, yet warm and inviting. The staff and service was impeccable. I stayed in the Whitehall Suite which added an additional level of charm to my stay. The hotel was the old Ministry of Defense and faces Old Scotland Yard. It was a quick walk to Trafalgar Square and the London Eye. A perfect hotel that will your stay a trip to remember.",5,2016,11,01
143,Impeccable,"An outstanding hotel located a short walk from the major downtown landmarks.  Five stars in every respect---service, accommodation, food.  Our standard room was large, plush, clean (the ONLY downside - interior rooms have little view).  Hope to return.",5,2016,11,01
143,They know the meaning of service,Even the 'basic' rooms have 2 sinks a walk in shower and a tv in the bath.  The bassoon bar is the best cocktail bar I've been to. Consider for a couples treat or a special family gathering. This is now my benchmark for all hotels,5,2016,11,01
143,"A great hotel, and a convenient location.","We stayed 4 nights and consider this to be the best hotel we have ever stayed in.  As one of my local British friends commented when we met them in the lobby ""You were in one of the top hotels which was very convenient for almost anywhere you chose to visit.""  The price is high (we paid 510 pounds per night) but the advantages of being centrally located to theaters, restaurants, and mass transit outweighed the high cost.
Considering it was in the city, it was very quiet.  The TV access had several US channels, including Fox News, and there was even a TV in the bathroom at the end of the tub, with a floating remote control!  The hotel wifi worked well.  A short walk to Trafalgar Square, and a 10-15 minute walk to the Theater district.  The only thing lacking was there was no shuttle transfer service to Heathrow airport - we made our own arrangements.  We have stayed in Westins, Fairmonts, St. Regis, and Ritz but none were better than the Corinthia.  We will stay here again.",5,2016,10,31
143,"Amazing Location, Top Notch Service","We stayed here for four nights as part of a group travelling for the NY Giants-LA Rams American Football game. Our room was outstanding: heated floor int eh bathroom, large shower with the best water pressure in a hotel ever, heated towel rack, large tub with TV, a big walk-in closet/dressing room, Nespresso machine and a very comfy bed. The location couldn't be much better - steps from 10 Downing Street, Trafalger Square, and the Embankment tube station. A few minutes walk to Big Ben & Parliament and the London Eye.  Also a close walk to the Westminster water tube dock, which we used several times. Good breakfast buffet with a lot of variety. The staff was friendly and helpful. Nice little jazz bar for late night drinks and entertainment. Would definitely stay here again if we go back to London.",5,2016,10,31
143,Excellent,My wife and I stayed at your beautiful hotel in March of 2016 and we couldn't have enjoyed it more and rebooked for May of 2017. The service and ambiance was more than we expected. Can't wait to get back in May 2017. Highly recommend.,5,2016,10,30
143,Wow,"From the moment you are greeted at the door until the moment you leave, this felt like a special place.
From the breath-taking flower arrangement in the foyer to the magnificent food.
The staff were very polite and professional.  Can't wait for my next trip to London.",5,2016,10,30
143,Haven in the Heart of the City,"My husband and I stayed at the Corinthia for 4 nights after a week of biking in Tuscany celebrating our 25th anniversary.  What a perfect pairing and the Corinthia is a first class hotel in a perfect location.  We walked 10 miles every day and couldn't wait to come back to our cozy room, overlooking the courtyard.  The bed is so comfortable and the bathroom with the heated floors was amazing.  We had the breakfast every morning which had endless choices.  Every night we had a nightcap in the Bassoon Bar with delicious cocktails and live music.  Though the hotel has lavish decorating and high ceilings, it still was able to feel cozy.  The concierge couldn't be more helpful with my daily questions.  The nightly walks across the river to the London Eye and then back again passing Big Ben and Westminster Abbey were magical.",5,2016,10,28
143,A great hotel but could be better,"I stayed four nights at the Corinthia and it was a good experience.  First, the location is outstanding: near all main attractions and the Underground (subway) is around the corner. The service is outstanding.  The Spa is exceptionnal (unbelievable would be the right word).  The rooms are pretty big (remember, it's London) but for the price I paid (650 pounds a night), they were not out of this world.  The bathroom is quite impressive with a very nice shower.  We hear a little bit the street noise but it's acceptable. The working desk is small. So the room could be a little more impressive for a five star hotel.  

If you're sensitive to odors, this hotel will perhaps bother you.  They had a strong smell all around the lobby and the halls of some kind of flowers that almost gave me a headache. But most people should not be affected by this (some even may like it). 

I don't go to London that often so it's hard to compare with other hotels.   I went to some great hotels in Germany (like the Ritz in Berlin) that - for the same price - had better rooms.  But in general, I was satisfied.",4,2016,10,26
143,Well positioned,"The location is ideal for theatre, museums, Covent Garden, River tours and very nice rooms also. The Bassoon Bar is always busy in the evenings and very difficult to get a seat if you more than a couple. Celebs always seem stay here, Pressing charges are a little pricey best to ask for an iron from housekeeping.",5,2016,10,26
143,The best hotel I have ever experienced,"Breathtakingly beautiful! The rooms are gorgeous with every amenity imaginable! Beautiful view of the courtyard. Marble bath with tv, plenty of counterspace and separate shower. Perfect location within walking distance of Trafalgar, Westminster, and Coventry Garden. ",5,2016,10,26
143,Corinthia is London's Finest Hotel,"Just spent 5 nights at the beautiful Corinthia Hotel. The staff were professional and friendly as well as very accommodating.. 
this hotel is in a quiet location without traffic noises. The restaurants and bar as well as their staffs were also top notch.",5,2016,10,26
143,Best hotel I've ever been to!,"This is my favorite hotel in the world, andI e been to many. The accommodations are elegant, immaculate, spacious, and quiet.  The delicious, healthy, high quality breakfast is superb!  And, the service is top-notch.  Very professional!  The location is also ideal for sightseeing purposes, as it is within walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, and the tube.",5,2016,10,25
143,AMAZING,"This is the best hotel in London. Service, Bar, SPA and restaurant are really top. We had a massage at the spa and it was brilliant. The receptionist gave us a very warm welcome and was very kind. Food was excellent. we will be back.",5,2016,10,25
143,Lovely hotel and amazing spa,"We stayed here for one night in an executive room on the second floor. Booked through booking.com, it's a lavish and modern hotel with kind, helpful and welcoming staff. We were given a free upgrade and a late check out which was great as we arrived very late. The room was large on facing the main road and traffic noise was minimal, although you could hear some. We were also near the lift and couldn't hear any other noises. The bathroom was enormous with great shower and mod cons, the bed very very comfortable as it is a Hypnos mattress. A couple of things that are a bit odd, no kettle for tea and no fresh milk but I could have ordered anything at any time of day to address that if I had wanted to. 
The spa is absolutely amazing, not over crowded, top quality and very relaxing, everything you should expect at 5 star prices. 
We had a couple of cocktails in the Bassoon bar, which were delicious and the service was attentive.
The breakfast in the restaurant wasn't dazzling, we had something from the ala carte menu, but it was a nice light airy atmosphere. A few things on service to be aware of, our  newspaper didn't arrive, no problem we asked for another one, water requested was forgotten and weirdly the guy on the desk thought Tate Britain was an hours walk away. Anyway very minor moans about a love luxurious stay, do not miss out on the Spa, if you do visit. The staff are all very professional and yet friendly and welcoming, which is part of this places charm.
",4,2016,10,21
143,"Excellent Hotel - Near theater, shopping and dining!",I would highly recommend the Corinthian. Old world charm with all modern appointments. Absolute 5 star. If you like people watching the bar is often home to celebrities. Near Theaters that often host European premiers and great restaurants. ,5,2016,10,19
143,Very Nice Place with Great Location ,Overall the hotel is very nice.  Rooms are comfortable and clean but small.  Location is great.  We could walk the majority of our visit.  Breakfast buffet wait staff was not the best (a little on the slow side).  Stopper in the bathtub did not work.  Still enjoyed my stay.,5,2016,10,17
143,Outstanding Hotel,"Lovely hotel, great location, easy walking to many popular sites. Stayed here for 3 nights and loved it. Beautiful modern rooms, excellent service. The spa should not be missed. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who appreciates a luxury experience.",5,2016,10,17
143,Outstanding!,"I routinely stay at this hotel and last visited in February.  This past trip we hosted an event for 160 leaders - CEOs, COOs etc from the industry we serve.  We had hosted smaller events at the Corinthia before - their third floor conference rooms are exceptional.  We also host private dinners which are amazing.  But we'd never gone all in for a full conference and from beginning to end the entire experience was outstanding.  Check in - easy.  They upgraded us to a lovely suite as hosts to the event.  Fabulous room - impeccable, roomy, immaculate.  We then hosted two full days of events including breakfasts, full sit-down dinners, and the works. They worked with us on our room allotment so we could host the right number of guests.  Everything handled at this hotel was superb.  One thing for sure - it is never easy to put out meals for 150 discerning clients at the same time  The banquet food was delicious.  Table settings beautiful. From succulent chicken to filet mignon to vegetarian or gluten free options they had it all handled.  Check out was smooth. We exhaled as we celebrated a final lunch with our team to commemorate the occasion and debrief.  We love this hotel. Whether for a couple's weekend, a business trip, hosting small meetings or large.  Bar none the best hotel in London and our London client's adored it. Not an easy feat.   We're coming back!",5,2016,10,17
143,"Amazing, fresh, clean, contemporary hotel. Great location!","I am a Virtuoso travel agent and was fortunate to stay at this property for 2 nights. The hotel offers friendly, but discrete service. Rooms are chic and luxurious. The hotel hosts it's very own special signature scent which is amazing without being over-powering. Lovely in all ways. Make sure to have a look at the special chandelier in the lobby! There is something very special and a trademark for the hotel! Would go back in a second! Thank you so much for the wonderful stay!",5,2016,10,16
143,Perfection in Whitehall,"I love London and last week while in London to meet up with friends I stayed at the Corinthian Hotel for 5 nights. The Corinthia was amazing, its a great building - beautiful rooms, lovely decor, great service, but it is the staff that made all the difference.  From the moment you walk in, you feel their attention to detail and their commitment to excellence.

The hotel is in a fantastic location, easy to access the tube at Embankment, easy to catch the boat to Greenwich, and easy to walk to Buckingham Palace, Parliament and Westminster. 

The hotel is lovely, it feels special and luxurious at all levels, but it was the staff that made our stay just marvelous. The butler service is phenomenal - especially Lucas and Eric, from unpacking our bags and giving a quick press to our dress up clothes, to responding to quick requests for tea or wine, the butlers made our stay perfect. Thomas, the reception manager oversaw all the odd details and requests we had and at every turn, we felt like valued guests.

The hotel is large and has the space to hold functions, host meetings and will accommodate a variety of tastes.  It also has a fantastic health club and spa in the basement. The pools, sauna and relaxation spaces downstairs are breathtaking. One of my colleagues had a massage and he gave it a two thumbs up.

In the evening, the bar is great fun, with intimate spaces for small groups, light foods and excellent service. Food in general at the hotel (room service, restaurants and tea/coffee service in the lobby) are all excellent.  The staff are accommodating, the service is prompt and the offerings are varied and fresh.

I did not choose the hotel, I knew nothing about it, but I will be returning soon!",5,2016,10,16
143,Excellent,"Definitely one of the best hotels in London offering a relaxed ambience in a formal environment with contemporary flair.

Excellent, quiet location 100 yards from the Thames and Embankment underground station. Easy walk to Westminster in one direction and to the theatre district in the other direction. Front and rear entrances depending on where you are headed.

Public spaces including the lobby lounge and the two restaurants are exceptional along with the spa and pool.

Wide corridors on room floors. High ceilings in bedrooms, excellent, intuitive layout, high quality and comprehensive fixtures, expansive bath tub and spacious walk-in shower.

Helpful, friendly service from start to finish. You can specify a preferred time for evening turn-down service as well as complimentary newspaper at checkin.

Outstanding breakfast buffet (or a la carte) in two room restaurant with an array of international foods, extensive cheese and cold meat selection, good juices and croissants.",5,2016,10,15
143,Flash Hotel in London,We staid 3 nights at the Corinthia Hotel. The rooms are very well equipped and luxurious. We only had dinner once at the Northhall restaurant. The food was good but expensive like most places in London. The supporting staff were helpful and nice. Some of the restaurant staff were quite snotty and pompous. We had a complimentary car to the airport and the driver was most courteous and helpful. ,4,2016,10,15
143,"Excellent hotel, very elegant. For a special occasion","Stayed here for business. Service and decoration flawless. Bassoon Bar is very welcoming and again quality of the drinks and the service was excellent. Ate in the British restaurant which had a very varied menu and lots of twists on classics with a good variety of meat and fish. All in all a hotel that you cannot complain about at all, although this is reflected in the price.",5,2016,10,14
143,Modern Elegance..,"We only stayed one night but will definitely stay here again. I believe the hotel has recently been renovated and it feels wonderful. Stunning heritage building with elegant modern flair. Everything feels solid and of very highly quality. The room we had (an executive room) was very comfortable and the bathroom was amazing! Huge stand alone bath and lovely bath products.
The spa has a great reputation but I only used the hair salon - very nice.
The staff and friendly and curious too.
We are at Massimo which was delicious Italian - beautiful decor and served by lovely smiley, friendly, helpful staff.",5,2016,10,13
143,Better than any Ritz on all levels and in the best location to boot,"I have stayed at the Ritz in Madrid and Paris, always feeling somewhat like an outsider.  However from the moment I got out of the taxi to the moment I left for home I was embraced by the staff like a most valued guest.  A doorman even offered me a bottle of water as I was returning from a full day of museum visits, looking worn and weary.  I arrived early in the morning from Paris and had been assured that I would have no problem getting into my room at that hour....what a surprise when I was not disappointed.  Reception staff is most accommodating and competent.  The rooms are beautifully appointed, thoroughly cleaned, well supplied and spacious.....I loved the television at the end of the soaking tub.  Room service gets a five star rating.  However, do not miss out on the wonderful spa experience offered....especially if you are able to book a massage with Heshmat....a super masseur who was able to cure my persistent shoulder problem...a miracle worker.  Moreover, the spa staff is super friendly, helpful and competent.  You will find the snooty staff at the Ritz.",5,2016,10,12
143,Certainly not 5* Service,"So I check in and pay £560 for a one nights stay.  After checking out I request a VAT invoice, the desk not knowing what I was talking about.  It take me then 1 month to try and get a VAT invoice which once received see that I have been overcharged.  Call the hotel directly to be hung up on.  Call again and get told that all people are busy.  I mean for a hotel of this class it is really basic to get your customer service correct.  I will not book again thats for sure.",1,2016,10,11
143,"Relaxing, comfortable stay","My partner and I booked ourselves into Corinthia because we were looking for somewhere with a wonderful spa and anything else would be a bonus. We were more than pleasantly surprised with our entire stay. From the moment we arrived until the moment we checked out, we were treated with the utmost respect and attentiveness. We arrived to the hotel at 10.30 and our room was ready and with an upgrade! We were shown around the hotel and around our room. We headed out for the day and came back at 4 to a bottle of champagne in the room. We wanted to have the champagne in the lobby lounge but it was booked due to afternoon tea. We then asked if we could have the champagne in the spa and of course that was no problem. Someone came up and took our chilled champagne and glasses to the spa lounge and we followed. We then went to the thermal floor/pool area and enjoyed an hour spoiling ourselves in the amazing jacuzzi, sauna and pool. The Corinthia has the best jacuzzi we have ever experienced! We didn't want to leave but had tickets to a show so reluctantly headed back to our room. We ordered room service for an early dinner and the food was the only slight disappointment we had. However, the man who brought our food laid it all out beautifully on the table. We came back to the hotel about 11pm that night and went to the Bassoon Lounge. It was full and they told us to come back in 20 minutes. However, we told them we were staying at the hotel and couldn't come back every 20 minutes to inquire if a table was available and they were able to squeeze us in. We enjoyed wonderful cocktails and very enjoyable music. The next morning we enjoyed the buffet breakfast in The Northall and then went to the spa for our 60 minutes massages. And the massages were some of the best we have ever had. The masseuses were thorough and very good at what they were doing. We then went back to the jacuzzi for another hour before we had to check out. This was an amazing stay and we left feeling relaxed and de-stressed. Well worth the money. Oh and the bedding was ridiculously comfortable making for a wonderful night's sleep.",5,2016,10,10
143,The Worst 5* Hotel In London,"On arrival at reception, we were told our room was not ready, but were asked for our mobile number so that they could call us as soon as it was ready. Some 1 hr 30mins later (which took us to 4.30pm) I returned to reception, to complain we hadn't had a call from them.  They apologised and upgraded our room, which was a positive 'thank you'.  No complaints with the room.  The staff however in this hotel are amongst the most unhelpful, unfriendly staff I have ever encountered and all of them look like they are truly unhappy.  Male colleague told me mens toilets in foyer were dirty.....not what you expect from a 5* hotel.  Had dinner in hotels Italian restaurant - beautiful decor but appalling service, at one point was asked what wine we would like and the waiter never returned with our drinks order!!!! Difficult to get waiters attention, as appeared short staffed - so ended up with water only, during our meal. No complaints with breakfast, but again unhappy and unfriendly staff.  Unable to get a invoice for the room on check out as told we had booked vie a booking agency and would have to get invoice from them.  Never has this happened to me before and I've stayed at most 5* hotels in London, and always booked through booking.com, so know this to be untrue - but they would not budge!!!  I would never return back to this hotel and neither would my work colleague.  A most disappointing experience",2,2016,10,09
143,Sunday brunch ,"Visited the Northall restaurant today for Sunday brunch and great live music. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a relaxing lunch, great food and excellent service. We are all looking to return when possible.",5,2016,10,09
143,Afternoon Tea,"Wanted to have afternoon tea here for a while so after booking it in advance we went and had a great time.

We sat down on the front table facing the main entrance stairs, which was unusual at first as we were in plane view of everyone coming in but in a funny way it made us the feel like we were on show for the whole restaurant and that's never a problem!! 

Service was extremely friendly and food was excellent. If you weren't keen on a particular sandwich then you could change it easily and without fuss. Cakes were to die for so all in all our two hour slot was well used! Would I do it again, for sure we would!! ",5,2016,10,09
143,Excellent evening,"Had an amazing dinner last night at the northall. The selection on the menu was great and our waiter ma'tè was really professional and knowledgeable about the wine list and menu, helping choose the right wines with our menu choices. We will be back",5,2016,10,08
143,a true five star hotel,"The Corinthia is a hotel that I expect when I read that a hotel is five stars. The rooms are spacious, the bed was as comfortable as home. The bathroom was large with two sinks and a great shower as well as a separate bath and soft fluffy towels. Of course everything was very clean. The service and the concierge were accessible and always helpful. The location in Westminster was ideal for touring, shopping and of course to the Underground. The only negative was the price of the food in the restaurants. A tiny caesar salad that was nothing special for 22 pounds is not memorable. Regardless, I would be delighted to stay there again.",5,2016,10,06
143,Defines 5 star,"Was it the overall atmosphere, showing us to the lifts, the anniversary cake and card, the FANTASTIC spa facilities, the aroma and displays of fresh flowers around reception, the location....it's hard to say which stands out the most but our weekend away was absolutely amazing.",5,2016,10,04
143,Beautiful Hotel in an ideal location,"I was here for business.  The rooms were very well appointed, linens were top notch and lots of room in my room.  I had a room that looked into the courtyard and it was always quiet.  It is located a short walk to a few major tube stations including Waterloo where you can get the trains.  It is a short walk to all the sites.   

With a wake up call, they off you complimentary coffee of your choice delivered to your door.  A very nice touch",5,2016,10,03
143,Vacation in London,"Fantastic room, better service! Jacob took fantastic care of you! I had no idea what drink to order, so he brought me the Mediterranean Toddy, a warming blend of Bacardi 8 Rum, Chamomile, Honey and Lemon Juice topped with hot water! Perfect for an Autumn chill! Ask Jacob his drink recommendation and he will bring precisely the right drink!! ",5,2016,10,03
143,Luxury and unpretentious ,"Stayed here because there are few places in London proper to enjoy a cigar. The Lobby Lounge is the best in London for both, a cigar and a dram. Dual fireplaces and well protected from the elements. A walk-in humidor with an excellent offering of Havanas, kept in proper condition. Manager Jacob is the quintessential host and will address your every need be it simple or extravagant. Looking forward to coming back. ",5,2016,10,03
143,Amazing ,"This is one of the best hotels in London, location ambiance, staff everything is first class if you are a smoker there is a bueatifull garden lounge there are 2 amazing restaurants a lobby lounge for relaxing under a suberb chandelier and rooms are to a very high standard. Looking forward to returning ",5,2016,10,03
143,"Superlative, superlative, superlative.....","Wow! Incredibly beautiful hotel! Rooms, common areas, spa, restaurants, friendly service, and location were all memorable. Seriously, the interior designers and architects deserve awards.
The day before arrival, I called the hotel to tell them that my long haul flight had been cancelled and that I was not going to be able to arrive until the next morning. I hoped to be able to get some kind of comp, but they wouldn't budge. Initially, I was unhappy. However, we arrived at 7 AM and went straight to bed.  Waking up at noon, I instantly felt my money was well spent. The room had been perfectly quiet and I felt well-rested.
I don't think my room had a view, but it doesn't matter. It was so quiet and the bed was so comfortable that it all worked out. The chocolate cake they left in our room to commemorate a special occasion might have been the best I have ever eaten.  There was also fresh fruit in the room. 
I took lots of pictures of the interior finishes, but pictures and the  hotel website do not do it justice.
We dined in the Italian restaurant and it was excellent and beautiful.
The spa was beautiful, co-ed, clean, and well-managed. 
I don't  remember the cost of this hotel, the restaurants, and spa. I know it was predictably expensive. But, I will stay here every return visit to London. I can't imagine a nicer London hotel.",5,2016,09,30
143,Outstandingly Magnificent,"All of the staff from the very minute we arrived were extremely helpful, attentive and friendly. The rooms were beautiful and very spacious. Bath tube with waterproof screen was a lovely touch. 
Breakfast was an amazing delight with a lovely varied choice each morning.
The Spa and gym are excellent definitely find time during your stay for a visit. A member of staff was available to advise and assist on any of the equipment. A beautiful warm pool, big enough for a lovely swim, a very large jacuzzi style pool with beds to relax on, sauna, steam room and all surrounded by walls of flames and granite!.
The Corinthia Hotel has now become our most favourite London Hotel we cannot rate our stay to highly
There is not a better Hotel in London",5,2016,09,30
143,Afternoon tea,"Me and my wife had afternoon tea in the hotel on a Saturday afternoon.  I have to say the service and quality of food was excellent, and the venue itself is very impressive.  Would Definitely recommend.",5,2016,09,26
143,Second time ,We stayed here in 2012. When business called for London we chose here without hesitation. As we remembered the service was top notch. From check in to room cleaning everything was seamless. The room (244) was lively but shows a few signs of age. The carpet had a few stains but......nothing awful. The only real negative was the strange perfume throughout the hotel. It was the strongest aroma in the halls and especially the lobby. This was new....and most unusual. ,4,2016,09,26
143,Excellent vegan afternoon tea,"This hotel provided an excellent afternoon tea for our party of vegans and vegetarians. The food was beautiful, the surroundings were lovely and the staff were delightful. My son who is a very fussy eater brought along his own vegan cheese which the chef was happy to put into the sandwiches for him.",5,2016,09,25
143,Luxury with an extra slice of specialness....,"This was a trip for business and being in the heart of Whitehall was important, but the luxury that greeted me was something else. It goes without saying that at such a hotel you know the doorman will be courteous, and he was.....very. The young lady who dealt with my check-in was polite and efficient so I wasn't kept waiting at all. She and a colleague then escorted me to my room on the 5th floor to give me an 'in person' run down of facilities. Excellent. 
The decor is splendid, grand and of highest quality. The facilities are what you have, or would want to have in your own home and the service is exceptional. 
I could not fault this, with one exception; having enjoyed a few drinks in the Northall bar, this was closed even to residents and we were ushered to another, louder bar where we could only avail ourselves or the very slow and inaccurate table service. A small point, and the only one to tarnish what was otherwise fabulous.",5,2016,09,24
143,Pleasant stay with a couple of small disappointments ,"We stayed with our children for a few days (aged 3 & 7) at the start of September and very much enjoyed it. We had a room on the fourth floor which didn't have a particularly nice view (a corner into a wall with a disused room opposite) but this didn't spoil our experience much at all.

Our room was ready on arrival and the hotel staff were friendly and efficient with one of the front desk staff offering to show us round as it was our first stay.

Room was very spacious and well appointed, with a lovely bathroom with tv and two separate showers which I gladly welcomed because I don't like raindrop showers and a nice little dressing room which was immensely useful for space saving, having two younger children with us. 

They also loved every part of our stay as they were given lovely turn-down treats and made to feel welcome in every area of the hotel. One small dislike was one breakfast we were shoved as far away from any other diners presumably because we had children, but I understand most aren't as well behaved or quiet at a table as ours! Still, it felt a bit isolating.

The food and drinks were all beautifully prepared and the hotel felt quite quiet and undercrowded which was much better than  a chaotic scene we have been met with in other London hotels.

There were a couple of small things with housekeeping that were a little short of a 5 star hotel but very minor things. The pull out drinks table had not been wiped before we checked in and had water marks from previous guests in the cup holders. There was no bin except a wine cooler sized one in the bathroom which we struggled to put nappies and wrappers in from the turn down gifts and so forth. One day there was no room so I had to leave a wrapped up nappy on the shelf under the sink in the bathroom and by the evening when we had been out all day and for dinner, it had nt been removed.

The concierge didn't prove very useful when we asked for help either. We asked for some child friendly restaurants nearby and were sent to one that didn't even have a child's menu and a celebrity restaurant! None very good for children or particularly good value, so we left one recommended place our kids having had a boring bowl of tomato pasta and our tummies half empty.

Another small gripe was at breakfast we were never informed we could have anything (such as eggs on toast) cooked to order, until I enquired! My husband missed his toast at breakfast and his cooked English most days because of this, however the choice was not limited on the buffet counters!

Overall however, it was very much a premium hotel with friendly staff that were engaging and down to earth. Just at night time there was a shortage of nearby restaurants apart from in the hotel, which meant normally a tube ride or walk into such as Covent Garden, which is fine but with children can be hit and miss!

It's a hotel in a great tourist spot near Whitehall gardens, Trafalgar Sq. and Big Ben but next time we will return to London in a different area.

You will most likely not be disappointed with your stay! Thanks to all staff.",4,2016,09,24
143,Magical,"My favourite hotel in the UK!

Utterly magical and perfect in every way. 

Every member of staff make your stay enjoyable and 5 star. 

The price truly reflects the luxury and attention you get while staying there - worth every single penny.",5,2016,09,20
143,5 star venue with surprisingly lacking service 17th September 2016,"My wife and I have stayed at several luxury hotels in London for special occasions but she had always wanted to stay at the Corinthia.  As a treat I booked for us and our friends to stay in 4 rooms for a group celebration for her 40th birthday.  When we arrived my first surprise compared with other high end hotels that I have stayed in was that our bags were not taken from us at the door and our names taken, rather we took them with us to reception to check in.  We arrived at 11:30 am which of course was too early for rooms to be available (as we expected) but the front desk took our bags and we were told they would be waiting for us in our room when we returned later which was good.  This pre check in was functional and procedural but lacked customer engagement and rapport compared with other similar hotels.  I felt even at this stage of the day that front desk were stressed.

We went off to explore London and whilst I was out Front Desk called me to ask did all of our rooms need to be on the same floor.  I replied that they did not need to be, and that we would not be back at the hotel until 3pm so no rush.  I was told that the rooms would be definitely be ready for us at that time and to come by and pick up our keys.

A couple in our group arrived separately at the hotel at 2:30pm and the were given a room that someone was already occupying.  When they came back down and were allocated a new room they found they had been given an accessible room which was not suitable for bathing etc.  The 3rd room they were given had no cups provided but the room it self was at last good.

On our return after 3pm I went to get my key for my Wife and I.  I was asked 3 times if I had definitely checked in already in the morning as I wasn't showing on the system. By now 2 people were querying the system whilst my friend's room keys were already ready prepared for them with no fuss. I was then asked my first name and with no comment acknowledgement was handed a key that she had made up there and then with a very cold attitude.  No eye contact or well wishing words.  When we got to the room our bags were not there leading us to deduce that our room had been missed off the prepared group of keys.  My wife called down and asked for our bags and eventually after 25 minutes she went in person to reception to demand her cases be brought up.  She was told the the hotel was very busy and Concierge had a bag backlog but that our cases would be prioritised.  The bags then arrived 10 minutes later.  These are small things that in the Hilton or Marriott I would not even mention in a review, but at this price point and class of hotel I found these behaviours and excuses out of place.  At other hotels of this class I'm impressed when front desk staff who checked you in the morning, recognise you and address you by name or wish your wife happy birthday.  I was pretty upset and stressed by this point that this expensive treat was being tarnished in the eyes of my wife and my friends who had 3 tries at getting a room allocated. 

When we arrived at our room it was beautifully decorated and was apparently an upgraded room.  We only found out this point out after we visited our friends rooms by comparison.  Surely when we picked our Key up front desk would have been pleased to tell us we had been upgraded for my wife's birthday to highlight this kindness so we knew.  

We had evening cocktails in Bassoon Bar.  The service in here was friendly, attentive and prompt and we thoroughly enjoyed our drink in here.  All of the staff in this bar deserve recognition as they delivered and exceeded on the their service. The cocktails were beautifully presented and well executed and the host was warm and friendly.

I went for a run in the morning and when I returned the door staff recognised me and offered to get me some water which was a lovely touch and one that deserves recognition of their attention.

We had breakfast in the hotel restaurant.  All of the staff here seemed unhappy and didn't want to be there.  One of our party asked if she could have 2 fried eggs as she didn't want the scrambled eggs on the buffet line.  She was told that she would be charged additionally for these so she declined.  This was a very expensive breakfast if it had been at walk in rates to find it was buffet.  Perhaps there were other options available (al a carte), but our waiter just directed us to the buffet.

When I checked out I was just told I had nothing to pay and my account was settled. I wasn't asked if I had had a nice stay, wished a safe journey or asked if I needed help with my bags or help arranging onward transport as would be customary.  At check out my friend was presented his receipt on headed paper in an envelope, I received no receipt.  As I say at a holiday inn this kind of service is functional and expected and maybe this is where the Corinthia place themselves?

In summary I was very disappointed with our stay at the Corinthia and very sad that this big event had been a let down on my Wife's birthday.  As stay at a nice hotel is about the experience but this hotel appears to be all about the building and the rooms and not service that delights.

143,Relaxing city break ,"I spent one night in the hotel. Rooms are  spacious and they have excellent amenities. I love Espa products in the bathroom, sachet of salt scrub was amazing. Bathtube with waterproof screen is nice touch, I have watched movie while enjoying my bath. Thermal floor and Spa is the best I have seen. Spacious sauna, steam room, nice pool and jacuzzi. I fell asleep on the loungers near the pool, so cosy. Breakfast in the room exceeded my expectations, tasty eggs royale, pastries, toasts and more. I do recommend Corinthia London. ",5,2016,09,19
143,A touch of decadence!,"When you arrive outside the hotel, there isn't the ostentatious exterior that you find with some of the better known hotels but as you walk in, the smell of fresh flowers and spectacular lobby is really quite breathtaking! 

Of course, the staff are very helpful and friendly, check in was easy, but I was completely surprised by our room! It was very spacious (unusual in London), a very large comfortable bed, sofa  beautiful bathroom/shower room. There was a coffee making machine but no kettle but they were quick to bring one when I asked, and also they supplied an iron and ironing board.

A small criticism was a tiny fitted wardrobe and very few drawers. The mini bar was well stocked but predictably very expensive! 

The absolute pièce de résistance is the Spa and gym! Make time for a visit. Probably one of the best equipped gyms I've seen in any hotel! A member of staff was available to advise and assist on any of the equipment. The thermal spa area was just spectacular. A beautiful warm pool, not Olympic size but big enough to swim, a very large jacuzzi style pool with beds to relax on, sauna, steam room and all surrounded by walls of flames and granite! 

There are many treatment rooms but I didn't indulge as treatments were quite expensive! 

We ate in Massimo's and the food was very good and pretty! The bars were busy and buzzy, live music in one of them!

I would definitely like a revisit one day! One of the finest I've stayed in in London. ",5,2016,09,18
143,Beautiful Hotel,"This is a great property, brilliantly designed in every way. We only ate breakfast at the hotel, which was as good as it gets, whether from the buffet or al la carte....service was spot on.
We stayed in two rooms a 29 and a 35. The 35 is a great corner room with a huge walk in wardrobe, very light, highly recommended.
Both bars are great. The light and airy main bar for early evening drinks and the clubby , darker bar for a late nightcap.
Sensational if rather pricey spa.
Two elements stopped a 5* rating. 
During our one week stay there were a number of minor miscommunication's between departments, suggesting that area needs a bit of work.
Whilst the location is very convenient for transport, IMO the quality of the area does not match that of the hotel. If this hotel was in Mayfair, Chelsea, or Knightsbridge, it would be very hard to beat, but then I guess it wouldn't be £500 a night.",4,2016,09,17
143,Great hotel great location ,"Booked 3 nights as part of our trip and was looking for a quality hotel in a great location. Corinthia covers this and more.

Location is perfect just a short walk from Trafalgar Square and other top locations with tube stations nearby.

The rooms are spacious (for London) and offered all the mod cons and more. We had an excitative room with a large bathroom.

Breakfast is worth the money with a large selection of choice and friendly service.

The lounge area is a great meeting place and drinks area serviced by a friendly and efficient team and hosted by the quirky Jacob.

Negatives. Couple of requests for room service were slow to respond and a request for ice not delivered but overall really good service.

Make sure you use the concierge who booked great restaurants and were very helpful.

Centre of London so not low price but worth the money if you only have a few days in London ",5,2016,09,17
143,Perfect Afternoon Tea!,"After reading some reviews on tripadvisor about the afternoon tea service at Corinthia I was excited to give it a try with some friends back in July. I was really impressed with the quality of the food and level of service. The sandwiches had creative fillings, the scones & sweet treats were delightful. I would definitely come back again.",5,2016,09,16
143,Great Stay!,"This was my first trip to London, so I wanted a very special experience. The Corinthia was perfect from start to finish. The lobby even smells wonderful and there were beautiful pink hydrangeas all over the lobby. Check in was smooth and was even escorted to our room. Location was perfect for us to get around the major sights. Taxis ready to take you anywhere right outside and the Embankment station just across the street for the Underground. Room was comfortable size. Nespresso in the room was a life saver, and the room was nice and cold in some unseasonable warm but beautiful weather. Turn down service includes lavender sachets on the pillow :) We needed a taxi one evening to take us to the Ritz for tea, and there weren't any readily available, so the door man told us the hotel Jaguar would take us free of charge! Arrived in style! I would definitely go back next time I'm in London, which I hope is soon!",5,2016,09,14
143,Best hotel in London,"I stayed at this hotel for a friends birthday, and after calling ahead to ask for a birthday message to be put in our room we arrived to find that we'd been given an upgrade which was a nice surprise!! All the small touches were what made the experience so great, every detail had been thought of. The rooms are beautiful and the room service menu was extensive and the chef was happy to accommodate our off menu requests. Highly recommend ",5,2016,09,14
143,Beautiful hotel spoiled a little by dinner options,"The hotel is spectacular in most ways. It is beautifully decorated and fresh flower displays are everywhere. In fact in the mornings the staff are seen cutting the flowers and there are lots of them! We liked seeing that.

The hotel has a nice light and airy feel about it.

The room was spacious for London and it overlooked a little courtyard which was nice.
Breakfast was very good. Lots of choice and the staff were attentive. 

Dinner was not so good - the options were more limited than we expected and although we have dietary issues (allergies), there was not a lot we could eat.",4,2016,09,14
143,Fabulous Stay,"We spent 8 nights at the Corinthia as part of our vacation in the UK in early August. We loved every aspect of our stay. We booked the room directly on the Corinthia website, which offers a room upgrade if available, which we did receive upon check in to a Deluxe King. Fabulous room, very spacious, with an entry, walk in closet, spacious bedroom and gorgeous bathroom. Everything in the room was in pristine condition and daily turndown with chocolate and service was superb. The hotel itself is gorgeous, in complete agreement with other reviewers comments on the spectacular floral arrangements, chandeliers and public spaces. Service was top notch and we were treated very respectfully. We had booked a rate with breakfast daily and it was a choice of either a fantastic buffet or a la carted off the menu, both excellent. We did have dinner one night at Massimo, which was just good, not superb. Tea in the lobby and on the patio were both lovely. We Thought the location was perfect, walking distance to so many of the places we planned to visit and a stone's throw from the tube and Embankment Pier. All in all, very pleased with our decision to stay at Corinthia and would love to do so again. Highly recommended.",5,2016,09,14
143,Superb venue in Whitehall,"This is the perfect venue for a business dinner in Whitehall and ideal for meeting clients. Situated near Waterloo is ideal for train and tube connections and perfect for early evening business dinners.

The venue has numerous bars and areas to socialise and the food is great. The staff are very friendly and very engaging. The venue is nicely refurbed and extremely clean.

Excellent all round.

",5,2016,09,14
143,Third Visit to the Corinthia,"This was my third visit to the Corinthia with my family. Amazing as usual. 
Swift check-in by courteous and friendly reception staff. We had two interconnected rooms. Sweets and juice left for the children is a nice touch. 
Lovely marble bathroom with plenty of Espa amenities. Shower is on the small side, but an enormous bath tub makes up for that. 
Food is excellent and the breakfast is varied and plentiful. 
A wonderful Spa with a swimming pool, gym and treatment rooms. There is also a hair salon. 
In short, fantastic hotel, professional staff, great location.  I love staying here. ",5,2016,09,13
143,Superlative,"where can I start...I always like to keep things short and sweet but it may not be as easy this time around! I'll start with some quick points,  service 5 star , hospitality 5 star , cleanliness 5 star , staff 5 star , location 5 star, spa 5 star, décor 5 star, room 5 star! you kind of get the gist. I'm 28 young slick and stylish and I like treating my lady to the finer things in life and the Corinthia certainly ticked all the right boxes on this occasion. At the time of booking I mentioned it was my birthday as well as my anniversary in the hope that they might do something a little special...and that they did! we got upgraded to the river suite which is over £3000 a night , a butler , bottle of Lp champagne , birthday cake, birthday card and they didn't forget the anniversary card either ! they looked after us and put a real show on for me and my girl which scored me some much needed brownie points with old lady Penelope! I'm basing this review on a special treat, the wow factor, a kind of pull out all the stops to impress effect and on that basis it has to be a 10/10. The Corinthia allowed us to live and feel like the rich and famous for a night !! what a lovely gift to give, fantastic Hotel .",5,2016,09,13
143,Afternoon tea,"The food is excellent I have tried other places but this place is outstanding. It is nice and peaceful and I loved it there and the ambiance and the look is something to look forward to, please try it and you will agree with me",5,2016,09,13
143,Gorgeous hotel,"Beautiful big rooms and luxury bathrooms. The flowers on the table as you enter the hotel foyer are stunning!  The staff is friendly and the concierge was very helpful and happy to offer assistance with information and buying tickets for tours around London. 
One negative is the Italian restaurant in the hotel wasn't very good. Food was just okay and the service was terrible. On a postive note, as with the rest of the hotel the restaurant was gorgeous.",5,2016,09,12
143,Spa to die for ,We stayed at this hotel mainly for the spa. It is by far one of the best in the world. Yes the world. Sleep pods and pure luxury. The rooms overlooking the river are good and it is well located for tourists.,5,2016,09,11
143,Leisure ,"Excellent place .Book a table on line 3 courses plus a glass of champagne for £18.95 .A good selection of choice although they had run out of sea bass 
Food was nicely presented and delicious.
Far superior to Langans months previous .Thoroughly recommended ",5,2016,09,08
143,Very quiet with an amazing spa,"Hard to review this one. The location is somewhat odd. You are very close to Trafalgar Square (less than 5-mins walk) but it feels miles away, almost like you aren't actually in London. One of the quietest hotel rooms I've ever stayed in (Room 210) and a great bed to boot. Nice and clean and (for any Americans reading) a shower (in Britain) that actually works properly. Only bad thing about the room was the movie selection - rather weak and somewhat expensive. 

Hotel itself is great. Lovely breakfast area (truly great coffee and scrambled eggs and smoked salmon on toasted brioche was awesome!). There also the restaurant and an 'outside in' lounge (it's outside but feels like it's inside) where you can smoke in all weathers. Also has a good selection of cigars.

The spa...probably the best in London. It looks a bit like Dr Evil's liar - all black marble - but it truly has to be seen. Stainless steel swimming pool and huge sauna, steam room and every treatment you can imagine. Could easily spend a day down there. BTW, kids under 16 are allowed in the spa/pool 10-11.30 and 3-4.30, which is a nice touch. One thing I would change: please no Ibiza style chill music in the sauna!

Staff are excellent too.",5,2016,09,08
143,Lunch,"Great Champagne Sunday Lunch. 
They really do keep the champagne flowing, you don't have to ask to be topped up. 
Delicous food and great service. Good value for money. 
I can Highly recommend to any one wanting to have a relaxing Sunday lunch",5,2016,09,07
143,Wedding anniversary stay,"Fabulously located luxury hotel, perfect for a 3 night London stay. Attentive staff, but not at all stuffy. The concierge in particular was fantastic- arranging restaurant bookings at late notice, and advising  on best travel arrangements. 
It's an easy walk to most locations, or close to Embankment tube station, which we used a lot with our visitor Oyster card. (We found the taxis very slow and expensive - hampered as they were by London traffic) The room is very spacious and the beds so comfortable I wanted to sleep late every day. The spa facilities were very relaxing- with a pool, thermal spa pool and steam and sauna facilities. Fairly busy on the weekend, but really a great treat after a busy day sightseeing. Would love to come back and stay again on our next visit to London. ",5,2016,09,06
143,Pre Dinner Drinks,"We visit here on a regular basis, usually just for a few drinks in the wonder fun bar, the staff are always friendly and attentive and the drinks well presented. It is the perfect place for a quiet pre dinner drink.",5,2016,09,05
143,A terrific place to stay in London,"We used to stay at a different hotel in London but decided to try The Corinthia this summer.  It far exceeded our expectations.  Our room was spacious and very well appointed.  We found the service to be superior.  Everyone was most pleasant and helpful.  The location is excellent.  London is walkable and The Corinthia is wonderfully located near theatres, the National Gallery, and the Embankment tube station.  The two restaurants in hotel are excellent as well.  When we return to London next summer we will happily stay at The Corinthia again.",5,2016,09,04
143,SPA and swimming pool,"We've been staying at this hotel for a few days, and faced the very strange and uncomfortable rules. You can use the swimming pool with your children, under 16,only during special hours!!! In the morning from 10:00 to 11:30 and afternoon front, from 15:00 to 16:30.
This was a very unpleasant surprise for us, nobody have told us before about this strange rules. I think that the hotel administration should warn customers with kids before booking the hotel!
It's very unpleasant to know that you can't have a rest with your family at the swimming pool after a long day of excursions in London.",1,2016,09,04
143,Classy place,"Lovely hotel with great amenities. The place oozes class. The rooms are very large and comfortable. Try the afternoon tea in the lobby, it's well worth the (exorbitant) price. Location is quite convenient, especially for sightseeing.",5,2016,09,04
143,Stylish surroundings and attentive staff,Have just enjoyed cocktails in the Bassoon bar followed by a meal in the Italian restaurant. Delicious meal cooked for our group of 7 people with not one of us disappointed. I had rabbit main course and the strawberry dessert and it was all delicious. Would highly recommend!,5,2016,09,03
143,Luxurious Hotel in a Great location,"We needed a hotel for 3 days before leaving on a cruise. Our friend, a flight attendant, recommended this one. I owe her a bottle of wine. This hotel is one of the finest I have ever stayed at, including Ritz, Mandarin, etc. This is not a boutique hotel but rather a full service hotel with two gourmet restaurants that offer pre-theater dinners. The staff are friendly, professional and welcoming. The concierges spend time making sure you understand directions and are very helpful. There seemed to be 3 available all the time. The rooms have fast internet, unbelievably comfortable beds, and are extremely quiet. The shower heads generate a strong flow which I need to unwind. The location is superb, just off Trafalgar Square. They have a gorgeous lobby area where you can get high tea service, cocktails, and small bites to eat. Now let me tell you about the Spa. But you see, I can't. It is so unique and overwhelming that it has to be experienced. Let me just say the Jacuzzi has places to sit where a deluge of water topples over your back while jets hit your arms and legs. It is operated by a luxury spa brand called Espa and it is their flagship location. This was one outstanding hotel visit that was a relaxing, luxurious prelude for my three week cruise.",5,2016,09,02
143,Elegant hotel with excellent service,"Stayed at The Corinthia for a long week-end. Location can not be better - very central and you can walk everywhere (5min walk from Covent Garden, 10 from soho). The rooms are lovely and well decorated. Every single detail counts. Service is very discreet and attentive. Two highlights: the breakfast and the spa (ESPA life). You absolutely need to take the time to spend in their spa - probably best designed spa in  the UK. ",5,2016,09,02
143,Birthday celebration,"I brought my sister to London for a Downton Abbey birthday celebration. We decided to stay at the Corinthia because I received a nice deal through American Express. (I wanted to stay at the Haymarket, but no deal available.) The hotel is truly lovely. The lobby is beautiful...filled with gorgeous flowers and the staff is very attentive and nice.  Our stay included breakfast and every morning it was a delicious treat. The hotel is close to everything...an easy walk to the London Eye, to Piccadilly Circus, to Trafalgar Square to Covent Garden.  I highly recommend the Corinthia and will plan to stay there again when I return to London. (I also love the Haymarket, so if there are good deals there, I would stay there again too!)",5,2016,09,01
143,If little things matter the most..,"Then here is where u want to be.. First thing is the showers are fantastic, great water pressure, easy to use, a no brainier.. Second the beds and the bedding are 6 star comfortable, never stiff always perfectly soft.. Third, the staff on every level are so helpful, from the front desk the concierge, special service to the people who work in the lounge, room service and housekeeping.. Oh one last thing there Cuban cigar selection is superb, you can't go wrong ..
So u want to know what's not good in the hotel, the spa manicure and pedicure are very expensive .. Hope u have a good understanding from my words... All the best .. Enjoy... E",5,2016,08,31
143,London's best hotel,"The Corinthia is simply one the most beautiful properties in Europe.
I enjoyed every minute of my stay. Rooms are beautiful  with large bathroom, walk in closet, and  large windows which could be opened to the court yard.
Every morning, on the way to breakfasts we had go through the flower shop. Twist my arm!! I wished I could do that every day.
Service was always impeccable. We had snacks at the Bar with drinks as well as afternoon tea. Food was always delicious.
The only thing which could be improved at the hotel is that credit cards are charged automatically for convenience. This should be addressed at check in. Maybe guests may wish to use a different card.
Otherwise, it is a very special hotel.",5,2016,08,30
143,Great hotel and outstanding service!,"I love visiting the Corinthia, its one of my favourite hotels in London - I love the deco, atmosphere and the hotel location as well. Service is simply outstanding. I visited last Tuesday and had some drinks with my family at the lobby. We arrived with a 3 year old kid and Belen from your F&B team, not only delivered but definitely exceeded our expectations. She was so professional, kind, helpful, polite...definitely the 5 star service that you would expect and more! Congratulations on such an amazing team member.  It was the first time for my family and they cant wait to go back again, thank you for the wonderful overall experience :)",5,2016,08,30
143,Currently my favourite hotel in London,"What a treat! We loved our superior king room, complete with everything you could possibly need for a stay here, such luxury. Excellent service, from reception to housekeeping, turn-down service, restaurants and in the spa. We started with wonderful cocktails and food in The Northall, breakfast each day was excellent and we really enjoyed our stay. The spa is really good, we didn't have any treatments but judging by the attendance they are very popular, we relaxed in the thermal floor and found it to be one of the best hotel spas we have been in. And with check-out not being till 12 noon, I could spend another morning in the pools and thermal rooms until I had to drag myself away and make my way home. We will definitely be back, looking forward to it already.",5,2016,08,30
143,One of the best hotels in Europe,"The refurb on this building is simply stunning.  I went into this building just before work began to turn it into a hotel and the transformation is incredible.  

The restaurants and bars are simply amazing. The food and drinks are lovely - maybe its the atmosphere this place has but i love coming to London and staying here.

Our room was just fantastic the beds are comfortable and there is plenty of storage for clothes. We had a suite and it was great to be able have the sitting room complete with champagne.  The bathrooms are large and nicely furnished.  Showers are great, the baths are deep and water is hot.

I have now stayed here 5 times and never fail to be impressed with the decor, service and understated elegance of the place.

Great location if you are going out to a show",5,2016,08,28
143,Wonderful Hotel ,"The Corinthia hotel has to be one of the most stunning hotels I have ever stayed in The front of house staff  are extremely helpful , as soon you walk in the hotel it has this amazing smell .Our room was Beautiful and extremely clean 
The spa is just out of this world 
The cocktails are brilliant 
There was live entertainment in the evening a lovely girl with just a amazing voice and a guy playing a guitar it was a wonderful way to end our evening  ....
All the staff are extremely friendly and helpful and may I say all very cute .......
The only bad thing I can say about The Corinthia is that we could only stay the one night . But we will definitely be back to stay again as the location is so central 
Thank you all so very much from the bottom of our hearts See you all very soon Love Roy & Chris xxx",5,2016,08,28
143,Above excellent,From the moment we arrived the Dorman open the door helped us   with the luggage everybody on the check-in desk was really helpful and friendly the man that showed  us  to the room and explained everything in the room had lunch everybody was very friendly service was impeccable we did not eat there in the evening as we had a dinner cruise booked but went to the American bar to watch the young lady singing I could've sat there all evening we had martini cocktail with champagne shot excellent we will definitely be back Chris and Roy xx,5,2016,08,28
143,LOVELY getaway,"We stopped by London after our Paris trip.  We didn't think we were going to find a hotel that would even be acceptable after the George V but we were delightfully surprised.

The property was lovely and the staff was super. We were pretty tired by the time we got to the hotel but the staff made sure we were able to get settled and relaxed in no time.

Thanks so much to the Corinthia.",5,2016,08,26
143,Always my favorite place to stay in Europe-not just London,"This would be my 6th year in a row staying with the Corinthia. 
Before arriving, I am always in touch with the concierge & with the spa. Both responsive and helpful. Check in is always a breeze with effortlessly friendly staff. This time I arrived and upon showing me to my room, we noticed an odor that was not pleasant. Immediately they did not hesitate to bring me to the lobby, serve me with drinks and snacks while they secured another room for me. 
Its not the mistakes that happen, because they always will where ever you go, its how they are handled. I was taken to the new room & of course splendid. As far as I know, all of their rooms have rainfall showers, bidets, nespresso machines with fresh pods daily, are exceptionally clean (I don't walk on hotel floors without slippers as they are mostly dirty-these floors I do!). The turndown service nightly is a nice touch, newspaper if you desire. Our room had a lavish oversized jetted bathtub and overlooked the Thames. 
HANDS DOWN best afternoon tea service in London. The Northhall Restaurant is FANTASTIC! Lobby lounge & room service food are splendid. 

Now the reason I originally selected this hotel was the gym & facilities. Its is still by far the best gym I have ever used while traveling. They have everything you need and then some if you are into a healthy lifestyle. The thermal floor/pools are expansive and an amazing place to relax after walking all over London during the day. 

Spa-I will repeat from my last review, Angel from Espa is by far the best massage therapist I've ever had. Very knowledgeable with all of the injuries I obtained from being an athlete. 

Concierge always helpful and ready to offer reservations anywhere in town, mail out something for you, book car service...they even found superglue for me when my nail broke! 

All in all, I highly recommend this hotel. Situated in a perfect location, with exceptional staff & service; I will be a forever guest!",5,2016,08,25
143,"Great location, lovely hotel","We recently stayed as a family at the Corinthia Hotel for 5 nights and had a great time. The location of the hotel was stellar -- we were able to walk to many destinations, and the Tube stop is just across the street when we wanted it (or the doorman would happily flag down taxis for us). 

We had two connecting rooms (we were traveling with our children, ages 6 and 9) and the setup worked well, although the number of drawers in the room was laughably few. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet each day (included as part of our room rate) and also ate at the restaurant with the kids, all of which was well received. Prior to arriving, the hotel arranged dinner reservations for us at a number of restaurants, and their recommendations on where to go for a nice meal that would also work with kids were all spot-on. They also arranged for an in-room sitter for us to go out to dinner without the kids, and everything came off without a hitch. The hours when kids are allowed at the pool were a bit on the restrictive time (but not unusual for London), and even when the kids were there it felt like they were out of place in an adult setting, so ultimately we only made use of it once.

The hotel itself is beautiful and very upscale. It didn't feel for me quite as welcoming as other places we have stayed where I felt like the staff knew us by the end of the trip -- here, it was more ""transactional"" but still responsive. We did not see as many kids here as I might have anticipated given the season and the degree to which they highlight how family friendly the hotel is (""crafty concierge"", etc.), but still the dynamic was fine.

In the end, I would say it was a very good experience and a pleasant stay. For the money, I might have expected something that was truly exceptional or distinctive, but hard to complain about a place that is so nice and well-located.",4,2016,08,25
143,great hotel with excellent service,"Our second visit to the hotel, A nice welcome...a free upgrade...great service and just a pleasant hotel to stay in London. Well done Corinthia team. 
We should not forget to give credit to the great doormen. Very polite and doing a great job.",5,2016,08,24
143,Quiet location in the heart of London tourist area,"Our first stay at the Corinthia and we were happy with our choice.  

The location is perfect.  It is a pretty quiet street so that is nice, but walk five minutes and you are in the craziness of Trafalgar Square.  It is such a convenient hotel to stay in with a selection of tube stations  nearby and a 10-minute walk in any direction will get you to numerous interesting places.

I would describe the hotel as understated elegance.  There are not many ""hello's"" from the staff, but when you ask a question you will get whatever help you need instantly and with a friendly demeanor.  The concierge staff and doormen are particularly helpful. 

The rooms are a good size and nicely decorated.  We were lucky enough to be upgraded so I am not sure if the following applies to regular rooms.  Regardless, we have stayed in many hotels around the world and the Corinthia had the nicest, best designed bathroom we have ever experienced.  Great job!

I would have given the Corinthia a 5-rating, but we had chronic problems with the front desk computer system.  We had problems releasing a credit card lock when we used another credit card payment, which would have been OK on its own.  However, during our stay every time we went to the front desk they seemed to have problems accessing their programs - something amiss there!",4,2016,08,24
143,"Excellent Location, Full of Lovely Surprises!","Our room was a welcome refuge for our weary bodies. They really think of every delight and comfort. Fresh fruit, slippers, Nepresso, tea, chocolates and to top it off, a remote control that floats in the bathtub! The hotel has a beautiful Jazz brunch on Sunday, an extraordinary bar, and many great spots to sit and enjoy a scotch.",5,2016,08,23
143,Perfect,"Had the River View suite, this time high enough to see the Thames.  Beautiful room.  Everyone we dealt with at the hotel was wonderful and helpful.  Enjoyed with the concierge team.  Was greeted on arrival and shown to our room by a manager. Could not have had a better experience.",5,2016,08,23
143,Delightful Afternoon Tea,"Enjoyed a delicious afternoon tea in the beautiful, elegant lobby lounge. The staff is very professional, friendly and everything was clearly explained and served with a smile. 
The sandwiches, scones and fancies, all delicious and washed down with a glass of champagne and lashings of tea. You could request more of anything you wanted. 
What sets this afternoon tea apart from others was the calm atmosphere, the tables set apart from others allowing space  for each party to enjoy each other's company and not packed like sardines as happens in some other high end hotelsI have visited. No conveyor belt here!
My only small complaint, and I do mean small was that there was a wedding party having photographs taken and the bride was being photographed at the pillar at the side of my table. While to some this might have been a pleasant distraction, to me it was a distraction I could have done without. I'm sure in such a beautiful establishment there would have been many a pillar to stand at for a more intimate picture.",5,2016,08,23
143,ESPA deserves an extra day,"This is my second review about Corinthia Hotel London, so you might think ""why again""? This very valid question has but one answer: Corinthia is, as I said before, ""a city landmark"". During each stay you may well have an experience you never had before. 

In my previous review, I detailed how wonderful Corinthia is and how much I've enjoyed the Hotel and its amenities. I found everything unchanged which, in this case, is exactly what I hoped for! This time, I allowed some time to enjoy the Hotel itself a little more. 

I will just describe part of my stay, to let you know what to expect from the ESPA life at Corinthia, the hotel's award winning SPA. 

The SPA-lift at end of the corridor is truly a travelling capsule. It brings you to the whole new world of ESPA life. As you register, ask your receptionist to activate the lift. As you exit the lift, you will find three marble chaise longues. Pretend you have not seen them (for now!) and make your way to the pool. Allow yourself some time to relax there. Then, move to the jacuzzi (vitality pool) and take advantage of each different configuration available for you. The sauna and the thermal room are outstanding providing a truly synesthetic experience, each of them. You will also find showers and an ice-fountain. Please allow yourself some time to enjoy everything! After you feel you have done so, make your way towards the marble chaise longues. You will find them heated to the perfect temperature. Lie down and rest. 

When you have awaken from your sleep (yes, it happened to me!), and if you have not done so yet, head back to your room to enjoy in-room breakfast (ordered the night before). I found it s the perfect ending. 

After an enjoyable day you might like to try the afternoon tea (I have not done so yet!) and eventually finish your day at the Bassoon Jazz Bar. The music is excellent and the drinks are amazing ranging from a luxury hot chocolate to a tasteful whisky on the rocks with a number of cocktails and hot drinks to choose from.

Everything taking place in a building once used as Ministry of Defense by Sir Winston Churchill. The man really was a genius!",5,2016,08,23
143,London Vacation ,"Luxury defined! Absolutely amazing. Staff will cater to your every need, rooms are exquisite and so comfortable and hotel is in close proximity to the heart of the city.  Afternoon Tea in the Lobby Lounge is delightful and delicious.  So classy.  We went to Massimo, located in the hotel and it was excellent.  In addition, Espa is the ultimate spa - I've never seen anything so magnificent.  You will not be disappointed with this hotel.  It's expensive, but worth every penny!",5,2016,08,22
143,Best hotel in the world - in my opinion,"The entire hotel from entrance, to the rooms, to the spa are beyond imagining. Beautiful hotel, worth every penny. The Penthouse is as stunning as the standard room, the views from the standard rooms are great whether you are facing the city or the courtyard, the view from the penthouse is breathtaking though. A 180 degree veiw of the thames from way up high, you can see right up to Tower of London. Can't recommend this hotel enough.",5,2016,08,22
143,Amazing hotel,"We spent three nights with our six month old baby. We got a suite which was super spacious, nice and quiet. The bathroom was particularly nice with TV in the bath... The building is grand and beautiful in a very nice area two minutes away from trafalgar square. The staff are all nice and helpful, the Spa is the nicest I've seen. Only thing not great was the restaurant. Not great choice and when we ate in the food was nothing special tho service was good. Overall a great stay.",5,2016,08,21
143,"Modern! Clean, what are you waiting for?","Very very clean, comfortable. Cleaning is one of the essential to be comfortable. A beautiful hotel, great view, great experience. With good ambiance, good people. great staff. Highly recommend. What are you waiting for?",5,2016,08,20
143,"Stunning hotel, great location, relaxing spa facilities","My husband booked this hotel for my birthday in June. Being pregnant, I asked him to look for somewhere with a pool so we could relax after hectic days in the city. Little did he know that it actually had a full on spa area complete with an extra large jacuzzi, sauna, steam room and heated beds! This was definitely our favorite part of the hotel and we spent as much time down there as we could when we weren't out doing things. 

Upon arrival, we were greeted by friendly doormen who took our luggage for us. Check is was quick and smooth- the lady tending to us was both polite and friendly. Our room was ready so we were able to freshen up before heading out to lunch. The room was lovely, just as we would expect from a 5 star hotel. Very clean, the bed was comfy, bathroom was large with a big walk in shower one side and a big bath the other side. Turn down service was great! One night we were left a luxury chocolate each and the next a relaxing lavender pouch. These were nice touches. 

Breakfast both mornings was fab- good selection and other things made to order if requested. 

Again, the spa area was lovely and very relaxing. The only strange thing was that when you went down in the lift, you had to get out at the spa reception level so the staff could swipe their card to allow you access further down to the pool level. Or you could get out and go down the 2 flights of stairs. Very strange. 

Overall, our stay at the Corinthia was excellent. We like to try different hotels when we stay in London but we would consider staying here again as it's so nice with a great spa area. The only complaint we have is that my husband requested a surprise cake to be in our room as it was my birthday, and this was not done. (He even asked twice!) So that was a shame. It's the little touches that hotel staff do for you that make your stay more memorable.",5,2016,08,18
143,Incredible,"Impeccable hotel, location, staff, spa, and experience.
The restaurants inside the hotel are great and surprisingly well priced for London.
Booking in a way that includes the breakfast is worth about 200 pounds per day.

Best stay ever...",5,2016,08,16
143,Cleand and comfortable,"A beautiful hotel right in the heart of London. Loved our bathroom, very clean and modern. Great for couples get-aways. Bed was very comfortable, sheets smelled rather fresh and clean. Overall, very satisfied!",5,2016,08,14
143,thankfully as good as expected,"This is a great hotel, rooms. staff and common areas. 
The property has history but the conversion back to a Hotel was very well done and it has modern character everywhere.
So centrally located but also very quiet. W walked to many attractions.Recommend to all.",5,2016,08,14
143,Phenomenal,"I would rate this hotel 6 stars if I could.  Ideally situated whether you want theatre, shopping or tourism yet in a remarkably quiet street.  Although a luxury hotel it is in no way pretentious and all the staff were warm and welcoming.  I was incredibly impressed that the dining room staff addressed me by name when I came down on my second morning, that high quality attention to detail is rare in this day and age.  The room is luxurious and extremely well appointed and the bed the most comfortable I have ever slept in - just wish my stay had been longer than than three nights.  I definitely plan to come back and this time bring my bathing suit so I can enjoy the amazing pool!  Many thanks to all the staff for a remarkable stay.",5,2016,08,14
143,Comfort in the Heart of London,"My husband and I stayed at the Corinthia Hotel in early August for 3 nights.  As I'm sure you've gathered from other reviews, this hotel is superb.  Here's why:

ROOMS:  For being in the heart of a major city, the rooms are very large.  We had a standard kind bed room.  There is a small foyer with a large closet, a bedroom with the bed, TV stand, 2 nightstands and a desk, and a bathroom with a large bathtub (with a TV!), separate shower, and toilet with a door.  We stayed in 3 hotels during our trip to Europe, so I can't remember if it's a double or single sink vanity.  Either way, it's spacious!
Also, despite being in the heart of London, the room seemed very quiet.

CONCIERGE: This was a last-minute business trip for my husband.  I decided to join him, but only had 1 week to plan.  For this reason, I had to rely much more than usual on the concierge.  I was beyond impressed with Justin.  He helped me secure fabulous tickets to Les Miserables and gave very helpful tips about navigating the city.  I probably asked some stupid questions given the small amount of time I had to plan.  However, Justin was very respectful and kind, nonetheless.

LOCATION: It just can't be beat.  The hotel is about one block from Trafalgar Square and the River Thames.  My husband and I were able to walk to many of the famous London attractions from the hotel (which made me feel less guilty about fish and chips!)

POOL: Don't miss the spa pool!  Although the pool is within the spa facilities, it is free to use.  There is a large jacuzzi with a special waterfall jet that feels amazing after walking all day.  There's also a steam room and marble, heated lounge chairs.  To me, it seemed like a great value that all this was included.

Don't hesitate to book this hotel.  You absolutely will not be disappointed.",5,2016,08,12
143,Clean central hotel,"We enjoyed our stay at the Corinthia hotel. The hotel is very centrally located, and close walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, St Paul's, with plenty of shopping and restaurants in the area.  With regards to the hotel itself, the beds were comfortable, Internet was so-so, and the rooms themselves are moderately decorated.  There's no gym in the building, but, there is one next door, and if you're staying at the hotel you can use the gym at no charge.",4,2016,08,12
143,Superb hotel,"A beautiful hotel with a great room. Very modern electronics, very comfortable, excellent bathroom all with great service and care. Bed was great, the lobby was delightful with beautiful floral arrangements.",5,2016,08,11
143,One of my fav hotels in London,"Had a really enjoyable stay at the Corinthia. The room was spacious and had all that I need. The Northall and Massimo restaurants are both very good and service very professional. 

The Spa is huge and the pool area very nice to relax. 

The bar is very nice too and the hotel is always feeling alive yet like a home away from home. ",5,2016,08,10
143,High end luxury,"Spent a night here recently and we were very impressed, great room, great service had a very nice lunch in the Lobby lounge. The door staff were more than happy to allow Caroline to use the disabled lift to get from the pavement to the reception area despite the fact she was walking with two sticks. The paparazzi weren't interested in us either which was good. Really liked the bar and apart from the Stratosphere in Vegas I have never seen such a spread for breakfast, there was pretty much anything you could possible imagine. The restaurant (reviewed separately) was pretty good too.",5,2016,08,07
143,Fabulous Stay at the Corinthia!,"I cannot say enough good things about the Corinthia. Absolutely gorgeous and luxurious hotel. Gracious and accommodating staff. Delicious breakfast. We arrived early (7:00 a.m.) from the U.S.  We were quickly checked in although our room was not ready (it never is at that early hour).  Our bags were stored, we were given delicious complimentary cappuccino in the beautiful lobby and offered use of the spa to shower and change. Our rooms were ready a couple of hours later and they were luxurious, spacious and well appointed. I am returning on business in November and am planning to spend serious time in the spa. I can hardly wait!!!  ",5,2016,08,04
143,Brilliant!,"I am a wheelchair user and this was a disabled room. The bed was huge and was lifted off the floor(so I could get the hoist under it) by requested elephant feet about 6-8 inches tall. It was also very hot in London. So there was a sheet,a thin blanket and another sheet on top- perfect! Though air conditioner was in the room. The bathroom was ideal and the shower wheel-in. 
The staff were wonderful and could not have been more helpful. 
The only negative point was that outside the hotel there was no drop-kerb fora wheelchair so I had to go to the end of the road to get on the pavement. (This was only a few yards)
A brilliant experience - one that we will repeat.",5,2016,08,03
143,Truly beautiful 5 star hotel with amazing service and excellent location,"We traveled with two young children (7 & 5)  to London for 10 days and had a wonderful time staying at the Corinthia.  We were very lucky to get an upgrade to a much bigger suite. The room was of good size and was nicely appointed. The hotel was very thoughtful with the kids amenities where they got their own bathrobes, slippers, toiletries and even stuffed toys!

Breakfast selection was good with quality food. Room service was nice. 
The hotel was filled with beautiful flowers and it just smelled really nice everywhere you go. 
Location was great. It's walkable distance to attractions or just places to hang out.  It's not far from any main shopping, entertainment or restaurants area. 

The one thing that stands out the most about Corinthia was its impeccable service and the very professional concierge.  Since it's the first time for my children to visit London, I did plan quite ahead of time with tickets, tours and restaurants bookings before my trip.  The concierge was by far the best I've ever experienced from all the top hotels I know around the world.  They were very helpful with any questions and were extremely responsive with all my requests.  I was already impressed before I arrived at the hotel. During my stay, I still found them to be very professional and very welcoming. It was also very well-staffed; I never had to wait even though it was during one of the biggest time at the hotel.  Places and restaurants they recommended were all worth going. 

So all in all, it's a wonderful hotel if you are looking for comfort and top service with great location.",5,2016,08,03
143,Perfection,"Good evening, my daughter and I just got back from a 5 night stay at your gorgeous property and I find it necessary to let you know our feedback.
It was perfection! You have an amazing staff, especially Fabián(AM) and Iván(PM). I never opened a door! Everyone rushed to open them for us! The building, the location, the flowers, the rooms, the bed, the pillows, the bathroom and toiletries, the coffe & tea, the books & magazines, slippers, robes, the spa, breakfast,( the Northall is gorgeous! ) lavender sachets, chocolates, dessert cake stand, candy for my daughter, apples, tons of hangers, room for both suitcases inside closets, I could go on...We were across from the lifts and never heard a sound! We even had someone's bodyguard outside our door and only found out because we saw him, never heard a thing! Fabian gave us a tour of Massimo's & the Espa, both stunning!! We were with a big group by invitation and were all very sad to check out. Can't wait to get back!
Thank you!! Best hotel in London, and dare I say ...the world!!

143,Amazing stay at this fab location ,"We booked in for a two night pit stop in London to do some shopping and sightseeing with our two children. The moment we entered we knew two nights would just not be enough. The entrance / lobby area sets the scene to this beautiful hotel. The staff were polite and attentive and listened to all our needs. The room was beautifully laid out and very spacious. We immediately decided upon arrival to extend one night. The location is perfect close to everything and the housekeeping staff were superb. There were a few little things we needed changing in the room and the staff listened and actioned anything we  requested. 
On the Sunday we wanted to be back at the hotel for afternoon but got held up and arrived a little late. The room service staff were kind enough to provide what we requested in our room.
Overall a wonderful stay and we will be back next time we are in London as this is now our new favourite hotel. ",5,2016,08,02
143,Simply perfect!!,"Outstanding service, great hotel, my number one in London.
Beginning with the great stuff at the Whitehall Restaurant till the amazing houskeeping staff.
I simply feel so homey. The spa is great, the food delicious, rooms are perfect, location - can`t be better.
Love it!!",5,2016,08,01
143,Perfect,"Love staying at this hotel in London. Brilliant location , beautiful lobby area and love The Basson Bar for cocktails . Classy but really friendly and there's usually a celeb to be spotted here. Rooms are a good size for London and love the Nespresso machine in the room ",5,2016,07,30
143,Delightfully perfect stay,"Everything about our visit was outstanding.  Attentive service.  Beautifully appointed room - LOVED the oversized closet - it was actually a dressing room.  Fabulous water pressure and oversized rainfall shower head. Super quiet room - never heard a peep in the hallway or from nearby rooms. Lots of dining choices - 2 restaurants, a bar, and tea room.  Visited the spa for a massage.  And oh so conveniently located.  LOVED our stay!",5,2016,07,29
143,The six stars hotel in London ,"For the past few years Corinthia became my permanent address in London 
In my opinion it's the best in town  (location, design, customer service, rooms/beds, breakfast, afternoon tea, ....)

It has it all ,, beautiful historical building, steps to the river ,, short walk to the famous west end ",5,2016,07,29
143,Amazing,"Was treated to an overnight stay and spa for my birthday. It was a truly amazing experience. 
The staff made me feel very special as I was treated to an espa gift pack and cake for my birthday it was absolutely wonderful   
The rooms are lovely and the beds are so comfortable   
I really didn't want to leave . The spa is a five star luxury haven. 
The choice of breakfast was superb .
I highly recommend a stay at this fantastic London hotel.",5,2016,07,29
143,Fantastic Afternoon Tea,"The best afternoon tea we had while in London was at the Corinthia Hotel. It was also the most expensive. So if you want to splurge on tea, make reservations at the Corinthia.  They had the best little sandwiches, the best scones (available with or without raisins) and the best baked goods (which our server called ""fancies""). Also, she offered us seconds on any of these treats we wanted. The setting is beautiful, with lovely flowers on the round central table under a spectacular chandelier. Not only that, if you're a guy, stop in and see the unusual ""waterfall"" urinals in the mens' room. (As reported to me by my husband).",5,2016,07,28
143,Amazing Corinthia,"What an amazing place this is. Our 2nd visit and it really out did itself. Room upgrade on arrival was very much appreciated, the staff are so welcoming and helpful and so efficient.  We have stayed at a few London hotels and this by far is our favourite. We give ourselves a yearly treat and have an all out splurge, so next year we will most definitely be returning.",5,2016,07,28
143,A very adult hotel!,"We visited the hotel several times over a week as our close friends from Asia were staying with their extended family.  Although the rooms were impressive we were shocked to see adults drinking all day in the bar and getting quite loud. When we went to take the children swimming we were told that there were strict limits on when they could visit as 'the adults don't like children in the pool'.   After being given a grudging 15 minutes I saw why. The atmosphere in the spa was more like a sex club than a health club with darkened areas and some dubious looking 'couples' .   We could not get milkshakes for the children when we asked for them and we paid a massive £25 for the tiniest portion of lobster I have ever had in the restaurant.   The waiters were lacking in knowledge regarding wine and food, telling our friends that Sorrel sauce was 'like Wasabi'!  The excellent breakfasts and service notably fell off in the afternoon and evening when everything began to look rather shabby.
While waiting for a taxi outside we were heckled by drunken residents and watched as a number of men with ear pieces and dark glasses were whisked away in a number of cars.  All in all it was quite sleazy despite the extortiate amount of money they charge.  Very poor and how unlike the wonderful 'Milestone' hotel which we had all stayed at previously.",3,2016,07,25
143,A fabulous birthday treat,"The most fabulous 5* hotel - from the efficient staff, beautiful bar and sitting areas to our bedroom - all first class.  As guests we also had access to the spa - and spent two hours relaxing in the pool - a perfect birthday treat and one we hope to repeat very soon.",5,2016,07,24
143,They got it right,"A well deserved stay for me as for several years I endured  the pounding of the massive construction going on with the former government building being transformed, beautifully, to the Corinthia Hotel London.  Exceptional service from the front desk staff, doormen, bellman and concierge.  The breakfast is one of the best in the city.  Not last call on a cruise buffet, but civilized with offerings that cover any palette from Asia to the Americas with another great staff greeting and serving.  The dinning rooms are all great looking.  The lobby and their Baccarat chandelier is a pretty amazing focal point - and it should be as the legend is they paid a million Pounds - - for that price I would need more than just lighting.  
The restaurants are worthy of this luxury hotel.  Meals and drink options are abundant.  From the Lobby Lounge, including the interior courtyard bar for meals and drinks with great high tea, to Massimo's and Northall restaurants. Your cuisine needs will be covered very very nicely.  The Bassoon Bar is reminiscent of a smokey jazz bar - rocket to 2016 and a no smoking but still offers great drinks and atmosphere, albeit VERY dark.  
The rooms are fantastic. Just beautiful and smartly designed.  The heated bathroom floors make me hate my bathroom at home.  Fantastic bathrooms to pamper.  And speaking of pamper - just a few floors down, The spa at the Corinthia is UNREAL. The weight room would cost a ton of money at a high end gym .  It is spotless, with ample equipment from weights to cardio.  The calming seated alcoves allow for rest and great retreats. The spa bubbling tub is larger than some community pools.  The options for therapeutic bubbling stations make you want to live there forever.  Only caution, families at times feel their children should play in this spa oasis, they should not.  
Hotel location is central and visually fantastic - Embankment tube station across the street offers tons of lines and travel options.  The river is just at the end of the block, and the London Eye massively displayed across the river. Turn right and give a big hello the The Elizabeth Tower, home of Big Ben and helpful timepiece. Heading away from the river is Trafalgar Square, The Strand. Soho, the West End.
My only negative was upon check out. You should review your bill, as I had an erroneous drink 'fee' that was removed immediately.",5,2016,07,24
143,Great staff,A beautiful hotel on the river I had a stunning two-story suite I guess they were full and it couldn't have been better. The two restaurants are fabulous and there's a wonderful lobby lounge for afternoon tea. Likely much better for a couple then a solo but an enjoyable place to stay nonetheless. ,5,2016,07,23
143,Lovely peaceful outdoor area,A 5* hotel through and through. It is certainly one of the best hotels in London. The outdoor terrace is perfect for a relaxing drink-great for a catch up with friends. I would highly recommend a visit. Staff are attentive but not intrusive. Decor is modern.,5,2016,07,23
143,Customers for Life,"Beautiful hotel in best spot in London. We have in the past rented flats through VRBO but won't stay anywhere else in London after our stay here. The staff are top notch and the rooms and all the facilities and dining are as well. Would love to know what that scent is that permeates the hotel. We will be back soon!
Thank you again!",5,2016,07,22
143,Exceptional Hotel,"This hotel is nothing short of exceptional. 

In my opinion one of the best hotels in London. 

From when you first enter you are welcomed by the doormen and shown to reception. Check in is swift and even though we checked in early our room was ready for us. 

The room is fantastically comfortable, with the not amazing bathroom. It is also really quiet, which for central London is a rarity. 

Location wise you can't get better, right between the Houses of Parliament and just down from Trafalagar Square. Get out and walk around from here. 

Breakfast was buffet style but with an a la crate option. The buffet however had everything that you need. 

As the title suggest, I had a wonderful stay with my wife and will definitely be coming back when we are in London next. ",5,2016,07,22
143,Absolutely Fantastic,"The Corinthia Hotel in London is absolutely fantastic.  The hotel is beautiful, always clean and smells heavenly.   The staff is second to none.  The concierge team is the best I have ever dealt with.  We travelled with two teenage daughters and they made our trip absolutely wonderful.  The hotel is in the middle of everything with lots easily a walk away.  The rooms were spectacular and large.  I highly recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone.  We will absolutely be back.",5,2016,07,19
143,Exquisite Hotel and Fabulous Service,"I had a very brief stay at the Corinthia when I had to fly to London last minute due to a health emergency suffered by my father. The hotel is beautiful, and no details were missed in designing the rooms. Most of all was the service. When my dad was discharged from the hospital, he wasn't cleared to fly back to the States for several days, and my understanding from my mom and sister (who were already with him) is that the hotel was incredibly gracious and helpful in accommodating my family, who was essentially grounded in London. They upgraded my parents to a larger room and offered assistance in making plans and keeping my parents comfortable while my dad recovered. It is service such as this that helps build a loyal customer base, and I look forward to returning in the future.",5,2016,07,19
143,Wonerful upscale hotel,"The Corinthia Hotel is located in Whitehall  and is only  5 years old in a renovated former govt building.. It is an excellent hotel with larger rooms than most in London and very well decorated.  The bathooms are some of the nicest and biggest in London with a large walk in shower as well as a seperate large soaking tub. The bathroom floor is  heated and toasty.The hotel service and ammenties are first class. There are two very good restaurants attached to the hotel which serve very good food. It is one block from the Thames and a short walking distance to Number 10, Westminister Abby and Big Ben as well as the theatre district in the other direction. We would return to this hotel for sure.",5,2016,07,18
143,Excellent ,"This hotel is excellent, the spa is the best. The staff bends backwards to accommodate our requests especially for the children. They make them very welcome in the room.  Only drawback is that children have limited use of the pool.

We went there during Christmas and we were treated to night caps of mini mince pies to die for.

Afternoon tea is also very popular. Unfortunately we couldn't get in.",4,2016,07,18
143,Upgraded to Executive King Room,"We have just returned home after staying at the Corinthia Hotel. We arrived early and were given complimentary drinks and upgraded from a Superior King Room to an Executive King Room. Words cannot describe how amazing our whole stay has been, from every member of staff, the quality and standard of the room (it felt like a suite), the spa facilities, to the gorgeous breakfast which we are still extremely full from. The location of the hotel couldn't be better. We have stayed in the Savoy a couple of years ago and would definitely rate this hotel above it. The price was excellent when considering the whole experience and attention from all members of staff. A perfect stay. Thank you for many many memories.",5,2016,07,17
143,Lovely afternoon tea and nice room,"We stayed in an Executive King room which was impressive. It had a separate walk in wardrobe off the hallway a very large bedroom with balcony and a massive bathroom suite. The afternoon was a nice setting with lovely sandwiches, scones and cakes! The staff here were very nice and friendly.

However, the staff at check in were not very friendly which is a shame and lets the whole experience down. Breakfast at the hotel also let the stay down. Service was non existent and the selection of breakfast items was limited.

All in all i would highly recommend this hotel only for the afternoon tea, not sure I would stay here again as there are other hotels around this price range that offer fantastic service from check in to check out!",4,2016,07,17
143,Not up to par - way overpriced for what it delivers,"Here is a bit about why I only give it 2 stars. The price is high and these things were poor.  It took hours and hours to simply get 4 bottle of waters delivered to the room.  When they came to clean they took one of the robes and never brought a fresh one, the concierge could not get even one dinner reservation for us and it was a tuesday night and we were only looking to pubs.  Nothing was up to par, the hotel i snot in a good location for being able to enjoy local cafes  or bars or shopping either. oh, and the king size bed was maybe a double",2,2016,07,17
143,Heaven in London ,"Excellent hotel with exceptional staff. Absolutely no complaints, would happily live there if I had the cash.  Food is excellent but would love to see some plain unsalted good quality nuts at Bessun bar. Other than that it's an absolute gem in the heart of London. ",5,2016,07,17
143,Excellent experience in one of the best (and more expensive) hotels in London ,"Excellent hotel, one of the best I've ever been. 

Spacious rooms, superb beds and a bathroom to die for with a huge bath tub with jacuzzi and a TV set (if you book the executive rooms instead of the basic ones)

Breakfast is just amazing, with a very good buffet and the best Benedictine eggs I've ever tried (supplement price for those). 

The price is   to what you get: very high, albeit not super expensive for London standards. 

Never get tired of it when I go to London on a business trip. 
",5,2016,07,17
143,Second stay was not as memorable as the first.,"When I stayed here previously (2013), I thought I had died and gone to hotel heaven. I'm not sure what has changed, but during our most recent stay, I felt as though something was 'off'. I think it was the 'little things' that were possibly unnoticed last time but, in their absence this time, were conspicuous. They probably aren't worth pitching a fit over, but at the cost of staying at this property, I think they do make a difference. I won't go into detail, but in short, I felt as if the staff was trying to 'upsell' everything, including the dining options, and did not do as excellent a job of listening as I had previously experienced. 

Here's a perfect example that the customer service dial was a bit off: I always liked that on returning to our room at night, the TV would be switched to a screen that welcomed us back to our room, with soft music. On our last night, the name on the screen was not ours, and I had to call down to make sure that they hadn't booked our room out to someone else by mistake. 

We specifically came back to London for a few nights just to stay at the Corinthia again. In all honesty I don't know if I will do that again. For the cost of the stay, I expect perfection and have in fact experienced that from the property in the past. This time, it was not there.",4,2016,07,16
143,A Touch of Luxury,"I visited the Spa not the hotel.  A beautifully relaxing experience which smells divine the minute you enter.  Hot marble beds, steam room, sauna, jacuzzi and infinity pools in a sumptuous requisite luxury area.  Treatments are available if required. 

Highly recommended for a relaxing unwinding time. Espa products available.",5,2016,07,14
143,Superb Hotel in a GREAT Location,"My family (husband and 2 kids) stay at the Corinthia for 6 nights.  We had an amazing time and all staff is friendly and helpful.  At check-in we were provided with a walk through and even asked at what time we would like turn down service.  We were also upgraded to new room.   

Rooms are well appointed and spacious.  Children were given welcome spa kits, bath robe and stuffed animals.   The every night the beds had a lavender packets which made the sheets and room smell nice.   

This hotel is perfectly located to many sites (Trafalgar Square, Buckingham Palace, Churchill War room, London Eye, Westminster Abbey, Big BEN, Parliament).  The hotel is a 5 minute walk to the EMBANKMENT train station.  

We went to two of the hotels restaurants (Northall and Massimo). Both were good but Massimo was the best.  We wanted to go again but they are not open on Sundays. 

The kids enjoyed the pool however there are specific times for kids to swim.   

You will not go wrong with this 5 star hotel.  We will definitely go back.",5,2016,07,13
143,Over night spa,"Breakfast- was 5* (they have beef and chicken sausages as well as Turkey bacon )

Spa-was 5* -best spa ever!!!

Room -was 5*- lovely bathroom with TV installed in the bathtub,good size comfy bed.
Good sized fresh room !

Staff-was 5*- very friendly and helpful !

P.s-This is by far my favourite hotel in London, it's not just a hotel it's an experience. Highly recommended",5,2016,07,12
143,Spacious room with beautiful bathroom.  Great location.,"I enjoyed our 3-nights stay here from Thursday through Sunday at the end of June.  At check-in, they upgraded the room to Executive King for free.  The room was on a lower floor, near the elevator, but it was very quiet during our stay except Saturday night when I heard some loud music from outside for a while around 12 am.  

Room was really specious, stylish and functional.  There were lots of power outlets, which was useful.  Bathroom was also huge -- a double-sink, a deep and long bathtub, a separate shower, a toilet and a bidet.

Turn down service put an ironed napkin on the floor of each side of the bed and placed slippers on it.  I thought it was a nice touch.

One missing feature (for me) was that the room doesn't shut outside lights so well.  So, by about 4 am, light comes into the bedroom from here and there, and that woke me once every morning.  I kind of expect ""completely dark bedroom"" feature from this class of hotel.  It's not essential, but it's a great feature that helps quality of sleep.",4,2016,07,11
143,Hotel with the best spa,"Corinthia is one of the best five star hotels but what makes it unique is the 4 level spa, voted as the best in Europe and the biggest in UK. The ceiling of the swimming pool throws the image of floating water, giving the impression of being underwater.  But the best experience is the vitality pool with jets of water from different angles and can be enjoyed in standing, sitting and sleeping positions which have to be experienced to be understood. The hotel boasts of the themed penthouses and suites lending excellent views of London & its attractions.",5,2016,07,11
143,5 star experience ,"My wife and I spent three nights at The Corinthia hotel on our vacation through Europe. Everything about The Corinthia was 5 star. The doormen were always friendly and helpful, great check-in process with a personal walk through of the facilities, excellent concierge team that provided great suggestions, spacious room that had many nice touches (lavender packets made the sheets smell great), first class spa, great restaurants/bar, and the list could go on. Staying in many Aman/Four Seasons/Mandarin Oriental hotels I can say that The Corinthia was one of the best hotels I have experienced. 

Highly recommend!",5,2016,07,11
143,Best Hotel In London,This is a fantastic hotel to stay in.It is a quite location very close to Trafalgar square. The rooms are superb. Fantastic fantastic. The restaurants are superb and the food is excellent. You want to be pampered ... it is the only place to go.,5,2016,07,11
143,Good,"I needed to escape a hectic working life and building work at home so booked a late deal - and I wasn't sorry. I loved the size of my room! The bed was enormous, everything had been thought of, even an umbrella if you needed it. The bathroom was well laid out and high spec Had breakfast in bed one morning which was excellent and made me feel very special Spent 6 hours in the ESPA Spa! The back massage, facial and scalp massage were incredible. All the surroundings were relaxing with lots of spaces to kick back and relax Fantastic dinners in both restaurants - I thought the beef carpaccio couldn't be beaten but the venison carpaccio was heavenly! And well done for selling lobster thermador with thin fries - perfect!",5,2016,07,11
143,Friday night,"Corinthians hotel is such a well designed venue. I went with my friends late Friday night for drinks. To my surprise they had live music which was thoroughly enjoyable, they had a good selection of champagnes too. Service was good.
If you are a cigar smoker or a smoker in general they have a very cosy and comfortable outside terrace for any weather.
Will certainly go there again and highly recommend it.",5,2016,07,10
143,"Lovely, location, style, comfort....but I wish I knew about the incidentals.","This is one of the most difficult reviews, I wanted to give it a 5, but some things considered had to leave it as a 4.

Let me start by saying it was nearly perfect. We stayed at the Corinthia London for 3 days, and I must say it was lovely.  We booked the executive rooms using Expedia.  The definite positives are:
1. Showers- the shower experience was second to none, mainly because of the water pressure.  This has to be one of the best shower pressures ever, you could almost drown yourself lol... Not literally, but pressure for days.  I'm dreaming about it now as I write this.  Reminded me about the Seinfeld shower episode. 
2. Location-  this was a hop skip and a jump from all the top rated tourist sites.  It was a luxurious location, high end.
3. Service-  treated with respect from the doorman to the room service.b Thank you all for being as professional as you were.
4. Our breakfast was included, and that even included a la carte breakfast.  You would need to get  ore details on this, I am not sure if it was just a fluke.
5. Walk in closet- A nice touch, may not be included in all room types.
6. Large windows- this made the difference.

Now for the things why this wasn't a 5 in my opinion.

1. Pre authorizations for incidentals-  We aren't all royals.  The pre authorization amounts they hold are the same or close to the room rate. Incidentals pre authorizations were as much as each room, per night, in my case more.  That is correct, per night.  If you stay 2 nights they take 2 times the daily pre auth.  Which a major inconvenience, when your credit cards has a 2000 dollar hold, while in a different country.  That was the only thing I could say that really would have made me second guess booking here.   However I am glad I didn't, just had to swallow the hold on my credit card.
2. Beds-  the beds were above average.  We had a king size.  The sheets were very nice, and the down comforter was nice too.  The bed itself was a little firm, and didn't include the stuff high end Sheraton properties include, such as those down mattress toppers.(you know the things that make you feel as you are sleeping on a cloud).
3. Wear and tear-  you can tell the hotel is a popular one, has some wear on the carpets and drapes.  Not terribly bad, but you know what I am talking about, if you visit.

Don't let the 3 items mentioned above hinder you from staying here, if you can afford it, it is very very nice.

",4,2016,07,09
143,Great place for a drink,"We were staying across the street at the Horseguards and noticed this beautiful but understated hotel and stopped in for a drink after dinner. Spectacular place, several bars with different atmospheres. Cigar bar very smart. Main bar is magnificent with very high ceilings. Done up right with fresh flowers in Wimbledon theme. No expense sparred in design and finishes. Sure to please. ",5,2016,07,09
143,Concierge - perfect!!,Stayed at this hotel many times - easily the best hotel in London! What makes this hotel even better is the high level of service from the concierge team. Restaurant and club recommendations are spot on - their knowledge is amazing! If you are thinking of a trip to London - stay at the Corinthia and take advantage of the best concierge team! ,5,2016,07,09
143,Beautiful,"We stayed here the night of our wedding, it is a beautiful hotel. The room was spectacular and you feel very special being here. We were greeted by a bottle of champagne as well which was a lovely surprise. Great location and lovely hotel. The breakfast is great too!",5,2016,07,08
143,Fa-bu-lous. How it is supposed to be!,"I can only tell you.. There are no negatives on this hotel. And I am very critical!
Beautiful interior, classis but modern at the same time. Lovely decorated room. And that marble bathroom.. Wauw! 
The spa was wonderful, such a nice atmosphere to relax. I didn't have a bikini and they even had a disposable bathing suit for me to wear! 
The bar in the evening is amazing as well as the (Italian) restaurant Massimo.
The breakfast is super delightful and classy, really tasty. 
The staff in this hotel is perfect they really make you feel at home and in the same time don't disturb your privacy at all. 
I would come back as many times as I can.",5,2016,07,08
143,Amazing location and breakfast,"We had the pleasure to stay here for two nights. Our check-in went smoothly and our room was beautiful. The bathroom was very large. It had double sinks and the amenities were wonderful. Housekeeping provided plenty. 

Although our room was very clean and the furniture appeared to be in good shape, the rug was dirty. This was a disappointing. Replacing the rug would make a world of a difference in this luxury room.

Service was very good from all staff. Everyone was attentive and willing to help.

The location is perfect. It is walking distance to many sights, Big Ben, House of Parliament, Westminster Abbey.

Especially enjoyed breakfast. It was included in our room. Buffet was plentiful. You order even order off of the menu if you preferred.

The hotel also provided a lovely Turndown Service. It is always nice to return to your room to find it refreshed for you.

We will surely return to this hotel on our next visit to London.",5,2016,07,07
143,Travel,"We spent the evening in extravagant ballroom for a wedding. Beautiful room and the hotel service was great. The ballroom itself is on the ground floor with beautiful windows out on to London. Cloakroom and bathrooms on the other hand, were in the subbasement about a 5minute walk from the venue. Little strange.",5,2016,07,05
143,Love this place!,"Stayed here three times when visiting London and I have loved each room I have stayed in. The room is always clean, tidy and well presented, full of amenities. The staff are always polite and friendly, without going overboard on the pleasantries. One thing that I do find annoying is that you have to call for them to collect your room service trolley. When I have to rush out in the mornings for meetings, I don't have time to call down to arrange collection. After a long day, I come back and find the trolley still there, even after my room has been serviced! Disgusting really! ",5,2016,07,04
143,Why would you ever stay anywhere else?,"We had an amazing week at The Corinthia during the first week of Wimbledon.  
After reading reviews on the hotel for a couple of months, I was a little skeptical that it would match my very high expectations--WRONG--it exceeded my expectations on virtually every issue.
1) Concierge--even before we arrived, the concierge desk was helpful with arranging a private tour, arrangements to play tennis, and other details.
2)  VALUE--not many of the reviews note that the hotel, while not cheap, is a value because the amazing service and amenities. We stayed in a junior suite, and it was huge.  Opened, with a balcony, to the courtyard, which made it very 
quiet. 
3) Service is just matchless at every turn, From the doormen to the folks in the spa and gym to the restaurants, your every wish is satisfied quickly and happily.
4) Room--as noted above, our junior suite was huge, as was the bathroom.  The rain shower was amazing--the most amazing volume I have ever experienced.  The bathroom is very large, and the amenities were excellent.  Housekeeping and cleanliness were impeccable.
5) Food--as several others have noted, the breakfast buffet is excellent and extensive.  A little variety every now and then is provided by the menu. Room service food was exceptional--hot, well prepared and it arrived quickly.
6) Spa and gym--both very nice and never seemed the be crowded.  I am recovering from a serious injury and needed to ice after exercising--two bags of ice arrived at our room on a silver tray---c'mon--where would you ever see that done. 
7) Overall atmosphere--quiet elegance, unobtrusive service, incredibly class in a beautiful hotel.
8) Location--in Whitehall, an amazing number of tourist attractions are in walking distance, the tube is across the street and there are many nice places to eat--ranging from the typical pub to same very nice white tablecloth establishments with in a 10 minute walk in a very safe area.     
Just an amazing visit--we will be back next year for the tennis!!!",5,2016,07,04
143,Excellent yet again,One of the best hotels in the world. Great breakfast. Awesome location. Wonderful rooms. Great staff. We were there on a family vacation. The whole staff made our stay very personal. The doormen are a delight. The restaurant team are some of the best anywhere and make every breakfast a delight. I still rate it as one of the best breakfast in the world. ,5,2016,07,03
143,Impeccable Service and Luxury,"From the minute you walk in the front doors, opened by door men each and every time, the Corinthia is a 5-star, well-decorated, high-end hotel in London, right near the Thames, Big Ben and the Embankment train stop.  Our family stayed here while touring the city and was thrilled with the room, staff and food, especially the unbelievable breakfast buffet.  Going to London?  Stay here!",5,2016,07,02
143,"Corinthia Hotel, London. Well up to its usual five stars","Spacious well appointed room. Concierge service top of the line. Breakfast: a superb range of quality foods. The evening pre-theatre supper is very good. We had a small problem with our in-room safe but a technician soon fixed it (we had this same problem on two previous visits).
Near to galleries, St.Martin in-the-Field for concerts, theatres, and a short walk to the Thames. Highly recommended.",5,2016,07,02
143,Third and Best.,"This was our third stay at this wonderful hotel. We had a beautiful upgraded room for 3 nights,enjoyed breakfast and dinner at the Northall and had a lovely table at Massimo on two evenings. Drinks at the Bassoon Bar before dinner were a highlight. The staff were very professional,but we enjoyed some good banter and jokes with them. We hope to return.",5,2016,07,01
143,"Luxe, Pretty and well located for a Tourist","I have been to London many, many times and stayed in many hotels and private clubs. I was very excited to stay here when a great deal popped up on line and my travel agent matched it with Virtuoso perks. American Express will do the same so keep on the look out. I upgraded to an executive King which was wonderful but the real treat here are the suites that come with their own butler. I had a courtyard room on a high floor which gave me the quiet I love. The air conditioning was excellent which always makes me happy because I have asthma.  The room was beautifully done with a small closet and well appointed bathroom with walk in shower and soaking tub. It took a few times to figure out the rain shower and very strong hand shower. I liked the separate glass enclosures for both. I suspect the river view rooms are the best in the hotel if you want a beautiful view of the Thames. The hotel is luxurious from magnificent flowers from their own flower shop , a small Harrods shop to London's most beautiful new spa with several floors and a swimming pool. The front desk was excellent . The manager came out from the back to greet me. I really appreciated that and when I got his note in the room it was an extra touch. I didn't use the concierge that much but they were generally helpful when asked. I ate breakfast downstairs in the large beautiful dining room with an ample buffet. I preferred room service which was excellent and the food was good. I was exhausted after a two week trip and lots of walking so it was perfect to end my trip here. The spa services were excellent and I so enjoyed the massage that I had a second one for an hour and a half. Thank you to the manicurist for fixing my horrible nails. I only realized later that you can order a spa menu and dine in the spa as I was leaving. The location is really interesting directly across the Thames via the pedestrian bridge, next to Scotland Yard, near Parliament and the War rooms and very close to my personal favorite: St. James park. It's one of the newer, prettier places in London for afternoon tea. My opinion is that this hotel is trying to position itself with Claridges and the Connaught. It is newer, younger and a little hipper but located on the Embankment. What makes this interesting is that the London traffic is so bad that the Embankment is an easier way to get across the city. My only problem here is that my wifi did not work in the hotel and no one including me could figure that out. It made getting an uber to the airport somewhat difficult.since I had to walk up to Scotland Yard. I really think this was unusual and due to my att service. I would highly reccomend this hotel and you should set aside some time for the spa.",5,2016,06,30
143,Impressive,"Impressive design, Excellent Services, Great Location just in front of the Millennium Bridge. Great cuisine and very good services. Modern Classic design is very impressive and welcoming. Very comfortable meeting space",4,2016,06,30
143,Exceptionally nice hotel in London,"Location of this hotel is brilliant - being near Trafalgar Square and very close to Big Ben, it is not over crowded place, and even cozy and quite.
Service is brilliant indeed, rooms are quite big, and lobby restaurant services very tasty food and almost the best oysters in London.",5,2016,06,29
143,Absolutely marvelous hotel - great rooms and service,"We enjoyed a 2-night stay and would gladly have stayed longer had we not other plans to catch a Viking Baltic cruise in Stockholm.  Everything was delightful and very comfortable and calming.  Great suite and bathroom (fabulous shower!!!).  Highly recommend this hotel for quality, location, service, ambiance and food.",5,2016,06,28
143,Stunning hotel!,"Love this hotel, have stayed here a few times for work - rooms are modern and well laid out. food and service are both amazing. Great location to, far enough out from the hussle and bussle, but less than 10min walk and your right back in!!",5,2016,06,28
143,"Beautiful, amazing hotel!!","My husband and I have been very lucky to stay in top hotels around the world and this is definitely one of the best, if not the best! We have stayed here a couple of times now, both as a couple and with our young son. The entrance to the hotel is breathtaking with amazing flower displays and the biggest chandelier I have ever seen! The staff are the best staff we have dealt with at a hotel. They can never do enough for you, extremely professional, friendly and attentive. The rooms are beautifully furnished, impeccably clean and beyond comfortable. The bathrooms are so amazing and I wish my bathroom at home was as good!! The spa facilities are second to none and you have to visit if u are planning a stay at this hotel. Breakfast is great with a huge amount of choice from the buffet. We also are in the Italian restaurant at the hotel which was fantastic.

Can't wait to go back!! ",5,2016,06,28
143,Great hotel with wonderful spa,"I have stayed at the Corinthia London several times now. What make me keep coming back to this hotel in London is its one of a kind spa and its convenient location. The spa is located on an entire floor underground. It has a beautiful, large pool with a very large jacuzzi. There are coed dry and wet saunas as well as unisex ones. There are many very comfortable beds around the spa that one can rest very comfortably. Complementary fruits and nuts are abound. You can also take in all types of wonderful massages. I always made it a point to spend an afternoon in the spa to relax and rejuvenate. There is a gas fireplace that you can lay in front of it. The hotel is conveniently located within 5-10 mins from Trafalgar Square, Piccadilly Circus, and many shops/restaurants. The rooms are nicely decorated with comfortable bed. The marble bathroom has heated floor which is very nice during the winter. The price is somewhat steep however.",5,2016,06,27
143,Calm Oasis,"We stayed for almost two weeks at the end of May/beginning of June. For the first time in many years we received a room we didn't like (tiny closet, single sink, tv off center) but staff was accommodating and we moved twice. Our final room (which I think was in the ""35"" group) was perfect for us. It overlooked the interior courtyard which made it very quiet, and it had an operable door to a Juliet type balcony that allowed for fresh air, plus a large closet and double-sink set up in the bathroom.

This is the third or fourth time we have stayed at the Corinthia and on prior trips our room was always immaculate and well-maintained. This time, I noticed some maintenance issues. In one of the rooms the hand-held shower piece in the tub leaked all over the floor every time I ran the tub fill; in another there was damage to the Venetian plaster where water had traveled from the shower enclosure to the w/c area. There was also some ""crud"" that had built up in the metal track that holds the glass shower walls together, and some scuffing on the wood surfaces. So, our pretty lady Corinthia is starting to show a wee bit of wear and tear. Still, she is a calm and comforting oasis that we are always happy to return to and recommend.",5,2016,06,27
143,Brunch what an experiance,"Brunch with free flowing champagne, a great way to spend a Sunday lunchtime. They call it brunch but it is a Sunday Lunch with great Jazz and very good food. The service is excellent very attentive and the champagne keeps coming. All in all a great place to go for a meal no rush take your time and enjoy.",5,2016,06,27
143,Exquisite hotel,"Very beautiful hotel and Loved the swimming pool
Too many tables for afternoon tea , the whole area felts very busy
I had an eye infection from one of the pillows unfortunately which never happened before and after",4,2016,06,27
143,Top-Notch Hotel with Beautiful Rooms and Attentive Service,"I spent three nights here in May 2016 and I think I've found a new go-to hotel in London.  The location is excellent -- an easy walk to many of the main attractions and very convenient for a run along the Thames.  While the room itself was small, it was very well appointed, with a comfortable bed and nice linens.  The bathroom was huge -- as large as the bedroom itself!  Reliable wifi and good tea in the lobby topped off the experience.  Very highly recommended.",5,2016,06,23
143,Luxury personified,"This is a beautiful hotel within easy walking distance of the National and British Museums and the Tate Modern as well as Piccadilly and many more sites. Although pricey, the suite was magnificent with a very large well appointed bedroom, walk-in closet and extremely spacious luxurious bathroom ( separate toilet, shower and enormous tub, double sinks with tons of counter space. The staff were extremely helpful and made our stay absolutely delightful.",5,2016,06,23
143,Nearly perfect in every way!,"The Corinthia has it all--location, beauty, class, first-rate staff, and lovely restaurants and bars. We stayed at the Corinthia for 6 nights. Everything--from the size of the room to the luxurious bathroom to the perfect staff--was over the top. It was our first trip to London and we are so glad we splurged and stayed at the Corinthia.",5,2016,06,22
143,Beautiful Hotel and location...but,"Not really up to 5 Star rating.  Had to move rooms because of water leak and mold.  Very inconvenient when you are on holiday.  And mold did not occur overnight...they had to know the room was showing signs of mold.  

When I returned home I was double charged on my credit card.  Just another unnecessary hassle one does not expect at a 5 Star property.",4,2016,06,22
143,Fantastic hotel,"This is a truly great hotel, it's stunning. As soon as you walk in you notice everything is tastefully luxurious. I found the staff without exception to be friendly, attentive and very well informed. The rooms are designed with comfort and restfulness in mind as well as providing touches that aren't strictly necessary but add greatly to the experience and make you smile, like the rain shower, coffee maker and tv in the bathroom. The room was so quite at night, and with the blackout curtains and bag of lavender under my pillow I had an incredibly restful sleep. This was probably aided by a massage and use of thermal spa facilities in the fantastic spa during the day. Superb hotel for a luxury getaway.",5,2016,06,22
143,Slow service and overpriced food,"Went for scones and some dessert. Their selection of desserts falls really short. And priced at around £9 each, I was expecting a reasonably sized portion, however there was hardly anything put on the plate. Garnishes seemed to be more important than anything edible. I wouldn't advise/encourage their desserts. Their scones, however were not bad. Settings are very pretty.",1,2016,06,21
143,London hotel of choice,"A few years ago we made the Corinthia our hotel of choice in London. Everything about this hotel is superlative. Whether it is the rooms, which are some of the best in London with the bathrooms being particularly impressive, the beds which are extremely comfortable, the service which is always incredibly helpful and discreet, or the location which is very convenient for the west end and central London, this hotel is consistently better than alternates. Breakfast in the North Hall is always an experience while the lobby is now one of London's best locations for afternoon tea. Without doubt, this hotel is one of London's best and is strongly recommended.",5,2016,06,20
143,Nice and charming hotel not far from Trafalgar Square,"Superb service. Delicate and cosy rooms with very good beds.
Stylish and handy bathroom. Great breakfast.
The hotel is situated in a great place, not far from the Parliament, Trafalgar Square and many other attractions.

All in all a very nice stay, i got an upgraded room as well.",5,2016,06,19
143,"For the ""well heeled""","I usually stay at The Savoy, however have recently been trying other hotels in central London, and I appear to have hit gold dust.
No annoying tourists taking photos, or doing ""the holiday of a lifetime"", just discreet, well heeled people. I couldn't have felt more at home and comfortable.

It's discreet facade ensures those annoying tourists are kept out is the first good thing, the next is the welcome where reward programs are recognised and greeting is perfect. The rooms are large and very well appointed, the bathrooms are excellent with very good showers. Power points by either side of the bed ensure you can keep your phone by your side through the night.

The bars are excellent as are the restaurants. And the food very very good.

The spa is a wonderful oasis of calm and tranquility in a chaotic, congested city and gives plenty to aid in your relaxation.

I couldn't recommend this hotel more if you're about luxury and subtlety.",5,2016,06,18
143,Perfect London Hotel,"Beautiful hotel, in the perfect location just across the road from Embankment station and we were able to walk to our theatre show too. Really comfy beds, lovely views from the room and a gorgeous spa. Really helpful doormen who took our bags for us as we were in a hurry to get to the show we had tickets for. Only thing I would improve would be to have more gluten-free food options at breakfast. There was gluten-free toast but other than this I could only eat the fruit as the bacon was in the same dish as black-pudding. A gluten-free cereal choice would have been good, but the fruit was delicious so it wasn't a big issue. Would definitely stay again!",5,2016,06,17
143,Best hotel I've ever stayed in,"Everything about the hotel is fantastic: service, hotel restaurants and bars, rooms and location! I first went to the Corinthia a few years ago because I had read that they had a great afternoon tea. When I needed to book a London hotel recently, I remembered that tea. It was delicious, generous (unlimited ""refill"" of tea and sandwiches and probably pastries but, by then, we were too full) and service was completely unpretentious. I decided that, if their tea was that good, that might portend other good things about the hotel. I was right. The location was perfect - you can walk to the West End theaters and many restaurants and, if you need to venture farther out, the Embankment station is right across the street. We were upgraded to a suite and it was spacious, quiet and beautiful. After the theatre, we ate at the Massimo Italian restaurant in the hotel - the food was great. It was very late and there were few patrons but we were never rushed. We spent a different post-theatre evening in the hotel bar. It was also beautiful, there was live music and, when we ordered a second drink, the entire snack selection was replaced with a new set. We ate other meals in the hotel - in the lobby, in an outdoor fire lit space, room service - and each was great as was the service. I cannot recommend this hotel more highly.",5,2016,06,15
143,Best conference hotel ever,"Perfect location, great and spacious guest rooms, fabulous breakfast and huge spa.
I've stayed in quite a few 5-star conference hotels all over the world and the Corinthia topped all of them so far.
The following two aspects have really enhanced my conference experience:
- The food they served during our conference was outstanding and absolutely delicious. This cannot be taken for granted, not even in 5-star hotels.
- The internet works without special codes, is extremely fast and reliable. I think they mentioned they had the best internet in London among all hotels.
Great conference, great stay!",5,2016,06,15
143,Wonderful Birthday weekend,"Booked the Corinthia for a 50th celebration. 

The hotel is within a stones throw from theatre land, so is a great place to catch a show and have a luxuriously restful weekend. We went to see LesMis, which was tremendous.

As we had mentioned the celebration on booking directly with the hotel, the room had been upgraded and we had complimentary champagne and a delicious cake with a Birthday message waiting for us as we entered the room. This was a very nice touch. 

We had afternoon tea in the Lobby Lounge which was lovely. The staff were very attentive and friendly. Breakfast in the Northhall restaurant was very appetising with many options available. I really enjoyed the smoked salmon and scrambled eggs and my partner loved the freshly pressed carrot juice.

We stayed for only 1 night, however we were still able to use the Spa Thermal floor after the noon checkout. If you have the chance, make sure you include this as it is a very tranquil experience. 

This was a very memorable stay and the Corinthia will now be firmly on our list of must do again very soon!",5,2016,06,15
143,Wow! Truly amazing stay !,"Booked into the Corinthia for night of much needed R&R and to experience the Espa Life Spa, and could find no fault at all. Rooms are beautifully appointed with incredible bathrooms. Understated luxury on all levels and attention to detail and service from all staff that is second to none. The Espa Life Spa is by far the best in the UK I have experienced with an unhurried and attentive service from all of the staff and therapists. Quite the place to see and be seen and before long you will think nothing of seeing famous singer/songwriters relaxing in the lobby or bumping into A list celebrities in the lift!",5,2016,06,14
143,Absolutely Exceptional - A TRUE 5* Experience,"I have given the ""excellent"" rating to a few hotels previously and now feel that I over-rated them. The Corinthia hotel was first class from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. The stay had been won as part of a competition, so the cost aspect was immaterial apart from the extras. The staff were first class, the room was first class, the concierge was first class, in fact I could not find anything at all to fault during our stay. The highlight has to be the spa facilities with what can only be described as the 'ultimate' in indoor infinity pools and in saunas. The glass walled sauna has to be seen and experienced to be believed (SERIOUSLY) and with perfectly sized benches on a number of levels, this was WOW. I wish that I had listened to other people and gone there on my first day rather than the day before I left. I urge anyone visiting to make the time to enjoy even if for a few minutes, just to marvel at the design and thought that has gone into this build.",5,2016,06,14
143,Splendid experience during conference stay,"The service is outstanding, friendly and attentive at any time. No queueing at the reception, a staff member is always available to help. Rooms are unusually large for a city hotel, beautifully designed. No open wishes. Restaurants and bars are excellent and glamorous.",5,2016,06,12
143,Amazing service ,"Amazing place, very convenient location and great service. 
It's a real deal in terms of quality/price. 
The spa got me with its different pools and areas. And the gym is a real place to be. 
Breakfast is one of my best souvenir, buffet or a la carte with various possibilities for vegans. 

Walking distance from Piccadilly. 

",5,2016,06,10
143,Spa Weekend,"Visited this hotel for a overnight Spa treat. Complete luxury the whole time. Service outstanding, rooms impeccable and the treatments pure indulgence. Very pricey but well worth the money as a treat.",5,2016,06,09
143,sublime,"I had dinner with friends at the Northall restaurant. The surroundings are so beautiful and staff are very friendly, and don't try to rush you. For starters I had eggs Benedict and smoked salmon with the best hollandaise sauce I've tasted. For the main we had the sunday roast which was just spectacular! I would definitely recommend for Sunday lunch/dinner as the prices aren't too steep and great atmosphere!",5,2016,06,05
143,Amazing Stay made by the Butlers ,"thanks a lot Ana,Linda,and butlers to make easy our family.Hotel near all main attactions.Room well organised and with all amenities. Very clean concept of the room. 
amazing service .
See you next time. ",5,2016,06,04
143,Gorgeous Hotel near London landmarks/attractions.,"The hotel and staff were top notch.  Our suite was gorgeous and the extra tech touches, like heated bathroom floor, 1touch lighting, free wifi, etc. were terrific.  The spa was A+ and access included with our room.  I would recommend this hotel to all my friends.",5,2016,06,02
143,Beautiful hotel,"We were highly recommended this hotel by some friends who regularly stay at the Corinthia. We were it disappointed. 
The check in was quick and efficient and we were given a room upgrade - deluxe. 
The room itself was lovely. Plenty of space, large bedroom area, large bathroom, dressing room and hallway. 
The only drawback for me - where are you supposed to dry your hair! The bathroom which has a large mirror and is well lit has nowhere to plug the hairdryer or straightners in. Only a shaver plug (must be designed by a man) therefore you have to use the bedroom area which means it is not as well lit and you have to make do with a small mirror. Or book into Daniel Galvins!!
I find this really annoying especially when the hotel is a five star. Perhaps the suites are better. 
The Bassoon bar was really good and they had a large selection of cocktails. My favourite was the Whitehall lady. 
The breakfast in Northall was excellent, lots of choices including lovely fresh berries.  
The spa was lovely - pity the main Sauna was closed but otherwise excellent facilities. Unfortunately I didn't have time for any massages etc. but I am sure they would have been wonderful. 
All the staff were polite, helpful and friendly. 
I will return to the Corinthia but I hope they can rectify the hairdryer problem. ",5,2016,06,02
143,Excellent property,"My husband and I recently stayed in a Jr. Suite for six nights.  The location is great for sightseeing.  You can walk out the front door and get a taxi anytime.  The breakfast buffet was excellent, the bars and restaurants had a very nice selection of wine and the food was excellent.  The flowers in the lobby were breathtaking.  I highly recommend this hotel.  We would definitely go back.",5,2016,06,01
143,Romantic get away,"Wow, this is just WOW.  I booked this for our third year wedding anniversary and from the start to the end it was just perfect.  I did not want to leave.  We were upgraded to a beautiful executive room, with a beautiful bathroom and large bath.  There was mood lighting which was very romantic, a large TV.  On arriving we were also asked what time we would like turn down and what newspaper we would like. It's the little details that count.  After dinner in the west end we returned to lavender on our pillows, the curtains drawn, water at each bedside and mood lighting! just lovely.  

The next day, breakfast was just perfect.  The eggs were just right, I asked for a hot chocolate and got marsh mellows, fresh cream and dark chocolate! wow! what a hot chocolate.

Now the SPA- wow wow wow.  You must go.  I had a facial and it was just WOW!! there was a lift on our floor just for the spa and it was located over four floors.  I did not go to the gym but I am sure it is really great too.  

The hotel had a class about it.  The staff were not pushy, they were classy like the hotel. They knew my name, what I was celebrating and just told me anything I want to contact them.  If my husband had his work laptop I would have stayed another night and he could have walked to work! they also sorted me out a good price for the same room for another night but sadly it was not meant to be.

I wish I could go to this hotel once a month for the night, get away from work, have some quality time with my hubby in a beautiful classy place, plus a facial or massage as well!

Just need to book another trip and soon!!!!",5,2016,05,31
143,Exceeded expectations ,"Booked three nights here for my wife's birthday treat and wow, what an amazing hotel. Ok, it's incredibly expensive so you want it to be great and the experience was better than I hoped for. Staff are professional and attentive, service impeccable. We stayed in an executive room that just oozed quality and class. Bathroom was superb. The spa is equally amazing and my wife raved about her facial. Location couldn't be better as everything from theatre land, Covent Garden, Whitehall, London Eye, big Ben are all within a comfortable walk. A real treat and hope to return one day.",5,2016,05,30
143,Superb Hotel near Trafalgar,"This hotel is the best we have stayed in (among 30 or so) in London.  Excellent in all respects.  Rooms are extremely large for London, staff is first-rate.  Food at their Italian restaurant, Massimo, is excellent, as is the wine list.  We will never stay anywhere else in London.",5,2016,05,29
143,Impeccable Consistently,"We head to London about three or four times a year on business trips and were long time fans of the Hotel Sofitel in St. James.  Their spa is wonderful, they treated us super well but we got tired of not being recognized when we return, not getting consistent upgrades, despite all the business we did at that hotel and meetings we hosted.  Around the time we had had enough Hotel Corinthia opened up and we have stayed there and never looked back.  It is BEAUTIFUL. the rooms are amazing, the restaurants are delicious, they are friendly, hospitable, and everything is super.  Spa amazing.  We host small client meetings and their business center is fantastic. Rooms with windows, great catering. Friendly no matter what you need.  We love Northhall and love Massimo - both restaurants are perfect whether date-night, hosting clients, breakfast, or dinner.  They've closed both restaurants for us to host dinners for 90.  And well, the Gin bar or Bassoon - both amazing and making a mean martini whether shaken or stirred.  The beds are probably the most comfortable in the world.  heated floors?  well lets just say that's perfect too.  Whether for business, pleasure, couples, or clients - this place is one of the best in London if not the -best.  I've heard the Rosewood is worth a peak. Will be hard to convince me to leave Corinthia.  The rooms are large, the place is immaculate. The service - we can't say enough.  Run don't walk to this place and when you enter you may just never want to leave despite the fact you're a stone's throw from 10 Downing and a walk around the corner to Trafalgar Square. You are 'away' but central.  It doesn't get much better.",5,2016,05,29
143,London gem,"Very nice London hotel. Price rather at the higher end but you get perfect, spacey room, good selection of room products, fantastic breakfast buffet and also good lunch / event food. Final plus: the location near Whitehall is the unbeatable. ",5,2016,05,29
143,A Very Elegant Afternoon Tea,"After careful research, the Corinthia Hotel was selected for a relaxing and elegant tea service.  The lobby area were the tea was held was absolutely stunning with the Baccarat crystal chandelier sphere, which set the mood of peace and tranquility.  The delicious scones, freshly prepared savory tea sandwiches, beautiful cakes, wonderful range of special teas, Laurent Perrier Champagne, and fabulous service capped off our very restful, relaxing afternoon.  Great memories!",5,2016,05,28
143,Great location and luxury Bachelorette party,"Great stay at Corinthia. It is an expensive hotel, but i would say the best of London. It has very good and professional service, the rooms are wide and good and the hotel is really really nice. If you are looking for great location and luxury experience stay here. I stayed with two friends for my bachelorette party and we had a lot of fun and it was special and really close to everything. ",5,2016,05,28
143,Wow !!!,"On Monday I was fortunate enough to have a spa day at the hotel it was a bday gift 
From the moment I arrived I was blown away
I have been to hundreds of spas but this was def the best by far complete luxury
My day was £225 city escape it was called but worth every penny 
I had 3 half hour treatments lunch and glass of champagne 
Arrived at 9.30 am left at 8 pm feeling very chilled 
Beautiful and truly outstanding 
Even down to the sleep pods 
And the individual shower and  changing rooms 
Roll on
My bday next year!",5,2016,05,28
143,Fantastic experience,"I stayed here for four nights for a mother/daughter trip. We had a room with two queen beds which was what we had requested and perfect for us. Room was very roomy and beautiful. Bathroom floor was heated, towel rack heated, two sinks, tub and shower. Courtyard view which was lovely with small step out balcony. Ordered room service which was good food, great service. Everyone at this hotel was extremely friendly and professional. Location was very good. Close to tube (subway) stop. Had emailed concierge to book restaurants and theater tickets. They were so helpful and always responded immediately. The theater tickets they got us were just terrific seats!  I would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again. Loved the entire experience!!",5,2016,05,28
143,One of the best for afternoon tea,"We visited for a special birthday and were all really impressed. The venue for tea is beautiful in the lobby surrounded by fresh flowers, service is unhurried and while they did forget a few things we asked for the staff were pleasant and happy to take lots of photos for us! The cakes were an absolute delight to look at and to eat. All the leftovers and a few extras were boxed up beautifully to take home. At £55 for afternoon tea and a glass of Laurent Perrier champagne it was fairly good value in fact the non drinkers ordered that tea and the drinkers had a second glass of fizz as the afternoon tea without fizz is £50. I would very much like an overnight stay here...",5,2016,05,27
143,Best Business Hotel ever,"Stayed here 3 times, twice as a guest, once as an event manager hosting a 100 pax corporate event. The service is as impeccable as the infrastructure & design. Top notch staff with a very international touch. Prices are top notch too but if you can score a good rate here it's definitely worthwhile! ",5,2016,05,26
143,Spectacular,I was here for 4 days and the stay was absolutely amazing. The hotel is beautiful. The service is exceptional and the rooms are perfect. Everything about my stay here was great. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a luxurious stay.,5,2016,05,26
143,Lovely hotel,"This was a very nice hotel centrally located. We stayed in a deluxe room for two nights. The room was spacious and very comfortable. Service was very good. The pool/spa area was nice. Breakfast was very good. They had a nice selection. Dinner was good, not great.",5,2016,05,25
143,Outstanding ,"I have been fortunate enough to stay in some beautiful hotels over the years and the Corinthia is as good as any.

""You get what you pay for"" and although this hotel is anything but cheap it exudes  luxury....

First class service, food and attention to detail and although you do expect that at their price point, many don't deliver in the same category.

Highly recommended. 
",5,2016,05,25
143,"Superbly located chic, 5-stars hotel","We stayed for one night in the Trafalgar Suite on a short stay over in London. After arriving at the Corinthia, we definitely wished that we had planned for a longer stay! The hotel is relatively new, opening its doors just 5 years ago, and beautifully located inside a preserved historical building (formerly occupied by the Ministry of Defense) while completely renovated its interior to a modern, chic style. Service is excellent and attentive, and the staff is friendly and engaging. 

Our room is spacious and airy. I was impressed with the large windows (given that it is in a historical building) and how well the natural light lit the rooms (as we were only on the 3rd floor). I loved how big and modern the bathrooms are, and the hotel features ESPA toiletries which are super nice. Little touches like having small table outside each door for newspapers / house keeping pick-ups made us felt that rooms are designed with an extra personal consideration. The bed was very comfortable, and the room was quiet despite the hotel being close to full occupancy. 

Corinthia's location is absolutely fantastic, and sits right next to the Thames. We walked by Westminster, Big Ben and Whitehall all within 15 minutes on a late evening stroll. We used the underground quite a bit as traffic was horrible, and the hotel is just a block away from the Embankment station. 

One thing that we wish we did was to plan for some time at the spa. My husband used the spa to change before our red eye flight out, and reported back that it looked truly magnificent with cool looking sleep pods. I think there was an option to enjoy the pool and sauna facilities without having to commit to a full treatment. Something on the list for our next visit!",5,2016,05,24
143,LUXURY ALL THE WAY WITH FIRST CLASS SERVICE,"My sister & I stayed at the Corinthia for the weekend as part of my 60th Birthday celebrations. Although the hotel is very expensive it is worth it for something special and this hotel is really special.  The rooms are luxurious , food and drink amongst the very best in London, the Spa is the best Ive been to anywhere in the world & nothing is too much trouble for the staff, even last minute special requests. I would return in a heartbeat.",5,2016,05,23
143,"Great hotel, but no means the best!","Had a great stay at the hotel and lived up to its reputation. Have stayed in many hotels and this ticks all the boxes however I wanted to be a little more amazed than I was. Swift service, bar staff were a little stand offish in bassoon but all in all a good stay. ",5,2016,05,23
143,A true five star experience ,"The Corinthia provided the best combination of service, amenities, food/drink, and location we've ever experienced all wrapped into one. The location is perfectly central for many sightseeing activities in London (walking distance to Big Ben, Westminster, London Eye, etc.) and every square inch of the property is exquisite. The lobby, the restaurants, the rooms, the courtyards - all beautifully done. The service was hands down the best I've experienced at any hotel in the states or abroad, the food was outstanding, and all of the small, thoughtful touches here and there truly make your stay one to remember. ",5,2016,05,23
143,"Wonderful hotel, great staff team","Recently stayed one night at this beautiful hotel. From the room, to the Spa to the food - everything was perfect. We had a really good time. The service and friendliness of the staff were absolutely spot on. Location is great too. We walked everywhere. Slightly interrupted sleep due to a noisy function in the ballroom with bass beat travelling up to the room but reception team was really helpful and sorted that out, after which we slept really well.",5,2016,05,23
143,Absolutely superb.,"We have just arrived home from a weekend at this fabulous hotel and there really aren't enough superlatives to adequately describe it. From check in to check out the staff were without exception extremely customer orientated. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a suite - without doubt one of the nicest rooms we have ever stayed in and we have stayed in some top class hotels ! The receptionist accompanied us up to the room and talked us through everything, very impressive indeed. The suite was huge, comfortable in the extreme, and catered to our every need. We ordered room service which was delivered swiftly and cooked to perfection. Breakfast was excellent, good choice both hot and cold. We didn't have time to use the spa facilities - but we will the next time we return. Definetely the best hotel we have stayed in on our trips to London.",5,2016,05,22
143,Just the food,"I was lucky enough to be bought the ""Safari"" package at this frankly amazing hotel. £75 gets you Prossecco on arrival, a course in each of their three restaurants and a cocktail to finish. 

The Italian mixed starter was enormous. A mix of charcuterie and warm dishes. The main course choice was excellent (I had the lamb. Magnificent) Dessert under the fabulous chandelier in the lounge bar was amazing. Lead from room to fabulous room by excellent, attentive staff, this was definitely a night to remember. Throw in a smoking area with outdoor fireplaces and sofas and you can't go far wrong. 

",5,2016,05,22
143,Amazing,"I've stayed here a few times and I feel like I'm in heaven the minute I walk through the door. Everything from the service, to the bedroom, bathroom, buffet breakfast, incredible spa... In-room dining. It's all completely worth the money and, in my opinion, the best hotel in London. I've stayed in loads of hotels and this is the best by far. Can't wait to come back!",5,2016,05,21
143,Fantastic,"Beautiful restaurant with perfect food and perfect staff. 
Couldn't be better. 5 *****
Entre, main and dessert together with the wine list makes a impressive impression. 
Stoning and professional served plates makes the whole experience totally full. 
Want to come back. 

",5,2016,05,20
143,Very impressive,"Booked a one night family package with two inter connecting rooms for my wife's birthday. Arrived on Saturday, car was valet parked and bags came up to the room straightaway. The kids were given sweets and treats and a cuddly toy which was a nice touch. My wife also had a small birthday cake and card in the room. We had afternoon tea which was very filling. One small criticism was that there wasn't a child specific menu at the tea but the staff were very accommodating and made jam, cheese and ham sandwiches for them when asked. Room service food was excellent as was breakfast. Kids loved the spa the next morning. Would definitely go back. Staff were very friendly and helpful when we had a minor issue of a smell of smoking in the room. Great customer service.",5,2016,05,17
143,My Home in London,"A really top hotel in all aspects. Outstanding rooms, classy restaurants and, last but not least, cosy old-fashion afternoon tea. A bit pricy, but with frequent imaginative promotions to save some pounds. Among the very best hotels I have ever been ... and I already booked a few more nights for next July !!!",5,2016,05,17
143,Our favourite hotel,"This was our second stay at the Corinthia and the experience was ,yet again, second to none. We unfortunately could only stay one night due to work commitments and celebrated our 24th wedding anniversary a couple of days early. From check in where we were upgraded to a junior suite to late check out everything was perfect. We managed 2 visits to the beautiful pool area and felt very relaxed, remarkably quiet for a Weekend. And the staff were extremely helpful, especially when my husband lost his fit bit. It was quickly found and kept for us ready to pick up. The bar service was excellent  - wonderful cocktails, and both the standard of breakfast and service was very good. All in all we had a wonderful anniversary and will be back as soon as we can make it. Thank you to all the staff, you do a fantastic job.",5,2016,05,15
143,Wow,"I was treated to a night at the Corinthia for my birthday a couple of weeks ago.  It's up there with the very best hotels that I have stayed in and certainly would be my recommendation for a luxury stay in London.

Firstly it's beautifully located, in between Trafalgar Square and the Thames, a stones throw from Downing Street.  You get the feeling of old historic London all around you here.

The rooms are stunning, with big comfortable beds, huge walk in rain showers and big baths with TVs.  

The star of the show however is the Spa.  The heated marble beds in front of the fireplace are so relaxing I struggled to stay awake.  Add to that the steam room, amphitheatre sauna, huge jacuzzi pool and first class massage and you have one of the best Spas in the South East of England.  To have it located in Central London makes it truly special.

This hotel is super expensive, and out of the reach of most for a long stay.  However it is worth it even for a single night as a special treat, you won't regret it.",5,2016,05,15
143,Best Hotel I have stayed at.,"We stayed there for 3 nights during the Rugby World Cup.  Quite simply the best hotel I have ever been fortunate enough to stay at.  First class rooms and service, excellent location, and an unbelievable spa and pool area.  Its very pricey but if you can afford it, well worth the money.  We will certainly stay again if we can next time we are in London.",5,2016,05,14
143,Very welcoming,"I recently stayed here with my mother, sister and nephew in a family room
The hotel was lovely and staff were all very friendly.
I loved the spacious bathroom with tv over the bath.
Very nice complimentary toiletries provided and the room service was delicious all food was to a high standard. Lovely perk that children under 2 eat free and provided with their own toiletries, dressing gown and bear.
The swimming pool was open for 1hr for families on the Sunday morning which again was a nice touch.
I would definitely stay here again.
Less than 1min walk from embankment station so easy access to all London!  ",5,2016,05,13
143,"Gorgeous, stylish, impeccable!","This really was the most wonderful treat for my friend's birthday. One day and night in town at this amazing hotel.  Great choice of bars and restaurants, do you don't even have to venture out.  There is even in interior garden which was perfect last weekend with the lovely weather. Our bedroom was spacious, beautiful decor and exquisite furnishings and the most amazing bathroom with an enormous oval marble bath in the centre.  But to top all of this I would say that the service was brilliant in every area of the hotel and the staff are warm, friendly as well as being very professional.  I have no hesitation in recommending it if you are looking for a special experience.",5,2016,05,11
143,Class ,This is a very classic Hotel .. Room was very big .. Lobby was nice ..you can see flowers everywhere which was lovely..I had only one night there but it was worth it.. The location was perfect and the area was good.. I would recommend it for those who seeks class ..,5,2016,05,10
143,WOW WOW WOW,"My wife and I stayed at the corinthia for her birthday, and we had an executive king room.

I could list all the things that were great about the hotel but the honest answer is everything was great......this is best uk hotel I have stayed in.

You absolutely must stay here if you can!!!!!",5,2016,05,10
143,One of the best 5-star hotels we have stayed in,"We were very impressed and happy by the way they greeted us when we arrived early in the morning after a long flight from San Francisco to London, especially when they offer a resting room (a nice regular room) for us to use before our room was ready... very nice touch and very friendly and helpful staff.  The Spa with the swimming pool and the other pool at the hotel was one of the best we have seen.  The location of the hotel is excellent being close to the underground stations (Embankment, and CharingCross), Strand, the Trafalgar Square, and being next to the Golden Jubilee Bridge with the Queen's walk, the London Eye, and the Waterloo Station just across the bridge. Theatre's and attractions are just nearby either by walking or with the convenient of the Underground and buses.  We stayed there for 6 nights and are very pleased.",5,2016,05,09
143,Perhaps The Best Hotel in London,"My wife and I spent a week at this hotel. 
The rooms are large for London and are all modern and up to date.  Yet, this hotel is an old building that in years past was used for the Defense Ministry. 
It is located a very short walk away from The Embankment tube station, which makes it well located for transport as well as for walking to key parts of the city.
My favorite part of the hotel was the formal dining room where the daily breakfast is served. Lot's of light as a result of the huge floor to ceiling curved windows.  
In summary, it is a very classy hotel.",5,2016,05,08
143,Another 5 star blissful stay at the Corinthia,"I think this was my 10th stay at the Corinthia and it never disappoints. It scores high on all levels for me - the atmosphere, the staff, the rooms, the food, the SPA - all tremendous. The spa is reason enough to choose Corinthia over most other options - it's magnificent.",5,2016,05,07
143,Pure perfection,"We stayed at the Corinthia in March 2016 for my partner's birthday and had a superb stay. As we were due to arrive late on a Friday evening, I booked a table in the hotel's Northall restaurant purely for convenience and wish I'd eaten there sooner! The food was amazing and the level of service provided by the restaurant staff made it a very memorable and special birthday celebration. They could not have been more helpful or professional. Our Executive King room looked out towards Trafalgar Square and it was spacious and very comfortable, with a large bathroom. The evening turn down service was a nice touch and the hotel was spotless and luxurious. Quite simply, the Corinthia is THE hotel for great service, beautiful surroundings and a wonderful stay. Yes, it is pricey, but you really do get what you pay for. Worth every penny and can't wait to return.",5,2016,05,05
143,If you want the best then this is it. ,"My wife Vivien and I celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary here, from booking in we were upgraded to a beautiful bedroom with a complimentary bottle of very fine champagne, chocolates and fruit. A most amazing bathroom with twin basins a huge bath and a separate and extremely powerful rain shower. The bed was large and extremely comfortable. 

The spa has to be one of the best that we have ever been to do try it it is quite breathtaking. 

It is very rare, to NOT find, anything at all wrong ie staffing, cleanliness or things broken or not working. The Corinthia is the best of the best. 

Enjoy your stay and I hope this review helps you all. ",5,2016,05,05
143,Outstanding experience,"I stayed here for at least 50 nights whilst on a work secondment to London and the experience was exceptional:

 - unrivalled service
 - spectacular interiors
 - large rooms with frequent free upgrades to reflect loyalty
 - utterly luxurious and a great night's sleep
 - the best gym and spa facilities i've seen in a hotel (usually empty in the evenings)
 - high quality room service
 - great location

I will be delighted if I get the chance to visit again in future.",5,2016,05,04
143,Beyond expectations,I absolutely love this hotel the room was great especially the TV in the bath :) but the spa was even better way beyond my expectations . Food a bit pricey but then it is a 5* hotel and tasted delicious Looking forward to my next visit :),5,2016,05,03
143,Truly amazing place...,"Stayed at this hotel for a weekend while we went to see Phantom of the Opera at Her Majesty's Theatre (5 min walk away). The staff were really friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble. We parked our car up at the hotel main entrance and a concierge came to collect our car. We had our luggage delivered to our room and after a trip up The Shard and a lovely meal at Gordon Ramsey's Union Street Cafe, we arrived back at our room to slippers and sleep spray for our pillows. The bed was extremely spacious and comfy and the surroundings are quiet and peaceful at all times. The spa is amazing, we didn't want to leave. So relaxing watching the fire on the heated loungers. We would definitely recommend and return to this hotel in the future, couldn't fault a single thing :-)",5,2016,04,27
143,"Couple of visits, beautiful hotel, first stay better than second","We stayed at this hotel twice to celebrate special occasions. Our first visit was back in 2014 and the next in 2015. It's a shame there's not a 'good' option for stars as although this hotel is in no way average I also don't feel some aspects are very good. 

Lobby -  Service is friendly and surroundings very comfortable. Afternoon tea served as very nice and ok value. Breakfast after the main restaurant stops is also very handy and service good.

Bar - Cocktails in the bar are good also but lacking in atmosphere as it never seemed busy (may have been the time of year of our visits).

Rooms - on our first stay we loved our room, it was spacious, beautiful and we were very happy. We were told on arrival we'd been upgraded to the same room type (executive king) as we had previously but the room was smaller. We queried this with reception and on coming back to me they said they couldn't find a record of our previous stay and tried to say it was the same. I then informed them they couldn't find it in my current name as the previous booking was in my maiden name and so they looked again and offered to show us an alternate room. We felt rather insulted that our word wasn't taken and was disappointed in the service related to this. It delayed the start to our trip as we were waiting around for the best part of a couple of hours for it to be addressed which is a shame. 

Spa - lovely. The ladies are very welcoming and ensure you know where everything is. Booking is very easy, had lovely ladies helping with reservations before our stay. Friendly, treatments good and pools relaxing. Also plenty of water available which is good. 

Location - excellent. We love this area of London and have stayed at various hotels in the area and always wanted to try the Corinthia. Very easy access to embankment or charing cross tube stations and easy walk to many iconic places. 

Overall - for the price tag I don't feel we got value and overall the service wasn't what I'd expect from a 5*. Not bad enough to say this gorgeous property is average but it's unlikely we'd return for a 3rd visit.",4,2016,04,27
143,"""Best Hotel in the Heart of London""","If you have been to London, you know how the culture and the iconic landmarks make it one of the most incredible cities in the world. After a full day of exploring the capital's varied points of interest. you can bet on always returning  to the one of the most enchanting and elegant hotels in all of London if you happen to be staying at Corinthia.  Whether you want to enjoy an afternoon tea, or a drink in the beautifully decorated lobby, you can be be assured that the service and ambiance will exceed all your expectations. We stayed in a deluxe suite with a connecting room  that comfortably accommodated a family of four including two kids who always leave a mess. The beds are so wonderfully comfortable that we slept in every single day during our one week stay. Thankfully the hotel is so perfectly situated that we literally just had to walk a few steps from Trafalgar Square and hop on the tube from the station. Also, we got an extra edge by booking with WhataHotel! . By doing so,  Full English Breakfast for 2 each day was free and we received an £85 credit on food. Although a relative ""new"" hotel on the scene, those seeking the best can book this property w/o hesitation.",5,2016,04,26
143,Excellent in every way,"We stayed five nights in a junior suite, paying as much as we ever have anywhere, and loved everything about it. The suite had a small sitting area in the foyer and a spacious bedroom. The closet was as large as a few bathrooms we've had. The bathroom was another great space, with enclosed toilet, separate shower and tub and double sinks. We found the service as attentive as expected and the meals in the restaurants excellent. The location is very good, close to many historic sights and the Thames; to be so close to Trafalgar Square, it's remarkably calm. The cost was extravagant but it's London and this hotel was worth it.",5,2016,04,25
143,Amazing,Stayed here with my family of four for three nights in a deluxe junior suite. We have stayed at many 5-star hotels throughout the world and this tops them all.  Best service.  Best spa.  Best hotel restaurants (food and service).  Best buffet breakfast.  Best hotel bar.  Best concierge.  They exceeded our every expectation.  The hotel was also reasonably priced for a London Hotel as we got a third night free promotion through the hotel in addition our Platinum Amex benefits.  We will definitely be coming back again and again.,5,2016,04,25
143,Didn't want to leave...,"We stayed at the Corinthia Hotel for the weekend and we had the such a lovely time. Our room was a perfect size and the bath was deep and large with a flat screen TV. The breakfast was incredible. It was probably the best hotel breakfast i have ever had! It had everything from pieces of honey comb to plump sausages to dim sum!!! The spa was also an absolute treat! It was very well laid out and had a very modern Scandinavian feel to it. We were also allowed to use the spa after checkout!!! 
We also had a cocktail in the Bassoon bar, again a very enjoyable experience! We will definitely go back! ",5,2016,04,24
143,Mega! including the prices,"Fantastic hotel, great location. Recently stayed at the Corinthia when attending a function at 8 Northumberland Avenue, with a quoted room rate of £290.00 including breakfast. (Special negotiated rate as part of the function). Not too bad for a 5 star hotel in central London, with a rack rate of £485.00 + breakfast @ £36.00 per person, one might think? Now I spend half my life in hotels all over the world and was some what surprised to discover for the first time ever 20% VAT added to the quoted room rate at check out.  The Corinthia is a lovely hotel, the staff are very polite and attentive, but beware if you have not got deep pockets or a very generous expense account you could be in for a nasty and painful shock when you come to check out.",4,2016,04,24
143,Underwhelmed,"We enjoy staying in the elegant, timelessly classic hotels in London, especially in Mayfair. However I was intrigued to see this highly rated Corinthia. We went to have tea in order to see the hotel and get a feel for the style. 
The building itself is beautiful. Great architecture: a very well-preserved building. I love the street on which it's located because it is far enough from Trafalgar Square that you still feel as if your in a tranquil area. (In fact, when we were thinking of staying here I was annoyed they referred to a particular suite as a ""Trafalgar Suite"" and then admitted it was impossible to see the Square unless you landed a suite on the top floor.)
I was heartily underwhelmed by the entrance/lobby/public space which other reviewers refer to as having a ""wow factor"". Well I suppose if glitzy and gaudy are the definition of whatever this ""wow factor"" is, then it's the right phrase of course we are all entitled to our opinions but garish lighting and tons of marble do not translate into the type of elegance one would hope to find behind that lovely facade. 
The main tea area, where we sat, was generic and forgettable. Between the glitziness and unimaginative decor I felt as if I was in a very grand commercial hotel that caters to groups. However, I felt I should give it a chance: it was raining and the doormen gave us a pleasant welcome. 
I was really let down by the slow and disconnected service in the tea lounge. The women in charge were lackadaisical. It took forever for them to sort out where we would sit. My son ordered a special hot chocolate drink that was supposed to come with marshmallows and whipped cream and some other treats. These treats were missing entirely. The server set down a cup and pot and disappeared. The chocolate was actually barely warm. It took quite some time before I could get the attention of the staff. The person who came over found it impossible to understand that we needed some hot milk to add to the chocolate. As well, she could not grasp that all the special extras for the chocolate were missing. I must say for a top hotel I find it exceptionally surprising that no seasoned expert manager is minding the space! All the wait staff were just hanging around the service station and paying no attention to the guests. I really found it hard to believe a humongous Las Vegas-style chandelier is more important for attracting customers than for fine service. It's said the standards one expects at such an hotel are non-existent. Sloppy. I was finished with my excellent cappuccino before they sorted out my son's hot chocolate. I recall having something to eat, but honestly, the surprisingly bad service is all I can remember. I know many people enjoy the glossy, hard product such as the gadgets, the fancy chandelier and lots of electronic gadgets (In the rooms). But I am sold through great service. There really is no excuse for careless and inattentive service at a top rated hotel when all that's required is a hot drink to be served as described on its menu and as ordered. Very disappointing.",3,2016,04,23
143,Stunning premises .....Service is a huge let down....just not 5 Star,"Room is Fine - very well presented and no fault issues .....
Our experience of service on the other hand is simply dismal 
1. From check in it takes forever to get your luggage delivered up ......but when it does arrive it comes with a sea of apologies 🤔
2. Dinner again very well appointed dining room , order cocktails before dinner which arrive after our starter arrives & in the term the waiter comes to pour wine before you get your cocktail 🤔 order M/R steak and it arrives rare , again they are very pleasant and apologise but it takes 15 minutes + to get my meal returned by that time I was eating alone 😞 which defeats the idea of ""family meal"" , they did apologise , and issued standard cream desert with  compliments  which we would never have ordered ....
The manager did not see it important enough to make his own way to our table until I made suggested in a very discrete manner that he was not very professional as he was presiding over the restaurant ! - they did remove the meal from the bill ... Which was not what I wanted ....what I wanted was to have a successful meal with my family which I was more than happy to pay for.....but apparently ""Apologise"" is the new sorted ....

I can say the staff are pleasant but I won't be back.",4,2016,04,23
143,GORGEOUS PROPERTY IN CENTRAL LONDONThis hotel,"This hotel is a beautiful property located in the center of London next to Trafalgar square and within walking distant to Buckingham Palace, The London Eye and Big Ben.  Several tube stations are nearby  if one desires. There are also lots of pubs and restaurants nearby
The hotel is modern, with an extensive spa , weight room and pool. You are welcomed to the property by 2 impeccably attired doorman.
The rooms are well appointed with Wifi, espresso machine, the bathroom has a tv in the wall and a huge rain shower. Plush robes and slippers are included, if booking a family room, there is a separate dressing area.
The buffet breakfast is extensive with every food imaginable, so it is definitely worth starting the day with
I thought that this was a fabulous hotel modern yet classy. I recommend highly",5,2016,04,21
143,Unbeatable location ,"A lovely hotel in a unbeatable location for staying in London. Located just a stones throw from Trafalgar Square. If I could afford to I'd stay here at every opportunity! 

Very convenient for travelling around central London, with tube stations close by. Also an abundance of buses passing every minute of the day. 

Would highly recommend if the price tag does t put you off! ",4,2016,04,20
143,Amazing!!,"What can I say, this place was amazing :) we were very lucky to have been treated to one nights stay with evening meal and spa access with one treatment. 
The spa was amazing!! The staff were very friendly, it was clean, very relaxing. I had a facial treatment and my partner had a massage. Both girls were brilliant so good I fell asleep during mine :) 
The room was perfect, clean and everything we needed. 
The meal was very tasty only disappointment was that a bit more cake for dessert would have been nice lol 
My partner and I slept like a rock so so so peaceful. 
Not much more I can say really, it is the best hotel I have ever stayed in :) and if someone was treating me again I would stay again, but I personally couldn't afford it :-/ 
Staff overall were very pleasant, friendly and helpful. Thank you all staff that looked after us :)",5,2016,04,20
143,Perfect for a family birthday treat,"Thank you for a wonderful stay at this beautiful hotel, to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday. I booked a family room for us and our two children, aged 8&12. Everything was just perfect, and they loved wearing their robes and slippers! I had been here for afternoon tea before and have been dying to stay ever since. Compliments must go to all the staff, who are all so friendly and helpful, everything we did was made so much more special by their lovely service. From those on check-in, to serving lunch in the Lobby Bar, those showing us and the children to the pool area (a big plus that there is family-friendly time in the pool, another reason for our choice), and all those helping with housekeeping/room service, particular mention to Robdan (hope I spelt it right), who was particularly friendly, thank you. The birthday cake and sweets for the children delivered to our room were so lovely. And service for breakfast on Sunday was also exceptional.
I had booked on the special rate, which definitely made it excellent value, and my husband had a treatment in the eSpa spa, which he loved. 
Thank you all for a wonderful stay x",5,2016,04,18
143,Great Place,"This place is fabulous!!  From the doorman, to front desk, to concierge all the way to the room.  It is beautiful, comfortable, clean and safe!! With the opulent chandelier and beautiful floral centerpiece, it was very welcoming from when we first arrived and each time we returned.   It is in walking distance to many restaurants, shopping and the London Eye.  Everyone is very friendly and Ivan was especially helpful with giving us information of getting us around. Everyone was even friendly to my boys. The patio area was nice and comfortable with the heat lamps.",5,2016,04,17
143,A visit for late Afternoon Tea with tea and/or champagne,"My friends arranged our tea here. First time for me and my husband.
What a beautiful lobby. The tea time was wonderful.  Great selections of tea sandwiches and wonderful dessert choices.  Very generous with offerings. 
 Each of us tried a different tea, as well as champagne.
Everything was very nice.  A memorable dinning experience for us all.",5,2016,04,17
143,As close to a perfect London hotel as you can get.,"I've lived in London for nearly 20 years and travelled past the Corinthia on the train to Charing Cross more times than I can remember, but never ventured inside. This changed when I decided to book a night's stay as a surprise treat for my other half's birthday. From the moment we arrived we knew we were in for a treat. 
Reception was stunningly appointed with fresh flowers, high ceilings, interesting art & furniture and had a gorgeous welcoming aroma of relaxation. The staff were friendly, hyper-efficient and keen to assist with anything from dinner recommendations to things to do in the area. 
Our room was on the fourth floor, a Deluxe King, looking out on Northumberland Avenue, facing the Playhouse Theatre with views to the river beyond. I've stayed in a fair few hotel rooms in my time, but this was way up there with the best of them. You could tell that someone had properly thought about every detail. From where the power points should be, to the clever little panel of light switches on each side of the bed with their soft blue lights. The free wifi was incredibly fast - 180Mbps download and 225Mbps upload speeds were consistent throughout our stay. The bed itself was superb, one of the best night's sleep I've had in months - beautiful soft linen, a lightweight but warm duvet, plump pillows and a mattress that wasn't too soft or too hard. Perfect. 
The bathroom also clearly had thought put into it. The tub was huge, perfect for two (we checked) and had excellent water pressure and temperature. The shower was also big enough for two and, unlike too many other hotels, had properly installed drainage. What I mean by that is that the water drained away quickly down the sloping tiles to the drainage hole, rather than pooling around your feet when the slope isn't installed correctly. A pet hate of mine. There was an extensive selection of Espa bathing products to use - all of which we did... and they were gorgeous. 
The room had a Nespresso machine with a range of capsules and fine tea bags for making a cuppa, and there was a lovely silver platter with three crisp Granny Smith apples for a snack. 
The hotel's spa is definitely worth checking out. There was a special lift straight down to it from our floor, so you can change in your room, stick on the provided robe and slippers and head straight down there. We had access to the Thermal floor which was stunning. A fairly large swimming pool, excellent vitality pool (aka a huge fancy jacuzzi), steam room and sauna (which was unfortunately closed when we were there). There are also three marble heated loungers which face a beautifully hypnotic real flame gas fire. If you lie on one, the warmth will gently ease away any stresses you have and, if you're not careful, send you to sleep. 
One word of advice - if you want to chill out and relax in peace and quiet then check which time you go to the spa. They allow children at certain times of the day (10-11.30am and 3-4.30pm I think) and when we ventured down there during one of those periods it was noticeably a lot noisier.
I'm afraid I can't comment on the restaurants or bars within the hotel as we had already planned to eat out elsewhere on the night, but we did have the English breakfast which was included in our room rate. We ordered it to be delivered to the room between 8.15-8.30am, and at 8.15 on the nose there was a knock on the door. Great service. We had a selection of stunning Danish pastries and croissants, freshly baked, and a full English cooked breakfast of sausage, bacon, scrambled egg, black pudding and tomato. Delicious, and a perfect portion size. 
Overall, I can't fault anything about our stay at the Corinthia, it's utterly deserving of its five star status. The whole place is immaculately kept, the staff are exceptional, and there is an air of calm throughout. It's not stuffy or overly formal, but relaxed and confident in everything it does, and everything it does is flawless. The only flaw was my own - for not booking more than one night...",5,2016,04,17
143,Reliably excellent,"My goto London hotel.  Easy access to the tube, river and major attractions.  Excellent breakfasts.  Attentive staff.  Conceirge services are also excellent.  This stay was in a Trafalgar suite.  These suites are very spacious with two baths and a separate dressing area with a large walk-in closet.  Views are uninteresting, but the room size and comfort make up for it.  The only view rooms at this hotel are located in a handfull of rooms on either side of the (spectacular) River Suites, which offer views of the river and the london eye. 
I've stayed here multiple times without a single misstep.  Highly recommended.",5,2016,04,16
143,Great restaurant ,"We were invited to this hotel for dinner by friends. Despite knowing this area well I had never realised that there was a hotel here. So firstly great location right by Embankment. The service was impeccable, discretely efficient. As for the food .. Well it was first rate",5,2016,04,13
143,Hidden Gem,"The Corinthia is indeed a hidden gem in the City of London. The service and facilities of the hotel are exceptional added with the fact that it's a superb neighbourhood. One thing that needs to be tried out is the buffet breakfast and the afternoon tea. The spa and pool area, will titillate your senses. Did i mention the bath room floors are heated? Yes they are! Not experienced that in any other hotel.",5,2016,04,12
143,Outstanding ,"Everything you expect from a top class 5 star hotel in central London. Room was perfect, and staff fantastic. Its location is perfect forgetting about whether it's seeing the sights or visiting all your favourite restaurants. This was the 4th time we've stayed here, and look forward to returning again.
",5,2016,04,11
143,A great choice for business or pleasure,"We just completed a 6 night stay in two connecting Executive rooms. We were traveling with our two children 10 and 11 years old. The rooms are spacious and immaculate.  The service was impeccable and breakfast was great...as usual.  Great central location, great spa, and great service.",5,2016,04,10
143,Great hotel in Great Location,"Location..Location!  In a very safe area (next to the Police H.Q.), within  a few minutes of walking to Trafalgar Square, Piccadilly Circus,  Houses of parliament, Big Ben, London Eye amongst other top attractions. This is a very contemporary hotel and all the public areas as well the rooms are well designed in light colors so it doesn’t feel stuffy as other London’s luxury hotels. 
Rooms are big by London’s standard, extremely comfortable beds but be careful when selecting your room. They have several layouts for the same room category such as the Deluxe Jr. Suite which in the hotel’s website is shown as having a separate desk/study area next to the entrance: my actual Deluxe Jr Suite didn’t have a desk so it was rather inconvenient to use the main coffee table (which was already crowded with a lamp, etc) to work on the computer.
Overall service is good and friendly especially the concierge team. (Zoltan & Sergio.thks!) 

I really liked their restaurants and public spaces especially The Northhall for both breakfast and dinner;",4,2016,04,10
143,Beautiful spacious hotel in Central London,"Such a great base right by the river & 10 minutes walk to theatre land. Love this hotel, beautiful common space on the ground floor to sit & have a drink or tea. They always have spectacular flowers & you can't help but smile when you see them. The staff are lovely & the Italian & the English restaurant are equally as good as each other. ",5,2016,04,10
143,The perfect luxury place to stay in the heart of London,"My husband and I had a very relaxing stay in the luxurious Corinthia over Easter weekend. Finished and maintained to an extremely high standard, the rooms are very well fitted, the spa has the best sauna and jacuzzi I've ever been in and the impressive public rooms, bars and restaurants have a wow factor worth exploring, yet maintain a friendly and relaxing atmosphere which make them comfortable and welcoming to chill out in.
If you can tear yourself away from the facilities, the hotel is perfectly placed for all the tourist attractions, walks along the river, exploring the Royal parks, taking in a show or shopping trip or any number of exciting adventures Central London has to offer.",5,2016,04,09
143,What a Fab Hotel,"I had the pleasure of staying at the Corinthia Hotel the end of March 2016.  What a beautiful hotel with something for everyone.  The Lobby Café/Bar is a great place for afternoon tea, breakfast in the morning or just to meet a friend for a drink.  The chandelier is gorgeous and one of a kind.  We had an Executive Double Double room with a marble soaking tub in the middle of the bath area.  Separate Stand up shower and separate toilet area, the floors were heated which was very nice when getting of the shower.  Off of the lobby is an out-door lobby with a fireplace at each end and heater all around where those who smoke my have a drink and enjoy a smoke at the same time.  Really nice.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for high-end and lots of class!!",5,2016,04,08
143,Amazing,Was told about the spa/salons at the corinthia hotel so decided I'd come along to try it out.. .Had a great welcome and it's a beautiful hotel...the staff were very friendly and patient with me as I forgot my locker number (sorry).. The sauna spa was really nice and I think it may have been the best massage ever my back feels great :) Thank you so much. I will be telling my friends and will be back soon. ,5,2016,04,07
143,It's the little things that make a great hotel.,"Long wanted to visit and it's a simply stunning hotel, beautifully designed with wonderful friendly and smiley staff. Lovely spa and gym and Northall restaurant was great. Position is great everything we wanted was in walking distance. This is certainly up there with the best hotels in London.
Why have I rated only very good? Well there were a few niggles with the housekeeping in our otherwise beautiful  room. I am not in favour of listing everything on Tripadvisor, but I contacted the hotel directly so they can improve the almost impeccable service and I am sure on my next visit it will be excellent. Do not hesitate to treat yourself.",4,2016,04,07
143,Best Jazz bar in London,"The best kept secret for this Hotel is the Jazz Bar.  The staff are very professional,and friendly.  good drinks, I would recommend the ""Moscow Mule"" and live singer.  always welcoming what ever time of night you arrive.",4,2016,04,07
143,Afternoon tea as it should be,"We enjoyed a Champagne afternoon tea in the Lobby Lounge on a Saturday lunchtime.  We were discreetly and politely informed at the beginning that we could only have the table for two and a half hours - it was a good job they told us as we could easily have stayed all afternoon!  Six varieties of sandwiches were served to us on our own individual plate and they were so delicious we opted for just a couple more each.  Then came the most delicious scones I have ever tasted - two each.  Normally I would just eat one but this time I ate both.  The 'English Tea Fancies' were amazing, not only did they look fabulous but they tasted fabulous too.  Any you don't eat you can take away with you.  I opted for Orange Blossom tea and the pot provided enabled me to enjoy four cups of this delicious tea.  The Lobby Lounge itself is calm, serene and visually very pretty and the chandelier is a thing of beauty.  The afternoon tea experience was perfect - delicious food, tea and champagne in a tranquil environment.  Service was just right - food and drinks served to you and then you were left to enjoy.  I don't normally return anywhere in London for afternoon tea as there are so many hotels to try but I may make an exception with the Corinthia.",5,2016,04,05
143,AMAZING!!,"Well.... What can I say... I'm Speechless! This hotel is one of the nicest places I have stayed! And I feel like I've stayed at all the top name brand resorts. The customer service is beyond anything that I've experienced! I used the concierge for pretty much everything... From our tour of London for a party of 12- was awesome!, to tea and all dinner reservations, the concierges even went out and purchased Easter baskets for my 3 children. Although we only stayed 4 nights.... We tried to experience as much of the hotel as possible... The spa was very nice and the pool for the kiddos was amazing, even if they do have certain hours that the kids can swim. The rooms were oversized with expresso machine in all the rooms and they were able to accomodate a connecting room for my kids. The bathrooms were great, with a decent size shower with great pressure from the rain head. 
The hotel restaurant- North Hall was great... They even made my little boy a pizza even thou it wasn't on the menu. I honestly don't have one complaint or suggestion for this hotel (which is a first)... I now know why Mariah Carey was staying at the hotel, because it's the best!  So if its good enough for Mariah, it's good enough for me! :)",5,2016,04,04
143,One of London's most luxurious hotels.,"Top class in this very well located area of London. The decor is modern classic - very very nice and original, starting with a huge lamp in the lobby, it looks really spectacular.
The Spa and pool area is modern, impressive and fun - with a glass covered Sauna next to the pool. Our room was very spacious and very confortable. The staff is quite profesional and efficient and  looking impecable. Great bar area - restaurant.
You can walk to Trafalgar Square and the National Gallery -  3 minutes. Also you are walking distance to London's Eye, Westminster Abbey - The Big Ben, 10 Downing Street, Piccadilly Circus, Soho area.",5,2016,04,03
143,Stunning for a business lunch,Ate at The Northall restaurant midweek and it must be one of the finest locations in the city for a business lunch. Impeccable service and stunning food. Certainly pricey but worth it for the ambiance and superb food. The Dover Sole (off the bone) was the freshest I've ever eaten and was cooked to perfection,5,2016,04,03
143,Couldn't fault a thing! ,"Stayed here for two nights with my partner. From start to finish there was nothing I could fault. The staff couldn't do enough for us and we're always extremely friendly. The room was amazing! We had a balcony on the courtyard (room 129) which was lovely. The little touches before bed was great (chocolates, lavender spray etc) the whole hotel smelt Devine and had fresh flowers everywhere which I loved. The spa is to die for so relaxing but the sauna was out of order unfortunately. There was plenty of choice for breakfast just with the buffet alone. They also had an a la carte menu which I didn't get chance to try. The decor through the whole hotel was finished to perfection and the hotel itself is very central for all your sightseeing needs. We will definitely be back!! ",5,2016,04,03
143,Amazing spa. Good food. Nice staff,"We use the Spa a lot however, this was our 1st stay here. We got a deal for £399 per night without B/Fast which was good considering the use of the Spa alone was £150pp. 

The Room was cramped, however, clean with all amenities to hand. The Bathroom was really nice - with the best Bathtub I've stayed in - bar one I stayed in Langham's in Thailand. 

Overal, very nice hotel. Will be going back. ",5,2016,04,03
143,Excellent Service. Excellent Location,"From the moment of my arrival this hotel delivered. Other than having been allocated the wrong room category at check in- the issue was resolved promptly with a generous room upgrade. 

Room was sizeable and the bathroom very generous with huge walk in shower.  Breakfast was a little mixed- the dining room is rather hectic and the greeter/seater is a little officious and business like about ensuring you are aware, in detail, what you are and aren't entitled to have with your room package.  This could be done a little more discreetly- but it could just be a cultural thing with the Polish lady sounding a little more abrupt than she might otherwise! 

Common areas of the hotel are beautiful- flowers in entrance a particular highlight.

Check out was great. 

On top of all of this is the benefit of the hotels location, which is so central that it means sightseeing is a complete breeze as so many attractions are slow close. 

Throughly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,04,01
143,Perfection ,"Words cannot describe how incredible this hotel is.  It is perfection in every way possible.  I cannot think of one bad thing to say.. I traveled here for business and enjoyed every minute of my stay here - except the jetlag :) 
The room was spotless and the bathroom was heavenly.  I did not want to leave this hotel.  Turndown service was the best I have ever experienced and the chocolates on the bed were delectable.  As I am writing this I wish I was back there right now.  if you ever have the opportunity to stay at this fine hotel, please do.  You will not regret it.",5,2016,03,31
143,Lovely staff and good food,"Yesterday I went for a drink and dinner at the northall and really liked the experience. Lovely staff and good food. superb rooms, spa and restaurants in a great location in Whitehall.i was Very impressed",4,2016,03,31
143,A real GEM of a hotel in London,"I've been visiting London dozens of times through the years and have stayed at hotels all over the city - but I now know the hotel that will be my ""home away from home"" in the future.  Hotel has the most incredible location, walking distance to Trafalgar Square, Piccadilly, Regency Street, West End, London Eye - you name it and you can get there on foot!!!!
Along with the location, Corinthia Hotel has one of the best trained staffs I've met in years - from the doormen to reception to porters to room attendants to butlers (if you're fortunate to stay in one of the awesome suites).
The restaurants are excellent - most especially the wonderful breakfast along with champagne.
And the spa is OTT - beautiful ambiance with pampering to match.
Do yourself a favor - stay at the Corinthia the next time you're in London - you'll never want to stay anywhere else....",5,2016,03,29
143,Stunning,Exceptional hotel! Amazing architecture and design! Amazing luxury and opulence! Lovely staff too. Excellent location! No better place to stay in London! Turns out Mariah Carey was staying at the hotel too.. need I say more?!,5,2016,03,29
143,"Outstanding Service, Stunning Hotel","From the moment you enter the Corinthia you feel welcome and relaxed. 

The concierge service is impeccable and exceeded our expectation. We mentioned we were celebrating our anniversary and our concierge, Giulia, upgraded our room and even surprised us with cake.

The room itself was faultless. Our executive suite had the most glamorous oval, marbled bathroom with central oval bath and TV. The room was beautifully decorated. Housekeeping was also faultless and the turn-down service included lovely extra touches.

All staff from the doormen, the bar and Massimo's restaurant are helpful, curteous and professional.

There is not one weak link in the chain in this hotel. You can feel the pride in every area and we cannot wait to return.",5,2016,03,28
143,"Fantastic concierge, excellent service and beautiful flowers","The location of this hotel is fantastic as far as seeing the sights in London.  My 12 year old son and I spent a week at the Corinthia over spring break.  The room was spotless, large bathroom with a heated floor and plenty large enough for the two of us for a week.  The concierge went above and beyond in arranging activities that would be interesting for my son and in finding restaurant recommendations that would accommodate his limited palate but be interesting enough that I would still enjoy the dining experience.  In addition, the service is unparalleled.  The housekeeping staff found a diffuser for their hairdryer (not common and if you have curly hair, you know its a necessity).  Also, the first night it appeared that part of my contact lens case had been thrown out by housekeeping (it hadn't, it was misplaced and we found it the next morning), the staff apologized, and went out and replaced my contact lens case (it was 9 p.m.) and generally could not have been nicer or more helpful.  I highly highly recommend this hotel and can't wait to return.",5,2016,03,26
143,"Cigar Humidor, new garden lounge","We went to the Corinthia to finally discover the new garden lounge and its cigar humidor. We have met Manu Harit the cigar manager, few years ago at the Bulgari Hotel and after meeting him in cuba this year it was high time for us to pay him a visit.  we're not surprised to see perfect Raws of precisely aligned cigars when walking in this stunning humidor. 
It was great to see manu fitting perfectly in his environment and having fun with the many cigar tables at the time. This is definitely a true cigar destination. The collection developed is impressive and hopefully will grow. 
His assistant, Martin was of great help as well and the two showed us that the cigar world isn't for old chaps like us. 
Well done Corinthia for creating a cigar culture in such a short period of time. 
We will come back.",5,2016,03,25
143,If you want a hotel to relax and feel special then the Corinthia is for you,Enjoying our stay . The staff is pleasant and very accommodating . Their flower arrangement in the lobby and in the corridors creates a very relaxing atmosphere for the guest. If you want a hotel to relax and feel special then the Corinthia is for you.,5,2016,03,24
143,"By far, my best hotel in the world","I had a pleasure of staying in this hotel for 7 nights recently.  This hotel was perfect in every way. Communication with the hotel before staying was prompt, and very efficient.  Checking in was a breeze.  You go through the spectacular lobby with modern glass chandeliers and take the elevator to your room.  My room, they gave me an upgrade to junior suite, was spectacular.  We had a walk-in closet of the size where you could have put a small bed in there; it served us nicely for the seven day stay.  The decor was very refined, and oh the bathroom!  Carrera marble floor was heated throughout, rain shower was to die for!
Location, as it turned out, was as good as it can be.  We were 5 minutes walk to Trafalgar Square, but it was very quiet.  Right outside was Embankment tube stop.  We would walk to theater area and to numerous restaurants, and many major sites, such as London Eye or Westminster Abbey were within walking distance. 
We had buffet breakfast or room service every morning.  It was pricy, but my rate included it.  Couple of nights, we had glass of wine sitting in front of fire place in the lobby.  I used the spa, which is included in the room rate, almost every night.  After a windchill day of sightseeing, the steam sauna and jacuzzi would soften my weary muscles.  
I have stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world, but this hotel tops it.  I would return here in a heartbeat next time I am in London.",5,2016,03,23
143,Almost 5 star,What a beautiful hotel and service was so attentive.  Suite was first class and very so comfortable.  One bad experience took a star away.  A false alarm fire alarm went off just before 7 am.  requiring the entire hotel to evacuate.  Supposedly it never happened before.  I feel a 5 star hotel would have offered complimentary breakfasts to the guests for their inconvenience.  The hotel decided instead to quote the importance of safety.  Not quite sure what that had to do with a false alarm but I suppose in the mind of hotel management it was a reasonable and economical excuse.,4,2016,03,23
143,Outstanding - a perfect stay!,"We stayed for one night as part of a birthday trip to London, everything was just perfect, lovely room, comfy bed, cosy underfloor heating in the bathroom, lots of space for suitcases, along with plenty of mirrors and plug sockets for getting ready.  Everything was perfect, I'm picky and could not fault a thing!  

We also had cocktails in Bassoon which were delicious.  

We will definitely stay here again when next in London for leisure, I just need to find a 'Corinthia' in every city we visit. ",5,2016,03,21
143,A fabulous hotel. But...........,"We stayed one night at the Corinthia as we had an awards ceremony to go to that evening. We checked our luggage in early and went into town. When we got to our room, after having a few drinks in the bar, it was fabulous. Beautifully decorated and very well equipped. We were really looking forward to a nice relaxing time in the room before getting ready to spend the evening in the Gherkin. Now for the but. Our luggage had gone missing and we were just about to go to a black tie do. Cut a long story short, our luggage appeared with 45 minutes to spare. So much for a relaxing stay! We had a bottle of good Champagne waiting in the room for us as an apology but this didn't make up for our disappointment. We had apologies from the staff that seemed a little insincere. Breakfast was wonderful and we then checked out. Whilst signing for my bill (which was wrong) and paying £135 for half a dozen drinks I had another apology. After our experience, you may question why I have scored the Corinthia so highly? This is because every other aspect of our stay was magnificent but was let down by probably one individuals stupidity. All in all, a fantastic place but keep your luggage with you at all times.",4,2016,03,21
143,Great hotel and amazing Spa !,"Stayed at this hotel on business. Hotel was great easy access to the Strand and stone's throw to Trafalgar Sq. The room was lovely and hotel staff really nice and friendly. You get free wifi and the hotel has a lovely central lounge where you can sit, relax and sip champagne or have afternoon tea. The spa is the best in London ! 4 floors of sheer relaxation. Night-time turndown Service is excellent ! Staff are helpful.",4,2016,03,21
143,Beautiful hotel,Beautiful luxurious hotel in a very central location. The bathroom had a heated floor and heated towel rack and a wonderful deep tub as well as a beautiful shower. The bed was super comfortable. We were able to easily walk to the tube stations and to the London Eye area. We will definitely go back.,5,2016,03,19
143,Amazing...,"This is a stunning hotel, decor is superb with a nod to tradition yet clean and modern, staff are impeccable and seating is comfy and clean, unlike similar hotels of similar grade.  Try the Champagne flights - well priced, superb champagne and well balanced with a good overview from the staff - can't praise this place enough, a must go venue every time I am in London",5,2016,03,18
143,Simply stunning! U must use the bath & the spa!,I have had the pleasure to have stayed in some of London's best hotels and the Corinthia has simply so much class to it. it is also of my opinion that its spa is most probably the best in Europe. I have been back since and will continue to do so.,5,2016,03,15
143,Stay here all Christmas/ New Year 2015/2016,"One of the best hotels we stayed in, great staff and service and decoration, we stayed for the whole Christmas here (stayed in different suites) and basically have seen everything in this hotel. I love the lounge area and the entrance/ the jazz bar is a bit too tiny and packed to my taste - Spa is good but bit small but overall for sure 5 stars :)",5,2016,03,15
143,A hotel at the very top of it's game!,"I recently spent two nights at the Corinthia Hotel London which exceeded my expectations on all levels. I've stayed at the Corinthia Budapest, another outstanding property, so I knew this would be nice stay. My room was upgraded from an Executive King to a Junior Suite upon check in, and included a beautiful fruit basket, Nespresso machine, separate tub (with TV) and shower, along with the most comfortable mattress I've ever experienced in a hotel.

The spa, hotel lobby & restaurants were all beautifully decorated & comfortable.  My favorite hangout was the bar in the Northall Restaurant with great bartenders, great drinks and good food.

The hotel location is excellent within a block of the the Embankement tube stop, close the Thames, and within close viewing of the London Eye & Big Ben.  

As much as i enjoyed the rooms, lobby, spa & restaurants, it is the terrific staff, from the doormen, to the front desk personnel, to the servers that make all the difference.  This hotel is clearly one of the best in London and at the very top of it's game.  

Well done Corinthia Hotel London!",5,2016,03,14
143,Superb Accommodations | Avery Eisenreich,"The hotel is located in the West End and is very close to Trafalgar Square, South Bank and the Houses of Parliament. Free WiFi is available in the lobby as well as in the rooms. From check in to check out, the staff was very friendly and helpful and ensured my stay was nothing less than perfect. The room was spacious and well-kept with a magnificent view of the Thames River.

Avery Eisenreich",5,2016,03,14
143,Awesome hotel- Cannot wait to go back,"From the moment we stepped through the doors at CorInthia Hotel we were transported to pure luxury. I was taken here for my 40th birthday and I would not hesitate to stay here again. We were checked in by Jason and he showed us to our room. We had been upgraded due to us celebrating and we were given a suite. It was truly stunning and everything about the suite was beautiful. From the Nespresso coffee machine in the room to the tropical rain shower and underfloor heating in the bathroom, it was stunning.

We are not the sort of couple to frequent these sorts of hotels day in day out and it must have taken quite a bit of saving for my other half to save up to take me here. I can honestly say we were not made to feel any differently to anyone else in the hotel. 

We sampled room service which was excellent and we also had breakfast in The Northall which was lovely. This restaurant was beautiful and we are glad we made the effort to have one meal in the hotel.

We sat in the Court Room courtyard area and it was beautiful with the heaters and open fires at either end.

The location was perfect for us, just a short stroll to Westminster, Trafalgar Square and right round the corner from Embankment tube station.

One point if staying here, the smell in the hotel is absolutely gorgeous. It smells the same as the shampoo bottles they leave in the rooms, Bergamont, Jasmine & Cedarwood and I am desperate to replicate this smell in my humble home lol xx

Thanks for reading and any questions ask away 😀",5,2016,03,12
143,Northall Restaurant,I went solo to the Northall Restaurant at the Corinthia Hotel for dinner.  The service was impeccable. The food was absolutely delicious.  The salted caramels which were complimentary with coffee/tea were to die for.  It was an outstanding solo experience.  The only improvement I would make is to the lighting - more candles I think to make the space more intimate and a little lighter at the tables.   I should add that the Bassoon cocktail bar is also outstanding and if you chance upon it on a night when the pianist is installed at the piano (built into the end of the bar) you are in for a treat. It is a place where you can lose track of time very easily. Try the Whitehall Lady cocktail... ,5,2016,03,12
143,Lovely hotel with one or two imperfections on this occasion!,"This was our fourth trip to the Corinthia; we love the hotel and the location is perfect for all the places that we enjoy visiting. We have stayed in a number of different rooms and all have been beautiful but this time it was not so good.

The room was very small, not necessarily a problem, however, we were struggling with wardrobe space as the dressing/wardrobe area was very short of space and we had lots of bags with us as we were going overseas straight after this stay. The bigger issue was with the plumbing, we had a bit of a flooding problem from the shower and there was quite a bad odour coming from the shower drain which was there constantly. We reported it to reception who said that they would arrange to have it looked at, which they did during the afternoon when we were out. Unfortunately, the odour persisted and while it wasn't a deal breaker, it wasn't great for a 5 star hotel. Also when we returned, the room hadn't been made up and there were wet towels all over the bathroom floor which wasn't great. In fairness, we were offered a different room but we had a lot of baggage with us and we didn't feel like we wanted the bother of moving.

We also had a strange moment of returning to the hotel one evening and not being able to find our room! A fire door had been closed with two rooms behind it and you couldn't actually see the numbers to suggest your room was even there, all very odd, finally we managed to get someone to help us. The management very kindly sent us a bottle of champagne to apologise so good service recovery.

The following day we mentioned that we were having a few 'niggles' during our stay and we were assisted in getting a table for afternoon tea which otherwise would have been full to us without the managers intervention. 

We have also noticed a few problems with the standard of food at Massimo's, a lovely restaurant, great atmosphere, great wine but food, not so good lately, I ordered the chilli infused pasta but to be honest it was quite hard and very bland. Not good value for money.

All in all, we love the Corinthia, I am sure we will stay again on our next visit to London but it would have to deliver to a 5 star standard otherwise we would probably look elsewhere thereafter. 

Great spa, great staff but compared to our previous visits felt a little let down, hopefully it will be better next time.",4,2016,03,12
143,superb,"I just spend 2 nights at the hotel, the rooms are spacious,modern and luxurious.

The gym and spa are also excellent,

The  reception was also attentive and helpful.
I will recommend this hotel as one of the best hotels I have stayed in London.

My only disappointing aspect was the food I had at their Italian restaurant, although the service was excellent my fish was tasteless, but probably one should not order fish at an Italian restaurant.

I did have drinks, breakfast and snacks at the hotel other restaurants and they were all excellent.

The service throughout the hotel is exceptional.

I would recommend this hotel without any hesitation.",5,2016,03,12
143,My new favorite,"This was my first stay at the Corinthia, but it certainly will not be the last. Everything about this luxurious, superbly-run hotel pretty much knocked me out. I particularly liked the location; a short walk from Trafalgar Square, but on a quiet street mostly devoid of traffic. The public spaces are arrestingly handsome, from the soaring, light-filled lobby with its Baccarat chandelier to Massimo, the stunning restaurant bar with its dramatically striped columns. Really, I just wanted to move in permanently. 

Our 5th-floor room had every comfort imaginable, starting with an entrance foyer complete with twin coat closets. The bedroom was spacious and included a table with two chairs that could be utilized for both work and in-room dining. The huge windows opened for fresh air. Our spacious bathroom, with its heated marble floor, included a large soaking tub and a large shower stall fitted with an amazing rain showerhead. 

Our only disappointment was not being able to spontaneously enjoy afternoon tea in the lobby, following a brisk walk in the cold. Apparently the Corinthia's smart lobby is the place to be and be seen, so advance reservations are necessary. 

Breakfast in the high-ceilinged Northall Restaurant is a treat, with the ability to offer off a menu, or indulge in the self-serve buffet, which offers most anything you could possibly be in the mood for.

In the early evening, don't miss having drinks at Massimo, where waiters distribute complimentary plates of incredibly delicious antipasti. Careful, or you won't want any dinner!

Over the years I've stayed in many of London's top hotels. The Connaught, Claridge's and the London Rosewood all get top marks from me. But my new favorite hotel in London is definitely the Corinthia.",5,2016,03,11
143,Very disappointing,"I treated my daughter to a stay in the Corinthia for her birthday present.  I booked a deluxe room because they had pink decor on the website and it is her favourite colour. I wrote and specifically asked for this. When they arrived they were given a horrible green room.  I feel really annoyed as it was a special occasion. They also took full payment when they arrived and then accused them of not paying and my son in law had to show them his online banking to show it was paid by debit card. They were really embarrassed by the attitude of the front desk staff especially as it was done in front of other customers. Also no apology was given when they were proved right which annoyed them even more. 
My family have been staying in the Ritz in London for twenty years and have always had all requests honoured with friendly staff and no problems. Unfortunately  l chose this hotel because l thought they would enjoy the spa.  I am really disappointed and a junior suite in the Ritz would actually have been cheaper. Never again. ",1,2016,03,09
143,Birthday trip,"Came here for my birthday and the hotel itself is beautiful. Was shown to our room and we had requested the pink version of the executive king but instead got green. Didn't complain it was still nice. Next day we visited the spa which is lovely then when we were heading out of the hotel asked for an iron and board to be sent to the room, when we returned hours later no iron and had to go back down to reception to ask again. 

When we checked in we paid our bill in full so checking out should be simple enough. When we got to the desk they wanted the full balance again. Had to show them the bank app on the phone with the large sum being taken out on our first day. They said no thats not right we had only been here one night and stood and argued with us that we had not paid or been there for two nights in the same room. 3 of them round the computer making us feel like we had done something wrong with a queue of people behind us all listening! Very embarrassing.

In the end we had paid in full and had been there for two nights so instead of an apology we got 'thats that sorted then!' 

We asked for our bag to be kept for a few hours before returning to the airport then called the hotel to say we would be coming in a taxi and could they have it ready, this was too much to comprehend so in the end we just had to let the taxi run and go in and get it. 

A very lovely hotel but not 5* service on check out which I see a few people have mentioned (with the exception of the door men who are all lovely and friendly). We won't be back.",3,2016,03,09
143,Best lunch menu ever!!,"The most wonderful experience from the moment we walked in and left. Amazing food, great service. Jacob made us feel welcome. Thanks to kitchen! Hilly recomend it to everyone as had a really greate time. Family friendly!!",5,2016,03,08
143,Love this hotel!!!,"Amazing place,stylish,quiet,the best hotel spa I've ever experienced! Used the beautiful pool and hot tub every day! The entire staff are so warm and helpful! Liked this location so much cleaner and more mellow than most off London yet all the big sites are an easy walk away! Ate there and thought the food was great and the restaurants are beautiful!",5,2016,03,08
143,5 star all the way!,"WOW, could not have been better service, location and overall stay.  Loved all of it and the spa was one of the best experiences ever.  Wish I had more time.  If wanting to visit London and have a first class experience, this is it.  If you have AMEX platinum or black, the deal was fantastic and included a wonderful breakfast (restaurant or room service) daily and a resort credit.  Could not recommend this hotel more.  Worth the extra.",5,2016,03,07
143,Perfect in every way,"From the moment we pulled up to the curb, to the time we left to return to the airport, each and every detail was perfect. We weren't familiar with the hotel, but friends of ours who travel to London often recommended it. It is centrally located and you can easily get to most key attractions. It is close to the Embankment and Westminster tube stations and a 2-minute walk from the River Thames.

The check-in process was efficient and friendly. The lobby was outstanding with the most incredible lighting fixture as the main attraction. They have a lovely little courtyard with a fire place which was appreciated considering the cold weather. Our room was beautiful, very large compared to the small rooms you normally find in the City. The bed was comfortable, all furnishings were beautiful, and the bathroom was gorgeous with heated marble floors and a big bath tub. My only complaint was the lack of space for clothes storage as the ""walk-in"" closet was quite small and there were barely any usable drawers/shelves. 

We enjoyed a drink in the bar each night - they have live music, a great vibe as it's always busy, and good interesting drinks. We had breakfast one morning, and although extremely expensive, it was well done and we were spoiled for choice. We didn't have a chance to eat dinner in either restaurant but they looked welcoming.

Service is top notch and there is no request they can't handle. You will pay handsomely for it, but for a quality stay and pure convenience this hotel is a great option. When we come back to London we will stay here - we enjoyed it that much!",5,2016,03,07
143,Mesmerising,"I didn't expect much initially, as the name didn't quite match what I thought would be like Four Seasons et al; however I was most amazed by what Corinthia had to offer. Simple things are of the highest quality; the bedroom slippers, the ESPA toiletries, the shoe shine, the flowers in the room by the in-house florist totally floored us, they also kindly packed it for us; the concierge is most helpful giving tips on where to park in Knightsbridge. I didn't mind the valet parking as it makes more sense to pay £55 than to look for parking around the parking lots around the streets and one had to pay significantly more if moving in and out from the place, we unfortunately paid £39 more 4 hours parking near Westminster parking bay area, and then used the valet parking. 
The breakfast menu could be better improved for children's menu; we didn't see many children, we had a 4 year old who got a soft toy in the room. Fruits were abundant. The ESPA spa and gym and swimming pool were great, just be aware of kids only swimming until 11.30am. 
Otherwise, a superlative stay. Thank you to all, especially Gaby from Costa Rica at guest relations. You are a gem helping my wife and I and would not be forgotten for your kindness.
Service is exemplary with afternoon tea.",5,2016,03,06
143,Simply the best!,"We stayed few times. Seamless customer service everywhere (reception, concierge, restaurants, spa, in rood dining...). Good food, amazing spa, rooms are better (size, comfort, facilities...) than majority of London's 5 star hotels, convenient location. Once you stay at Corinthia you won't be looking for other places to stay in London.",5,2016,03,06
143,Trafalgar suite ,We stayed in the lovely Trafalgar Suite for the weekend. Great spacious room with nice modern decor. The hotel itself is in a great location and is very luxurious inside. The cocktail bar is great to stop off for a night cap after the theatre. Breakfast in the morning was ok. The food was great but I would prefer if the waiters wrote down the order to ensure of the correct details. It's never great to have to wait for half your breakfast while the other half goes cold. ,5,2016,03,06
143,Amazing central London hotel with fabulous facilities,"I have stayed in the Corinthia many times over the past few years and it keeps on getting better, we just had the most wonderful weekend celebrating an anniversary there. The hotel is housed in the most incredible building in central london, the architecture is stunning, it has a couple of great restaurants and bars and an incredible spa. The staff are excellent and cannot do enough to make you feel at home. The interiors are, in my mind, the best of any hotel in London, I struggle to find anything negative to say. 
True luxury in beautiful surroundings.",5,2016,03,06
143,A Very Special Hotel ,"Where to start - we checked in to the Corinthia yesterday as a special treat to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday. What a treat! The Corinthia is out of this world.  For a start, the service is incredible. From the moment we checked in we received first-class treatment (thank you Daniel at reception!) We were given a complementary upgrade and asked whether we would like a late check out. When we got to our room, we were greeted with a bottle of champagne and chocolate cake. The room itself was stunning and included everything we could possibly need from a walk-in wardrobe to bath tub, nighttime lavender sachets and sheets so divinely soft I actually wanted to take them home with me!! We spent most of the daytime enjoying the spa which a treat not to be missed (recently featured in Tatler  spa supplement as the number one London spa). The spa, which spans 4 floors, includes a well equipped gym, sleeping pods, jet pool, saunas and steam rooms and fabulous treatments. Every little detail has been thought through and the result is magnificent. My only complaint about our stay here is that it was not long enough! I can't wait for another special occasion to come back again.  ",5,2016,03,05
143,"Incredibly fancy, spa is unbelievably opulent","Fortunately for me, I din't have to cover the bill for my 5-night stay there, however I was very happy to be staying at Corinthia!

Attention to detail was amazing. Room amenities were first class, turn down service very classy, cleaning immaculate, the way the sorted out my mess and made the room very flash each day, etc.  It was very top notch indeed!

I had dinner in Massimo one night.  A beautiful pasta diner and the wine list is to die for.  I had wine by the glass and the recommendation was spot on.

The highlight has to be the Spa, spread over 4 floor with a special 'spa lift' in each corridor.  I can not imagine a more opulent set of surroundings than in this place!  So many hot, cold and ""in between"" options, immaculate changing & storage facilities, multiple chill out zones, great snacks & drinks and brilliant fresh fruit available, sleeping pods, beautifully designed ceiling lighting and projections, mood lighting and ambient sounds spot on, high quality ammenites for when changing back into street clothes, very attentive and pleasant staff without being stuffy/posh, etc.  I could go on and on! I (maybe quite obviously) haven't experienced this type of spa very often before so I was blown away by how fancy and perfect this place was.

Problem for me is that I only got time to visit the spa on my last evening there.  I would have loved to have been able to visit the spa daily!

If  you want a treat, stay at Corinthia and use the spa (a lot).",5,2016,03,04
143,Can I move in please? ,"Spent a night here for my husband's 40th. Cannot say anything negative or critical about the hotel, the staff or the spa (that's a first). 

We were warmly welcomed and shown to an executive room (we got a complimentary upgrade). The room (322) was a good size the bathroom impressive with its floor to ceiling tiles, very large shower and bath with a tv in the wall for long lazy bath tub days. I was surprised that there wa even a separate wardrobe area with sash window and mirrors inside and out - not your standard hotel wardrobe area. 

No noise issues at night from guests or from traffic/road noise. The King sized bed was comfortable and we slept very well. 

If I wanted to be really picky - because others may want to know - there is no iPod docking station so you can play your own music or charge phone. We have had this in other hotels of equal quality. But really, it's not fundamental to my decision whether to book again or not. We intend to spend one weekend in London every year now and Corinthia will be our spot.

I have to give special mention (and thanks) to Guilia for her warmth and kindness. She made such an effort and she is a credit to the hotel industry. 

The spa was amazing - it certainly is impressive if not a little overwhelming at first. But don't panic, it doesn't take long before you know your way around and find all the facilities. The sauna was particularly impressive set in the centre in an all glass enclosure. Those wanting to do laps may be disappointed that the pool is not very long - but that wasn't an issue for me as I had plenty to keep me occupied. When I was exhausted from relaxation, I got a warm towel, wrapped it around me and curled up on one of the beds and had a snooze. It was hard to believe I was below bustling London! ",5,2016,03,02
143,Anniversary visit,"We returned again to the Corinthia (this is where we stayed when we got married at the Royal Festival Hall) so the hotel has very special memories for us both.  We have stayed here since but on this occasion specifically asked if we could have the same room, facing the Thames under the O in Corinthia was the clue I gave them.  They did the rest of the work and found the room we had on that special day.  The bathroom is stunning with bath in the centre of the room and a TV and sound system to totally relax with.  We had a wonderfully fruity bottle of wine (very reasonably priced at £27.00) and enjoyed the complimentary nibbles in Massimo between 1800 and 1930.  A quick walk to settle the food and then back to Bassoon to work our way through the cocktail menu.  Although the bar was very busy (function in the ballroom) we were found a table quickly and had our first cocktails whilst quaffing, chatting and people watching whilst the band played on...After numerous wonderfully mixed and varied cocktails we left just after midnight.  We rose early on the Sunday and made our way down to the thermal floor for some swimming and other treatments to relax ourselves before breakfast in Northall.  The room itself is light airy and was busy but not too much so.  We opted for the self serve breakfast which gives the chance to sample many other items we would normally, even the Dim Sum which I am advised by someone who prides himself on food from that region, was some of the best he has tasted.  Full and contented we returned to our room for a final bath and late checkout which gave us the opportunity to make the most of this special stay.  Many thanks to all at The Corinthia for making this return visit so special.  We will return again later this year to what has to be one of the best London hotels and certainly the best spa and thermal floor areas.",5,2016,03,02
143,Stunning hotel in the heart of London.,"Before I discovered Corinthia I tried a few five star hotels in London, (including Mandarin, Montcalm, St Martin lane, and few other boutique hotels). They are good hotels, but none of them clicked. 

With Corinthia it was different. It was love from first site. I don't know other places that are as luxurious and perfect and yet make you feel like you at home. Everything is amazing about this place. The location. The restaurants with extraordinary breakfast. The rooms. The quick and professional service. The spa to die for (the only comment I have to the management of spa is to put a sign near entrance to the sauna for guests to use towels while using sauna. Unfortunately not every person knows this simple rule and the smell in there is not fresh and woody anymore.)  

I can't imagine staying in a different hotel when I visit London. Stunning!",5,2016,03,01
143,It has to be love!,"We totally felt in love with this hotel! It is located in a very central area, close to soho , Covent garden, Trafalgar Square ,not far from mayfair and knithsbridge. Gracious service: porters, receptionists, housekeeping outstanding. 
Delicious breakfast in the comfortable room: lots of space, beautifully decorated. Love the shower that feels like a warm rain.... Good soaps and the best hairdryer ever! We love it! Hope to be back soon! ",5,2016,02,29
143,Superb,"We stayed here for my Daughters hen weekend, arriving on the Friday, very welcoming staff and plenty of them so no waiting,  three of us shared a room which was plenty big enough to accommodate us comfortably, everything we needed,  lovely bathroom with TV and floating remote :-) breakfast was very good, plenty to choose from. 
Saturday we had champagne  afternoon tea , just amazing, lots of different teas to select from , sandwiches a'plenty and refilled before the the cakes came out, again beautifully done, well presented and pretty to look at  as well as tasting delicious, they also didn't need reminding that one of us was vegetarian and one had an allergy those came out completely separate, very impressed. 
We had cocktails in the bar in the evening, again can not fault the service or the drinks. 
We made use of the fabulous spa facilities  including the sleep pods :-)
We also treated ourselves to hair appointments during our stay, all in all a very memorable stay, I would not hesitate to go back to the Corinthia, in my opinion a fabulous hotel. ",5,2016,02,28
143,Premier Hotel in London,"Checked in this hotel to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  Informed management the reason of booking and we were happy to be upgraded to a junior suite and was surprised to have anniversary cake at our hotel room.  Concierge were approachable and friendly.   We were ushered to our room and was oriented with different facilities of the hotel.  Hotel is picturesque, immaculately clean and recently renovated.  Room was huge with modern facilities eg. Entertainment showcase, heated floor and even a flat screen television in bathtub. Breakfast was good which offer delicious portobello mushrooms.",5,2016,02,28
143,"Opulent, comfortable, great value, and little known.","In the hotel there are two restaurants: an Italian, called Massimo (which is so, so)  and the Northall. It's the Northall you go to. At first glance it looks unaffordable. But it is such good value. The range of food you can eat there extends from burger and fish and chips to extensive a la carte. The burgers are about £20.00 and presented beautifully and taste sublime.  The only plate that was not great was the steak tartare, anything else I have ever chosen is pretty much as good as it gets. The service? As close to perfect as you will ever get.",5,2016,02,25
143,Betwix Christmas escape to a gem,Our 2nd visit to this home from home. A true 5 star gem.  The standards never change in this hotel. Warm & welcoming & food glorious food comes to mind when we think of the Corinthia.  Breakfast is the most important meal to start the day & it certainly lives up to the high expection. The choice is endless. The rooms are spacious & the beds are enveloping & cosy. The bathroom is of beautiful marble tiled film star standard with 2 wash basins & a bath for the deepest longest soak ever with quality espa toiletries.  A must visit is the secret garden to enjoy another secret the luxurious Hot Chocolate served in a large chocolate pot & beautiful matching teacup & saucer.  Not forgetting Espa thermal floor. Spending time in here is relaxing & good for the soul.  Thank for resorting the balance. x ,5,2016,02,24
143,Fantastic hotel,"I got engaged here this month, everything was fabulous. 
While we Stayed at the hotel we used the spa, hairdressers & also had afternoon tea. 
Never seen an Indian or Chinese breakfast in a hotel in the uk before, temped to go back just for breakfast select alone. Yummy! 
This hotel Should be a 6-7 star ;)",5,2016,02,24
143,Disappointing.,"Really small room, tiny desk with almost no working space. Shower barely fits someone slightly taller than average. Service is polite though not particularly friendly. Would only recommend if you have a special rate, not worth premium for these rooms.",2,2016,02,24
143,Fabulous hotel,My favorite hotel in London!!! Third visit in three years. This hotel has amazing service from the second you walk in to the doorman opening your door to the fabulous flower arrangements that awaits you is just amazing. we have had afternoon tea in all the favorite places but the Corinthia tops the list. The rooms are very spacious and they have the best spa called ESPA. My favorite spa. Love this place and will return next year.,5,2016,02,23
143,Impressive hotel,"Stayed here for just one night. The check in is seemless I was able to check in early which is really helpful. (Thomas) at reception even escorted me to the room which I think is a nice touch. We had one of the smaller rooms which was enough for our needs nice big bed and toilet area is very well equipped.
One thing the only place I could find to plug the hairdryer in was by the bed at 5""2 I'm not tall and I struggled to look in the mirror they have. It would be great to have a plug point near the mirrors in the wardrobe.

On checking the room out we discovered some parmesan cheese in the mini bar and a pair of jeans in a draw... No big deal to be honest but we rang down as we worried (1) it was someone else's room or (2) had it been cleaned at all. The ladie came and collected the items we were then rang and apologised so much! I have to say the room was impeccable cleaned if not for these two items.! However a guy I can remember his name but he was from Ohio... Came up to the room took us to another room which was an upgrade and considerably bigger as an apology of course we took this! 

We went to the spa ( which I will review later) came back we have a bottle of Laurent Perrier champagne to big bottle of water and two massive plates of fruit all because of the small error! I was super impressed there was no need but yet they went above what they needed to do..

The spa

This is a a beautiful spa!! I had a 90 massage she literally made me dribble on the floor. They have sleep pods to a mum of two very small children my eyes lite up at the prospect of lying in a dark room with a small fire in a secluded pod all by myself! 
They have a pool extremely large hot tub style pool steam room and sauna. It's excellently decorated and very relaxing!

The only con I would say is the service at breakfast considering how the hotel clearly as service expectations this clearly falls far off the mark.

The have a lovely buffet to choose from and a large menu to order from. We sat for around 15 mins before I finally had to get up and ask for tea. We also ordered at the same time. I asked for black pudding and some other items of the larger menu and he said well you just go to the buffet from that ...( it's at the buffet but can also be ordered) so I waited for my breakfast then got up and got myself some black pudding all a bit stupid really! We also ordered toast we never got this at all. We finished breakfast and ordered a latte we sat with these dirty plates for a good ten mins before we decided to get up and leave a drink the latte somewhere else. They weren't rude or anything perhaps just not very organised perhaps it would be better if the servers were given a certain area and certain tables to be in charge of And perhaps a few mins into getting something come back and ask if everything is ok and if we need anything else because if they had we would have mentioned the toast as it was we never saw anyone again until I again had to get up ask for the coffee then we never saw them again. That's the only negative and not even a big one but service needs a little oiling..:

This is in a great location and easily accessible from the tube ( embankment station is def the closest) there is also always black cabs sitting outside. It's perhaps about a 5-10 walk from Big Ben ( we live in London but if your a tourist it has everything within walking distance)

143,"Fantastic, mostly!","Quite possibly the nicest hotel room I've ever stayed in. The room itself was gorgeous. High ceilings, custom millwork everywhere. Beautifully milled pocket doors. A Walk in closet with a window, and built in shelves and drawers. Heated floors in the extra large bathroom. A walk-in shower with rain showerhead with spectacular water pressure. Fluffy  white towels. Sheets and duvet that felt silky soft. Quiet. A truly lovely turndown service at night. The public spaces are beautiful too. The lobby, the breakfast room. Elegant, but comfortable. The staff tries really hard to go above and beyond. Things aren't always going to go the way they should. Stuff happens. But, a true class act handles problems quickly, calmly and with grace. A couple of things went wrong, lol. My luggage didn't show up in my room as it was supposed to. I didn't receive a wake up call one morning despite ordering one. The heated floors in the bathroom were too hot. The TV remote stopped working, and I couldn't shut the tv. As I'm writing about these incidents, I'm almost laughing because truly, the staff tries very hard to make sure everything is going perfectly. Out of all of the above, it was the missed wake up call, and the luggage not getting to my room that bugged me. I was pretty annoyed about the missed wake up call because I missed a trip with friends because of it. BUT, the hotel manager really tried to make it right, apologized profusely, and sent me fresh fruit plates twice over the next day. He was extremely gracious about it, and tried explaining how that type of thing is very unusual and shouldn't happen. What more could I have asked for? It was human error. It happens. I was annoyed at the time, but looking back on the incident, the manager handled it very nicely. Overall, I think the hotel was really beautiful, and the style of service they are giving is generally top notch. They are a five star hotel, and they are striving to provide five star service. I didn't get to try the spa. I would love to do that next time I get to London. I've heard it 's terrific. I have to also mention that the food at the hotel is excellent, and that the staff in dining facilities and in the bar area are very gracious.",4,2016,02,17
143,"Wow, wow, wow","Such a beautiful hotel. Service is second to none and staff extremely helpful. Afternoon tea, followed by a visit to the Espa spa.....simply divine! The room was very tastefully decorated with a very comfortable bed so a great nights sleep!",5,2016,02,17
143,Ticks all the boxes but I want more than a checklist ...,"A large hotel in Whitehall, the reception areas are lovely and quite grand, but lack something that would give this hotel its own identity.
Staff are perfectly polite - impeccable, but focus was 'Service' with a capital S (nothing wrong with that) rather than me as their guest ... I guess that's more difficult to achieve with such a large hotel.  Room service food was excellent.
Gripes? 
1) Bathroom lighting not good enough to apply makeup (I ended up sitting on the floor in the bedroom in front of the window)
2) Couldn't adjust the room temperature (max 21, if you want higher reception do it for you downstairs, but in the morning we couldn't turn the temp down so we switched it off)
3) I kind of resent walking through the Harrods concession shop to get to breakfast (walking past is ok, not through)
4) The bed was a bit too firm for me
5) I struggled a bit with the buffet breakfast - I get breakfast brought to me in a Malmaison.
.... Overall, nothing really wrong with this hotel, it's all 5*, but I was just a little underwhelmed",3,2016,02,17
143,Fantastic stay - wonderful hotel,"My teenage son and I spent a long weekend in London at the Corinthia. Everything was perfect. Warm reception, accommodating staff, helpful concierge. The location was ideal for my son's first trip to London - within fairly easy walking distance of much (including the Eye which is a short walk across the river) and Embankment tube stop just across the street. The hotel itself is large, grand and luxurious. 

We were there over Valentine's day and the lobby flowers were stunning. Our room was wonderful - very comfortable bed and lighting. Fantastic dressing room/wardrobe. And a perfect bathroom with rain shower and bath (complete with a TV for the ultimate indulgence). Loved the Espa bath products. Room service was prompt and delicious. And there is no better way to start a day that with the indulgent breakfast buffet in the beautiful Northall. 

If I had been there for work, I might have quibbled that there was no ideal desk or workspace, but that wasn't an issue for this trip.

Great stay - will definitely return.",5,2016,02,17
143,Amazing stay!,"We staying at the Corinthia on the 14th February 2016 and we simply had an amazing stay! Warm welcome from the staff, who was at all times helpful. The spacious room was everything you can dream for. I managed to book a dinner table for Valentine's the day before via email, I got a prompt reply and the food was exquisite. It was a very special stay from start to finish.",5,2016,02,16
143,Birthday surprise,"My partner surprised me to a stay at the Corinthia for my birthday yesterday. On first impressions the hotel decor and architecture is striking. Within minutes of arriving in the room a small chocolate with 'Happy Birthday' written was given to me (cute touch). Both restaurants had very attentive staff and excellent dishes. Both my partner and I felt that the spa was beautiful and array of fantastic facilities. 
The housekeeping lady came for a third time (quite late) for a turn-down service (sorry!) which we were very grateful for. 
My favourite part of the hotel was the Bassoon Bar which was quite possibly the best I have ever been to. The cocktails were fabulous and the pianist added a charming atmospheric touch to the evening.
Unfortunately, today the spa Thermal Floor was closed and we had not been informed. Naturally, this was quite upsetting as this had been the principle reason for visiting. However, we have been given a weekday pass to use the spa which I feel is a satisfactory compensation for not being able to use it today. 
All in all, I have nothing new to add to the rest of these reviews. It was a very enjoyable couple of days and I am excited to visit you again. Thank you Corinthia!",5,2016,02,15
143,4th birthday ,"I really wanted to stay in a top end hotel for my 4th birthday so we picked this hotel.  Everything about this place is luxury. The room was amazing and had everything you could wish for. The spa was very luxurious and perfect to relax in. The restaurants were top class including the multi cuisine breakfast included in the price. Above all though are the staff.  I have never come across such attentive friendly and professional staff before.  All of them we come across could not do enough. 

Would definitely return for another visit. ",5,2016,02,14
143,Excellent!,"My husband and I and our friends stayed there recently and absolutely loved it.  From the convenient location to the excellent service, our stay  was completely wonderful.  This is definitely our new hotel in London!",5,2016,02,13
143,Heaven on Earth!,"This hotel is just INCREDIBLE! We absolutely enjoyed our stay. We told the staff about our special occasion (engagement) and when we got there, they upgraded our room and surprised us with a nice treat of champagne, strawberries and cream, chocolate and the best cake we have EVER tasted in our room. What a stunning and delightful edifice in which to be, marked with joyful opulence and unrestrained grandeur. The spa - we can't even begin to describe the divine nature of that place. 5 star is an understatement. However, as a couple we shouldn't have been separated for our treatment. The staff were so friendly in this hotel and allowed us to literally shine. They allowed us take some beautiful photos strictly because of our occasion. Who wouldn't want to stay in a place like this? Now, breakfast was just WOW! That's a feast. If we eat like that everyday, we'd just be fat. What incredible value for money. We love The Corinthia Hotel London!",5,2016,02,13
143,A wonderful stay!,"I stayed in the hotel last weekend with three friends and had a terrific time. The first evening we had diner in Massimo, Cristian & the sommelier took really good care of us. A very good choice of wine!  Also thumbs up to the housekeeping team who paid attention to every little detail when servicing the room, we were flabbergasted! Last but not least a big thank you to Gabriela from Guest Relations who showed us a couple of the beautiful penthouses. A truely wonderful hotel in the heart of London.",5,2016,02,11
143,Fantastic Hotel,"What a great design in every common space; entrance, bar, restaurants spa.
Service was spot on, friendly polite, professional. 

The feeling that you get when staying in this hotel is amazing, and so well worth the price.",5,2016,02,09
143,Networking Event,"We were treated perfectly. The chefs were amazing, food and staff great. The entertainment was brilliant courtesy of the Corinthia. I would recmnd for event planners!!
The decor and original features are beautiful. The courtyard is a great spot to hang out with the heating and blankets. Lounge areas with fireplaces are a must for a chill out.",5,2016,02,09
143,Good but not worth the money.,"We stayed here for one night with breakfast which cost approximately £600. The room is very nice and the bed very comfy, but I've had better rooms from £150 hotels. The air conditioning is temperamental and struggled to keep the room cool even though it was winter. 

We were going to eat in the British restaurant and turned up in our normal clothes to make a reservation a few hours before. We stood at the entrance and several waiters just looked at us and walked off; I got the impression they weren't willing to serve us because we weren't dressed to impress, even though we weren't dining at that time. After two minutes and several waiters and staff walking straight past us I decided to take my custom elsewhere. 

The spa is very good and the thermal suite is great. There is a big water jet pool with loads of different kinds of jets you control with buttons, a swimming pool, various showers, a steam room, saunas and sleeping pods. ",4,2016,02,06
143,Very comfortable. Not quite 5 stars,"Very comfortable quiet cocoon convenient for central and theatreland. Lovely thermal floor. Good room service and housekeeping. 
Not quite 5 stars as not given/offered upgrade as intimated on website (or explained why not).
Not shown to room (only to lift), odd, as all other London 5 stars do.
Was informed at spa couldn't go down in day clothes to view thermal floor (they could show photos(?)
so obliged to do the dreaded corridor walk in hotel dressing gown to gain access
Yet there I am on the thermal floor in my swimwear and 3 ladies in day clothes are being shown round.....?",4,2016,02,06
143,One of the best hotels in London,"This was our first time visit to London. The hotel staff was impeccable and very accommodating, the room was clean and beautiful and had no issues. The location of the hotel is perfect, close to most attractions in London. We will come back and stay in that hotel again. Highly recommended!",5,2016,02,05
143,Majestic and elegant,"Wonderful hotel with beautiful room, stunning common areas, and a very glamorous bar for a drink at the end of the day. The room was very spacious and the bathroom was really nice with a fantastic shower. Excellent service. Goes without saying that the spa is also amazing. All in all, it's the ideal place to stay while in London.",5,2016,02,05
143,A wonderful hotel.,"I've stayed at this hotel a number of times for work travel, and I really loved almost all of it.  The larger rooms are wonderful, and the two restaurants downstairs are quite good, especially the Italian Massimo. The spa downstairs, with a huge Jacuzzi and nice lap pool, is really great.  I absolutely loved the facilities, but I was always disappointed with the staff.  Given that I was there for a few days almost every month for two years, one would think that they would remember the kind of rooms that I liked.",5,2016,02,04
143,Birthday Paradise,"The rooms are so cozy and the beds are large and roomy and comfortable.
The staff are amazing and attentive to all your needs and know what you want before you need it. We were really hungover and housekeeping sent up some tea bags for us. That is customer service of the highest degree. 
We loved the spa the changing rooms were huge the showers perfect towels really fluffy. The sleep pods were the ultimate in having peace and quiet when you really need it and I loved the fresh fruit platters. We didn't have time for any treatments but made full use of the pools the steam areas and the bubble jet areas. The whole experience was blissful. 
The hotel can arrange anything you need and it's location is also perfect your a minute from a station and surrounded by pubs restaurants and even a theatre opposite.
Our room had a brilliant view too and the bars were really nice place to hang out you have to check out the cocktails.",5,2016,02,04
143,Grand hotel in the heart of London,"Old but new.  Beautifully restored.  Very comfortable rooms.  Great location.  Beautiful spa (bring a bathing suit!) Well worth consideration.  I was on a business trip and was uninspired by my past options in the City.   I was quite happy to chance open the Corinthia following a recommendation of a friend.  Walking distance to the City (assuming you like to walk in London as I do). The hotel is very near Trafalgar Square, the National Gallery and Westminster Abbey. ",5,2016,01,31
143,Best Hotel in London! Your Expectations will be Exceeded at Every Turn!,"This property will blow you away! It's beautiful, well appointed, and the staff is top notch. From the hundreds of vases of fresh cut flowers everyday in the lobby and in the room to the modern and well appointed gym, you can't beat this hotel in London. It's the small details they get right-like reaching out to us via e-mail to see if there was anything we needed before we checked in, the healthy treats in the fridge at the gym, the bowl of fresh fruit in the room, the seamless interior decorating of the room, built-in US/Euro outlets, and the amazing turn down service. Even the breakfast that's included which you can order a la carte without issues!",5,2016,01,31
143,Perfect!,"Whether you need accommodation for a business trip or want to impress your other half Corinthia is the right choice. Interiors are truly impressive, service is seamless and discrete. At breakfast you need to try eggs royale and Japanese buffet (placed between two breakfast rooms) and do not forget to visit the SPA - it is like a peaceful oasis in the middle of a busy city. Would definitely be coming back!",5,2016,01,30
143,"Loved this place, one of my favourites","I recently stayed here in this unbelievable hotel. I don't really want to say too much as its nicer to arrive and see for yourself but you will leave feeling like a the king of England.

The hotel is clean with a nice smell of fresh flowers lingering and full of lots of little cubby holes relax and to go about your business in privacy without feeling like your locked in a room. The bedrooms are very relaxing, comfortable and have just about everything you would ever need. The bathroom is massive white marble, heated flooring and a massive bath with TV at the end. Also a stand up shower with a Shower head the size of an original wagon wheel and feels like your stood under a Jamaican water fall.

My advice, check in as early as possible and head to the lobby for afternoon tea and cake. They don't mess about with the cake, you've got to go all the way up to Scotland for a slice this generous. It is sensational.

Get yourself into the spa and leave plenty of time to just dwell there. If you've got a lot on your mind or want a bit of peace and quiet this solve all of your problems. Ive not been to a place like this for a long time. Exceptional.

If you have a bad experience just explain to the front desk and it will be resolved asap with minimal fuss. Justyna, I think was the name of the lady who helped us and nothing was too much trouble. A very pleasant face upon arrival after a tiring few days previously.

If you are going to get breakfast get it sent to your room. 

If you want to stay in this location, The Corinthia is head and shoulders above all of the other nearby hotels on just about every level. Try it for yourself you won't go wrong.",5,2016,01,30
143,WAS ALL SO GOOD UNTIL BREAKFAST,"I stayed here on Saturday the 23rd of January with my wife and 4 friends, two of them had stayed in the hotel 2 years running for their birthdays.
Its was our first time and my birthday that day, we normally go to The Grove Hertfordshire.
All started really well with a room upgrade and a nice cake in the room and the room was ready early.
The room its self was really nice, great bathroom and really comfortable bed but i must say they are very wide but a little short my feet hung off the end.
The spa, gym and changing rooms were very good and we had a really nice afternoon there.
The bar was good for a drink before dinner then we headed out to Nobu then back to the bar after which still had a good atmosphere.
I can remember saying to my wife this hotel is perfect, looks great, clean and has really good staff.
We both had a good nights sleep and headed off for breakfast around 945am and this is where the hotel fell short of expectations.
We were shown to our seats (which are really nice) and was met by one of the waitresses with a big sigh.
We were told about the buffet and was told she would be back with menus and to take drinks orders.
After 10 minutes we waved her down and got some menus and order coffees, it took another 20 minutes for a white coffee and a cappuccino to come and by this time we had been up to the buffet once and had finished.
I order eggs benedict and it was very average , the eggs were not cooked well, maybe we notice more because we had brunch at Tom kitchens and there eggs were prefect the day before or that the whole experience of breakfast wasn't very good,
The staff looked very stressed and you never know whats going on behind the scenes but this is often the last memory of a hotel so they should get this right even our friends who had stayed before said it hadn't been like this before.
I love this hotel and would go as far to say it's the best hotel i have stayed in before in London and i will be returning very soon,  lets hope breakfast was just a bad day.
Great hotel

143,Great stay at the Corinthia but not without some small issues.,"This was my third stay at the Corinthia over the last 12 months and overall I enjoyed it very much. The public spaces are beautiful, service is attentive and good and the rooms are elegant but contemporary.

However with many wonderful, and recently opened, hotels to chose from in London the primary reason for my staying at the Corinthia is their participation in the Discovery Loyalty Program of which I am a Black (highest level) member. 

Joining a hotel loyalty program is basically a contract between the guest and the participating hotels. You choose to show your loyalty to a particular brand of hotel by staying repeatedly and so 'earn' status and particular benefits pertinent to your status in the program. In exchange the participating hotels recognize your status in the program by treating you as a valued repeat guest and by honoring their commitment to provide you with the benefits your status entitles you to and which they had promised when you 
joined the program.  Unfortunately Corinthia Hotel London does not honor their part of the contract and don't seem to 'get' the purpose of the 'Loyalty Program'. 

I attach a screenshot from Corinthia's own web site. As you can see as a 'Black Member' you are entitled to a number of exclusive benefits:

Black card exclusivity

Stay 30 nights and get all platinum level privileges plus:

• One Black level local experience
• Double upgrade at check-in
• Early check-in at 9am/Late check-out at 6pm
• Guaranteed room availability 24 hours prior to arrival
• Choice of amenity
• Local brand benefit(s

How did they do? Not very well.
I wanted to redeem a black level experience but the hotel was not offering any - fail

I had booked an Executive King Room and they upgraded me ONE level to a Junior suite. I checked and the next level a Deluxe Junior Suite was available but I was not given one of these. So another Fail. (incidentally they say if you book via the Corinthia website they will offer an upgrade to everyone). Other hotels in the program will regularly offer their black members more than a double upgrade if rooms are available.

I did not need an early check in or late check out on this visit so no comment.

Amenity - I didn't receive any amenity never mind my choice. In other hotels this is normally a bottle of wine/champagne and some snacks/fruit. - Fail

No idea what the 'local brand benefit is but I wasn't given it!

So overall their attitude to their Loyalty Program is disappointing.

Room Choices: As I said on this visit I stayed in a Junior Suite. On my last visit I was in an Executive room (not upgraded at all). There is very little difference between the two room types. The Junior Suite may be marginally bigger but looks pretty much the same as the Exec. Room I was in last time. The down side of the Junior Suites is that they all face an inner courtyard, which I don't particularly care for.

Although I love the decor of the rooms and the lovely spacious bathrooms, on this visit I notice that the grouting around the shower stall was dirty and discolored. See attach picture. Not particularly nice and in need of some maintenance.

Breakfast in the Northall is good and we enjoyed drinks on several nights in the Basson Bar.

Despite the foregoing I enjoy the Corinthia and am booked to stay again in April.",4,2016,01,28
143,"Wonderful, luxury hotel - couldn't recommend more ","I recently stayed here with my husband and what a fantastic hotel! From arrival we were made to feel valued and very welcome. The staff knew it was a special occasion and so upgraded us to a nicer room. It really made us feel special! The room was spacious and beautifully furnished, and the bathroom was huge, We ate room service once and had breakfast - both meals were tasty, super fresh and flawless and I just wish we'd had time to eat more. We enjoyed the spa - sooooo relaxing. It was very relaxing! The swimming pool and hot chairs being my most favourite. Cannot recommend this luxury hotel enough. I hope to return here again one day. ",5,2016,01,27
143,Wow!!,"Have just spent the weekend with my husband at The Corinthia as a surprise birthday treat from him. Wow what an amazing hotel. The staff are all friendly and keen to help, nothing is too much trouble. Thank you for the upgraded room it was divine. We ate at The Northall restaurant on the first night and found this to be excellent. Returning to the hotel later in the evening we spent time in the Bassoon Bar enjoying a drink listening to the music. The buffet breakfast on both mornings was first class, so much to choose from. The Spa facilities were incredible and we made use of them on two occasions. A place of calm and tranquility. There are really no negatives about this hotel. Would certainly recommend to anyone. Thank you to everyone at The Corinthia.",5,2016,01,27
143,Great luxury hotel with great service,"This is a true luxury hotel with great location and service. Wonderful room and bathroom. Clean, beautiful and super confortable beds. Very friendly and helpful staff at both check-in and concierge. I have not a single negative thing to say about this hotel. We will definitely come back.",5,2016,01,26
143,Brilliant!,"We brought some friends to stay at the hotel after an excellent stay last year.   The rooms were great in terms of facilities, cleanliness and decor. Everything about the hotel made the stay extra special.  The overall feel of the hotel is great and the decor is absolute class and suited our taste perfectly - luxury without being too fussy and overly ornate. 

We had dinner at the Northall Restaurant which we found delightful and very reasonably priced considering the quality of the food. We also spent some time in the cocktail bar on Saturday evening (early hours of sunday morning rather), this place was really cool and we loved the drinks, decor and overall atmosphere in there. 

The spa facilities are second to none

Service could not be faulted

After this visit The Corinthia remains the best hotel I have ever stayed in :)",5,2016,01,25
143,In room dining for breakfast,"In room dining for my breakfast was lovely, Bogdan provide a great service, he was very professional and thoughtful. The table presentation was so beautiful, and he was on time by my door at 6:30am, which I care a lot about being on time! Thank you for the service! ",5,2016,01,22
143,London's true Crown Jewel ,"Where do I begin!? This hotel is simply the most exquisite hotel I have even been to. My boyfriend and I spent a week in London and all I wanted to do was hang out at this hotel. The spa was unreal, an underground world of serenity and relaxation. The service was absolutely phenomenal. Never have I experienced such care from hotel staff. Upon entering the hotel the first that that goes to your mind is ""wow"". From the baccarat chandelier to the mini harrods, it is evident that this hotel is where luxury truly lives in London. Our room was spectacular with a river view including the London eye. The in room dining was delicious and the menu was extensive. This is most definitely the place to be in London for those who enjoy plush robes and one of a kind experiences! ",5,2016,01,21
143,"Stunning property, service in the restaurants just OK","The Corinthia has on one of the best locations in London. You are in walking distance to great attractions, museums, trafalgar square, etc. The rooms ave very comfortable, at least on the fourth floor (room 410 was lovely). The beds were worthy of the cost of staying here! The housekeeping and room service staff were very professional and helpful. The spa is still the star of the Corinthia! Not a big fan of the staff in the lobby/ tea area. They seemed to be bothered, unless you are constantly ordering. Not once in four days, did I see anyone have a smile on their face. They dont seem like they enjoy their work enviroment. If that doesnt bother you, then the hotel is still a gem.",4,2016,01,21
143,management issues!,"Booked a decent room for my 21 year old son and girlfriend's birthday : 2 nights@ £650/night
Poorly managed check-in sent her packing out onto the streets because she did not have the correct credit card which was with my son , who was delayed , although the hotel had my payment details on their system. She could not have lunch with her friend at the Hotel and decamped to Costa Coffee ..... not a good start . Dad intervened and the Hotel finally let her in.
Check in staff told me that there was no reservation, Even with the number they could not find the details.
Hotel told the pair that their rate did not include a meal in the evening , which it did , it was too late to rectify because they had eaten in their room.
Hotel charged incorrect  rate when checking out [rectified]

Too many mistakes",2,2016,01,21
143,Good chill and chat as the champagne flowed.,"My sister-in-law and I took a well earned couple of hours' relaxation in the bar last Friday afternoon.

Pleasant chill and giggles time over champagne; well looked after by the staff - thanks!  

Will call again.",5,2016,01,18
143,A truly great London hotel,"For the moment you pull up outside this hotel you know it is going to be a great experience. Set in Whitehall the hotel is the perfect setting for business or a quite relaxing weekend.

Everything looks and feels perfect. The staff and friendly yet totally professional and are very welcoming.

I had a suite booked and it was the type of room that you could spend a day in relaxing or working as it had every facility that one could require.

Lunch was in Northall and I was very hungry so I decided to eat like a king and order 3 courses plus some extra oysters. The Oysters came in a classic style with vinaigrette and also cooked and both were stunning. I also ordered Dressed Crab, Pickled Beetroot, Avocado Purée and Innes Goat’s Curd, light and fresh. very nice.

For main Cumbrian Beef Fillet with Oxtail Dumplings, Star Anise Carrots, Port and Shallot Jus which is the best Jus I have ever tasted and would return just to taste this again. Well done Chef. 
My friend had the lobster and steak tartare both which were very, very good.

After lunch we both had treatments in ESPA Life at Corinthia London which was a unique experience as it felt like we were in a spa of the future. The treatments were very good and the staff professional and friendly. They also have sleep pods to relax in after the treatments. A great spa experience!

Overall a wonderful luxury hotel to spend a few days in.",5,2016,01,18
143,A lovely evening in an elegant perfect hotel,"We chose to dine in the Northall Restaurant under the Book a Table offer so our expectations were not over high as we were on an offer. What a joy and surprise as the service was immaculate, the food wonderful and the value for money unbelievable. 

We enjoyed this so much we have already booked to go back to them for the a la carte as this is terrific value anyway, I cannot stress how good the service is. Everyone is treated 5 star irrespective of where they come from or who they are. 
The menu choice is terrific and appeals to all palates but nothig is overlooked if you are not happy. 
Some persons may like larger persons - order the sides if you have an appetite that large otherwise the complete menu is enough. The bread by the way is wonderful !!!",5,2016,01,18
143,Fabulous in every way,"We spent 3 days at this gorgeous hotel which is perfectly located 5 mins from Trafalgar Square and across the road from Embankment underground station which has access to 3 lines making it quick and easy to get to any London location. Door men decked out in top hats greeted us and took care of our luggage. The reception staff were professional, friendly and helpful and spontaneously offered us a late check out at no extra charge. We booked a family room which has 2 queen size beds and was room enough for my husband and very tall son. An extra bed was available if we wanted and we were told we could order one anytime, even at 2am, should we wish. The room was comfortable, well appointed and quiet with the room overlooking the internal courtyard. We enjoyed the buffet breakfast on our last morning and it is up there with one of the best buffet breakfasts I have tried. I have no hesitation recommending this hotel and will definitely stay here again when next I return to London. 
 ",5,2016,01,13
143,Our Favorite in London (so far)!,"This was our third (and best) stay so far at the Corinthia London.  Unfortunately it was very short - we were only there for New Year's Eve - but it was a great stay.

Because of all the NYE hoopla, when we arrived in London, the area around the hotel was already closed to vehicular traffic.  But the staff at the Corinthia went above and beyond and were able to get our car/driver (booked through them) to the hotel so we didn't have to walk with all our luggage.  It was quite a feat and a great example of their customer service.

We had booked through AmEx Platinum and were lucky enough to be upgraded from the basic room to a Junior Suite (Room 625 I believe).  The room was fabulous - we would request it in the future when possible.  It really was more like a full suite with a sort of entry/living area and an entirely separate bedroom.  It had a separate closet area and large bathroom with separate shower (which was really large itself), tub and dual sinks.

The hotel dealt with all the NYE paperwork making sure we had the needed wristbands and such so we could get back to the hotel if we left the area.

I know the NYE is just one night, but if you consider spending it in London, the Corinthia is perfectly located for the fireworks.  We walked about 100 feet from the hotel and had a spectacular view.

We had breakfast in Northall as we have in the past.  As always it was delicious - wide variety of hot and cold items.

We have tried several other hotels in London but the Corinthia is our favorite thus far.  If you can manage the price, book it and go!",5,2016,01,11
143,My favourite stay in London,"I have beautiful memories from my multiple stays in this wonderful hotel. The hotel is the expression of finesse in every detail. The Whitehall Place is an exeptional location and the Whitehall itself is an experience, so having lived through all of that, I find myself a very lucky person. Having breakfast with Sir Alex Ferguson in the same dining room, meeting Clive Owen in its lobby, conversing with wonderful people at the hotel's chic bar, made my stays in this hotel very memorable. Will always be a pleasure to go back.  ",5,2016,01,11
143,A birthday treat,"I recently stayed at the Corinthia for a pre Christmas/ birthday trip to London with my boyfriend. What a beautiful hotel, absolute luxury without being pretentious in any way. The staff couldn't have been more helpful. We also experienced the spa... Amazing! I travel a lot  with work and I have to say that the breakfast at the hotel was the best I have experienced anywhere! Thank you for such a wonderful stay.",5,2016,01,10
143,Outrageous prices and shambolic service,I aranged to meet some family here for a pre dinner drink. I arrived early and was met with a fairly attractive bar but one that lacked atmosphere. After a long wait for someone to attend to my table the waiter finaly appeared. He was pleasent and very helpful - re arranging seating for my soon to arrve guests. He left the drinks menu and I was horrified at the prices. Now committed to stay as guest were on the way I ordered 1 drink each for the 3 of us here already. Drinks took an age to arrive but agan waiter was very friendly. Guests turned up after about 15 mins and  I ordered another 3 drinks and a bottle of water. The waiter poured two of the new drinks and the ammounts in each glass were a little short as he was trying to get them both out of a bottle that was already nearly empty. We let this go as we were now pushng tme to leave to make another appointment.  I went to the bar to pay the bill as  couldnt stand to wait any longer for service. I paid a horrendous bill of £96 for 7 drinks - one of them was just a glass of Coke. So roughly £14 each. At this point  just needed to get out - so paid in full with a tip and started to leave. As got to the hotel doors a waiter chased us down and accused us of leaving without paying the bil. I explaned that I had and showed him the reciept. We tried to leave agan and he came back sayng there was a mistake and there were 2 bills we needed to pay - and produced a second bill for items we had not had. I sent my guests on and went back to the bar to put an end to this embarasng nonesense. I will never go back to this hotel and will advise everyone I know to stay away.,1,2016,01,09
143,Family holiday trip,"We just got back from a family trip to London and Paris. We brought our 18, 17 and 12 year-olds with us and we all thoroughly enjoyed this hotel. Has to be in our top 5 list of nicest hotels. The service was wonderful and the rooms were fabulous. We had two rooms and a private entryway that allowed us to keep that door shut and the two bedroom doors open. This made it quite easy for our family. The bathrooms are so luxurious and the beds are very comfortable. The breakfast buffet was abundant and the location was great. We hated to leave.",5,2016,01,06
143,Lovely but not the best for the money,"I wanted to treat my wife to a very special couple of days in London and thought the Corinthia would give us a fantastic experience at that rate.  Although the staff are all very friendly and efficient, especially the doormen, and the décor is lovely in reception and lobby we found the room a little ordinary.  It is definitely not a travel lodge but we have stayed in more spectacular rooms for the same or even less money.",4,2016,01,06
143,Amazing Stay,"Last year I stayed at the Royal Horseguards Hotel which was not a great experience. Another reviewer said don't bother and stay at the place across the road. The Corinthia. So we did for New Years Eve and I am so glad we did. It is a fantastic place. From the minute you enter you are welcomed and treated as an important guest.

There is no hanging around for check-in. A member of staff immediately addressed your needs if they saw you waiting. There are plenty of staff around which is great. Our room wasn't ready as we were early, but they checked us in, offered us free coffee in the Lounge (which is beautiful), while a final inspection was done of our room. When it was ready they found us to give us our key. Luggage all taken care of. A great welcome which immediately relaxes you.

We had an Executive room and it was lovely. Spacious, clean, nicely decorated, large bed, TV, integrated media system and everything you would need provided. The bathroom was large, separate walk in shower which was lovely and again everything was provided in the bathroom. Cannot fault the room and attention to detail.

We visited the spa which was great with steam room, sauna, pool and amazing jacuzzi. There are set times for families which is great and when the kids leave, the peace is lovely. All provided free of charge.

We had breakfast in the morning in the lovely Northall Restuarant. An all you could eat buffet and there was everything on show.  A real feast to enjoy. You certainly would not be disappointed. We didn't eat in the evening but I am sure the food would be just as good.

The great thing about the Corinthia is the staff and plenty of them!! Always ready to help and you are never kept waiting. Nothing is too much for them and they will always help where the can. 

Together with the he quality of the room, stay at the Corinthia and you will certainly not be disappointed (and give the other one a miss.)",5,2016,01,05
143,Is perfection an art or a science?,"We stayed for four nights.  We have already booked another visit.

This is what a luxury hotel should be and the Corinthia puts its competitors to shame. We have been searching for a number of years, but at last we have found a hotel where impeccable standards are allied to dogged attention to detail.

The staff members are the crowning glory.  They are knowledgeable, smart (in both senses), eager to please and interact without a hint of superiority or fawning.  Indeed, one generally doesn't necessarily see anyone until you need to.  For instance, we never saw the room cleaning or turn-down people - everything was done immaculately in the background.
The public rooms are a delight and it was  an added pleasure to experience the excellent quality of food and wine throughout.
Yes this hotel is not cheap.  Instead it is amazingly cost effective.  We felt privileged, pampered and relaxed.  Job done.",5,2016,01,05
143,Spa visit! ,"We recently stayed in London and our hotel (hotel 41) recommended to us the spa at the corinthia.
What a fantastic recommendation.
The spa is great, the pool, steam room, sauna all great, the changing rooms ect are all really nice, this is by far a 5* spa. 
I had myself a 50min massage that was very good. My therapist was Imogen, she was very professional and very informative throughout. 
Please pass on my comments to her, she was excellent.
The spa is very classy and oozes luxury.
I would definitely return here in the future.",5,2016,01,04
143,Amazing spa,My partner and myself went here for some relaxation as the hotel we were staying in recommended this as being one of the best in London. I can honestly say they were absolutely correct. As soon as we walked in we were made to feel very welcome by all members of staff. The facilities there were outstanding the pool and sauna and the plunge massage pool all were just what we needed. It's a must after a few days walking around London. You could help yourself to as many towels as you needed. It was just nice not overcrowded. I would certainly visit here again ,5,2016,01,04
143,One of the best,"The Corinthia in London is impeccable. Everything about the place sets the bar. Has to be considered one of the best hotels in London and perhaps the world. It's impressive decor, service, food, location are all truly first class. An exquisite experience. ",5,2016,01,03
143,Almost perfect ,"What can I say this hotel is virtually perfect. Expensive but they make no secret of that fact. The room are well thought out ( we stayed in a suite) with very comfortable beds and a huge bathroom. Our only minor irritation was the light in the dressing room was on a sensor so if you stopped moving for any length of time you were plunged into darkness.
We throughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend it to anyone for a special occasion. ",5,2016,01,02
143,Fantastic,"The Corinthia is a beautiful hotel that is in a fantastic location. We had a gorgeous room with all the luxury you would hope for from a 5 star hotel. Considering the size of the hotel it has retained a homely feel. We ate breakfast in the Northall which was excellent.. They had everything you could want. We had cocktails in the Garden room which was sublime.. The fires were lit and had a lovely romantic feel. We also had drinks in the Massimo bar which again was lovely. The Spa was most definitely a highlight for us. It is huge and beautifully designed. The only down side is that children are allowed in the pool which is fine if they are encouraged to respect that people are there to relax. Sadly two children were extremely noisy, running about and jumping in and we didn't feel we could use the pool which spoilt the ambience the hotel had clearly worked very hard to create. But it didn't spoil our enjoyment and we can't wait to go back.",5,2016,01,02
143,Best in London ,"This place is simply wonderful. The architecture is great, the service is fantastic, the rooms are spacious and nice. The spa is probably the best in London. Breakfast is fantastic and they serve wonderful afternoon tea in a beautiful room in the center of the hotel. Well done Corinthia! ",5,2016,01,02
143,Excellent!,For a week from 27.12.15 to 2.1.16 we (family with 3 boys and a baby girl) had the pleasure to stay at the Corinthia Hotel. A very nice hotel for a family. 2 improvements could be made: longer schedules for the kids at the pool and better team communication at the Northall restaurant. Massimo restaurant was the best in-house! ,5,2016,01,02
143,HIGH QUALITY,"Location is Fantastic, have a very good Service, with splendid Breakfast, quite Bars, kindness, high general quality, all good!
Umbrellas at your disposition.
About three hundred nice rooms with top top bathroom !",5,2015,12,28
143,Outstanding,"Arriving at the Corinthia is entering a whole new world where service and luxury are served everyday at high quality standards with joy and kindness. The Corinthia is right down the road from Trafalgar Sq. within walking distance from a range of landmarks in London: monuments, theaters, galleries. It is very near the Embankment tube station  (in case you don't care for a cab or don't have a car). 

Inside the Corinthia graceful staff is waiting to help just around every corner. The rooms are very spacious, superbly decorated and very comfortable and the in-room fresh fruit and coffee and tea amenities are the perfect end for you day (either leisure or business). 

Breakfast is served in the elegant Northall Restaurant room. Service may sometimes be overwhelmed by a large number of guests but it is worth waiting for extra items. All items are fresh and top quality. 

I traveled with family and I'm told that the afternoon tea is an experience not to be missed and the SPA facilities are absolute top-quality. I shall not miss those next time! Yes, I will return!

Some hotels are close to city landmarks. Some others are city landmarks!",5,2015,12,28
143,Nothing to add,I have stayed at Corinthia Hotel London a few times and have to say that it is one of these few institutions which make you remember what hospitality stands for! An amazing experience and compliments to the entire hotel team!,5,2015,12,25
143,excellent service,"We attended a wedding at the corinthia at the weekend and opted to stay the night. 
The venue was fabulous and the service first class. Our room was lovely. 
However on our return my wife realised that she had left her straighteners in the room. We contacted the hotel and were  dealt with by Branko Mihalik from house keeping whose service was fabulous....aending them back to us without any charge.
His excellent actions saved me having to purchase the wife a new pair for Xmas!!!!
Many thanks Branko",5,2015,12,23
143,Great hotel,"I have stayed at this hotel one night. I have been getting much better. The luxury hotel. My impression of this hotel's rooms, bedrooms and bathrooms wide. You can relax with a dip in the tub and turned on the television to see. Spa room of the hotel. A beautifully calm and relaxed. And sumptuous breakfasts The impressive facilities of this hotel.",5,2015,12,22
143,Wonderful experience,"We stayed at the Corinthia Hotel last month for four nights and it was a wonderful experience. Location is perfect. The Deluxe room was big, surprisingly with a walk-in wardrobe, the bathroom unbelievable. Breakfast buffet in the gorgeous Northall restaurant was fantastic. But we were most impressed with the staff. Everyone (doormen, reception, room service, waiting staff at the restaurants and the Bassoon Bar) with no exception was friendly and attentive and made us feel comfortable during our stay. I didn't use the Spa but my partner was absolutely delighted after her treatment. It was planned as a onetime trip but now we are sure we'll return in the future.",5,2015,12,19

143,An excellent Christmas lunch with colleagues ,"All I can say was the whole experience was divine from the excellent & charming service to the exquisite  food.  Not only was it beautiful to behold but also mouth wateringly delicious. I could not fault it all & that's rare these days. It really made the beginning of the seasons festivities get off to a great start  I hope the chef received my complements. You are truly an artist. Thank you from all of us. So glad Simon you booked this. A Christmas meal to remember.  I am definitely going to visit again & am going to treat myself to your twilight  spa too. It looked heavenly. Thank you for showing me around. 
Merry Christmas & a Happy New Year to all the staff at The Corinthia. Best wishes Simon, Bal Margaret,  Gertrude, Peter, Sahan & Davina.🎄",5,2015,12,15
143,Real value for money,"Hotel rooms are spacious with all the amenities that one can desire for real comfort in a hotel.  you can even watch TV while having a bath!

143,Gorgeous and great service,"We had a mini suite room and it was lovely, the best shower I have ever had in a hotel room, great food, great service, and really well equipped rooms. Breakfast is really lovely, as is the spa where we spent two hours. Spa lifts on each floor are a lovely touch to allow you to leave your room in your robe and get to the Spa in private. Hotel decor is glitzy and glamorous and gorgeous. Fabulous location too.",5,2015,12,14
143,An amazingly special experince,"I treated my wife to 'high tea' at the Corinthia on Sunday 13th December and it was just spectacular!
The surroundings are beautiful and tastefully opulent, but not stuffy in any way. The attention to detail was impeccable and perhaps most importantly, the staff were warm and friendly and went out of their way to ensure that we truly enjoyed the wonderful food and a glass of champagne.

It isn't a cheap thing to do, but if you want to treat your significant other to a genuinely lovely experience, there are few ways I can think of in London that make you feel quite as special.",5,2015,12,14
143,First class experience,"A wonderful, beautiful and well located place. The rooms are very comfortable and the service is amazing. Personal are really polite and kind. Staying there, I also had the opportunity to have dinner and breakfast at the restaurants and the experience was great as well. I highly recommend this place if you have budget to that.",5,2015,12,14
143,The sumptuous surroundings and excellent service made it an afternoon to remember,"We visited for champagne afternoon tea following an investiture just down the road! It was my first visit and I was bowled over by the whole interior. Having the gorgeous Christmas decorations up gave it a magical feel. The staff were lovely, professional and warm. The afternoon tea was super, our  family party, made up of differing age ranges all enjoyed it. I am planning my next visit.",5,2015,12,13
143,Top in hospitality and professionalism,"We have stayed in this hotel a number of times. The consistency in excellent service is beyond expectation. Starting from a professional and warm welcome at the reception including reservations, to the impeccable restaurant service. The afternoon tea and lobby lounge are wonderful also for receiving external guests. The breakfast and brunch are real value for money and atmosphere is very cosy. Massimo's is also a beautiful place but admittedly the food does not reflect the standards of the establishment; the main drawback we encountered. The Spa is wonderful. Saturday afternoon and evening is really busy so not very relaxing but the rest of the time is simply great. Worth trying the jacuzzi and swimming pool. The gym has very good equipment including state of the art spinning machines. If you are looking for a weekend relaxing seeing friends and enjoying london (Covent garden, Big Ben, theatres, London Bridge, national portrait gallery all within a few minutes walk) this is the place.
The hotel is super kids friendly with little perks like bath equipment, kids Burt Bees toiletries and a little toy always waiting our daughter on her bed! Once there was even a bath you. The staff knows how to deal with children with respect and is very accommodating to parents for special dishes and requests.
The rooms are beautiful - worth upgrading to an executive sometimes even though deluxe is spacious and very cosy.",5,2015,12,13
143,Top in London ,"We stayed for a night but this was the highlight of our week-long London trip.

We received a free upgrade from the basic room to the executive room. The bath was amazing -- furnished with full marble and tv for the gigantic bath. 

The use of spa facilities (nap pods, steam room, sauna, jacuzzi) was complimentary for hotel guests. The gym was 24 hours and offered free fruits and coconut water. 

Service was impeccable- all the way from check in to housekeeping and bell service. Location was convenient as the hotel was next to Charing cross station. Trafalgar Square and the Strand was about a 10 minute walk away.

Please note that breakfast is not provided and may well cost another 50£.

Highly recommended for a luxe stay in London.

143,The Best 5 star Luxury Hotel in London,"I come to London often but since I stayed in the Corinthia I always come back with a smile!
The Hotel is in all aspects perfect and gives you the feeling you are at home all the time! Ambience, Style, spacious rooms, Bar, Afternoon Tea, Service - got it all and in first class!",5,2015,12,12
143,Amazing Hotel not well known,"This is a relatively new gem in London. While some say it suffers from being a bit removed from the center part of London, I think it's in a great location. Easy access to Embankment station. Right on the Thames for good running.

The rooms are spacious and very modern. The gym is one of the best equipped I've used in Europe. 

And the breakfast is the absolute best I've had in the world. Bar none.",5,2015,12,11
143,Excellent service in the heart of London,"My partner and I spent our honey moon at the Corinthia Hotel in London.

They have great place, excellent service and a fantastic breakfast menu. The staff are really lovely and caring.

Theur SPA is prnobably one of the most amazing things I have ever seen. 

The hotel is in the heart of London, next to Trafalgar Square, a few minutes away  Leicester Square and the West End theatres.

Our honey moon was unforgettable and I highly recommend the Corinthia Hotel.",5,2015,12,11
143,oh my Eamon! Perfect from the floor to the Ruth!,"Eamon Holmes and his wife Ruth really put the cherry on top of the cake for me. To see them relaxing in the beautifully designed 'Lobby lounge' enjoying their afternoon tea was delightful. Everything about this hotel did not disappoint in any way, I loved absolutely everything. 'ESPA' was amazing and would go as far as saying it was one of the best spa experiences I have ever endured. I would deffinately recommend having a glass of white wine in the outside courtyard and enjoying a cigar, infront of the cosy fire. The tv's in the room are the best I've ever used in a London hotel, so easy to use with an iPad-like remote to choose any movie/channel you desire. Will be returning very very soon!",5,2015,12,07
143,Fantastic Hotel,We have just returned home after 2 wonderful nights at this hotel. We were impressed the minute we arrived at the hotel the service is outstanding. The room was lovely and the bathroom is amazing and a very comfortable bed. The breakfast was a great start to the day.  Can't wait to return,5,2015,12,06
143,Perfect,"This was the second time staying here for a Christmas shopping trip. 

It's a stunning hotel, with big rooms (for London) and great facilities. The bathroom is wonderful, the rain shower amazing and the bed super comfortable. Everything is kept beautifully, rooms and common areas too, with a luxurious feel from the design and touches throughout. Food was excellent, breakfast fab. Faultless.",5,2015,12,06
143,Excellent 5 start hotel with impeccable service,"The whole experience was awesome, from the arrival to the reception lobby to the check out. The doormen are polite and respectable, opening your way to a modern yet warm lobby. You can not stop admiring the lovely flowers and lighting. We had a short 4 night stay but it was enough to enjoy the wonderful, cosy rooms,with elegant bathrooms.The shower both myself and wife enjoyed after a long day shopping in Selfridges. My wife became ill during late evening and the duty manager was making sure the doctor from Harley St was called up and the staff informed of the situation. On check out the Hotel manager personally called to be concerned about my wife's well being. A small but nice gesture that touched us. For sure we will be coming back to the same hotel on our next trip to London. Well done Corinthia team and thank you for taking care of us.",5,2015,12,05
143,Top notch,"Technical brilliance eg TV in the bath with waterproof remote , incredible hi-def TV, RC sockets in wall for audio .I expect 100% and get it. 
And the location is peerless , just a stones throw from Trafalgar square .
Best Hotel ever for facilities.",5,2015,12,04
143,Best in London.,"Super location and the greatest staff. 

Rooms are terrific.    Suites are excellent.   Their restaurant Massimo is northern Italian and superb. 

Bassoon bar is improving.   Have stayed at least 25 times.  Short walk to st. James and all theaters.",5,2015,12,04
143,Amazing in every way!,"I have stayed at the Corinthia Hotel in London several times. The location (within walking distance of Trafalgar Square, Whitehall and Big Ben and across the street from the embankment tube station) make it ideal. The rooms are incredibly well appointed with amazingly comfortable beds, rainshower and soaking tubs and ESPA bath amenities. The service is impeccable. I've been to the ESPA spa which features an array of spa treatments, a lap pool and thermal floor in addition to a fitness room The Dining options (northhall and massimo's) are top notch. I love staying here and cant wait until my next trip to London!",5,2015,12,01
143,Still the best,"Have been staying here more or less since it opened
I just love everything about the place
The bar serves great cocktails and we love the cakes in the lobby lounge
The bedrooms I feel are the best in London 

Looking forward to Christmas shopping trip there 
",5,2015,12,01
143,The best hotel,"This is the third time my wife and I have stayed at the Corinthia. I am not sure why I have not reviewed it before. It is without doubt the best hotel we have stayed in. Everything is superb to the minutest detail. The staff are fantastic, superbly turned out, and as polite and helpful and one could wish them to be.

The hotel itself is luxury personified. The entrance hall bedecked in marble sets the scene for what awaits you. On this occasion we were treated with a complimentary double upgrade (subject to availability) and had a beautiful room with a balcony on the courtyard garden. Again everything is just superb and it's difficult to find sufficient superlatives to describe how good everything is.

We made full use of the Thermal Floor, which my wife (who is an expert in the Beauty trade) tells me is the best Spa she has been in. Our package included a treatment each as well, and as one would suspect, we weren't disappointed. The therapists were outstanding.

Make no mistake, this a luxury hotel with prices to match and it's a 'special occasion' hotel for us but it's well worth saving up for the experience. There are many luxury hotels in London but we have no wish to try the others now, this one is too good!

",5,2015,11,30
143,great personalised service,We passed by while in the city as we heard of their prestigious garden lounge and humidor. My husband is fond of cigars and Manuel their young cigar sommelier was of particularly good advice. Especially impressive by his humility. High standards in a great atmosphere.,5,2015,11,29

143,Perfect,"This is probably the best palace in London. The staff is perfect and always here when you need something. The garden lounge is held by a cigar sommelier of exception who knows his products as if he made them himself. His recommendations are gold ! I go there on a regular basis and every time is a pure delight. You must try the garden lounge, they'll set you up with a nice smoke around the fireplace. You won't be disappointed !",5,2015,11,26
143,A Perfect hotel ! ,"This is easily one if the best hotels in the world. 
I have written a review against the Corinthia in Budapest which should have been against this hotel in London.  

It is perfect I. Every way.  The service impeccable ,the food , the rooms on my stay the afternoon tea and the bridal show I attended recently !! 

I love this place ! ",5,2015,11,26
143,A beautiful hotel - Actually perfect hotel !,"I love this hotel ! It is perfect in every single way . 
I attended the bridal fair on this occasion and the service was still impeccable . 
I have stayed at this hotel , had afternoon tea and on another occasion had dinner . It is always perfect. 

You would want for nothing here . It is decadent , beautiful , luxurious yet everyone regardless of background is always welcome,  

This is very much my favourite hotel in London in every way .",5,2015,11,26
143,ABSOLUTELY WONDERUL,"stayed here in November and I cannot praise this hotel enough. Nothing is too much trouble - the staff cannot do enough for you. 
The rooms are clean, modern, spacious and very welcoming - everything you could possibly need has been taken care of. The food is excellent, check in quick efficient and welcoming. Much better than any ""iconic"" London hotels I have ever stayed in - the attention to detail is beyond belief.",5,2015,11,23
143,Amazing hotel in perfect location,"By far the best hotel I've stayed in. Amazing staff and beautiful hotel. We stayed in a king executive room on the 5th floor. The room was beautiful, the bathroom was exceptional.
Breakfast was outstanding with a wide selection of food available. We also visited the Spa which was amazing too. I can't fault this hotel at all. It may be expensive but you get what you pay for and this is the very best without doubt!",5,2015,11,23
143,If Carlsberg did hotels.....,"Probably the best Hotel in London.  Stayed here with the wife for one night but wished it was more.  I cannot fault the service and attention to detail was simply amazing.  Drinks in the Basson bar is a must, live music and a lively atmosphere with pretty much any drink you can think of to boot.  Breakfast was divine with plenty of choice and exceptional quality.  The Spa facilities are great, with a lovely pool and the biggest jacuzzi and sauna you have ever seen.  Stayed in the deluxe king room which was of ample size with a wonderfully proportioned bathroom. Stay here and you will not be disappointed.",5,2015,11,23
143,Attention to Detail,"My husband and I had spent one night stay here in November this year and as this was our second visit here new what to expect we checked in and was giving a late check out which was very handy as we had a late train to catch and it gave us more time to shop and chill out .
Our room was facing the main street with a limited view of the Thames, as usual the space was limited we had a separate shower with cubicle then a large bath and plenty of Espa products to use .. the living space was bijou but a generous bed and comfy pillows and a turn down service provided the usual mini bar service which is added to your bill on checkout the room has ironing facility's hairdryer good WiFi ..
The hotel had numerous bars and dining areas, we had reservations to eat out but we tried the Basson Bar for cocktails which were divine . the ambiance and attention you receive from the waiting staff was very good and we could of easily have stayed longer if not for our reservation at the restaurant ..
I loved the fact they have a Florist in the foyer of the hotel which is part of the Harrods chain , we asked for flowers sent to our room which were divine ..
The spa at the hotel is a must if you have time i would advise you book via the hotel website they have numerous treatments to try ..
We will return to this hotel the attention to detail from check inn to check out is very professional and discreet ...",5,2015,11,22
143,stayed a few times and can't wait to return,"I've stayed here a couple of times for work, and now cannot wait to bring my husband in a couple of weeks.  I cannot say enough good things about the absolutely amazing spa space.  I had a massage, which was good (the room was circular, if I remember correctly).  But I was more impressed by the fantastic lounge space - with reclining chairs, open fireplaces, and the possibility to order light food (though I didn't), and, most of all, the fantastic water floor with a huge sauna with glass walls, a steel bottom lap pool, and an amazing Jacuzzi-type huge pool with multiple stations at which you can turn on jets of various intensities and directions (including a waterfall!).  How relaxing. I cannot wait to return.

I've also really enjoyed the rooms each time I've stayed at this hotel.  The bathrooms have been large and very well appointed, with separate shower and tub, and great spa amenities (including bath salts).

The in-room tea and coffee options are extensive, the bed-always very comfortable, and the service - impeccable.  By far my favorite in London.  A great location too.",5,2015,11,20
143,Outstanding rooms,Corinthia is a wonderful hotel with beautifully decorated rooms and every modern convenience. The staff were attentive and made sure that we totally enjoyed our stay. The bars and outside seating areas were perfect for an enjoyable cigar.,5,2015,11,20
143,Better than never!,"On a week long trip to London in mid-September, we stayed at the Corinthia! It was a perfect place to be on many counts. The staff at the hotel from the front desk to the concierge to all servers from the lounge to the bar to the two restaurants and to the  doormen  were all friendly, efficient and helpful. They made our stay special. The location of the hotel is ideal as well: quiet street, two blocks to Trafalgar Square, and in the other direction, along the Thames by Whitehall Garden.",5,2015,11,19
143,Fantastic Afternoon Tea,"We pre booked afternoon tea here with our friend from Italy who we had ""done"" the typical London touristy things even the open top bus. However it actually was a great way to see London.
Anyway we arrived at the hotel and were seated in a plush area where a few others were also taking afternoon tea. We were given a menu and chose the champagne one. A glass of champagne with wonderfully fresh selection of sandwiches before our cakes arrived. Far too  rich to finish them all but it was good trying. 
My wife and friend from Italy had earl grey and I had the afternoon tea blend. Excellent tea.
Would definitely go back,but might look for a deal next time as a tad pricey, but you don't do it everyday fortunately for the waist line and the wallet!",5,2015,11,19
143,5 star romantic getaway,"Our experience with the Corinthia Hotel was faultless. The reception staff were incredible. I was welcomed by a lovely girl who ensured everything that weekend went to plan. She noticed I was slightly nervous as it was a surpass for my partners birthday and had several things to do. She went out of her way to ensure I was eased and gave me great advice and calmed my nerves. I had forgotten several things but she arranged everything from phone charger, adaptors etc. to be sent up to room asap. Her extra special attention and willingness to help made the entire night run smoothly to booking my cab for me and advising on lipstick colour! 
Food: Breakfast was fantastic. A massive variety to choose from and a quick service for if you wanted anything extra. 
Cleanliness: faultless. 
Room: Great! Very ample. I had a standard deluxe room which exceeded my expectations by a mile. 
Spa: I have visited the Spa at the Corinthia several times before. In fact its the only spa I go to in London or send clients,  as I can trust their constant excellent service and fantastic facilities. Treatments are bespoke which the therapist takes great care in ensuring they deliver exactly what you are looking for. 
Overall: A perfect stay! Highly recommend. You are in the heart of london and its most romantic area.",5,2015,11,19
143,Excellent hotel,Stayed here for two nights. Fantastic rooms and great restaurants. Food excellent. One of the top three hotels in London I would say. Rooms are clean and modern and the staff are very helpful and friendly. Parking is easy. Very close to all the main attraction s as its near Whitehall. ,5,2015,11,18
143,Fantastic Stay!,"My wife & I celebrated our 30th anniversary with a week in London, and we're so happy our agent recommended the Corinthia.  Unquestionably one of the most beautiful & welcoming hotels we've ever visited.  Photos of the lobby, courtyard, etc speak for themselves.  The staff was friendly & helpful, our room (Deluxe King) was large & comfortable, and the Northall breakfast buffet was outstanding.  Corinthia has a great location within walking distance of Parliament, Westminster, Buckingham, The Eye, Trafalgar, etc.   Embankment tube station is across the street, and Charing Cross rail station about two blocks away.  Highly recommended -- hope to return soon!",5,2015,11,17
143,Exceptional service & gorgeous décor,"For my 50th Birthday I was taken to this stunning hotel for a spa weekend, dinner and Sunday brunch.

Every member of the staff are charming and attentive.
Our suite was massive and tasteful décor
Common areas, bars and restaurants were lovely
Spa was very unique 
Entire property was spotlessly clearn",5,2015,11,16
143,Weekend theatre visit,"The location of the hotel is excellent as is the facilities both in the public areas and the bedrooms of the hotel
Check in is a stress free process and takes only a few minutes before you are escorted to your room.
My only disappointment was the quality of the buffet breakfast. For £34 I would have expected a much better selection and quality of food",5,2015,11,15
143,"Great hotel, great service, but...","...the hotel restaurants seemed to us to not be quite up to the hotel's overall service standard. It it possible the restaurants have a different ownership or management structure?  To be fair, several couples, all newly arrived in London for a wedding, wound up in an impromptu gathering looking for a quick dinner before bed, and thus a party of nine arrived in the restaurant (Massimo, one of two in the hotel) without a reservation and on the late side.  It was a weekday, the restaurant wasn't crowded, and we were seated promptly -- a very promising start. And the food, when it arrived, was quite good.  But the intervals between sightings of the waitstaff seemed endless; the intervals between courses added new meaning to endless.  What we'd hoped would be a quick drink and bite turned into a two and a half hour endurance test as the jet lag set in.  

But the service in the hotel itself was outstanding, and it's hard to beat the location.  Room service was prompt and good, and there are a zillion other restaurants nearby. ",5,2015,11,14
143,Best spa in London,"The spa (ESPA) has been rated one of the best spa's in London, and in my opinion it is THE best spa in London. You'll find world class therapists and an amazing tranquil interior - a place to escape and destress. It's worth visiting just to see the design, let alone receive a perfect massage. Be sure to book in advance.

We have been going to the spa every visit to London, however last weekend we chose to stay in the hotel for the first time as well and were not disappointed. We stayed in a Deluxe King room on the top floor (7th floor) with views onto the historic streets and London Eye (see attached photo). We loved the hotel design; a lot of luxury 5* hotels in London are far too ornate for our modern tastes, but the Corinthia manages a modern design with a luxurious feeling. 

The location is excellent; you are by the river, a short walk to Westminster, and a short walk to Covent Garden (shopping and theatre district), as well as Oxford St and Soho. The hotel in other words is in central London! You can get to all of the major London sights by foot.",5,2015,11,13
143,Excellent Review for a best hotel like Corinthia,"Excellent!! What a treat! This is one of the most put together beautiful hotels I have had the pleasure to stay. Do take part in high tea for it's elegance and charm. You must visit the spa for it is divine. Even if you do not have time to take part, go check it out anyway. The design is a fest for the eyes.",5,2015,11,13
143,Dinner,"As one would expect, impeccible food and service and beattiful surroundings. A five star hotel with dinner to match. The bar just around the corner is bright and glamerous, although the smaller bar is perhaps my favourite. Dress to impress",5,2015,11,12
143,Excellent weekend stay,"Booked hotel for weekend treat on 3 nights for 2 offer so worked out at very good price for 5* hotel in very central location.  Room was spacious, well equipped, well designed and well maintained - so near perfect! The staff were attentive and friendly - but not excessively so.  Would go back in a heart beat.",5,2015,11,12
143,Luxury hotel,"Location is near to everything. The hotel are spacious with many amenities. Lobby is gorgeous. Very helpful. One of the nicest hotels we have stayed at. It is a bit pricey. Breakfast was included and we were allowed to order off the menu, which I truly appreciated.",5,2015,11,11
143,Top notch,"Although this hotel is slightly out of the way from Soho, I immediately warmed to the place. The hotel is luxurious but in an uncluttered way. And this is maybe a good way to describe the whole experience; traditional luxury hotel but modern and efficient. The room was very roomy and well appointed, while food and drinks were first class.  
The most important part was the professional and friendly service all the way from the front desk to the room service, while the concierge was top notch in getting reservations and even my lost luggage back.

I am looking forward to come back.",5,2015,11,11
143,Birthday surprise stay,"Stayed on the night of my birthday as a lovely surprise.... Great hotel, fantastic spacious room.... Special note about the staff who offered a first class service, very friendly.Breakfast the following morning was also very good, with options off the menu and a very good buffet as well.... It was a very special stay and I would definitely do it again as an amazing treat",5,2015,11,09
143,Fantastic service and a delicious meal! ,I came to London with friends and chose to eat at the Corinthia. We had the 3 course theatre menu which had 3 options for each course. The food was absolutely delicious with generous portion sizes. The service in the restaurant was friendly and attentive. They provided a cushion for my friend who'd had a recent hip replacement. The only slight downside of the whole experience was the attitude of the doorman who was quite sullen. This didn't spoil our enjoyment of the evening though. The meal was excellent value for money. I would highly recommend The Corinthia for a pre or post theatre dinner experience! ,5,2015,11,08
143,"Great location, great service, and cigars","When you go to London you want to think about the location of where you stay. You want a hotel that is close to the things you wish to do, and for many tourists, or politicians, the Westminster area is the place to be. If you are there this is one of the two hotels to stay in. 
The service is at a high level - quickly there to get a cab, light a cigar, direct you to some location. When my kettle broke (I used an American and the current there was a bit strong) they quickly replaced it. 
The rooms are larger than most in London (which is small by most standards) but they are well kept and well put together.
They did the little things for our son, JJ - who was with us. Providing him with some toyx and treats. 
The cigar lounge continues to grow- as do their cocktails.",5,2015,11,07
143,Superb place to host corporate events,"I was attending a corporate function around the Rugby World Cup. 

Pre Dinner drinks in the cocktail bar. Brilliant service. 

Then the function in the ballroom. Most beautiful room. Over 100 people. Service again excellent and standard of food was superb. 

I thoroughly amazing experience which way over delivered on my pre function expectations.",5,2015,11,06
143,Swage Smell,"This hotel is a 5 star hotel with a 3 star service. Amazing building but it is quite evident that they neither have enough staff nor the caliber of staff to match the category of hotel they are charging for. We spent a weekend there. Spending more that $4k USD over two days. On arrival we were given a room that had a major swage issue. On opening the door, the smell hit us hard and filled the corridor with the most awful stink. I only managed to walk in, call the reception and wait in the corridor. After one more call and a a 20 minute wait, they walked up with with a new key, a gave us a much smaller room witch thankfully did not smell. The manager was apologetic, but I insisted on him coming up with me to the room and was asking him, how does something like this would pass the housekeeping, the people who left the fresh fruit there and ..........He did send us a bottle of Champagne and a written apology but we had already started on the wrong foot. Things were not great in the hotel, the Spa never picks up the phone. I tried 6 times directly, called reception and they tried and we all gave up. Their suggestion was, I should just go there! The Spa was great once we got there and that went a long way to recover the bad hotel service. After we checked out, I realised I left my fitbit in the room. I called them back and they had thankfully found it. I asked them to have it at the concierge and I will return on Wednesday to collect it. They confirmed this is what they will do. Returned on Wednesday, no sign of it and lost and found was closed. Concierge took my card and promised that they would call me and send it to me the next day! No calls, yes you guessed it. Called today, it is with lost and found and they wanted me to pay for postage (somehow?) and write to them so they can send it back. Pathetic service. It all looks very nice, but trust me, the service is really bad in this hotel.",3,2015,11,06
143,"Very good service, excellent food, underrated location","For London, the hotels were surprisingly roomy and well situated.  The one true complaint was the lack of a proper desk- which made doing work a bit more complicated than necessary in the room.   Otherwise, the overall layout of the rooms were very strong. 

The hotel's location in close proximity to Trafalgar Square and the Victoria Embankment were both very useful, as was the ability to easily walk to London theatres and Covent Garden.   Oxford Street was a bit further away, but it was quite possible to do a brisk walk, as well as one to the west edge of the City.  

Food and service quality were both excellent, and I was quite impressed with both the concierge desk and the morning buffet.   Room service was solid, and the afternoon tea was excellent, both in terms of food and setting.",5,2015,11,05
143,Best tea I've ever had. ,"Went there yesterday with my partner for an afternoon tea. The decoration is modern luxury but relaxing. I ordered Earl grey which was exceptional best I've ever had! 
The scones feel fresh and warm serve. 
The service was faultless my partner asked for extra hot tea and the Spanish waitress is more than happy to take your order. 
At £50+ per person it definitely not cheap but worth every penny. ",5,2015,11,04
143,Perfection,"Stayed here during the rugby World Cup and this is the best Hotel that I've ever stayed in! I have been to many great Hotels around the world, but the Corinthia is one step ahead of the rest. Staff, food, rooms, gym can not fault a thing.",5,2015,10,31
143,Night away,"This is the best hotel I've stayed at in London. The rooms are of the highest standard. The staff are also very helpful and knowledgable. We also used the spa which had swimming pool, which was small but a nice touch in Central London. The location is great for the Horse Guards parade, Buckingham Palace, Downing Street and the London Eye. They're all within easy walking distance. ",5,2015,10,30
143,Heaven by the river,"Perfect location for exploring London. 2 minutes to the Thames and the water taxis, a must do between The Tower and The Eye. 10 minutes walk to Downing St and 20 minutes walk to Bond Street.  Stylish hotel, spa and pool a high standard.",5,2015,10,29
143,Brilliant Stay!,"Beautiful hotel with exemplary staff who always seem to be smiling and always happy to help, based in the heart of London there is no better spot to explore from! Make sure you make use of the tea room which looks as beautiful as the pictures!",5,2015,10,29
143,Faultless luxury.,"What a wonderful hotel. There is nothing to give but praise.... the staff were helpful and accomadating, the food was wonderful, the service excellent & the room and location would be hard to beat....we had a totally wonderful stay.",5,2015,10,28
143,Hidden Gem of a hotel in West London,"This has got to be one of London's finest hotels, extremely classy venue, whether you wanna meet business clients for coffee wine or a cigar, or a date night with someone you really wanna impress.... especially at Basson Bar inside.  your greeted and treated like royalty but the service of the bar and not to mention the excellent attention to detail in the exclusive cocktails they serve you! My night ended really well and will definetely recommend this venue!",5,2015,10,28
143,Fabulous get away at the Luxury Corinthian,"London has an endless list of fabulous hotel properties and I never stay in the same place twice.  It is not that I think there is always something better, I simply enjoy a new experience each time.  The Corinthia is elegant, chic and had excellent service.  I prefer the feeling of a smaller, boutique hotel and the Corinthia delivers.  The public spaces are exquisite; the chandelier in the center parlor is worth a pop in if your are even in the neighborhood.  The outdoor lounge with lit fireplaces is perfect for a nightcap.  The rooms are lovely and very quiet which is surprising given the central location.  Our bathroom was simply one of the best we've had in London.  It was spacious, beautifully appointed and had an amazing shower, which can't be taken for granted even in a high-end London hotel.  The walk-in wardrobe is a lovely way to feel at home.  The bedroom itself was a bit small but I've come to expect that in London.  Only disappointment was breakfast.  The service was always a bit harried and the hot food on buffet was often cold.  This is a blip.  I'm fine with a cheddar scone and pot of tea. All in all, a really lovely 4 night stay.  Highly recommend and I'm a tough hotel critic!",5,2015,10,27
143,Another fine stay at the Corinthia,"Recently spent 6 nights at the Corinthia in London. Although we had a minor service hiccup at the start of our stay, this was rapidly solved by the delightful Jean Louis Fresta, one of the senior Managers.
Staff are friendly and attentive, rooms are beautifully furnished and spacious. We stayed in an Executive room which had apple space.
Location is also great for all the sights of Central London.
Looking forward to my next visit.",5,2015,10,26
143,amazing cocktails at the bassoon bar..,we had an amazing experience at the bassoon bar of the Corinthia hotel.We were served by an Italian guy by the named Rocco who was extra super polite and was making amazing drinks.it is an experience to visit the bassoon bar.amazing cocktails in a very classy environment..,5,2015,10,26
143,"Top-notch customer service, amazing public spaces, fantastic spa/gym and delicious breakfast","Was here last year with my wife for a spa/gym half-day.  Rushing from work, forgot a shirt to work out in.  Spa/gym manager solved the problem by giving me one of his.  Fantastic and professional customer service.  Went back this year to stay the night and weren't disappointed.  Top rate in every aspect, from Anton the barman opening slightly earlier for us (and making some great Old Fashioned) to the Asian dumplings for breakfast.  Cannot recommend enough.",5,2015,10,26
143,"Attentive, personalized service","Fantastic customer service and attentive management. 

After a mismanagement of our original wedding booking, the manager was quick to resolve the issue and our impression of the Corinthia Hotel. 

We truly appreciated our anniversary evening at the Northall. Fantastic chef, every part of our meal was superb. The attentiveness, professionalism, knowledge, and friendliness of the Northall staff was some of the best we've received - really made our night that much more enjoyable. On top of the customer service and food, we love the overall decor of the Corinthia for its understated, classic, timeless elegance. Many thanks to Mirko Cattini and the Northall staff, we can't wait to come back!",4,2015,10,26
143,10 days in heaven!,"Blown away by the luxury and beauty of the amenities at Corinthia. Very helpful in providing iron/ironing board and adapter plugs. Lovely touch with the lavender, chocolates, water etc at bed turndown time. Only little bug bear was they were too tidy with putting the hairdryer away in the closet everyday instead of leaving it out where I had it plugged in for using everyday. Nespresso coffee was a nice touch but needs to be accompanied with real milk not long life pottels.",5,2015,10,24
143,Simply out of this world!!!,"Wow! Wow! Wow!...... 

This hotel and the value it places on service excellence leaves a guest like me speechless and with no words. We spent 8 nights at this hidden gem in amazingly quiet part of the city.

The staff is amazing, the restaurants offer a good variety, depending on what one would feel like (whether formal, or otherwise). 

Your afternoon tea is also great and the ladies there are very friendly, neatly dressed in their beautiful black dresses with brown sashes. 

The location of the hotel is superb! You step out of the hotel building and London's many attractions and activities are literally at one's doorstep.

All the way from South Africa, I cannot wait to visit the Corinthia London again.",5,2015,10,24
143,Extremely great experience ,"Chose this hotel for location and appearance. The greatest decision ever. Staff was extremely courteous and friendly. The cleanliness and overall appearance was excellent. Can't recall anything out of place or that required attention. Room service was timely and great food. Ordered breakfast the night before and it arrived at the exact time it was requested. Plenty of amenities in the room. Coffee was great tasting and the tea variety ample and exquisite. Bed was so good we didn't miss our own bed. Bathroom was ample and comfortable. There were different restaurants at the hotel. Didn't get to visit all but the lobby lounge was really good for relaxing and eating light snacks, dessert, tea or any of the other available snacks and drinks. Location was really good. We were able to walk to most of the places we wanted to visit. The nightlife was very vivid within walking distance. Plenty of small pubs and restaurants nearby. Truly great location. Highly recommend to stay at this hotel. ",5,2015,10,21
143,"Exquisite. Excellent attendent staff, fabulous food, most beautiful spa in London","We recently stayed in the Corinthia and everything about our stay was excellent. Highly recommended for the discerning. Within walking distance to the Thames, Buckingham Palace, the theatre district and hundreds of pubs and excellent restaurants. 2 minute walk to the underground. Amazing bed. Consider a suite.",5,2015,10,21
143,"Excellent Services, location and room","This was my second time stay at this hotel. It is in the quiet yet very easily accessible Whitehall Place neighborhood. Westminster Abby, Parliament Hall, Big Ben, 10 Downing St, London Eye, River Thames, etc all just a quick stroll. 

The best part of this hotel is the service. Anything you need help, as long as the hotel knows it they will find a way to make you feel at home. My luggage was delayed and somehow the airport won't deliver it, and when I told the concierge desk about this, they sent someone to Heathrow to pick it up for me!! And they also put your fave room type on profile and try their best to accommodate to your satisfaction. I want to send my gratitude to Garry at Concierg and Ryan at reception for their exceptional service to truly make me feel it is the home in London. 

Last but not least all food provided in the hotel are of very high standard, no matter taste or presentation. 

",5,2015,10,20
143,Decadence personified,If you're looking to impress your guests with  luxury and service then the Corinthia Hotel is the place. It is up there with the Savoy and the Connaught. The decor has a hint of Art Deco and everything is finished to a high standard. If perfection could be built then this is it. Including the food. Not for the faint hearted though. Make sure you take a credit card because it is pricey but you get what you pay for. ,5,2015,10,19
143,Amazing,"From the food to the room to the service... It was amazing ....and the spa facilities were utterly beautiful!

The staff were fantastic with my daughter too, couldn't have been better 

Well done Corinthia team, world class",5,2015,10,17
143,"Mmmm, Spa!","Let me start by saying that that this is our “go to” hotel in London. Not just because the staff is incredible, the rooms are exceptionally comfortable, and it’s in a great location. No, it is because of the Spa! This has got to be one of my favorite hotel Spas in London, and the main reason this is our favorite, is because it has a pool, a hydrotherapy pool, a steam room, sauna, and all the other Spa essentials you would expect. Just wonderful!

Thank you again for our most pleasant stay everyone at Corinthia! See you next time.",5,2015,10,16
143,5 Star Stay in London,"Absolutely wonderful stay in this beautiful hotel.  Having stayed at many others in London (The Langham, The Savoy), we have found our new favourite.  It's hard to find fault with the hotel - from the minute you pull up outside the door the 5* treatment begins.  I was amazed at how many staff they have working in the hotel and it certain shows in the service.   I arrived at 7am after a very long flight from Hong Kong, not expecting my room to be ready.  I was thrilled when the Guest Relations Manager was called and escorted to my suite - WOW!  My only fault with the room would be that it needs more lighting and the light in the walk in wardrobe should remain switched on.  Best room service breakfast ever as was the breakfast downstairs.  I checked out after 2 nights but my husband was staying another night so had booked a twin room.  However, as we were about to leave the suite we got a call to say he could stay there for the same rate as the twin room - amazing.  Thank you Corinthia Hotel and staff.  You deserve to be the number 1 hotel in London.  Well done to all.  We can't wait to come back!",5,2015,10,15
143,A very nice hotel,"The Corinthia London was beautiful and centrally located.  It was very easy to reach the best sights by foot and the tube station, if needed.  This hotel would be better for a business trip - the service is quick, the hotel has a corporate atmosphere, and you can easily go unnoticed.  The check-in staff, restaurant staff, and the concierge were polite and to-the-point, but not personable.  The hotel feels cold, and a more home-like experience might be better found at The Savoy.  We plan to return there on our next visit to London.",4,2015,10,15
143,Jewel of a hotel in this busy city,"My third visit to this fabulous hotel, definitely one of London's best! The attention to detail in this beautiful property is second to none.  Excellent restaurants, glamorous bar, stunning lobby area, comfortable, luxurious bedrooms and central location make for a memorable stay. The spa is just amazing. Great hair salon at the spa which is really convenient. This hotel has it all! I cant wait to return.",5,2015,10,14
143,Absolutely Fantastic,"I stayed there whilst my husband was working in London. Excellent service, excellent food, very polite staff.  Impeccable room and very spacious. Had both a shower and a bathtub.  Very good breakfast selection. Always with a surprise on the pillow every time the room is made :-)",5,2015,10,14
143,"Great hotel, fantastic staff","We stayed at Corinthia Lisbon for 3 nights to celebrate my partner's birthday. The experience started before we even arrived at the hotel with the staff really going out of their way to make our stay memorable. I would like to send a special thank you to Ines for being so helpful, always with a smile on her face ready to offer any help. The restaurant sommelier was very knowledgeable and he made some excellent wine recommendations to accompany our meal. This is a great hotel but what makes it special is its staff, they are truly amazing. The hotel is just outside the city centre but the metro is 1 minute away and it takes 10 minutes to get to the heart of the city. Metro runs until 1am so for us it was a perfect location. One small criticism is that my family were trying to get hold of us on the landline but reception never seemed to answer the phone.",5,2015,10,12
143,absolutely brilliant!,"I booked the Corinthia Hotel for my wife's birthday along with treatments from ESPA Life at Corintha. We spent one night and in that very short time the service was impressive. The room was spacious and the shower (a particularly important feature to me;)) was exquisite.  The Northall restaurant presented a good breakfast selection could have been improved with a better hot meal selection for the buffet. The interior was very nice indeed.

The hotel was expensive but you pay for what you get and based on location, aesthetics, and service I would say it was money well spent. 

",5,2015,10,07
143,Excellent,Stayed with s large group for rugby outing. Service great. Food excellent. Room superb. Generally service second to none. Would recommend to anyone spending s few. Days in London. Wives enjoyed the spa and Ireland won the rugby. Great place to stay,5,2015,10,06
143,Amazing!,"Myself and three friends booked the Safari Dining Experience to celebrate two of the party's birthdays.  We absolutely loved the whole experience.  We were greeted by Anton in the Massimo restaurant.  He was great fun and explained how the evening would run.  The food in the Massimo was superb and very plentiful.  Anton then showed us into Northall for our main meal which again, we could not fault a thing from the friendly service, food and surroundings.  Dessert was in the main lobby under the most impressive chandelier.  Our desserts arrived looking like art on a plate with the two birthday girls enjoying candles and a birthday greeting on the plate.  Alas we did not make the Basoon Bar for our cocktail but I am sure it would have been as perfect as the rest of the evening.  Thank you to all who made it such a special evening.  We will be back again!",5,2015,10,06
143,A hidden gem in London,"This hotel captures you from the moment you walk in the door. You are surrounded by the most relaxing interiors and contemporary innovative floral displays that invites you to relax and leave the hustle and bustle of London outside. Everywhere you turn, from the atrium to the restaurant is a pleasure. The service is outstanding, the choice of restaurants and bars is exciting and 'cool'. The design and interiors of the bedrooms and suite are good enough to take home. Thank you to all at the Corinthia for a wonderful stay and delivering on your promise of making our wedding one of the most memorable days of our lives. We will always remember the Corinthia with fondness.",5,2015,10,06
143,Sunday Lunch,"Our family group of 9 attended the Northall Restaurant on 4.10.15 and enjoyed the Set Menu of 3 courses including a glass of champagne for 45.00 UK pounds.

They phoned before to confirm the reservation (always reassuring), our table was perfectly located and the service was outstanding and so was the food.

The location of this hotel is excellent (2 mins walk from Charing Cross Station) and the interior quality and class of this hotel is wonderful.  The live jazz made the whole experience totally perfect.

It was a special occasion and we were all made to feel special.

They even accommodated our very fussy 9 year old.

If you didn't want the champagne, they were happy to allow another member of the group to have it.

Honestly, this is a fabulous hotel and we will definitely return.  The toilets are the best I have ever visited in London!",5,2015,10,05
143,Simply Outstanding,Its as simple - the Corinthia is an outstanding hotel from every perspective. All staff is very friendly amd helpful. Check-in was smooth and the receptionist brings you to the room to explain all details. We got upgraded to an Executive King which was wunderful (close to 50sqm) with a very large daylight bathroom. The room is in a modern british design nad has a more than comfortable king size bed. Breakfast is taken in the main restaurant and again we have had no complaints. Its served as a very large buffet with an additional menu for specialities like Eggs Benedict. We have also tested the ESPA Spa which offers the usual variety of treatments. The treatments are excellent and you can relax at the pool / whirlpool afterwards. We stayed three nights and both agreed that this was to short. Having stayed in a variety of London 5-star hotel it is a shame that we tried the Conrinthia so late. It will be our primary choice in the future and we will come back soon,5,2015,10,05
143,Fabulous hotel ,"Stayed one night only but wish it had been more!! Hotel is amazing, staff are great, customer service was excellent. Our room was everything I'd hoped for and more! Breakfast was wonderful. I can wholeheartedly recommend this hotel and I'll definitely stay again I was so impressed!! ",5,2015,10,04
143,Perfect stay & wedding ,"We recently had the pleasure of staying at the Corinthia for 4 nights. Our friends were married at the hotel over our stay and therefore it will always be memorable but would have been anyway even without this special occasion. 

The location is amazing for exploring central london by foot and very close to public transport if needed.

The staff are efficient and very friendly. I have no idea where the housekeeping staff hide because you never see any sign of them but you always return to a perfectly made up/turned down room. 

The rooms are luxurious with all the amenities you'd expect from a hotel of this class. The extra bonus is they are extremely quiet. We arrived back in the early hours of the morning and in the hall we could hear another room close by having quite a loud party but once inside our room we could here nothing at all. Combine that with block out curtains and a super comfortable bed made for great sleeping. We didn't have a view and there wasn't a great deal of natural light in our room but we weren't there to spend time in our room so didn't bother us. You may want to ask for a room with those things if you do plan to spend a lot of time in your room. 

The breakfast was included  in our rate and is a fancy affair. Buffet selection and dishes to order. Perhaps pricy if not included in room rate.

The service at the wedding was exemplary. Very high class product and delivery when serving 130 people at the same time. High praise should go to their functions team.

Finally for me what distinguished this hotel from others is their overwhelming need to please their guests ; when the wedding function was over and the hotel bars were closed  (1am Monday morning )  I asked the concierge a nearby place to go for a drink and they said they would continue to serve us in one of the hotel bars on a limited menu. It was a really nice move as we had all come a long way around the world for this wedding and were not quite wanting it to be over! So Thank you 

It's definitely high end in price but then so is the hotel and service. You can't be disappointed here. 
",5,2015,10,04
143,Treated like second class citizens,Beautiful place just stay away from the lounge and dinner areas you are easily treated like common trash asked for a table to have drinks had to wait for a table and then the table was given to another couple that walked in well after us. then shoved over by an aggressive bartender. This place is insulting and tends to only cater to elitist. ,2,2015,10,03
143,"Classical elegance and modern refinement, fabulous !","We returned to the Corinthia for a four day stay in London, this September.  We had stayed at this hotel a year ago and chose it again because of its wonderful combination of elegance and modern refinement.  

The hotel is in a great location, near tourist sights , yet in a quiet location.  The rooms are spacious and wonderfully appointed.  The spa, swimming pool, and exercise facilities are fabulous. The bathroom is probably the finest we have ever experienced in the many five star hotels we have stayed. The restaurants are excellent ( reviewed separately).  This time around we found all equally wonderful as our first stay.

Unfortunately on arrival there had been a miscommunication about our intended room.  The hotel was full and the hotel manager was unable to give us what we had wanted our  first night.  However, because of this inconvenience we were given an extraordinary upgrade for the remainder of our stay.  The management went out of its way to be sure that the remainder of our stay exceeded our expectations. We found that the Corinthia did all the little things that make a hotel truly extraordinary. It is the type of place that prides itself on learning your name and greeting you personally when you come and go.

For those who seek understated luxury, elegance, and fine amenities, our experience with the Corinthia would suggest you will not be disappointed in the least with this wonderful hotel.",5,2015,10,03
143,"Refined, elegant, just so good.","I stayed here for a business trip in a mini suite. Level 5 with a part view of London Eye and the lovely South Bank. At night they are all lit up and provide a lovely back drop view. Rooms are spacious, well equipped, comfortable beds and absolutely awesome bathrooms with a choice of deep marble bath, or separate shower room. Espa toiletries add to the luxury that is the Corinthia. Nespresso coffee machine which bales the resident to get there caffeine hit on tap. Room service is very swift and efficient, food here is always of a very high standard. The staff are all so helpful too. The reception, foyer area is just wonderful to sit and watch the world go by...so relaxing too. The spa, pool area is absolutely jaw dropping too.....the best spa in London",5,2015,10,01
143,January in London,"I hesitate to write this review for fear of many flocking to one of my favorite destinations, in one of the worlds most amazing cities during the off season.  I have been to London a couple times before, but never have I enjoyed my visit more.  Never mind the smaller crowds at the British Museum or the Tower of London, but dining and just touring the city is much easier.  I digress, this review is about how amazing the Corinthia Hotel of London is, but the backdrop of London only adds to the experience.  After a day of walking around viewing amazing artifacts from across the globe the doorman greats you and invites you in to a luxurious sanctuary.  The Corinthia is a refined beauty that that is a convenient walk to Trafalgar Square and Parliament.  It is a premier temporary residence that has all the finishings.  The marble bathrooms with built in flat screen televisions, the surround sound systems in your room, to the Lex Luther style three level underground spa complete with marble lounge chairs by the fire place are all a welcome embrace after a day facing the elements.  I left asking, why can't all of like be this good?",5,2015,09,29
143,Perfect place to chill,This weekend was our third visit at the corinthia . We love this hotel . The staff is very friendly and The lobby is a perfect place to hang out with friends for coffee or wine. The rooms are good and very Well decorated. The Spa is the best spa I have been to in a long time . The gym has all The equipment you need for a good  workout . The breakfast is olso Great . I hope that the room prices Will go down so we can visit more often!!,5,2015,09,28
143,Luxury and Comfort in Central London,"The Corinthia Hotel, nestled in an idyllic grand historic neighborhood, was a perfect spot for visiting central London. Trafalgar Square, the National Gallery, Big Ben, Mayfair and the Theatre District are all within walking distance. Alternatively, you can cross the  Golden Jubilee Bridge which is right outside the hotel and walk the promenade to the Tate Museum, Borough Market and the Shard. It is also a convenient location for people who need to reach the financial district. For longer distances, there are several Tube stations nearby.

The service level is warm and attentive throughout the hotel. We enjoyed every public space, but our favorite spots were the incredible ESPA spa (the Thermal Floor is spectacular) and the Northall Bar. Round this out with afternoon tea in the Lobby Lounge topped with an unbelievable Baccarat chandelier.

The room style is contemporary residential with bits of historical notes. The room sizes are large for London. Couple of favorite details: Walk in closet (not in all rooms), easy-to-use lighting (amazing how complicated it can be these days), separate toilet, and 110 volt plugs (their ""media hub"" is all well thought out).

Wonderful 5 night stay - I recommend this special hotel to friends whenever I can!",5,2015,09,27
143,Immaculate,This is a beautiful hotel of that there is no doubt. Every time I visit for food or an evening drink it is wonderful passing through its rooms and experiencing the atmosphere the team here have created. The service is always very attentive and the food/drink I have sampled here has been excellent.,5,2015,09,22
143,Wow!  Beautiful and wonderful!,"We were expecting a lot from this hotel because of its reputation and reviews.  And we were not disappointed in almost all aspects of our five night stay.  At first our room seemed a little small with entryway, walk-in closet, bath (with tub, shower, WC, and double sinks), and bedroom.  But as we settled in, it was a wonderful layout and our place of repose when returning from a tiring day.
I must say I overworked the concierge desk with a lost baggage issue and they were most helpful.  Finally, after five days of frustration and countless phone calls by the concierge, it was returned.  But the concierge helped not only with this but all our needs.  Thanks to you all!
The restaurants in the hotel were excellent and we ate there numerous meals - which we seldom do on trips.  But each time we had very good to exceptional food and superb service.  One memorable lunch was at Massimo's and was one of the best for the trip (shrimp and citrus starter and broiled squid which was truly exceptional) and most reasonably priced (executive lunch menu)
We spend a lot of time in the lobby bar having a glass of wine after dinners.  The chandelier is a work of art and we felt very special just sitting with it.
I don't think we've ever seen a more finely decorated room (actually the whole hotel).  And the shower was one of the best we've ever seen.  Whomever did the design and decorating  deserves an award.
Our only area of ""less-than-stellar"" would be the room-service breakfast.  It was very prompt and the coffee, tea, and other items were excellent but the omelets and eggs where just not very satisfying.  We tried eggs as omelets, scrambled, fried, and poached but they just were just not how we liked them.  This is a small complaint in the overall experience but eggs are just not that hard to cook!  The staff did send a whole service of tea cakes to make up for our dissatisfaction one day, so they were trying!
The location, as noted by many, is very central to many of the attractions.  So it is a very good base for that.  Can't say we liked the neighborhood for strolling and finding restaurants.  Of course, this is a busy, somewhat touristy part of London.  It is a good thing taxis are readily available to enable visits to other areas.  For most people this location would be great, but our having some mobility issues, taxis are required (while most could walk).
In summary, you get what you have paid for and those things are exceptionally delivered.  It is not a bargain hotel and probably doesn't have that as a goal.  If you want a very sophisticated, beautiful, service-oriented hotel and you are willing to pay for it, this is your place.  We would certainly return.",5,2015,09,19
143,"London, Up Close. But Just.","The British Parliament, Big Ben, South Bank, Westminster, London Eye, Thames, Trafalgar Square, etc etc. You get it right?

These are all the places one likes to visit once in London. Now what if your hotel is not minutes, but steps away from there? That's Corinthia for you. 

I was on a business visit to London this September and stayed over at the Corinthia. 

Now for the hotel itself. To put it mildly, it is old. Really Really old. 

In fact parts of hotel were so old I wouldn't be surprised if the government ordered carbon dating to determine age. 

Rooms - especially the one I got - 104 was it? They are small. Way small for a super luxury hotel. It had a tall ceiling - now only if that could compensate for the lack of space. 

What's surprising was the room layout. You enter, left is the cupboard, on your right is your room, bear left and you would see a bathroom half the size of the room. I mean, who does that. 

If that wasn't enough, the bath tub has a TV that plays out hotel advert with music blaring out from the ceiling speakers. Surely we could have lived without that.

The real cool thing though was ceiling mounted hot water sprinklers - that was nice. 

On the outside, the lift informs you of the floors not by using a digital meter, but a huge dial. 

Now many would say - it adds to the charm for those who romance things in period. For those type of people - it can be home away from home. 

Corinthia had nice open areas in the middle of the building. Just gave the hotel rooms some breathing space. 

In all, Thank you Corinthia for being so close to every place a person wants to see in London. You saved me my journey in the tube, the bus, a taxi to see all the iconic places.",4,2015,09,18
143,It doesn't get better than this!,"This was our second stay at the Corinthia Hotel, London. I cannot stress enough what a gorgeous hotel this is. The rooms are beautifully decorated and very high tech.  The bed in the room was incredible comfortable. The staff is highly attentive and very helpful. The Corinthia is perfectly situated in the heart of London. Everywhere that we wanted to go was a short walk away or easily accessible by the Embankment tube station. My absolute favorite part of the hotel is there spa and thermal floor. The first time we stayed here, I did not budget enough time to truly appreciate all of the thermal floors amenities. That was a mistake. This time around we spent a couple hours a day luxuriating on the thermal floor. They have heated, jetted pools that face a cozy firewall. Steam rooms, saunas and sleep pods that are divine. This is the ultimate in relaxation partly in fact that it is a child free zone for all but an hour or so a day. The hotel is pricey but in my opinion, money well spent. We will surely be returning for another stay.",5,2015,09,17
143,Simply Beautiful!,"We loved this hotel. The location was perfect for walking to many locations and is literally minutes from the Embankment Station tube stop. Great for exploring the West End and theater district. The specialty restaurant Massimo was delightful. My only caveat is be prepared for a very expensive stay. 35 pounds for breakfast!! We walked down the street for the ambiance of a local coffee shop. Gorgeous, huge room with walk in closet. The outdoor heated patio was super for after theater drinks.",5,2015,09,17
143,A Perfect Stay,"We had one night in a standard room at the Corinthia - it's a stunning hotel, classy without being overly garish, and refreshingly (compared to some major London hotels) the staff are very helpful and considerate - you never feel out of place, or that anything is too much trouble. Lots of small bits, like beds being turned down, bespoke chocolates on the pillow etc, all add up.

The rooms are of an excellent size - ours had a dedicated dressing room, and a bathroom with separate shower rooms etc all finished to the highest standard. I really liked the 'mood' lighting settings too.

If you have a chance to go to the spar, do it - it's the most bizarre underground complex spanning four floors: we were perfectly happy just swanning around in the infinity pool/hydrotherapy pool/sauna, and it's a great place to kill a couple of hours before dinner.

The breakfast buffet is excellent and sets you up for the whole day, with a fairly bewildering array of options. It's our new favourite place in London!

Location-wise, it's hard to beat - easy access to embankment and walking distance of  Picadilly/Trafalgar.",5,2015,09,17
143,First class hotel. Can't fault it. ,"Beautifully located. As soon as you walk up to the entrance, you know you are entering somewhere special.
Attention to detail is the name of the game at this hotel.
One negative is that the lobby lifts can be a little slow at busy times.
The reception area is immaculate. The room are spacious.  I was lucky to get a free upgrade to a suite. 
The beds they us in the rooms really Hypnos, and I can  confirm that they are in the top  2 beds I have ever slept in. 6 hours sleep and feel a if I have had 10.
Breakfast had a wide selection  of hot and cold food. I always think you can tell a lot from the breakfast. The bacon was thick  deluxe slices..the black pudding was lush. Eggs were done perfectly.

As I said, I can't fault this place.",5,2015,09,17
143,Location and luxury- at a price,"I found this hotel to be excellent- courteous staff, excellent, clean room, good desk and adequate Wi-Fi for working, and a good breakfast.
Great location in Whitehall Place, close to Trafalgar Square, Houses of Parliament and Westminster Abbey. 
You get what you pay for, but it is certainly expensive- a Minibar wine (Malbec) is approximately 10X the high street price.",5,2015,09,15
143,"Gorgeous Hotel, Amazing Spa","The Corinithia is a gorgeous hotel with all the amenities you'd expect from a hotel of it's caliber. The rooms are beautifully appointed all with absolutely gorgeous bathrooms - you can expect heated floors, large bathtubs and luxurious showers. Thoughtfully stocked mini bar and Nespresso machines in all rooms make you feel pampered and at home. Housekeeping was prompt with all requests and room service was fast and superbly delicious - the Chinese breakfast shouldn't be missed. We used the house car quite a bit and all of the drivers were exceptional with excellent recommendations for everything from travel around the city to restaurants and attractions. Service was excellent at both Bassoon and the Northall Bar and food and cocktails were delicious. The one shortcoming we experienced was with the readiness of our rooms  - I was traveling with friends and their 2 year old who had just gotten sick on the way into the hotel upon our arrival. At a hotel such as this, one would expect some sense of urgency on the part of staff to get us into our rooms and settled given the situation. Additionally, I would have expected some follow up to inquire how she was feeling, if a doctor was required and whether any of our clothes needed cleaning. This level of customer service would truly have set the Corinthia apart from other luxury hotels. All that being said, we truly enjoyed our stay at the Corinthia and would return in the future.

The hotel is perfectly located within walking distance of Covent Garden, Trafalgar Square, The London Eye, Big Ben, Noel Coward Theater, 10 Downing Street, etc. Don't miss the spa, even if you don't book a treatment - the sauna, steam room, pool and vitality pool are amazing and completely relaxing. Spa staff was amazing and I felt completely transported while there.",4,2015,09,13
143,Excellent stay,"Hotel is just amazing and in good location. Very spacious interior.
Room was lovely, bed very comfortable and big. 
Staff members are just spot on, very good service, very welcoming,helpful,polite.
Breakfast was good, nice selection for everyones taste.
Had a pleasant stay and would come back.",5,2015,09,13
143,Visited on a business trip and was impressed with both the room and the service at all levels.,"Visited on a short business trip and from the moment I arrived the service was impressive. I was shown to my room at 10.30 am, my luggage was there before me and the room was more than adequate with a large bathroom and a separate dressing room. The service in all area's exceeded my expectations and I cannot thank the staff enough for making my short stay fabulous, to the extent that I have just booked again on my own dollar to go back next month for a weekend. Thank you Corinthia !",5,2015,09,11
143,Best breakfast ever,"Wow the breakfast buffet blew me away!!!! Best salmon I ever tasted!!!! Berries and fruits awesome and I having even started with the rest of the offering. Suburb!!!

Room great and everything working!!! Awesome shower and great bed. 

Well done to the hotel and the team. ",5,2015,09,10
143,Exceeded Expectations!!!,"This was one of the best hotels we have ever visited.  From the moment we arrived it was nothing but 5 star treatment.   Our private car service was very late picking us up from the airport so in addition to being  jetlagged we also lost all of that excitement energy while waiting.  When we arrived at the hotel our room was available for early check in (and it was early).  When booking our room I opted for the Executive King instead of the King Suite with the thought of upgrading upon arrival if the Executive King was too small.  We were very pleased with the spaciousness of the Executive King.  Not only was the bedroom portion of the room large, well appointed and exactly as pictured on the website, but the bedroom area was separated from an extremely large bathroom by the entrance hallway which also contained a well-lit, spacious walk in closet. The overall room configuration separated the closet, bathroom and bedroom!  So glad we didn't spend extra for the full suite.  

The bathroom itself was very large and had a large soaking tub, large shower, double sink and of course private area.  A wonderful feature was the heated towel rack which would hold multiple towels!!!  

The hotel has a lovely interior courtyard area which we enjoyed for a quick lunch bite, afternoon cocktails and evening champagne.  The main lobby area was well appointed and offered a wonderful afternoon tea and again champagne!  

We had breakfast twice at the hotel.  The day we arrived we ordered a la carte and another morning we had the breakfast buffet.  Breakfasts were adequate but not as well appointed as we would have liked for the cost.

I would be remiss if I didn't thank the wonderful concierge staff of the Corinthia Hotel.  From play recommendations to local restaurants their suggestions were always excellent!!  They truly enhanced our London experiences with their recommendations.

Lastly, we found this hotel to be perfectly located to experience  the famous tourist spots, parks, theaters, restaurants and both sides of the Thames.  We walked it all!!!

We wouldn't hesitate to return to the Corinthia on our next trip or recommend it to family and friends.  It truly exceeded our expectations!",5,2015,09,09
143,Outstanding service!,"My husband and I stayed for 3 nights to celebrate our anniversary.  It was our first time in London and I did a lot of research ahead of time.  This hotel came out on top every time.  The hotel is beautiful.  The staff is very polite and attentive.  We noticed the difference when we entered the Ritz for Tea and not one person bothered to greet us. We were dressed very appropriately so we were quite shocked by the difference in service.  

The rooms were spacious and there is a lot of attention to detail.  For instance we received something different each night with the turn down service.  The breakfast buffet was nice with a good selection.  

If I could only make 1 negative comment it would be that both my husband and I were underwhelmed by the massage at the spa.  Having experienced one of the best massages at the fairmont in banff- every other one is mediocre.  I enjoy it when the masseuse is versed in kinesiology or physical therapy because they can really work on the muscles.  

Great hotel! Spa needs work- at least the massage part.  Liked it so much I am reviewing on my day of departure.",5,2015,09,08
143,Afternoon tea,"Went for afternoon tea with my boyfriend.Beautiful room, excellent tea and great service. Scones were dry though and pastries, very small and not particularly good quality which was a letdown. The waitress told us they had a new pastry chef who has just started so hopefully it will be better the next time we visit.",3,2015,09,08
143,Five star all the way!,"I had visited The Corinthia before so knew I was in for a treat but my husband had never been so we booked an overnight stay for our wedding anniversary. From the moment we arrived, we could not have been made to feel more welcome. Ryan on Reception had only been there for two weeks but was knowledgable, chatty yet professional. Nothing was too much trouble. We were very happy with our room. A huge space with opulent furnishings and the comfiest bed I have ever slept in! The bathroom was equally huge and decorated in white marble. We spent a few hours in the spa which is something very special. Beautiful facilities, mood lighting and a feeling of total luxury. A real must experience if you stay here. We didn't eat at the hotel but after dinner we returned to the very stylish Bassoon Bar for delicious cocktails and the most wonderful singer. Breakfast the following day was another wonderful experience. There is everything you could wish for at the buffet but if you do want something else, the a la carte menu will satisfy your appetite. Again, the restaurant staff were incredibly pleasant. This hotel is absolutely a five star experience but it also manages to make you feel at home and this is not something you experience at every five star hotel.",5,2015,09,08
143,Comfortable elegance,"This hotel is so perfectly located that it's hard to imagine staying anywhere else.  It's also gorgeous, comfortable and has attentive and friendly service.  The rooms are comfortable, with wonderful bed linens, a well-appointed bathroom  (with heated floors!), and a very roomy and special closet.  It's truly special without being stuffy.",5,2015,09,07
143,Feels like home,"I have been fortunate to be able too stay at the marvellous Corinthia twice in a year. Always get excited when staying ,always feels like I'm coming home. Great staff. Especially Max Concierge. Always go above and beyond to help . Do your self a favour and stay at this quite special place . Looking forward to my next visit. Thank you Corinthia.Aphra Natsis",5,2015,09,07
143,Wow! Among the best places I have ever stayed...,"The Corinthia is best summed up in one word - SERVICE. The staff are very adept in being attentive to your every wish and this, coupled with the crisp, elegant decor and quiet, understated luxury makes this hotel one of the best places I have ever stayed. The bedrooms are cozy and comfortable with high-thread count linens, plush terry cloth towels and thick carpeting. The dining options are impeccable including the splendid breakfast buffet and the Spa is second to none. I have been pampering myself on this trip working out in the gym followed by relaxing on the thermal floor. From the moment you enter the hotel, located just off of a busy, noisy street, you feel the quiet and calm enveloping you.... I would live here if I could!
",5,2015,09,06
143,Beautiful hotel,"without any doubt this is a beautiful hotel.  All the staff are excellent and go the extra mile to make your stay a very happy one.  It is as many have already said very central to most of the sights and theatres.  
We had a mini suite which was spotless overlooking the courtyard and it was so quiet  you would hardly believe you were in London. The bathroom was the best I have ever used.  The littles extras that were in the room such as fresh fruit and champhane were a lovely touch. 
The cons though were.....1) the rooms apart from the bathroom were very dark and the light could be turned down but not up. 2) I found the WI FI very hit and miss and spent a lot of frustrating time trying to get it in the bedroom. It was fine down in the hotel reception. 3) mobile phone reception was also hit and miss in the suite but okay on the balcony but a bit inconvenient standing in the rain.
4) The dressing area almost drove me mad as the light only stayed on for a few seconds and then went out so had to keep going in and out for the light to come on again, obviously set on a timer by someone who is a very fast dresser! There is a very good hairdryer but as the room is so dark and nowhere to sit and dry it near a mirror it is very difficult to dry your hair. It would be much better if there was a hairdryer in the bathroom like most other hotels especially as this was the lightest room.
5) I also think that at over a £1,000 a night that breakfast should be included, I know that a lot of London hotels do charge but why not be different especially as the suite costs so much.6) the porridge is the worst I have ever tasted but the rest of breakfast is very good. 
Would we stay here again, probably not as we expected perfection from this standard of hotel.  Maybe it was just the suite we had and others may be better. But having said all this the staff are wonderful.",4,2015,09,05
143,"A first class hotel, a new standard for London","The hotel was not only one of the nicest in London, it reminded me of the standard 5 star hotels used to live up to. 

From the moment you enter the hotel you are given a high standard of care and courtesy. The staff are well trained and are clearly under great management programs as they all have a air of confidence and professionalism.

The rooms were well appointed, unique and with special touches that remind you of the standards the hotel aspires to. The beds are ultra comfortable and the sheet are ultra soft.

The bathrooms are spacious and the showers are very modern with ""rainfall"" settings so you never want to get out.

The flowers, the cafe and the lobby are all part of the ambiance of this lovely and spacious hotel

The standard has been set in London.. great work",5,2015,09,04
143,Service,"Currently resolving an issue with this hotel and will provide full review shortly once I have a full understanding of how they deal with matters of safety and service. 
At present both my wife and I are in direct contact with management and I am sure having stayed at this establishment many times before, it will be fully resolved to the standard one would expect from a 5 star establishment.",2,2015,09,04
143,Premium hotel,"Two years ago I was invited with my wife to a conference business in London.
We stayed at the Corinthia Hotel.
Rooms were very nice and elegant. Food was excelent.
It is very well located, near to restaurants and other enterteinments.
I repeat the experience last year just because of fun.",5,2015,09,03
143,"Great hotel, great location!",Could not be a better location for new and seasoned London travelers to stay!  Its steps from both Embankment Underground and Waterloo Train Stations.  Service is 5 star.  Food is wonderful.  This was our second time there and they have only gotten better!,5,2015,09,01
143,Business trip in London,"I had to go to London for a quick business trip. I knew nothing about the Corinthia hotel until my company put me up there. It was a great discovery and pleasure to stay at the Corinthia Hotel. From the moment I checked in, the staff was a pleasure. My room was ready very early in the morning when i arrived. The room was great... Walk in closet, heated tile floors in the bathroom, huge tub, big shower. The bed was very comfortable.
Never heard or saw the maids but my room was always cleaned and turned down.
The Italian rest. was amazing. It's called Massimo. The pasta was great and ended up eating there twice. The Bassoon Bar was also great. Teh bartender's are more like Mixologists. The staff always remembered my drink of choice. Great live music every night. Whether you're staying there for business or pleasure, you'll love this hotel.",5,2015,09,01
143,Still my favorite hotel in London,"I have stayed all over London and I have enjoyed every hotel I've visited. The Corinthia has become my favourite. The staff and service are incredible. The doormen greeting you, the concierges helping you, the front desk staff and the bar and restaurant staff are exceptional. For our stay, the lovely Zita in Guest relations chose excellent rooms for me and my family. I stayed for 15 nights and each night was exceptional. The restaurants and bars are outstanding. The location in my opinion is the best in London because it is near everything. I ran to and around Hyde Park ten times; we walked along the Thames; we biked to Holborn and we were a stones throw from Trafalger Square and everything else. We walked everywhere. The only complaint about the hotel is that the spa is too big and too dark! It is set on four floors with the beautiful pool area in the basement. It is very beautiful and extensive but for me, the stairs were a bit of a chore. 

I love staying at the Corinthia and I will return often!",5,2015,08,31
143,Out of a movie,"I have stayed at the Corinthia several times now for business. It is absolutely stunning. The chandeliers and fresh flowers in the lobby really help set a gorgeous, contemporary atmosphere. The rooms are definitely large by London standards. The bathroom is almost as big as the bedroom. They have a rainforest showerhead as well as the handheld showerhead.  There is a tv in the wall next the tub. On my most recent trip, I ended up having to order room service several times.  The burger was excellent.  The pizza was not so great - it reminded me of frozen ones back from college. I did try the restaurant downstairs once for breakfast and I became a lover of eggs benedict because of them. The service is excellent - everyone is extremely professional and courteous.  They even have a mini-Harrod's on site. I would love to bring my family here one day.",5,2015,08,30
143,"Just ""wow"". ","Visited here with my Wife for a weekend break. 

The hotel is a wonderful old building located in the heart of Whitehall, just a stone's throw from many tourist attractions (Leicester Square, Downing Street, Palace of Westminster etc.). The decor is a contemporary nod to the hotel's art deco past - and it really 'works'. The public spaces in this hotel are without doubt the best we have ever seen. 

OK, so we were lucky in that our late arrival on Friday evening meant it was complementary upgrade time! We booked an Executive Double but ended up with an Executive Suite. The room was absolutely beautiful: comfy bed, good linens, underfloor heating in the sumptuous bathroom, great AV system, massive walk-in wardrobe..........there really was nothing missing! Even at the list price this room would be good value, never mind as an upgrade! Also, this is easily the quietest hotel we've stayed in: not a door bang, rumbling suitcase or stiletto click from the room above was heard. 

Staff were brilliant and also dressed very smartly. 

Breakfast was a very comprehensive buffet affair with everything you could image, all top quality too. 

The spa facilities are a treat (with hydrotherapy pools, sauna, steam room etc. all available to guests free of charge) and I can highly recommend the deep tissue massage. 

As you can tell we were highly impressed with this hotel. In fact it is the best London  hotel we have ever stayed in, by a long shot. 

We will be back. Thanks Corinthia! ",5,2015,08,30
143,Fantastic ,"Awesome hotel. Antigone in reservation had liaised with my partner over email and was a pleasure to deal with. On our second day she made a point of coming to introduce herself to the hotel and meet us face to face. Such a great customer service person to have!  

Beautiful, clean hotel, amazing breakfast, exceptional service and facilities. Spa and gym were amazing. I loved the variety of gym equipment available. 

Restaurants and high tea also amazing. We didn't get a chance to try the high tea 
ourselves but walked past the lobby and saw many people enjoying the high tea! Looked amazing. Can't wait to visit again. Thank you Corinthia 

",5,2015,08,30
143,"As always a flawless stay, my favorite home away from home","This will be my 5th time staying at the Corinthia and each time my expectations are met. When you are spending time away from the comforts of home and in a different country, feeling comfortable in your hotel is very important! This is one of my favorite hotels from all of my global travels. 

Before I arrive at a hotel, I usually correspond with the concierge to arrange car service, or something or another. They are always very helpful & pleasant to deal with. This trip I had an unusual safety issue arise, but the minute I walked onto the property, the head of hotel security was ready and had ensured that things were safe for me for the remainder of my stay.

The rooms are beautifully appointed and the housekeeping does a phenomenal job, leaving the room immaculate with several cleanings per day. This is one of the only places I feel comfortable walking in the room without slippers because I am exceptionally clean & most hotels let the floors get dirtier than they should. 

I was there for work so had a lot of room service as I was short on time, and although it was the most expensive room service I have ever had, it was always very good. Plenty of options and very quick service times. 20-25 min at most. 

(I will separately review the restaurants but they are all very good as well)

I am an athlete and working out while traveling is very important to me, the gym is fully equipped with everything you need. The best gym I have seen while traveling period. The thermal floor is nothing short of AMAZING. SO very relaxing, I only wish it was open until 12a instead of 10p. 

Espa really has a handle on how things should be done at a spa. I was fortunate enough to have time to book a massage with one of the best therapists I have seen, Angel. Educated & very professional. 

Really can't say enough about the courteous & helpful staff and condition that the hotel is kept in. The location is great, right near Trafalgar Square, within walking distance of the London Eye & other great sites. 

Everything about this place is A+ and they have a loyal customer in me for sure!",5,2015,08,29
143,World Class Location and Service,"Can't say enough about our experience with the Corinthia.  For starters, the location can't be beat -- you're less than five minutes walking from the Eye, Trafalgar Square, Big Ben, and so much more.  Next, the staff is extraordinary -- in particular the concierge Sahil performed miracles and was spot on with every recommendation.  The rooms are classy, though those on the inside suffer from lousy views.  There's also celebrity chic -- besides the Bond connection, it seems like every movie shot in London holds its press conferences here, so you never know who you might see in the lobby or at breakfast,,,,",5,2015,08,27
143,Perfect Business Hotel,"Don't normally review hotels I use for business but I love this place. 
Always try and stay here while working in London.  
The brand is exceptional and have used other Corinthia Hotels in Europe for leisure. 
They all have their own special touches, this one is the business travellers dream. 
Central,locations, great quite rooms, large too which in Central London isn't easy. 
Ok, it's not the cheapest,,but it's the best. 
Staff are of course professional and service I find is always superb. 
As a female travelling alone I always feel safe here. 
Food is great, room service too. 
Would definitely recommend.",5,2015,08,25
143,Wonderfull hotel and really profesional housekeeping,"I visit London last week and i booked my holiday at your hotel. What can i say. Perfect. My room was more then i was expecting , food wonderfull . Your staff its well traind and it make us feel its worted. Specialy we want to say thank you and well done to our housekeeper Violeta , her smile and her pasion for what she is doing was over the limit. Thank you Corinthia for everythink. ",5,2015,08,24
143,Really first class hotel,"This is an absolutely gorgeous hotel. The location is perfect---walk to Big Ben, Houses of Parliament, Westminster Abbey, Trafalgar Square, the theatre district, the London Eye, the Westminster Pier on the Thames, the embankment tube station, and St. James Park.
The room was exquisite. Huge bed, larger than King. 

We were booked into this hotel via American Express, where we got a 4 day stay for a 3 day pricing. Still very very expensive. Normally, 510 pounds a night, which is $800 a night.",5,2015,08,24
143,"Beautiful hotel, all the modern amenities, perfect location","We stayed here 2 nights while we were in London.  We wish we could have stayed longer.  It was wonderful.  Beautifully done.  The lobby tea was amazing and not to be missed.  It is so centrally located I could not have picked a better place to stay if we tried!  
Everyone who worked there was lovely.  Room service was great.  The showers are the best around, especially after a long flight!  Big thumbs up",5,2015,08,24
143,Wow! Just perfect touch ,"Hubby and I stayed here and everything was just delightful!!! Service top notch. Cleanliness was perfect. Afternoon tea was just right. There's a little bakery shop in the hotel that has impeccable cookie display!!!! It was gorgeous. Distance to main city attraction is ideal, we walked to pretty much everything. ",5,2015,08,22
143,Best hotel in London,"Stayed there many times, every time having a fantastic experience. Located right next to Trafalgar Square and several subway hubs, a few minute walk to St James Park, the palace, and the parliament. Two restaurants (British and Italian) offer amazing food, the bar is excellent (if you are in a hurry if can get restaurant food at the bar or at the lobby as well). The rooms are large and combine a classic style with various modern touches. Highly recommend to everyone.  ",5,2015,08,22
143,"Great service, great location, great experience","We recently spent a week at the Corinthia. It is rare that I stay this long at any hotel and never have a single negative experience. This was the first time. The hotel - the lobby, the rooms (we had 3 connecting), the restaurants and lounges - was extraordinary. When you consider it's equally extraordinary location and the attentive and professional staff, I can't imagine a better hotel in London. We cannot wait to get back to London because it is a great city with much to see and do, but we really can't wait to get back to the Corinthia.",5,2015,08,21
143,Excellent service,"This is a great property beginning with the reservations department down to the concierge. We stayed at the Berkeley hotel several years ago but never again. The staff here are professional, pleasant, and truly service oriented. The location is excellent. The room is well appointed, dark wood paneling with a modern clean feel. We were in a deluxe suite, stayed with children, and never felt out of step. The only remark I have is that the walk in closet light is sensor operated and kept turning off while I was inside. This was tedious when I was trying to find something in my suitcase as the light kept turning off. There should be a switch to keep the light on longer, or perhaps there is.",5,2015,08,20
143,Comfortable stay,"We initially booked the Whitehall Suite.  It seemed the most appealing to us and met our needs (1/2 bath and an extra sitting room for our 13 year old son) and we loved the decor.  When we arrived we were upgraded to the Trafalgar Suite.  I think I would have preferred the decor, layout and location of the Whitehall Suite, but was told they were fully booked.  

Our room was comfortable enough.  It was hard to really hang out comfortably as a family with the curved couch and glass table.  The heavier drapes and smaller windows seemed to block out a lot of natural light.  The bathrooms and bedrooms were very nice, but we could never figure out the lighting system.  

Service was good, but perfunctory.  They were always in and out very quickly, sometimes too quickly to ask all of the questions you needed.

I really enjoyed the location near the Thames and the Embankment station, my husband prefers to be a little farther into Covent Garden.  

The room met all of our needs and the hotel was beautiful.  The concierge helped us with a box and shipping some of our extra purchases home.

I would stay again, but would really prefer the Whitehall Suite next time.",4,2015,08,20
143,Has to be the best in London,"Once you've experienced Corinthia London, there is no going back. After a wonderful stay last June for our Anniversary/Husband's birthday, we simply had to return this year.

Everything I said in my last review still stands: in my opinion, this hotel cannot be beaten. It comes at a price, but we feel that price is worth it for the overall superb experience you receive.  It goes way beyond a room for the night for us. The bathroom is a highlight, and I spend as much time as possible in the amazing tub, with TV, whilst sipping on the Champagne that we added onto our booking. The general amenities are also top notch.

We arrived early, but as we had plans did not need access to our room - instead, we said we'd prefer to be able to checkout late the next day after a business lunch in the Northall, which they duly noted.  We had been told we'd received a double upgrade to a room on the 6th floor, (upgrades, where available, are one of the benefits when booking directly with the hotel). When we returned that afternoon, we were given a different room on the 7th floor.  Not sure what room type it was, and we did miss the larger bed we had last time, but as with all rooms at Cornthia, it was supremely comfortable and this particular one had a view to die for whilst in London, and did allow us the aforementioned late checkout the following afternoon.

We enjoyed the spa, the Bassoon Bar, the Northall - (which is always a highlight for us).  The food, ambience and service are perfect in there, and it's always on our if we visit London, even just for the day.

Would we go back?  Absolutely: I think it will become a yearly tradition - with more stays in between if time, babysitting Grandparents and funds allow!",5,2015,08,20
143,They don't get better than this...,"The Corinthia reminded me of a larger, more glorious Carlyle Hotel (NYC).  Everything was perfection.  The rooms are large and well appointed and getting a connecting room with my children was no problem.  Wifi is included and had no issues. The hotel is approx 4 years old so everything is fresh and new.  The breakfast buffet was excellent and staff were attentive and eager to please. The location is right near a footbridge that isn't far from the Eye with lots of restaurants nearby.  Also within walking distance to several museums and great shopping.  My husband is a frequent business traveler to London (previously stayed at Savoy, Dorcester, Four Seasons) and he felt the service and amenities topped them all.  I did not have a chance to use the spa but took a tour and it was gorgeous.

This hotel has spoiled me as few hotels will be able to measure up.",5,2015,08,19
143,Service with a smile!,"We stayed 3 nights and it was absolutely perfect!  Great location and a truly professional staff that can take care of your every need - the attention to detail is outstanding.  Best part for me, I left my camera in a taxi - the bellman assured me it would be returned and it was.  We had already left to return home to the USA, but I received a call the day after we arrived notifying me that my camera had been found and I received it within 2 days time.  The efficiency of the staff is unmatched!  Thank you Corinthia - you will definitely see us again!",5,2015,08,19
143,Great stay for our family,"We recently stayed at the Corinthia for four nights with our three teenagers. The hotel was terrific - rooms were beautiful, the staff was very helpful and the location was perfect for all of our outings. Breakfast was great as was the evening drinks on the patio. Can't wait to go back!",5,2015,08,18
143,Rich Repas!,"Lunch in the Northall Restaurant of the Corinthia Hotel was a sublime treat!  

The sophisticated decor enhanced by giant blushing hydrangeas created a feeling of entering a luxurious oasis. 

Efficient, friendly staff clearly enjoy helping to create the ethereal gastronomic experience.

I had the two-course £25 Express Lunch.  What a TREAT!

The cornish mackerel/jersey salad/fresh horseradish/squid ink starter was a blend which sent my tastebuds into a frenzy. 

My main of roast hake/cauliflower puree/salted mango/capers/pine nuts with a side dish of spinach was superb! 

Daughter devoured her steak tatare starter and grilled seabass with a look of sheer bliss...

I glanced at the pretty desserts which beckoned from the next table but had no room...

I highly recommend this culinary oasis! ",5,2015,08,18
143,Outstanding,"Another great stay for us and our clients at this prestigious hotel. The bedrooms are great and location perfect.

The staff, service and hotel is outstanding and most  definitely worth a stay if in town.

A must for all !!",5,2015,08,18
143,Elegant inner city hotel,"A sophisticated hotel ideally positioned for proximity to the major tourist attractions and also close to the city for business,  we found the location ideal and were able to walk to most attractions.  Catching a cab to the further away locations was easy and a short trip.  Service was generally excellent as was the room.  We recommend requesting a room on a high floor and we looked out on Whitehall which was quiet.  Rooms are a very good size.  We enjoyed meals at both Northall and Massimos.  Food at both was excellent and the staff knowledgeable.  We specially would like to compliment the doorman who was of great assistance when taxi's were in short supply.  We would recommend the hotel for couples and business travellers.",5,2015,08,18
143,Simply elegant...,"This is the best hotel I've every stayed in.... The staff is lovely and accommodating, room impeccable and location is perfect. I would recommend this to hotel to anyone. I could live here... The restaurant is so good though, I would become a bit obese. :)",5,2015,08,16
143,Wonderful hotel with great design,"We felt like in a true designer world when entering the lobby! One of the world´s best hotel, I would say. The breakfast is simply breathtaking, everything you can think of is at your demand. We had a lovely suite with a walk-in-closet, a big bathroom and a big living/sleeping room. Housekeeping and all other service stuff were wonderful! We had the chance to eat at Massimo restaurant with it´s great Art Deco style. The Chef Andrea met us in person and told us about his philosophy. I cannot remember a better Italian menu in my entire life. I also got the chance to visit the Spa - the massage was great, the therapist really caring. 

All in all a wonderful hotel in a great are (Trafalgar Square, etc. around the corner).",5,2015,08,16
143,Pampered and Spoilt,"What a hotel! So when we arrived the city centre was shut down for a Charity Bike Race and the driver from the hotel could not get us to the hotel. We circled for awhile than gave up. We got out and walked maybe 4 blocks. Now this is early Sunday morning, not quite 9 am yet and our reservation is for that night. When we got to the front desk they advised us that our room as ready! Really! Wow at 9 am in the morning we got checked in . Then came the room, can you say UPGRADE? Another WOW, they put us in the penthouse suite, a luxury apartment , two stories of divine decadence. Now we had booked a suite but this was another level of opulence again. Now that is classy. They also threw in a drive to our dinner the following evening. Our butler was marvelous. Thank you Anna. The hotel decor is stunning, the restaurants are beautiful. The food was very good. All in all a great experience. We will be back.",5,2015,08,15
143,"A True Gem in the Heart of London, England","This was our third stay at the Corinthia. The first two stays there where truly amazing! The first two times we stayed in an executive room, which was well worth the price.  However when we arrived for our third stay here we where disappointed. Since we had previously stayed in the executive room, and had a good experience, We naturally booked the same room. However this executive room was much smaller, although it had been the same price. Once we complained to the manager, our stay drastically improved. The manager on duty was very responsive and helpful. No later than one day had we been upgraded to a junior suite (they where out of large  executive rooms). This stay was the best one yet, due to the wonderful staff and a caring hotel. This is definitely not the last stay here!!!",5,2015,08,15
143,It just gets better,"My third visit, and it wont be my last.  My absolute favourite hotel by far.

I had a delicious lunch in the Lobby Bar accompanied by a glass of Champers, a wonderful spa treatment, and a truly delicious supper in Massimo before retiring to my beautiful room.

This hotel transports me to a state of relaxation that is usually only achievable via meditation!!

Love. Love. Love.

First class. Five star at its best.

143,Elegance and Opulence,"We came to this hotel on a family trip.  The rooms, furnishings, and staff all are excellent and luxurious.  They did little things well, like having kid-sized bathrobes and treats for our children.  The concierge was consistently helpful. It is expensive, but you do get what you pay for.",5,2015,08,12
143,This what it is all about,"Having been traveling to London on a regular bases the last 5-6 years, I have stayed in most of the 5 * hotels and this is my favorite. Good location for pleasure and business. The atmosphere is just modern luxury, bar and restaurant are great and the SPA is something you shouldn't miss. Staff is really professional, but in a friendly way, so you really feel welcomed. ",5,2015,08,12
143,"Excellent rooms, service and perhaps the best breakfast ever","My wife and I recently stayed at the Corinthia as part of a second honeymoon. From the outset the experience was outstanding. The room was luxurious and inviting. Everything worked and had first class amenities, fixtures and fittings. Awesome shower and brilliant bath. It was also great to be able to open the two sets of double french doors to let fresh air in.
The absolute highlight though was the breakfast. Each day we were there we would have a huge walk and then sit down to a sumptuous brekky - meats, breads, fruit, eggs a million ways, etc, etc. We would then be tempted by a serve of brilliant pancakes. We didn't need lunch afterwards it was so good. We have stayed in many great hotels around the world and always thought the W in HK had the best breakfast. We have a new winner!
The Spa and Gym are also incredible. All the equipment you could ask for and it is broken up into private little pods so you can have some privacy at each station.
Please do afternoon tea and desert in the main lounge area. One world - Incredible.
A brilliant hotel in all regards. We have booked to take the family back there on our next trip",5,2015,08,11
143,Luxurious,A beautiful hotel in lovely area of London . The waitress services is impeccable as is their appearance and that of the hotel. A fabulous place to take time out of a busy schedule sit back relax and enjoy.,5,2015,08,11
143,Pity the superior room gets smaller each time we visit,"Having been many times in this hotel  we feel now taken for granted because the booked room becomes each time smaller.

Last time the room was bigger and had a bathroom with two sinks a shower a bath a toilet and a separate bidet. Now one sink and the bidet is gone as well as quite some floor space.

After complaining we got offered a bigger room but my hubby's health is not so good and moving is a hassle.
When I told the manager that he said we filed your preferences

But should they not have noticed we stayed here even last month for four nights

So disappointed ",3,2015,08,11
143,Loved this place,"Beautiful hotel. Loved the food. Would not miss the afternoon tea; the sandwiches, tea and people watching were all so incredible. Drinks in the courtyard was also great, martinis for the grown ups and fresh apple juice for my daughter. Service was very attentive, despite several high profile celebrities staying at the hotel at the same time. They even brought several little gifts for our daughter on arrival. Really wished we could have stayed longer!",5,2015,08,09
143,The best hotel in London,"With my wife, we spent three nights at the Corinthia in London. The hotel was exceptional. The staff was very friendly and helpful in all of our demands. 

The lobby area was big, well decorated, it almost made me forget that I was in central London. We had a modern, spacious and luxurious suite, which was very well equipped, and worth the money we paid for it.

Even though we had dinner outside of the hotel, we attended the ""Two for Tea"" which was a delightful moment. We were severed many different things, and it was an enjoyable moment.

What was also surprising, was the cigar bar, as an amateur of Cigars, I was delighted to find a cigar bar.

From now on, I will only be staying at this hotel when I am in London.",5,2015,08,07
143,In Love with the Gem,"Got Home and Life just happens..No excuses just WOW OH WOW..I wanted to give the Hotel and the review the time it deserves-They are more then 7 stars.They sure were not lacking  in there service,hospitality and welcome everyone with open arms .(you will see I am kinda a dramatic gurl-LOL

This is a wonderful Hotel,the pictures do not ---I repeat ---do not do it even come  close to doing the hotel justice! hoping my pictures will help-you be the judge!

The Hotels sheer designer opulence and attention to detail is remarkable. Some of the reviews were less then stellar-dont know why. 
The staff, is here to please help and accommodate. There goal is to make your stay as  AN UNBELIEVABLE ONE!!!! 
The whole staff and management are the BEST-  from Concierge,Front Desk greeters to the Door Man to the Porters(who I might say if you are from the states 1 of them  looks just like a young version of  Christian Slater was soo sweet ran down the street got taxis when it took to long or was raining,he took pics for us) The one Door man who is from Ireland gave us suggestions where to go as this was our 2nd leg of the trip. We were going to the Notre Dame Game there.To the cleaning staff,as I smoke(oh there is no smoking in the rooms or in hotel)however there is a lovely courtyard that is built between the hotel walls that you may smoke cigarettes and cigars. Lovely fireplaces at each end ayou may also order sandwiches or tea. To the  restaurant servers at Massimos the Head Receiptionist Oonagha,to Maxime the Asst Manager who waited on us. 
Everyone and I do mean everyone from the Concierges with Darren, Justin and Sebastian, to the Front Desk Ben Milsom Reservations Supervisor.  He helped with the car  service(we chose a JaguarXJ cost of £140  from the service of"" Quintessentially""(please ask for Mark07738971555) and the  initial reservation.

Our room was unbelievable a  deluxe room,a lovely chocolate confection cake to celebrate our 1st trip to london and more. He made it all so special with champagne,which was waiting for us in the room. To Jean Louis Fresta -Front of House Manager to Julius Asst front desk supervisor. We had a slight problem with the first room heated floors(which seem to be standard in all rooms) not working.(Oh yes the hotel has free yes free wifi and it worked in our room along with the one we switched to! )They tried to fix the problem but were unable to with out major work in house.They were very courteous as they wont enter your room if you have DND light on or are not there and have not spoken to you to enter. If you read the review you will see I am trying to point out what others seem to find fault with where we DID NOT.
Also the closet was huge in this standard room. Not be able to fix this  they offered to move us from room #726 deluxe to  room #321 which was a beautiful suite.
The room was excellently appointed in decoration. There are 2 rooms a small hallway and 1 full bathroom along with a entry hallway with a guest bath as we did entertain while there we did biz and pleasure. I loved the room with its accessories books to read Chanel and more all for the guests enjoyment. I must mention I loved the makeup table with mirror drawers so chic!
I also want to say we didnt even need to leave the hotel if we chose not to.
The brkfst was lawesome, so many choices to choose from.Breads eggs sausage bacon ceral fresh fruit yogart I think you get it. You could also see a menu if you didnt want the continental Breakfast. This served breakfast and lunch tea can be had in the wonderful hotel lobby which really isnt a hotel lobby like we think of in the states. Dinner can be had at Massimos yumme yumme italian and a French Restaruant which we did not eat there. The spa which was phenomenal along with a  work out room,lots of water and use of certain spa amenities.

WOW OH WOW Thank You to Renaud Gregoire who we had the pleasure to meet. He enables his staff to take care of a situation-get it handled make the customer happy!
I am sure if  you are reading this you can see how much we loved this hotel. Yes I did gush a bit  -on and on...When a Hotel outshines the rest it deserves this recognition",5,2015,08,07
143,"Sublime, luxurious haven in central London","We stayed here for one night in July, and it was truly luxurious. The check-in was easy and the receptionist personally showed us to our room (Executive King), which was magnificent. There was a small entrance hall, large wardrobe spaces for him and her, very comfortable bed, Nespresso coffee machine, well-stocked mini bar, fresh fruit... Possibly best of all was an enormous bathroom with huge stand-alone marble bath, and an enormous shower with rain shower-head. I really did not want to leave the room. 

Of course the location is fantastic, being right by Embankment, but we were not troubled by any noise at all. We had cocktails in the bar, dinner in the Northall restaurant and breakfast in the bar, all of which was excellent. 

This is such a fabulous hotel, that we will return the next time we find someone to look after all the children(!). My only regret was that I didn't pack my gym kit nor book a treatment in the spa. Next time...",5,2015,08,07
143,Attention to detail and genuine friendliness at probably the best in London,"Hi There

Just a quick note to say how wonderful our recent stay at the Corinthia was 
It was our 25th Wedding Anniversary on Tuesday (4th August) and we decided to celebrate it with you guys and what a wise choice it turned out to be. We were very warmly greeted and from the moment the taxi arrived outside the whole experience was very, very professional.  But mostly what made it was the quality and genuine friendliness of all of the staff we encountered during our stay…
Our room was upgraded (a nice touch) and the personalised congratulations card in the room was very sweet, the cake you made us with ‘happy anniversary’ piped on a piece of chocolate put such a huge smile on my darling Wife’s face I’ll never forget it…

Massimo is one of my favourite restaurants and here in the evening (as ever) you excelled once again. The warm congratulations from The Restaurant Manager, the same from your charming Sommelier, the pink champagne and the genuine interest from all of your restaurant staff was unforgettable. Then to top it all off your Chef came and greeted us, talked about his excitement with the new menu, talked about his family and ours and personally brought us out little plates of appetisers, he came out several times to check on us… at the end of a memorable meal a plate with petit fours surrounded by the words ‘happy anniversary’ piped in chocolate with our coffee arrived … Wow

It’s not often one gets to celebrate a 25th wedding anniversary and all of you at the Corinthia Hotel played a part in making it a wonderful experience for myself and my Wife

Thank you so much

Robert",5,2015,08,06
143,Great hotel with best spa in London ,"This is a truly great hotel. It definitely lives up to the five-star standard. Everything from check-in to check-out was superb. We spent a long-weekend with the family and had two connecting de luxe rooms. The rooms are quite large with London standards and equipped with everything you will possibly need (except for an iron, which we got after a quick call to the housekeeping). We had lunch in the Massimo Restaurant, which was great. We also used the spa, which must be one of the very best in London. Large swimming pool, hot bubble pool, different saunas and very stylish interiors. Despite all this, we may choose a different hotel for future visits (we go to London every year). There are hotels with the same great standard but not as expensive. ",5,2015,08,05
143,Amazing,"Can't fault this hotel, you are treated like royalty and the atmosphere is sophisticated and non intrusive and the service is beyond what you would expect from 5*. Breakfast was superb and we ate at Massimo which was amazing. The spa was also the best i have been to in London.",5,2015,08,05
143,Personal and friendly service in a perfect location,"Back from a short weekend in London staying at the Corinthia Hotel I just wanted to thank all the staff for making us feel at home. We only had little time but enjoyed every  minute of our stay. We were able to relax - particularly we enjoyed the room facing teh courtyard allowing us to sleep with open window and without traffic noise. The breakfast was great and the attention we were given during our visit to ESPA exceptional. 

Thank you!",5,2015,08,04
143,Great hotel. ,"Stayed here for two nights with the fiancé. We loved it. The staff were awesome and very friendly. Great rooms and awesome bathrooms.  We had the continental breakfast which was fine, however there was a HUGE selection for made to order, We would defiantly go back. ",5,2015,08,02
143,Glorious upscale Hotel right in the heart of London,"Enjoyed 7 days at the Corinthia hotel at the end of July 2015.  This is an upscale property right in the heart of London in the Whitehall district.  It is just a few minutes walking from Trafalgar Square and the embankment tube station is literally across the street.  The Corinthia met all our expectations for a higher end property.  The rooms were well appointed with a great bathroom and shower; also they are quite large and very quiet, offering excellent sleeping.   The concierge was excellent; we arranged theatre tickets and car service with them and they were fast and quite knowledgeable.   Overall the hospitality and service was consistently excellent throughout our stay.  This hotel is all about location and great service.  Being so close to all the main sites and the embankment tube station is what drew us to select the Corinthia for our time in London and it didn’t disappoint.  The guests were an eclectic mix of business people, wealthy Europeans and some N.American tourists.  The two lounges were quite good with excellent service.  The Northall restaurant had great service but the cuisine was a bit of a disappointment.  Overall we very much enjoyed our time at the Corinthia and will likely stay here again the next time we are in London.  Being able to walk to Trafalgar square at night and lazily walk around the Whitehall district just mins from our hotel was one of the highlights of our trip to London.",5,2015,08,02
143,"Gorgeous spa, immaculate property","We stayed at this hotel, as a couple for a weekend and we both agree that it's the best hotel that we have stayed at in the UK. It feels like a 'proper' 5-star. Everything is beautifully decorated and immaculate. The standard rooms were a good size, breakfast (a la carte room service) was delicious and everything was as it should be with coffee still steaming hot, eggs still hot and cooked to perfection etc. Without a doubt however, the reason that we would return and the reason we've recommended the hotel to friends is the spa. The facilities in the spa were spot on and the treatments were perfect. It's difficult for us to justify staying in a London hotel as we're London-based, but I'll definitely be returning!",5,2015,07,31
143,Corinthia,"Checked in at the Corinthia for 6 nights. I was truly impressed by this hotel, rooms are spacious by London standards and luxurious. Staff were professional and service was great. This was my first time at the Corinthia, enjoyed every aspect of this hotel and will definitely come back. Afternoon tea and breakfast not to be missed.",5,2015,07,30
143,So absolutely 5 star,"To the white glove arrival service to a beautiful room spacious and oh so comfortable. Sweeping reception areas, a get lost in spa, great vibe at Bassoon and welcome from Domenico! Wow do I have to depart?!",5,2015,07,29
143,Excellent Services,My decision to choose the Corinthia Hotel was right as the services by the staff was excellent. I enjoyed my stay at this Hotel and recommending all the visitors to enjoy your tour by staying at this hotel.,5,2015,07,27
143,fantasic stay,"We stayed for a Saturday night as part of a celebration evening. As we live in London we have pretty high standards for London hotels and having stayed at a few in the past I have to say the Corinthia deserves a great billing. 
Whilst it has the same old fashioned elegance of a number of its competitors like the Savoy, Ritz, Berkley, It is far more relaxed and I found the service to be exemplary.
We had booked a deluxe room and were upgraded to a suite in the newer part of the hotel which was magnificent. The quality of the bed (comfort, linins, pillows) etc was wonderful and the room was immaculately furnished.
I probably wouldn't use the room with a small child as the window seemed to open on to not a lot, but as we were child-less I can't rate it high enough.

The spa pool is small but perfectly formed and we also very much enjoyed the bars. The breakfast was very pricey I thought, but then it was also of supreme quality. My previous favorite London hotel was Blakes in SK, but this may have just sneaked past it.",5,2015,07,27
143,Never again the Northall Bar at the Corinthia,"We were close by and fancied a cocktail so we decided to give the Northall Bar another try despite having a bad experience a few years ago, well never again... the bar was fairly empty and had plenty of waiting staff in view, we were in fairness approached very quickly by a very nice waitress who took the order and brought some nibbles, the problem is that we had to wait at least 20 minutes for the drinks to arrive, another couple arrived after us, sat at the bar and got their drinks before, they just simply forgot us while the barman was busy polishing his glasses. They knew that happened as the waitress apologised for the wait when the drinks eventually arrived. Although the drinks looked good (photo attached) one, the ""let the sunshine"" was so tart, it was like drinking pure lemon juice. It is not acceptable for a so called 5 star property to have such lack of customer service, if you know you did not deliver then you should try to recover as opposed to just say sorry with little meaning. 
Also, when you get to pay by card, the employee hands you the machine taking you through stages of leaving gratuity (after a 12.5% service on the bill)... How can you call this 5 star??? I call this taking guests for a ride... never again!",2,2015,07,26
143,Birthday treat,"Well this is a fabulous place. 
Seemless polite check in, although the room hadn't been inspected so we couldn't get in there until 5. Therefore we were diverted to the bar which was a bit pricey.  
To the room, this was beautiful! Everything was lovely, the bath with the TV, the shower was relaxing, the bed was large and very comfy.  Once we managed to pull ourselves from the room we made it to the spa.  A beautiful relaxing venue with steam room,sauna, pool, jacuzzi.  It again was calming and an oasis. Perfect! 
To breakfast! There was a wide range of hot and cold dishes, variety of fresh fruits to choose, and a selection of teas. A fantastic place... Perfect!!! ",5,2015,07,26
143,Love the Corinthia and London,"Just back from the Corinthia Hotel in London - fourth time there which speaks for itself -we love it. Location - a 20 out of 10, you don't need to look for anything - walk out the door and London finds you. Food - great. Service - always excellent. Staff - friendly & professional. Spa - never been to a better one anywhere. Already planning our fifth trip.",5,2015,07,24
143,One of the Best I've stayed in,"Just walking into the lobby is an experience! It's amazing! The staff were friendly but very professional. Quickly got us checked in and up to our room, then disappeared.

The room was lovely. King bed with very nice linens and coverings. Lots of pillows. The bathroom was the best. Heated floor was very nice coming out of the shower. The shower was big enough for a cocktail party and had the latest kind of heads and hardware. The room was very quiet.

All of the public rooms are special.The mini Harrod's in the lobby is a nice touch. The am breakfast is well done and reasonably quick. Good service. 

Afternoon tea was lovely. The bar staff was proficient.

There were quite a few A List Celeb's staying there. Which was fun. 

The location was great. We walked all over central London from here with no problems.",5,2015,07,23
143,Afternoon tea with champagne,The finger sandwiches were superb the cakes were amazing.selection of teas to choose from and they even have a specially blended tea made exclusively for the hotel which tasted lovely.the rose verve cliquot champagne went very well with the sandwiches and cakes overall a most enjoyable experience.,5,2015,07,21
143,The best in London!!,"We have been coming to London for 25 years.  Love London.  We have always stayed at the Park Lane area hotels.   This was our first stay at The Corinthia.  This is now our one and only hotel in London.  First class in every detail.  The location is incredible.  You can walk in every direction and be close to the main sights. The tube station us across the street and Charring Cross Rail Station adjoins the tube station.  Fantastic stay and 
experience at this hotel.  ",5,2015,07,21
143,One Night Stay....one of the best,"Stayed over in December 2014 with friends and its obvious from the minute you see the hotel let alone enter it that this is a special hotel.
Check in was quick, service of course top notch and the room was amazing.
Had a great stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for something special.
Location is perfect of course.",5,2015,07,20
143,Nice new hotel in london,"Spent five days in London at this hotel.  Had not stayed here before.  Really liked the property.  Great location, nice spacious (for london) rooms, good service.  Good workout facility with occasional celebrity (not me). Highly recommend hotel.  ",5,2015,07,19
143,The best. ,"The hotel is one of the most well constructed I have ever seen. Each public space was created using the best materials and smart design which makes you want to linger. My wife and I stayed in an executive king for four nights in July. The first room we were given was dark and seemed small with what could not even really be considered an interior view - it was more a corner of a wall. But the front desk did a great job of moving us to a fantastic room (same catagory) after the fist night.  Staff overall were very accomdating. The real standout aspect was the spa, however, especially the vitality pool with jets, waterfall, etc.  The Corinthia was worth the expense in our view. ",5,2015,07,19
143,Another wonderful stay at the Corinthia.,"A really test of any hotel/restaurant you've really enjoyed is if they can deliver a second time and the Corinthia really did. 

It was our second visit as we enjoyed our first so very much, see my review from October 2014. 

The breakfast and lunch was just as good, the staff were just as welcoming and helpful and the hotel was as beautifully presented.

This time we used the spa which was the epitome of luxury and relaxation. Every detail has been painstakingly executed to the highest standard to create an almost other worldly experience. It was the best spa experience I've ever had and I doubt it will be exceeded. I particularly loved the Sleep Pods, could have stayed in there all day.

We are hoping to visit again soon with our children for a Christmas treat.",5,2015,07,18
143,Favorite London Hotel !,"My wife and I were in London for Wimbledon. Had a great week at The Corinthia, and plan to return soon. Great location and service. Concierge and room service are outstanding. Management team including Mr.Cattini are excellent.",5,2015,07,17
143,Excellent in every way,"Dont think twice. The swanky and stylish spa (best in town)  was spread over 4 floors. Plenty of relaxation areas. Treatments were very good. The spa dining menu was fresh and tasted healthy. Everywhere staff were friendly and smiled. When we asked for room to be cleaned a little  late they accomodated with no objections. Rooms were well appointed, bathroom spacious.TV was a bit temperamental, but not the end of world.
 
Ambience in common areas was top notch. Exudes class.

Tried the food and it was delicious and not pretentious. 

Overall great, great hotel.
",5,2015,07,16
143,Stunning location!!!,"Rooms were generous and well appointed, but the best part was how well we were able to get around the city on foot. Tons of sites, parks, museums, squares, shows within 15 minute walk, including the London Eye, Trafalgar and Picadilly Circus.",5,2015,07,16
143,Stayed for 3 nights,We spent 3 nights at this hotel before starting a cruise from Southampton.  This hotel is in a great location and you can walk to most tourist spots without taking transportation. The rooms are small by American standard but they are very clean and the service couldn't be better. No matter what you need they bring it right away with a smile. I will stay here again when next in London,5,2015,07,15
143,Excellent!!!,"Hotel is in amazing location. The greeting we had upon arrival was friendly and check in was smooth. We were here for 2 nights as a couple. The room was spacious and the bathroom was good. With a TV at the end of the bath. Breakfast was really good we had it in our room once which arrived hot and everything was as ordered. 
The cocktails we sampled on the bar were outstanding as was the service.
The spa and the facilities are excellent. I would recommend this hotel In an instance and can't wait to return ",5,2015,07,15
143,Fantastic hotel in great location,"This is not the place to stay on a tight budget, however if you can stretch a little then it is highly recommended. We stayed here for the weekend of the Wimbledon finals and enjoyed the excellent service and friendly staff. The amenities are what you would expect from a 5 star hotel and we were certainly not disappointed. The room was comfortable and large by most standards and nothing was a bother to the staff in any way.",5,2015,07,15
143,Afternoon tea,"faultless,we loved it ,this afternoon tea is the best I've had in London,eight to date.
Service perfect,no rush,nothing was too much trouble,food tasted lovely,staff friendly and we stayed to have a lovely cocktail in the bar afterwards.one regret we were too full to eat anything off the extensive menu but next time plan to go for a meal.",5,2015,07,11
143,Worth the splurge,Stayed here for a night while we were in London. Location is great and the room exceeded expectations. Was pleasantly surprised by the complimentary access to the spa facilities which we absolutely loved. The thermal rooms are a treat and something we would definitely go back for! Reception was terribly nice and gave us a late check out as we had a late flight. Till next time! ,5,2015,07,11
143,Simply Extraordinary.,"We had the pleasure of staying in this fantastic hotel for three nights.  We were immediately greeted, our bags swiftly collected, and taken immediately at reception.  We were personally shown to our room and had all the features of both the hotel and (amazing) Espa Spa explained.  Adorable plush animals and small bags of fun candies were waiting for our children, along with fresh fruit and juices for us.  Every request was attended to within minutes.  The bathroom was exceptional with heated marble floors and a jacuzzi tub with television (our kids loved taking their bath with cartoons on!).  Very comfortable beds!  The food was expensive, but well worth the price.  A small Harrods outpost resides in the hotel, which is perfect for those wanting a souvenir without the crushing crowds at the regular store.  

What really sets the Corinthia apart is the outstanding service, which is the best I have ever received at any hotel.  

While we wouldn't hesitate to return and highly recommend this property, there are two areas we feel could be improved upon:

1) The rooms were heavily perfumed.  Pillows, fabric headboards, and even the toilet paper were drowning in fragrance.  We had requested a hypoallergenic room due to severe allergies and asthma, which was not in their records apparently.  While they did change the linens and towels, these items had to be special-ordered in so there was a wait, and there was no getting completely rid of the scent since it so heavily lingered in everything in the room.  Both my daughter and I had asthma and allergy complications due to the fragrance.  We would have loved a truly hypoallergenic room that fragrance had never been used in.

2) The lighting system in the room is tricky to get the hang of.  Also, the boxes for the lighting glow very bright blue at night which we found mildly disruptive.

The Corinthia fully deserves it's 5-star rating (those without fragrance sensitivities and allergies would likely find this place perfect)!",5,2015,07,10
143,Birthday & Anniversary Treat,"We have visited the Corinthia Hotel in London a few times now for various occasions, we keep going back because we love it there!! Amazing hotel, brilliant location, staff and rooms are amazing. We did the stay Sunday, spa Monday as we had booked the theatre on a Sunday! Was brilliant. Best massage I have ever had! Would definitely recommend this hotel! Best hotel I have ever stayed in! Can't wait until our next trip! Thank you Corinthia! ",5,2015,07,10
143,Center of London,"A classy, modern hotel in the heart of London.  Within walking distance of major attractions (Buckingham Palace, Trafalgar Square, British Museum, Scotland Yard, Churchill bunker , Westminster Abby, Big Ben)
Beautiful service and gorgeous room!
High teas is exceptional.
Gorgeous spa!!",5,2015,07,09
143,Great for families as well as business....,"I admit we got off to a bumpy start.  After 2.5 weeks on a cruise ship with small, connecting cabins for our family of five we were very anxious to get into the oversized rooms at the Corinthia.  

One room was ready for us but as it turns out the person staying the previous night in the connecting room left the hotel and all his stuff in the room and didn't check out until almost 5PM.  I was not happy but that is not the hotel's fault.

They sent a nice bottle of champagne to sooth any misgivings.  

Otherwise, the place was fantastic.  The rooms were clean, modern and spacious.  The service was fantastic as well.  The kids enjoyed the treats given to them as well as the video game console.  

We dined in the excellent restaurant also.

We'll definitely visit the Corinthia again.",5,2015,07,07
143,Most expensive view of a wall!,"I arrived in the evening,for two nights so the room had been turned down,booked the hotel for Wimbledon a few months ago.The room was nice,nothing out of the ordinary for a 5 star,in the morning I opened the curtains to be looking directly at a huge brick wall,no view at all! At £667.00 +breakfast per night this is obscene. Breakfast buffet is £32.00 + a 12% service charge for serving your self. I complained about the room the hotel wasn't able to move me and was told its Wimbledon and recived a £60.00 discount,what's tennis got to do with a view of a wall? Nice hotel,but they are having a laugh charging this,I felt ripped off and won't return I don't mind paying for quality,don't stay here if you want to feel valued as a customer.",3,2015,07,04
143,Perfect stay!,"Great staff, beautiful building, nice spacious rooms which is not often the case in central London, open air inner court for lunch or tea and a very nice Italian restaurant 'Massimo' (and two other restaurant facilities). The spa is supposed to be the largest in London and when visiting it, it certainly looked like it. It is a real pleasure to stay at the Corinthia!",5,2015,07,03
143,Beautiful,"Wow. 
Beautiful food. Beautiful place. 
This place is a must. 
Italian food at its best.
Amazing service. 
I will revisit. X
Fantastic wine menu. 
The staff are attentive, just the correct amount. 
Knowledgeable on the menus and the hotel decor and design. Being an interior designer this impressed be hugely. :)
The bar is beautiful

143,Lovely Hotel & Spa,Beautiful hotel & amazing spa facilities. Makes a lovely treat. Had a nightmare trying to rebook by email. Best using their website instead. Had a lovely meal there with cocktails and some live music too!,5,2015,07,02
143,The best in London,"The Corinthia is doubtfully the best hotel in London. Not only in terms of location and food but in service! We have experienced the most exclusive and honest service in a city hotel and not only. Staff are amazing, always happy to help, discrete, polite and very well trained. Congratulations to all the manager.",5,2015,07,02
143,A great smoke with outstanding service,"Traveling to London for a few days last June and willing to smoke a nice cigar, I went to the Corinthia Hotel of which I'd heard through Manu Harit, the cigar sommelier whom I follow on Instagram after meeting him a couple years back at the Bulgari Hotel. Manu provides an outstanding service experience, he remembered me as well as what I'd smoked back at the Bulgari and suggested I'd try a Hoyo de Monterey Double Corona, that we picked together having a walk in their impressive humidor (see picture). Manu then suggested a very nice white wine to pair with my cigar which was just to the point.

The atmosphere in the garden lounge is intimate and refined, a good way to escape the buzz of the city. I highly recommend you paying them a visit and do ask for Manu Harit to recommend you a smoke and a good drink, he has a rare talent for hospitality and you can also see how he enjoys what he's doing. Bravo!",5,2015,07,02
143,Exceptional London weekend,"We stayed Friday & Saturday, over the weekend of the marathon by coincidence, which was fabulous as we were able to walk out a few metres on Sunday morning and watch the race.
The hotel is well located for theatres and trips on the Eye as well as other venues. It is super luxurious and the service from the staff is exceptional. Our friends booked it as a gift and we were so impressed. We had a wonderful weekend.",5,2015,07,01
143,Amazing service,I absolutely love this place. Especially for the service in the restaurants and tea room. Fist of all the tea room on it´s own is a reason on it´s own to stay here. Then the people in the restaurants are amazing!,5,2015,07,01
143,Luxury without being Stuffy,"When you think Luxury think Corinthia Hotel as you will want for nothing!!  Perfectly located ~ A 15-20 minute stroll down the Mall to Buckingham Palace, across the River Thames from the London Eye, shopping, pubs and chic restaurants.  You'll certainly not want to leave.  Pamper yourself soon!!",5,2015,06,30
143,5 star hotel,"The Corinthia in London, while expensive, provided 5 star facilities and service. Its location is close to Trafalgar Square. It is really a boutique hotel. 
The rooms were well equipped and the staff was very friendly and helpful.",5,2015,06,30
143,"Great location, excellent condition, amazing spa","First, the hotel is beautiful and in like new condition. Rooms are very spacious, especially for the location and the bathroom made me wish I could bring it home! A really neat central lighting control system, complete with mood levels and accent lighting was a great touch, but the in-room sound system wouldn't work for me. I spent a week there for work and would definitely return if my expense account would bear it. I was able to get a great rate on the room, but the room service and onsite dining is a no-go for all but those with the most generous expense accounts!

I typically stay at 5 star properties when I travel with my wife and while the physical hotel rivaled any urban hotel we've visited, the service seemed a bit distant and less warm and personal than I would have expected.",4,2015,06,30
143,"very flash, extremely nice rooms. disorganized staff in need of training.","this is a great new hotel on the london hotel scene and i have stayed in just about all of them during my 30 years of business travel to london. located just south of the national gallery, this is not a ""quiet neighborhood"" type location. it is however, the nicest hotel room i have stayed in recently in london. better by far ( and i mean far) than browns, a dump, the langham, nice but matter of fact, clardiges, nice but crowded and a little shop worn, dukes, tiny rooms, the stafford, ho hum and the berkeley, awful,  and i could go on. 
this is a super deluxe hotel and with rooms to match, london enters the 21st century is all i could think. i was upgraded to a large room with bath, dressing room and large bedroom. newly furnished in reasonably attractive.
here are the two big problems:
the air conditioning is a nightmare. it is really loud and poorly balanced. it sounds like a freight train when it is on medium speed. i would hate to have to had it turned on to high. the company who designed the system should get a remedial course in air flow. the vent is located directly in front of the bed, facing the interior of the room. only the bed room is air conditioned. the cold and noisy system blows air right on to the bed and does not a/c the bathroom or dressing room. by the time you get out of the bath, you are sweating, there is no air flow or separate unit in 1/2 of the suite. it is crazy. 
the second problem is staff training. they just seem a little green. there were times when i called the front desk and no one answered. on the saturday night that i was there, i called the front desk at about 11 pm. 28 rings and no one answered. the concierge 18 rings, no one. room service 18 rings, no one. the operator, 20 rings no one. finally i got my cell phone and called from that phone, someone finally picked up. she explained to me that she was the only person answering all of the phones that night. really? god forbid there was an emergency of any kind. there was simply no communication within the hotel. crazy.
nice, needs work....",4,2015,06,30
143,Lovely stay at the Corinthia with outstanding service,"We just spent one night at the Corinthia and had a great time. The service was fantastic. I am nine months pregnant and immediately upon arrival at the reception desk was offered a bottle of water, which is very thoughtful. At the breakfast table I was given an extra pillow for my back, again a lovely gesture from the attentive member of staff. The breakfast itself was one of the best I have had in a 5* hotel, and staff were refilling the display even after the official time for breakfast had ended. 
The spa is just fantastic, my husband described it as something out of a James Bond movie, which sums it up quite nicely. We will definitely be back!",5,2015,06,30
143,Fabulous Father's Day meal,"We had a marvellous Father's Day lunch at the hotel. The food was excellent, the staff were all very friendly and efficient. Cannot fault it in any way. My favourite London hotel is the Savoy but this is fantastic too. I now have two favourite places.",5,2015,06,30
143,"Amazing - great location, beautiful hotel!","We had 4 nights at the Corinthia at the beginning of June 2015.  This hotel is truly 5 star.  From the doorman to reception, room service and housekeeping, service is impeccable.  We stayed in an Executive King Room which was beautifully furnished and very spacious with a large walk in robe and full size bathroom.  I think you would be hard pressed to get a better location in London - literally around the corner from the Thames (Embankment), across the river from the Southbank and London Eye, quick walk to Big Ben, Trafalgar Square, Buckingham Palace, Piccadilly Circus and St James' Park. We we return to London I would definitely stay here again and cannot recommend it highly enough.  I would say it was one of the best hotel experiences we have had. (The next James Bond movie was being filmed in the street while we were there - if it's good enough for 007...)",5,2015,06,30
143,Mesmerizing,"Absolute luxury! Second stay at the hotel. The hotel sweeps you off your feet with its lovey deco and ambience.Rooms were suprisingly big for london standards. Being there for Christmas was truly magical. Staff are really helpful and attentive. The spa is lovely ..a perfect compliment to the cold outside. Location perfect for long walks by the river and to visit popular landmarks, tube stations very close by. A couple of pubs close by with many other restaurants/cafes close by trafalgar square and leicester square. Would always want to go back",5,2015,06,30
143,Best of the Best,"I hardly know where to start....every experience during my stay exceeded my expectations.  I have stayed at some of the best hotels around the world and this hotel ranks near the top.  Best in class staff members demonstrated knowledge, professionalism, sincerity and dedication at a level that should be a source of pride, and is a point of distinction compared to other hotels.  Beautiful rooms, exceptional location and fantastic spa/pool (do NOT miss out on that experience!).",5,2015,06,29
143,Amazing Hotel- Amazing Stay!,"I cannot say enough wonderful things about this hotel!  We had the most amazing time here.  We stayed on holiday for three nights and hated to have to leave.  We will certainly be back!

The Staff:
The staff is incredibly attentive!  Upon check in, we were escorted to our room, given a tour, and ensured everything was to our liking.   Anything we requested was at our door in a matter of minutes.  There is absolutely no waiting in this hotel, including for taxis which have to be flagged from the main street (the doorman jogs to the corner to flag it for you).  Room service was impeccable, and set our breakfast at the small table in the room instead of leaving a dining table.  

The Room
We found the room to be beautiful, clean, exceptionally large, and very comfortable.  We felt at home.  The room had a foyer, two sitting areas, floor to ceiling windows, and an oversize bathroom with separate toilet and shower areas, an additional window, and heated floors. The room is also incredibly high tech.  Everything can be remotely controlled by the staff, but can also be made available to you upon request (i.e. we requested the room be cooler in temperature, and was in a matter of minutes remotely).  The lights can also be controlled via wall switches or bedside remote (so helpful at bedtime!).    

If I had one complaint, it is that there were no electrical outlets near the bathroom vanity.  But that's it- everything else was wonderful!",5,2015,06,28
143,5 star luxury,"Great hotel in a great location. Rooms are spacious and very well appointed. The spa is first class (as my fiancee tells me). Staff are professional and friendly. We were fortunate enough to be upgraded to an executive room upon arrival which was a nice plus. Expensive, yes, but you get what you paid for.",5,2015,06,27
143,Fantastic hotel,"As regular visitors to London for work and pleasure we have stayed at many hotels and I have to say this has been the best one yet.  The hotel is luxurious and elegant throughout without being old fashioned and overly ornate.  For me the aesthetics of the place are as good as it gets.  The room was large and comfortable, service was warm, friendly and professional.  We particularly enjoyed having drinks in the garden area.  The hotel Spa was on another level to any other spa I have ever experienced, a great facility and a big plus for the hotel overall.  The Corinthia is definitely number one on my list for future visits and I would highly recommend to anyone - Can't fault anything.",5,2015,06,27
143,An amazing combination...,"True British charm, and fully modern amenities -- closets you can actually walk into, spacious bathrooms with full sized tubs, rooms the size of, well, traditional American hotel rooms.

The hotel has an almost secret outdoor (but covered) courtyard, that might be the last place in Britain you can smoke a cigar.  The breakfast buffet is amazing, and the food service in both restaurants is excellent.

Location in Charing Cross, right at the emergingly hip Embankment, an excellent place.

I have stayed here many times, and find it consistently wonderful",5,2015,06,26
143,Best hotel in London?,"This is probably one of the best hotels we've ever stayed in.

It is stylish, clean, great service, awesome location close to the tube station with several lines coming into it. They got all the services you need, invluding a spa if you are into that.

Great breakfast & room service.",5,2015,06,26
143,"Inaugural, but not final visit","The Corinthia, London is a beautiful property with all of the amenities of a 5-star accommodation.  In addition to the hotel appointments, the personnel was attentive, professional, and kind in their demeanor.  We will, without doubt, return to this hotel upon our next visit to London.  It is well worth the added expenditure compared to other top-rated hotels.",5,2015,06,25
143,"Abit out of the way, but its ok.","Am starting to like this hotel. Travel to london alot but already have a fav place to stay, now this hotel was recently introduced to me. Love the rooms, high ceilings and overlooking terrace. Love the cigar area. Gym is good, tricky to get to but worth it. Aircond in the gym is too cold. Spa is excellent.",4,2015,06,25
143,Superb Hotel,"The hotel was excellent in every regard. Had a beautifully appointed and quiet executive room, with an amazing bathroom. Dined at the Northall restaurant in the hotel for a late supper and also had breakfast there every morning. Restaurant wait staff were very accommodating, efficient and quite pleasant. The hotel is also very well located. The only possible negative was that I felt the personnel at check-in and check-out were a bit chilly. But perhaps that is the British reserve. 
Overall, a wonderful stay!",5,2015,06,24
143,My Birthday,"What a great Hotel food is great service is excellent.  Manu Harit the Floor manager in the cigar terrace is a great guy really likes to take care of his guests. His knowledge on cigars is excellent. 

He organised a little cake on my Birthday which was a nice touch.",5,2015,06,22
143,Amazing,"The most amazing hotel experience ever, luxury at its finest. heated bathroom floor and tv to watch while bathing just added to the relaxation after walking around london all day. Hotel is in an excellent location if you are going shopping or to see a show, all within a short walking distance.",5,2015,06,21
143,Amazing afternoon tea,"My mum and I frequently have afternoon tea and have sampled many of the top destinations. The Corinthia is definitely up there with the best. The lounge where tea is served is like an atrium with a huge glass domed roof and it gave a wonderful air of space, light and tranquility.

We arrived half an hour early and asked to take a drink in the bar but the staff suggested that we sit at our table early and enjoy a drink there instead. We had a lovely bottle of champagne, followed by the tea. The sandwiches and cakes were exquisite and we were offered many top-ups as desired. The service was excellent and there was absolutely nothing to fault. 

We'll definitely return.",5,2015,06,19
143,Comfortable modern and accessible ,A comfortable stay. Rooms are large with large walk-in wardrobe and toilet. Luxurious marble lined toilet with espa toiletries. Comfortable bed. Nespresso machine in the room is a nice touch. Location is convenient to most sites and shopping .  Trafalgar Square just 1 minute walk away. Breakfast in the hotel may be expensive but lots of choices just outside the hotel. ,5,2015,06,19
143,Exceedingly good,"I have enjoyed my stay at this hotel enormously.

Any previous average reviews are not justified at all.

Wonderful hotel and extremely helpful staff.

I would not say that this is the best hotel in London, however; it is close to reaching that spot.

Highly recommended.",4,2015,06,18
143,Love this hotel,"Everything about this hotel was perfect! The room was large and very comfortable. The lobby was stunning, drinks at the bar are unique and delicious, and the breakfast buffet was delish. We had our best meal at the restaurant here also.",5,2015,06,18
143,Amazing start to my honeymoon!,"I just stayed at the Corinthia for the first 5 nights of my honeymoon.  There is not one negative thing i can say about our stay.  After the long flight from Los Angeles our friendly driver, that the hotel arranged, was waiting for us and easy to find with beautiful new Mercedes S class.  As it was out first time in London he pointed out every landmark and gave us many suggestions of places to see.  

The check in staff was as nice as could be and quickly got us to our beautiful suite that had, champagne, fruit and other snacks waiting for us.  The room was exceptional with a huge walk in closet, wonderful bathroom with a huge rainfall shower, large bathtub and heated floors.  

Everything in the hotel from the amazing gym and spa, breakfast area, restaurants and bars were excellent.  The concierge was able to get us reservations, even on Friday night, in some of London's best restaurants.  

The location of the hotel, especially for tourists on our first trip to London, was perfect.  Walking distance to Big Ben, Westminster Abbey and Buckingham Palace.  

Thank you Corinthia London for starting our European honeymoon off right!",5,2015,06,15
143,Enjoyable stay.,"Stayed here for a 2 night weekend break recently. Room fine, not the best, given it was nearly £500 a night, it was small but ok, modern and clean however towels could have been whiter and fluffier and one of our bathrobes had a hole in the back but bed was comfy. Hotel facilities great, great bars, Bassoon for excellent cocktails and good breakfast in Northall. Good location and thermal Spa was great, worth a visit. Staff good but not top notch.",4,2015,06,14
143,The best hotel in London at the moment,"Beautiful hotel, spacious rooms. Fantastic service. Staff very attentive and your wish is their command. Whatever you ask for they will deliver. Great spa and afternoon tea. In my opinion the best hotel in London at the moment. Highly recommend",5,2015,06,14
143,Exceptional hotel and amazing service!!,"This was the first stay (but not our last) for me and my wife at the Corinthia and we were not disappointed. Everything about this hotel exudes luxury, from the first time you walk into the grand foyer to the exquisitely appointed rooms and the superb restaurants.

On arriving we were met by the very welcoming and attentive door staff that collected our bags from the car and showed us to reception. Check in was easy and painless and within minutes we were shown to our room and given a rundown of the facilities.

We stayed for three nights in an Executive King room. The room was spacious with a large walk in wardrobe and an equally spacious bathroom. The bed was comfortable and the room very quiet. The housekeeping team and turn down team deserve and mention as were very thorough and never missed a trick.

The first night we ate at Massimo’s which serves Italian cuisine. The food was amazing and the staff even more so, they were all very personable and took the time to explain the menu and give you some guidance as to what to try, if needed. The second night we used room service and were impressed by the ease of ordering and the speed of the food arriving. When the food arrived the staff member was so attentive and rearranged the seating for us so we could dine in comfort. I know this is what you would expect from a five star establishment but this is not always the case.

They say breakfast is the most important meal of the day and The Corinthia obviously agrees. This is by far the best breakfast experience we have ever had at a five star hotel. If like my wife you enjoy the buffet style breakfast then you will be in your element. The variety of fruits, pastries, fresh breads, meats and cereals is exceptional and are always replenished. If like me on the other hand you enjoy something off of the menu then don’t fear you have a wide range of choice to, but I would strongly recommend the eggs benedict, best I have ever had!! The breakfast was amazing but yet again this was outdone by the staff and in particular one member of staff (Sorry I didn’t manage to get his name) he treated us every morning like we had dined for breakfast for months. Always remembering our names, always very attentive, always remembering our preferences, my coffee cup or glass was never empty. He was very friendly and a credit to the Corinthia. 

I can’t leave a review without mentioning the Spa. I have to say I myself am not a regular spa visitor but my wife is, and she was extremely impressed by the very modern and luxurious facilities, as was I! It has all the facilities you would expect, swimming pool, vitality pool, steam room & sauna. As this is free for all guests I would strongly recommend you make time to visit, you won’t be disappointed. My wife also had a massage and requested a deep tissue full body massage and was not disappointed by her therapist who used the perfect pressure. The treatment room was quiet and relaxing. I didn’t have chance to use the gym facilities but will on my return.

Unfortunately we didn’t get round to having afternoon tea, which was a shame as I have heard great things about the experience. 

I have never stayed in a five star hotel and had the perfect stay, which I guess you expect, and as such have never written a review but the Corinthia and all its staff deserves all the praise and recognition it gets. This is truly a five star hotel from top to bottom, if you are after luxurious surroundings, very professional and attentive staff, then look no further, the Corinthia is for you. The Corinthia is now our London hotel of choice and as such have booked our return in August to celebrate our anniversary.

Thank you Corinthia for making our stay perfect and see you soon!",5,2015,06,11
143,Seriously perfect . . .,"The hotel was perfect. All interactions with all levels of staff were professional and very personal. They want you to enjoy yourselves and it shows in every way. Here's a snapshot-  Geography: Situated within 5 minutes walk of SOHO Traflager Square, Scotland Yard, Horse Guard Arena, Churchill's War Room and the theatre. 10minute walk to St James Pk and Buckingham Palace.  A 5 minute subway to Picadilly Circus, Oxford St., Regent St and Carnaby St. And as the hotel is right at the Embankment station and Golden Jubilee bridge you are steps to the shops, theatre, bars and sights of the Queens Walk on the South Bank. Seriously perfectly situated. Rooms (pics) : tasteful decor, lounging wc with wonderful bath; linens mmmm, walk in closet with enough drawers and space for the entire week; wonderful turndown service and privacy - you are never ever bothered unless you have requested. Food: Massimo the Italian restaurant (pics)  -wow. Selection, knowledgable service - they were so pleasant and the sommelier, well she introduced us to a new fav, something we never would have tried. Unfortunately we didn't experience afternoon tea but heard great feedback and saw happy faces. The outdoor courtyard was nice after a long day to sit back under the umbrellas by the fireplace (pic) and unwind. Samuel  in the lunch bar (sorry forget the actual name) was so sweet and after finding out our love of Jack Daniel's proceeded to make a cocktail I shall never forget (pic). We were so busy we were unable to enjoy the spa so cannot comment on this area. 
We went for one week to celebrate our birthdays and we have not one single negative note nor wish for improvement. Do yourself a favour, spend the extra and stay here. You won't be disappointed.",5,2015,06,07
143,Wonderful Place to Celebrate The New Yeat,"The Corinthia in London was part of a two week trip split evenly between London and Paris right after Christmas. Arrangements were relatively easy online, though the fact that I had not visited before made room selection a bit uncertain. Concierge service in advance of the trip was excellent. I began planning this trip in May of 2014, with part of the purpose to propose to my (now) fiancée on New Year's Eve. Th concierge staff promptly responded to every single request, only unable to fulfill some of our dinner reservation requests until we were inside a 90-day window. When hat window arrived, I did not need to remind them. They reached out to me and confirmed the restaurant reservations I request, including Ledberry, a place not to be missed. Staff also arranged a car service from and to the airport, as well as for a day trip on NYE to Canterbury where I proposed. We lived the driver who met us at the airport, and so requested him for all our excursions, a request that was honored completely. 

Upon our arrival at the hotel, we were met by several staff , all of whom (of course) knew our names. Our room was modern, not quite a true suite, but with a separate closet area and a very nice bathroom. Shower and tub fixtures were wonderful, including a large rain shower head. We never ran out of hot water. 

Room service food was quite good the one time we ordered. Breakfasts and dinners in the hotel were excellent. I am not suggesting you should want to eat in, but if the weather or any physical discomfort causes you to, you will not regret it. Dinner at Massimo was superb. 

Our day trip to Canterbury was perfect. Skies were blue, it was a chill crisp day, with thick frost on the fields, and traffic was light guy. We arrived at the cathedral shortly after it opened and had the place almost to ourselves. I had Ben to Canterbury before but my fiancée had never been outside Heathrow. It was perfect. And she said ""yes."" That night, we celebrated NY with new friends and one of the more spectacular fireworks displays I had ever seen. The Corinthia is situated right at the Millennium Bridge, just a couple of blocks down from Trafalgar, a wonderful place to stroll and enjoy shops, excellent morning espresso, afternoon and evening pubs, and all the fixtures of Trafalgar. Citizenry access to London on NYE is limited, but all hotel guests have access to an event wristband. We celebrated NYE with the hotel's gala dinner (including some fun music), met new friends next to our table, and ended up celebrating the fireworks all together. Simply magical. ",5,2015,06,02
143,Perfect hotel for our honeymoon,"When booking our honeymoon to London we wanted a hotel that would make us feel special and the Corinthia didn't disappoint. From the moment we arrived until we left, the staff couldn't do enough for us. The hotel was a little more expensive that we would normally go for but as it was our honeymoon we wanted to push the boat out, the Corinthia is expensive but you get exactly what you pay for - a top quality hotel. I'll be surprised if I ever stay in a hotel that can out do the Corinthia.

The hotel spa is out of this world and has to be experienced to be believed, photos don't do it justice. The Bassoon Bar is definitely worth a visit, we only popped in for a drink and ended up staying all night, great drinks, knowledgeable bar staff and live music, we didn't need to go anywhere else.

In summary, if you just want a place to sleep while in London then I would say look for another hotel and save yourself some money. If on the other hand you want to experience a luxury hotel then stop looking, you've found it!",5,2015,06,02
143,Excellence in every way !!!,"I'd been lucky to stay a night at Corinthia Hotel , the experience was unique , everything is top notch , the rooms, the dining, the spa,the sound system in the bathroom , amazingly beautiful , with an incredible location and extraordinary architecture this has become my favorite hotel in London, not to say that you might have breakfast with Pacino an Arab Prince or one of the members of The Black Eyed Peas ...Love It!",5,2015,06,01
143,Perfection!,"Total and utter perfection!  It has taken me a year to get around to writing this, but our trip in May of 2014 included a 7 night stay at this lovely hotel. It was a 30th anniversary celebration - we don't normally stay is such luxurious quarters - but it was so lovely to return here after touring all day and bask in the luxury of a soak in a big bathtub and watch the tv at the same time!  Also, please have afternoon tea here!  Love, love, love everything about The Corinthia!",5,2015,05,31
143,Disappointed in room,"Very disappointed in the room (executive room, streetview) - which was small in size and cleanliness can be improved. Room decor is a little old. Different from photo shown on website ( missing fireplace, and mirror/clock on wall ) Pricey and i get a far better suite at Rosewood with lower price yet excellent service overthere.",2,2015,05,31
143,REGULAR STAYS,We have been staying at The Corinthia since opening 5 years ago.  We have tried many others but always return to this beautiful hotel.  Good location within walking distance of Trafalgar Square and beyond into Regent Street.  Very Welcoming and attentive staff.  Rooms always good.,5,2015,05,31
143,Pretty impressive.,"Lovely ambience, quiet and luxurious. Corinthia offers one of the best afternoon teas in London in my perspective. Service was also pretty attentive and polite. Beautiful furnitures. Would recommend to friends and family.",4,2015,05,31
143,Perfection,"We had a bit of an afternoon here, we did not stay in the hotel. Firstly we had tea as a means of avoiding going out in the rain, we had dinner reservations elsewhere however as soon as we saw Massimo we cancelled and sat down for an amazing 3-course meal! We then had a drink in the bar. The service was always great, the food and drinks were great. The food was very reasonably priced, we got a £30 3-course meal with prosecco, this included a sampling of breads with olive oil. You couldn't get that amount of food or that quality at a high street chain for that money!",5,2015,05,30
143,THE BEST PLACE FOR NEW YEARS EVE!,"we had our dinner at the restaurant.very nice starters but i couldnt eat any of the main because im vegeterian and they cook for me a pasta wich i didnt like it.
after we had our new years eve party at the penthouse suite.the view was breathtaking!",5,2015,05,30
143,Truly wonderful in every way......,"What can one say?...Everything was perfect in every way.  I booked through lastminute and thought I would get a smaller room......on the contrary, on checking in I was upgraded.  Every single member of staff could not have been more helpful.
The room was beautiful and the bathroom excellent.  The bed was so large and comfortable....I had the best night's sleep I have had in years.
We ate dinner in the Northall......the food excellent as was the service.
The Spa is just amazing........like something out of a Bond movie....and had a wonderful manicure.
I come to London every couple of months.......this will now be my hotel of choice.  In my humble opinion.....much better than stays at The Berkeley, The Langham, Claridges and the St James' Club.
I have just booked direct with the hotel for my stay in July.  I cannot wait!
Thank you",5,2015,05,28
143,Birthday dinner ,"I visited this month(May 2015) as my family had arranged an early birthday treat for me!Excellent food,staff and view!in my opinion I think it was worth every penny!highly recommend this hotel to people in a visit or those who wish to spend some time in a very decent hotel!",5,2015,05,27
143,Phenomenal hotel - luxury and service in the perfect location,"First of all...perfect location. Steps to the Underground...Walking distance to Buckingham Palace, The London Eye, West end theatres, Shakespeare's Globe , Covent Garden and more. 
We have stayed previously in several other 5 star London hotels but were referred to the Corinthia by a taxi driver on our last visit!
Our family usually flies to the UK from Canada on an overnight flight...arriving quite early in the morning.....long before regular check in time. We were treated with complementary tea and baked goods in the beautiful lobby bar while the fabulous staff found a room to accommodate us for a quick nap until our assigned rooms were ready. Never has that happened before! 
The rooms themselves were wonderful. The beds were extremely comfortable...The towel heaters a treat...great water pressure in the showers. Housekeeping was impeccable. 
The room for our three children contained special snacks, toiletries and stuffed animal presents just for them. 
Our return flight was cancelled for inclement weather and the staff were again graciously able to accommodate our request to extend our stay by an additional day. 
This hotel is our new London favourite and my children are all ready begging to return!",5,2015,05,26
143,Opulence tastefully done- a seamless transition between past and present,"A fanastic overall hotel, with history, charm, modern amentities, and fantastic service.  Dining options were fine, but i was not blown away.  The wine we had was not good at all, and they naturally comped it when we switched to beer.  Service is fabulous here. A solid business hotel but i can see myself coming for pleasure as well.  good workout facility and massive spa (at least from what i can tell).",5,2015,05,26
143,Our Wonderful Wedding at the Amazing Corinthia!,"From the moment we walked into the Corinthia Hotel, we knew that this was the place where we wanted to get married. Not only is the venue itself incredible but the professionalism of the staff meant that all other venues paled in comparison.
Claire and Amanda took care of every detail and helped with the organisation and planning of our big day. The celebrations began when we arrived with our family at the Corinthia the day prior to our wedding.  What could have been a stressful time actually felt like a perfect holiday as we were treated to first-class and friendly service.
Amanda and Hannah ensured that the whole weekend ran smoothly and even eased a few nerves along the way! 
The River Suite was out of this world and the panoramic views of London and the River Thames were breathtaking.
We have also had so many compliments from our guests about the service, food and beauty of the hotel. 
Our wedding was wonderful as we became man and wife. The fact that it was held at the Corinthia was the icing on our wedding cake!",5,2015,05,26
143,Perfect city stay,"We stayed here after we got a great deal on last minute and decided to go and watch a show, we read good things about the hotel but when we arrived it was sensational - so grand, marble everywhere, the staff were all so polite and reception staff were really helpful despite there being an issue with our booking (last minutes fault) they quickly and without causing any stress sorted out room with a Complimentary upgrade! We were pretty amazed by the room, the bathroom had a tv, under floor heating - plenty of decent toiletries - the little touches that make the difference. The bed was incredibly comfortable! The location is perfect if you are coming from Waterloo - it's a 5/7 min walk from the station and about a 30 second walk to the nearest tube station, plus only a 8 min walk to theatres and ten mins are you are in the heart of the hustle and bustle with all the shops- glorious hotel!!",5,2015,05,26
143,"Wonderful Hotel, with great staff in an excellent location.","This is a wonderful hotel with the best staff (ALL of them) who could not be more polite and helpful. The bedroom is VERY user friendly and management must have actually tried using the room to make it that good! Food was wonderful, served by very efficient and pleasant staff. Location excellent for theatres, sightseeing and shopping.
This will be our ""Go To"" hotel in London.",5,2015,05,26
143,wonderful,"The hotel is great and very good service. Rooms are fantastic, location is great, and food very good. Prizes are high but according service, though my company was able to negotiate a good deal. A great place, I will remember.",4,2015,05,26
143,Delicious Afternoon Tea!,"Having recently had Afternoon Tea at Hilton Park Lane, The Savoy and The Langham, I had high expectations for The Corinthia, another of London's most prestigious hotels.

First impressions were good - a welcoming, airy room to serve Afternoon Tea, which looks absolutely stunning. Certainly compares well with the above mentioned hotels, albeit I think The Savoy is a hard one to beat.

There is an excellent selection of tea to try from. My tip? Try the hot chocolate!
It comes served with a stylish tower of mini marshmallows, chocolate curls and other bits to drop in as you wish - a real experience!

The sandwiches and scones were delicious, just as expected. The cakes are where this place do really well - by far the best selection I've had at Afternoon Tea!
Each one dainty and delicious...and if you can't finish them all, they'll box them up for you to take away.

Something that The Corinthia could do here however, would be to have a pianist playing (or at least some music) - this makes a big difference and is something I loved at The Savoy.

Overall, would I return? Yes I would...although I'd rather try London's other top hotels first.",5,2015,05,25
143,Fantastic and very good service,"Recenlty, I organized an event in the Corinthia and we hosted about 20 person in the hotel. The hotel is great and very good service. Rooms are fantastic, location is great, and food very good. Prizes are high but according service, though my company was able to negotiate a good deal. A great place, I will remember.",5,2015,05,24
143,Amazing,"I just finally found the time to give my review to this amzing hotel. Words are meaningless. Business traveler or not you will enjoy this great hotel close to the river Thames abd charing cross railway which is important if you're in a hurry the whole day... The four floor spa is really impressive with espa therapy offers a very relaxing feeling. All staff is amazing and beyond imagination.
Thank you.",5,2015,05,23
143,The most fantastic hotel,"This was just the most fabulous hotel. It had a lovely feel to it and it reminded me slightly of George V.  In fact it definitely reminded me of some fantastic European hotels but with a British twist. The room decor is beautiful. Just feels luxurious. The spa is also lovely. We only went for a swim as we had our child with us but I inagine the treatments would be amazing. The breakfast was yummy with a great selection and we had lunch in the Italian restaurant which was very good. 

The concierge deserve a particular mention ad they were incredibly helpful and did above and beyond

I can't wait to stay again!",5,2015,05,22
143,Afternoon Tea - very special,"The lobby lounge is where I took my mum for a birthday treat and we enjoyed a sumptuous choice of sandwiches, scones and pastries. All beautifully made and presented. A varied choice of teas to choose and you could try more than one. The staff were very attentive and very helpful when the food arrived in telling you what each was made from. They surprised my mum with a birthday, decorated plate and a huge thank you for that. Memories have been made and we will return. ",5,2015,05,21
143,CENTRAL FOR EVERYTHING,"Was in London for a special occasion and this hotel was simply brilliant. Close to all the usual sightseeing spots including Downing St and The Palace. Food in the restaurant was second to none, one of the best meals I have had in a while. Private dining room was lovely with brilliant staff throughout. Hotel rooms have stunning views, very quiet and very very comfy. I wont stay anywhere else when visiting London in the future.",5,2015,05,20
143,Fantastic Property in the heart of London,"terrific hotel, magnificent service, opulent rooms, cool factor off the charts.  Star sightings on two occasions.  Everything thought through and execute on just right throughout our visit.  This has become our go to destination hotel in London.",5,2015,05,19
143,Afternoon tea delightful!,"The Best afternoon tea Ever! 
Set in a beautiful surrounding and The staff are so attentive from the start to your departure. 
The tea selection is perfect - champagne was divine. 
sandwiches are fresh and tasty with themed cakes that are just heavenly. 
Do yourself a favour and treat yourself it's amazing! 
Thank you Corinthia Hotel x",5,2015,05,18
143,Amazing,"I booked a room in this hotel so I can propose to my girlfriend and it was way above what I expected. 

It was a proper luxury experience. 

They met all my few demands like have the word spelt out Marry me on the bed with flower petals and they even upgraded our room for free. 

Highly recommend this place and would definitely go back. ",5,2015,05,18
143,Fantastic hotel!,"Fantastic hotel in the centre of London.

Staff were attentive, nothing was too much trouble.

Enjoyed drinks in the Bassoon Bar during the afternoon which was nice and relaxing.

Highly recommended for those that appreciate quality surroundings.",5,2015,05,17
143,Absolutely wonderful hotel!,"I stayed here with my family for 2 days for a very special occasion. It was a brilliant stay from start to finish. The staff are all so friendly and nothing is an issue.  We had a problem with our air conditioning and it was fixed very promptly.
The rooms are all finished to a very high standard and the beds are extremely comfortable.
We had a lunch in their private dining room in Massimo restaurant which was excellent. The food was out of this world, there were 10 of us and no one had any complaints.
The hotel is in a great location,  very close to major tourist attractions such as Buckingham Palace and Downing street.
I would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely go back next time I am in London.",5,2015,05,17
143,Stayed for business,"Near the Thames across from the Eye.  Wonderful ambience, room and service.   I go to London once a year and usually stay in a different hotel each time.  Will go back to this one - may become a regular.  Walkable to many sites and right near the Embankment tube station. ",5,2015,05,16
143,Unsurpassed.,"The attention to every detail makes the Corinthia my favourite place in the world to stay.

I have stayed in a great many hotels in London and around the world and the Corinthia is the only one to date that I cannot fault in any way - always an absolute pleasure!",5,2015,05,13
143,Fantastic Hotel!,"Came here to celebrate my birthday, What a lovely hotel. Greeted by some lovely doorman and this continued throughout the hotel.  All staff were very helpful, Breakfast very good with lots of choice. My only negative( very reluctant to write this) regarding the breakfast was we had to ask twice for the hot food trays  to be filled causing the food already on our plates to then go cold. Not a major blip but should not happen. Rooms very spacious, fabulous .bathroom. Cant wait to return",5,2015,05,12
143,Fantastic hotel,THE best hotel we have ever stayed in. The service and attention to detail was perfect. The hotel was stunning. We stayed for 2 nights and had a fantastic time. The Spa is a must. Lovely surroundings and very calm. Highly recommended.,5,2015,05,11
143,Superb,"We have just returned from a weekend stay at the Corinthia, all I can say is what a wonderful hotel. It was very well located with all the main sights, shopping and amenities nearby. 

We stopped in a junior suite and the room was lovely, with a separate seating area which my boyfriend enjoyed as he got to watch the football on sky sports whilst I relaxed in the superb marble bathroom (with TV over the bath and watched what I wanted!)The Espa toiletries were gorgeous.

The food in the hotel was excellent, we ate breakfast in the Northall both days and the buffet was very good. We also had room service and this was just as good.

The speed of service and attentiveness of the staff was a real credit to the hotel. Check in was very smooth and we were shown to our room and the facilities explained.

Room service and any other requests (numerous pots of tea!) arrived very quickly and the phone was answered almost immediately whenever we rang down to room service or housekeeping.

We were also fortunate enough to be near the VE Day celebrations (we had actually booked to go down for my 40th birthday) and spent time in St James' Park where the atmosphere was lovely and we saw the veterans having a wonderful day after their service and parade. This added to the excitement of the General Election (we had a quick walk to Downing Street) made for a wonderful weekend and we have already booked to return in a couple of months.

The spa and gym were amazing. The thermal floor has a sauna, steam room, pool and hydrotherapy pool and is free for all guests. A nice place to unwind after a long day walking around.

This is now our favourite London hotel - I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.",5,2015,05,11
143,Excellent afternoon tea,"We stayed outside. A charming terrace with amazing aged porto bottles and flower bouquets. Sandwiches, cakes, scones are part if this great afternoon tea. The 30 year porto is exquisite. Lovely afternoon.",5,2015,05,10
143,Exceptional hotel in the heart of London !,"Corinthia is what you consider an exceptional five star hotel in the heart of London. Service is attentive, super friendly and well trained. Breakfast is open until 12 am which is not common and the Spa facilities lead to pure relaxation. A special thanks to Jochem (Front Office Manager) for making our stay so special !",5,2015,05,10
143,Wonderful Modern Hotel & Staff!,"With so many hotels in London to choose from we turned to Trip Advisor for help (as we always do). I can understand why this hotel receives such great reviews and deserves all 5 stars. There is absolutely nothing to negative about this hotel. We booked through the Amex web site with Fine Hotels and Resorts and received a room upgrade, free wifi, and credit towards the restaurant or spa. 

From the lobby to the rooms, to the restaurants, the modern decor was done impeccably. The bathrooms are huge and have the best amenities. The wifi is FAST - doing a Webex is no problem, and watching Sling at night had no issues. The staff was excellent and so helpful. There is easy access to the Underground across the street at the Embankment station, and many of London's landmarks are a quick 5 minute walk away. On our next trip to London we will stay at the Corinthia - there will be no other choice!",5,2015,05,09
143,"Wonderful hotel, great location, world class service","As many have said previously....Wow!  The Corinthia provides the whole 5 star package in a modern, thoughtful, and quintessentially British way.  Virtually impossible to fault from the Doormen & Concierge on first arrival (our bags were out of our hands within a few steps inside the building), though the room, breakfast, spa & checkout.

It's hard to put your finger on it exactly, but what the Corinthia gets so right is the subtlety, genuine enthusiasm and lack of pretentiousness whilst providing a true 'old school' 5 star service. 

Particular mention to Emily who checked us in.  Nothing was too much effort for her including showing us to our room (without us asking, just standard service) and taking us on a quick tour of the hotel, at our request, to show us the main areas including the spa.

A birthday cake and present were waiting in the room for our daughter.  She was delighted, a lovely touch - many thanks.

The Spa & Pool were amazing.  Again what the Corinthia gets right here is letting the children use the pool area for set times during the day.  Peace for the adults for the most part of the day (and I fully understand that, when you're paying considerable money to enjoy world class spa facilities), yet time for the little ones to enjoy themselves too.  A well balanced solution.

Breakfast was excellent, our host, Anneka(?), seemed genuinely happy to serve us.

It's not cheap to stay at the Corinthia (but nor are any 5 star London hotels), but I still think it's good value for money - you really do get what you pay for.  We will be back......maybe without the children!",5,2015,05,09
143,Beautiful hotel. Less than 5 star service.,"We stayed in a River Suite because we wanted use the living room for a private business meeting with two other colleagues. First we had a late breakfast meeting into a working lunch in Northall. The food was great, the service was spotty. Because we were working we didn't mind so much but all of us noticed how long it took them to initially come over for orders. 

When we reserved, we arranged for white boards, markers and afternoon tea to be brought to the suite at 4pm. We also asked for a gluten free tea service for me because of my celiac disease. At 1st they said they couldn't accomodate which we found odd and we commented that they should be able to provide service for guests with food allergies considering they are considered a 5-star hotel and they should really check with their manager or Director of operations to find out for sure. They immediately confirmed they could conveniently. 

When we went to the suite at 2pm after a very full and long working lunch, our tea service was already there. We rang to ask them to please take it back because we arranged it for 4pm and would like it fresh. 

They seemed to not understand why we wanted it sent back. We had to reiterate we arranged for tea service to be delivered at tea time which we organised for 4pm, not 2pm and we would like the tea hot & fresh. 

They came and took it back...or so we thought! When 4:30 rolls around and no tea service we thought it was odd but gave them the benefit of the doubt that they were remaking everything fresh. 
At 4:45 we rang and they told us they left the cart outside the door. We asked why they didn't buzz because we had no idea it was there and they told us it was the cart from the previous service!

We were very surprised. After much to-ing & fro-ing again, long story short, we had to ask them to come to the room to explicitly re-tell them to please remake the tea. We kept the cakes and fruit to keep it really simple for them. 

They finally got it but sheesh!  

Other than that, we had a fine evening. We went down for few drinks in the glamourous Northall Bar which was very nice and low-key. 

Bed was comfy and the room was clean and nicely appointed with cool coffee table books for reading in our suite. 

Overall: The hotel is absolutely lovely. Very chic yet grand feeling. Maybe it was an off day (although it even started when we were reserving) but it's quite a pricey hotel and considers itself 5 star. For 5-star the service has to be impeccable. This wasn't our experience sadly.",3,2015,05,09
143,Wow. What a great place ,"Stayed here for a few nights on business. Location, staff, facilities and everything absolutely top notch. Very difficult to fault anything although I was glad I was not paying the bill. 
Gym was great and open 24 hours per day. Was a shame I did not have the opportunity to use all of the facilities. ",5,2015,05,09
143,Best in London ,"I have had the pleasure of visiting London on a number of occasions and it's normally a family break. However, this hotel has to be the best I have stayed at in London. We stayed in an executive king room and it was fabulous. The bathroom was amazing and especially the bathtub with its built-in TV. The staff were excellent and extremely accommodating. The ESPA spa was something to behold and is top of the range. My only slight criticism would be that the breakfast buffet could have been a little better. Other than that a fine experience and a hotel I hope to visit again. ",5,2015,05,05
143,Refined relaxed luxury at its best!,"After staying for our wedding anniversary, I can see why The Corinthia Hotel does so well in the ratings. In my opinion it should be number one. From the moment we approached the hotel we were greeted by very helpful and friendly doormen, this continued throughout the hotel with every staff member we met. It felt like the staff really enjoy working there and have a real passion to please. Stefano in the bassoon bar was so friendly, courteous and professional. We just loved every small detail in the spotlessly clean room, like the lavender on the pillows at turndown, and the fine presentation of our own toiletries on crisp fine linen. The room itself and the huge bathroom was spectacular. Our stay concluded with a beautifully cooked and presented breakfast, in our room. Fine quality ingredients, of which we appreciated the provenance, and served hot. It was the perfect end to our stay which we wished would never end.
It only remains for me now to bore every body I meet re-living our wonderful experience, and look forward to our next stay!",5,2015,05,05
143,Amazing Afternoon tea!!,"We booked afternoon tea as part as a weekend away for our friends hem do and couldnt recommend this place enough! As soon as we arrived they took our bags and coats and made us feel at home. We sat on the most comfy sofas and armchairs and everyone was commenting (and taking lots of photos) about the beautiful decor and surroundings . Our waiter Joe was so accomadating and we couldnt thank him enough. He kept offering us more tea, scones and cakes (even though there was so much that we ended up taking nine cakes home with us!). The food was superb and the tea was delicious!! We had the wedding tea, and the hen liked it so much she wanted to by some but unfortunatly there wasnt any. However our evere attentive waiter Joe gave her a couple of sachets as a treat for the morning of her wedding!! As well as a tin of very similiar tea. Needless to say we all came away very full and impressed and shall be returning next year for a reunion! Thanks!!",5,2015,05,04
143,Super Awesome Beautiful Hotel,"So beautifully quirky and yet stylish and yet modern and yet somehow quintessentially English ... the staff there go the extra mile to make you feel at home ... for example, when I staggered back to the Hotel after finishing the London Marathon, the doormen were amazingly kind ... oh and the hydro therapy pool in the spa was fantastic for my recovery....

I give it 6 stars out of 5",5,2015,05,04
143,Must Go Again,"Our stay at the Corinthia was a 50th birthday present from a friend and he chose the hotel.  Well I don't think I could have done any better if I'd done it myself.  Firstly, the staff.  They were, every single one, the best that you could hope for, from the efficient check-in to check-out you couldn't fault them. We had a deluxe king room and it was spacious with a very comfy, if somewhat firm, bed.  The bathroom was very well appointed with a rainfall shower and TV at the end of the bath! Luxury!  The turn down service included putting bath mats on the floor by the bath and shower.  We had breakfast and opted for the all you could eat buffet at £32 which included all the usual from fruit, yoghurts and cereal to bacon, eggs, sausages and smoked fish and meats.  Special mention for the rolls which were delicious.  Coffee also really good.  Can't wait to go back.",5,2015,05,03
143,Splendid Sunday - Northall Bar,"A rather disappointing lunch at a nearby hotel left us wanting the wow factor to celebrate my friends 50th and we popped into this hotel as it was nearby

Wow, we went into the Northall bar and spent a fantastic afternoon with cocktails, champagne and oysters.

The staff were uber efficient and yet friendly and this visit saved the day in making my friend feel special.

We loved it so much, I've booked for a special occasion meal for next Bank Holiday and THIS time will remember my camera to take photos of this splendid place",5,2015,05,03
143,Two day mid week break,"This is our 4th visit and is still our favourite hotel. I can't recommend the hotel highly enough. Staff very friendly and efficient. Made good use of the spa facilities - fantastic. Can also recommend The Massimo restaurant, ideal for pre-theatre dinner.",5,2015,04,30
143,Excellent,Fantastic hotel and excellent service. Travel alot this will be my choice next time in London. Friendly efficient staff. Keep up the good work Room was spotlessly clean. Food was great complimented with first class service.,5,2015,04,29
143,Great second visit,"Stayed again last weekend with the same crowd, I felt this hotel hotel deserves a second review because this time, the front of house staff were very polite and efficient, huge improvement from last visit, nothing was too much trouble and the rooms were ready early this time, which was a bonus. Same high standard throughout,  in the rooms, very clean and stylish, complete with 3 apples on the table again,I asked for an iron and board and the response was prompt and helpful. 
There is a but, however, and that is the service was still very slow in the bar, our group arrived in stages, so not needing drinks all at once, my friend waited 15 minutes for  her drink  to arrive, having already waited to order, our group lunch was served promptly, with delicious warm bread to tuck into while waiting for the starter.
Again my steak took ages, it was very tough, even with a steak knife it was a battle to cut, and it wasn't well done as requested, but we were short on time so couldn't be bothered to complain. 
All in all, a fabulous hotel in a fabulous location and we will, no doubt, be staying there again next year!!!",5,2015,04,28
143,Top shelf 5 star,"The Corinthian hotel is in a league of its own.
4 years old with the feeling of yesterday year with a modern twist .
Daily high teas for those who wish run by in house harrods.
Sit in front of the fire inside if you wish .
Step into the court yard of which enjoys a fire place both ends lounges and snugly rugs.
Full service for afternoon teas or a beverage .
We were upgraded to a large suite with a walk in robe .
There are so many pluses for staying from in house florist to restaurants .
Ps you never know who you might see the cast for the new avengers stayed during our week and of course the papparatzi .
Terrific location near Trafalgar Square .",5,2015,04,28
143,Incredible Hotel and Spa,"My wife and I stayed at Corinthia over Christmas for 3 nights in an Executive King Room.  The spa at the hotel is incredible and worth staying at the hotel just to experience the spa.  We ate in both restaurants, had afternoon tea in the lobby and drinks at Bassoon Bar.  The hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas.  Our room was very clean and the bathroom was extremely spacious.  It is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed and I plan to return again.",5,2015,04,27
143,Impressive All Around,"This hotel was designed to impress, and it really pulls it off.  Everywhere we went the posh modern elegance of the hotel was evident.  The look and style of the hotel is also very cohesive and blends together nicely to create a grand hotel experience in the middle of a great city.  

We stayed in a deluxe room that exceeded our high expectations.  The room was large enough to include two chairs, a long lounge chaise, and a bench at the end of the bed.  The color scheme was light earth tones. The look of the room was very soothing and refined with good use of light woodwork that gave the room a slight masculine feel.  The full luxurious bathroom was also sublime with ample use of white marble and even a full window.  The room also came with very good lighting that could be adjusted to create different moods, and attractive art work.  Our only complaints were that closet and drawer space was very limited, and we also could hear a little road noise on floor 6.  Of over two hundred room stays, this room fell right into our top ten list.

The hotel is large and has beautiful public spaces throughout the ground floor to take advantage of.  Each has its own flavor and style, and there should be a space that meets your needs including two stylish restaurants.  One of the more unique spots is a small open air courtyard seating area with two fireplaces.  

The spa at the hotel is very large for a city hotel, but the layout is not ideal, as it is on four levels. This space is also very bold, mostly on the dark side and a little too clubby looking for our tastes, but it still is very nice.  The pool is just large enough to swim laps, and there are several dry and wet spa options.  The gym area is large enough to get a full workout.  We used the spa several times and it was nice to have this available to us given that most city type hotels do not have spa facilities as extensive as this one. 

Overall the service at the hotel was very good, including a nice turn down service with a different item left behind each night.  The location of the hotel is very good especially given the size of the city.  There are plenty of main points of interest within walking distance and the Thames River is just half a block away.  

This hotel came across to us as a world class facility, and in a city full of great hotels, this one will be hard not to return to.",5,2015,04,25
143,We keep returning....,"We just completed a 4 night stay at the Corinthia in two connecting Deluxe rooms.  We were traveling with our 9 and 10 year old children.  The rooms are spacious and the interior (courtyard) facing rooms are quiet and comfortable.  Our children love the breakfast buffet which even includes some dim sum items.  The location is perfect.  Trafalgar square, the National Gallery, the West End, Covent Garden and Soho are all an easy walk.  The spa and pool are very nice, but remember they do have limited hours for children.  There are so many great hotels in London, but we keep returning to the Corinthia because it's hard to beat the location, the contemporary design, the service, and the amenities.",5,2015,04,24
143,5 star hotel with 5 star service,"Stayed here for just one night and was very impressed. The valet parking made my life a lot easier after battling the London traffic, cost £55 but so worth it to park at the door. Bed was extremely comfortable and the deep bath heavenly...Had an early dinner in the lounge area rather than the restaurant, good quality, well cooked food and great breakfast the next morning. Car delivered to the door when I was ready to leave...",5,2015,04,23
143,"Fabulous five star, fantastic breakfast.","Stayed for 3 nights for business, lovely rooms, awesome walk in wardrobe and enormous bathroom (with a tv in the bath!) and great power shower.  Room very comfortable and great bed.  Nice turn down service.
Good spa, very well equipped gym.
Awesome breakfast - can't say more than that!",5,2015,04,22
143,Lovely..,"Lovely Hotel, great location, clean and modern but still some character. Lovely size as not too big or too small. Staff were attentive and room was good. Breakfast buffet was one if the best I have had.",5,2015,04,19
143,Great for afternoon tea ,Visited for afternoon tea. Really fantastic food and service. Lots of choice and they let you tailor it to what you like most. Even gave cakes to take home for my children. Best afternoon tea I've had in London and that includes a number of the top hotels. ,5,2015,04,18
143,Brilliant hotel,Staff accommodating and welcoming. Rooms luxurious. Relaxed and gracious. Best hotel in London. Restaurants are consistent and serve quality food. Northall restaurant is high quality but relatively expensive. Beautiful decor. Will definitely return. ,5,2015,04,18
143,First class Corinthia,This hotel from top to bottom oozes excellence the staff are superbly trained and attentive without being condescending the rooms beautiful and comfortable and the spa is outstanding as is the food.Finally the location next to the Thames and close to Trafalger square is hard to beat.,5,2015,04,18
143,One of my go-to place for business travels.,"I am a regular business traveller and really appreciate their hotel. It's clean, the staff is very (VERY!) accommodating when it comes to personal preferences, and the food is pretty good for a hotel.

I prefer to have a room to with a view onto the street and pretty much always get that.
The bathroom in my room are always massive in size, and the tub has a TV… in case you want to watch something while relaxing. The bed is firm (which I like) and the coffee machine makes a decent espresso. Fresh milk would be a bonus… but you can always call the concierge for that.

It's certainly a high-class hotel, and a lot of other guests seems to work in the financial sector. As someone who works in tech, most of us don't dress in the same way. You may get looks from folks, but certainly not from staff. They are just a charm.

The one snag that I found was that when I order breakfast to my room the night before with my fill-out sheet, I didn't get a new one the next day. I was told this will be addressed with staff, so whoever is going to benefit from that, you're welcome ;)

Oh, and the only awkwardness is when you stay a long time and you live off room-service food (I think my last stay was 10 days), they do remember your name. And your order from the previous day. And whatever drinks you had to accompany the food.",4,2015,04,17
143,It's all about the spa,"All very 5 star impressive, especially as Manchester United were staying their for their away London game. Room could've been bigger, but lovely bathroom and all well appointed. Breakfast was ok; not particularly 5 star. BUT THE SPA!!!!? Amazing, wonderful, ""How the other half live"" and all that. Go.",4,2015,04,17
143,Not worth your money,"We stayed here in the run up to Christmas on our way home to family for Christmas day. We were here for a total of 5 nights, we were shown our room and were really disappointed at the size, way too much furniture in a really small area and there is very little room to lay your bags so we didn't bother un packing - oddly the bathroom was a decent size in comparison. Considering the amount of days we were staying in to hotel and flying internationally with a lot of baggage the room was not well chosen for us despite us mentioning where we had come from etc to the receptionist checking us in.
There is no doubt the hotel is exquisite, decor is stunning and the main reason why I chose the hotel. Staff on the other hand left a lot to be desired, reception was underwhelming, we were rudely turned away from the bfast room one morning as we were 10 mins past the time - understand that we were late but staff should be able to explain in a courteous and friendly manner where we can get bfast (in the room next door it seems after we asked around) - it left a bitter taste and was to set the scene for the rest our time there. Concierge was the same, pretty snobby and not inviting or friendly. The spa is beautiful and would recommend you take advantage of this. The location is ok - we usually stay in the Mayfair area so for us we can spend the same money and get a better hotel in a better area (in our opinion). Would we go back? No you can get much more for your money.",2,2015,04,16
143,The best hotel in London? Quite possibly...,"This truly is an exceptional hotel. We ran one of our flagship development programmes at The Corinthia for three days using the Neslon room as our plenary with our cyber cafe in the Victory room and serving lunch in Hardy (which was also an occasional break out area). While the Nelson room doesn't have natural light and is a bit noisy with the the aircon, it wasn't a problem.

Lunch on the first day was on the Northall mezzanine and delivered a real wow factor in terms of the space as well as the excellent food. Breakfast and dinner in Northall restaurant as well as Massimo private dining were all consistently outstanding in terms of food and service. Our people are used to high standards so to impress them is quite something.

The staff are consistently friendly and efficient and must have all been very well trained. The bedrooms are beautiful and very comfortable. One of our participants (who is used to staying in great hotels) said this was the best bedroom she's ever had in a hotel. 

This really is a super hotel with excellent food and flawless service.",5,2015,04,16
143,What a splendid marvelous hotel,"Would never have stayed there had it not been for a friends suggestion. I stayed in a King deluxe. I was not disappointed at all. Modern and spacious with the best bathroom I could ever have experienced in a London hotel. None of the tacky shower in a bathtub you so often get in a number of the five star alternatives. I scored a really good rate, however did not include breakfast and by golly that was expensive. 
However you are smack bang walking distance to so many tourist sites and a 5 minute walk into the theatre district. I tossed with getting an Uber. I was seeing ""The book of Mormon"" and estimated would take longer to get there by Uber than by foot. Central, posh it's my firm favourite. ",5,2015,04,14
143,Not stayed here but would love to!,"I'e just attended an event here and felt I had to write a review.  Its an absolutely beautiful hotel with fantastic staff who are friendly, attentive and helpful without being snooty (although they'd have every right to be working in such a glamourous hotel!).  The staff at our event were ever present with champagne, canapes and smiles and, talking of canapes, they were amazing, like little mouthfuls of heaven.  Even things you didn't think you'd like (goat's cheese!) tasted amazing.No creepy bathroom attendants waiting for you when you get out of the cubicle, just plentiful Espa products with lovely, fresh rolled up towels  I'm not in the market for marriage but, if I was, I'd do it here! The decoration is gorgeous, the ambience heavenly and the food, out of this world.  I really, really enjoyed the 'Artists in Residence' event I attend and i'd thoroughly recommend the Corinthia for events and if I didn't already live in London, I'd stay here - it's a gorgeous hotel, well run and deserving of its 5 stars!.",5,2015,04,13
143,Excellant place to stay,"Lovely hotel that I would definitely recommend and stay at again. We stayed for two nights on our return from Honeymoon and the staff were lovely. We were upgrade to the Club Floor this entitles you to a lovely buffet breakfast, afternoon tea and Happy hour with all you can eat canapes and drinks.",4,2015,04,13
143,英国を代表する歴史的ホテル,"After renovation, rooms are much nicer yet the great architecture still remains in variety of parts of the hotel. Services is beyond the expectation and full of surprise and delight. If you are keen to experience traditional British culture, I couldn't think any other hotels, riding Black taxi or horses, concierge with long coat and hat, tea time in the fascinating lounge. Access to most of the tourist spot is easily be done by taking tube or bus or taxi and no stress of getting around.",5,2015,04,11
143,"Great location, great service, nice rooms","The Corinthia arguably has the best location for a tourist in London, across from the Thames and a block from Trafalgar Square.

We were there for 9 nights.  The Deluxe Room seemed to cramped for a long stay, and after a couple of days they kindly upgraded us to a spacious Executive Room.

Beautiful architecture.  Very comfortable room with openable windows, luxury bathroom, comfy bed.

The thermal floor is lovely, steam room, sauna, jacuzzi, pool.

The fitness room is small, but there is a full gym across the street with daily entry for 5 pounds (the gym.com)

The only disappointment was the buffet breakfast - 36 pounds, with runny scrambled eggs that looked more like soup, no omelette or egg station, and tired fruit.  Poor quality, limited selection, and ridiculously overprice.

But that's a small complaint, many nice breakfast places nearby.

Would certainly choose the Corinthia again.",5,2015,04,10
143,perfect from arrival to departure,"we stayed at the corinthia hotel in London for four nights and were very sad to leave. Upon arrival you get greeted by the porters who open the door for you and help you with the luggage. The procedure at reception was very proficient and quick. The rooms are sparkling clean spacious and offer any detail a luxury stay would need. The spa area is among the best I've ever been to and so is the gym. The probably best thing if you are in London in order to explore the city is the location. Everything is in walking distance (Westminster, trafalgar, Buckingham, Piccadilly, etc.) the staff is very friendly and will go out of their way to provide an exceptional experience at the corinthia in London. ",5,2015,04,09
143,Fatastic Easter Weekend Stay,"I've never written a hotel review before, but felt compelled to do so after our wonderful stay at the simply magnificent Corinthia Hotel London. Every aspect of our visit -- from booking, check-in, our room, dinning, staff and service at the hotel, and our departure -- were flawless.  We stayed in an oversized executive King, exquisitely decorated and furnished, with every modern convenience and feature.  The large walk-in wardrobe provided more than enough space for us to unpack, and the bathroom -- especially its fabulous shower -- was a real pleasure to experience.  Our room, on an upper floor away from busy Northumberland Ave., was one of the quietest rooms I've ever stayed in.  The public areas of the hotel were impeccable, with a sophisticated, contemporary elegance throughout.  Drinks in Bassoon's Bar are not to be missed  (very creative and original), although we also enjoyed relaxing in the Lobby Lounge.  Our dinner at Massimo's was excellent.  Service at the hotel throughout our stay was really exceptional.  We used the concierge desk at the hotel extensively, to book all of our dinner reservations in town, for tours in the city, and to arrange for flowers in our room before arrival.  Everything was perfectly executed, with terrific suggestions and help, in a very courteous and professional style.  If we had any complaint with the hotel at all, it was that our room temperature was a little warm at first; however, a quick call to housekeeping resolved the issue when the engineer adjusted our thermostat.  Our room was kept immaculately clean and evening turn-down service was great: each night we received a different ""treat"" on our pillows.  Our one regret was that we didn't have time to use the spa, which looked and sounded wonderful.  I chose the Corinthia based on the reviews posted in Trip Advisor -- and it's unsurpassed central London location -- but was a little hesitant because of the lack of pedigree this property held when compared to most of its 5-star competitors in London.  However, I can truly say that our stay exceeded my expectations in every possible way.  I simply cannot imagine any other 5-star London hotel (and we visited many of them on our trip) providing a better combination of elegance, comfort, convenience and value than the Corinthia.  After our recent visit, I would not stay anywhere else but here in London.",5,2015,04,07
143,Shopping trip to london,I cannot express enough how amazing this hotel is! Myself and my husband regularly take trips every few months to London for shopping and an overnight stay and for the past 3 years have always stayed at the Mayfair hotel . We found our last few stays to be disappointing so decided to try the Corinthia Hotel . We were blown away at the level of service we received. We could not fault a thing . Utter perfection in every way .we will most definitely be staying here on our next visit !,5,2015,04,06
143,Wow! Just about everything you could ask for...,"After much research we decided to spend 3 nights at the Corinthia in March. Wow! I am a pretty big hotel snob, but loved just about everything about this true five star hotel.  We checked in late after the train from Paris.  Check in was smooth and friendly and attentive.  We were shown to our upgraded executive room and I was afraid it was too small for us with a roll away bed.  They worked hard to find us something else, but I was desperate for a balcony so it limited our options. I did not choose to pay for an upgrade to a much larger suite and as it turned out, the room assigned was fine for us, even perfect!  When a hotel and its rooms are well designed it makes all of the difference in the world. This was a perfect example. The executive room is not huge but just right.  The room also had a little balcony that overlooked their beautiful and quiet courtyard. I should add that I loved the design and decor.  Just so pretty. The bathroom is as fabulous as the pictures. Great double vanity with perfect lighting and huge tub with TV. There was a separate shower and room with toilet and bidet. Soaps and products for all necessities. (Serious pet peeve of mine). 
I am quite particular, and during our check in had a lot of requests. Everything was taken care of quickly, efficiently and with a smile. From the extra blankets, to the portable fan, to the welcoming stuffed animal that was so sweetly given to my very grateful son, it was really quite impressive.  Special thanks to the evening housekeeping gentlemen. Turndown was a treat nightly.  Wifi was excellent as well.
The location CANNOT be beat.
Near the eye, trafalgar, Piccadilly, covent garden, soho Buckingham palace etc.  All within walking distance.
Breakfast was a highlight! I love fancy hotel buffet breakfasts and this was one of my favorites. Huge selection plus a great made to order menu.  Yogurt, cereals, fruit, delicious Belgian waffles, eggs, fish and even Asian delicacies.  The room and service were just wonderful  and my son loved the very special hot chocolate with marshmallows and accoutrement. It certainly kept us going for most of the day.  The concierge was nice and helpful. The doorman and bellman were great as well.
Our only complaint was the room service dinner we had the last night.  The pizza was not edible, an Indonesian dish with dried out chicken and shrimp with undercooked rice was really bad and the rest was mediocre at best. My kid's pasta was just fine but for 85£'s and everything else being so so wonderful, I was really disappointed.
I do not want to end this review on a bad note as I loved our experience there and have already recommended this hotel to many.  It ticked almost every box and really felt like a true five star WOW hotel! With luck, we will definitely be back!",5,2015,04,05
143,Exceptional Exceptional Exceptional,"This hotel should be the definition of what a 5 star hotel should be like. The service is absolutely exceptional. Look no further and choose this hotel, you won't be disappointed. One of the if not THE most amazing hotels I've stayed at all over the world.",5,2015,04,05
143,Exceptional service,"This is a beautiful 5* hotel with the kind of service you would expect from a hotel of this quality.  Rooms are lovely.  We loved the bath with TV!  Gorgeous Espa toiletries and fantastic coffee in rooms. The spa is fabulous.  
We did have one or two problems, however, the manager handled these in a very generous and professional manner...in fact we have been offered a complimentary return visit!
I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for top quality accommodation in London.",4,2015,04,03
143,Perfection in London,"Classy, elegance,  contemporary,  location is ideal. Entry level rooms are bigger than most hotel suites in London.  The staff are beyond friendly and the atmosphere is very welcoming. If beyonce and Rihanna stays here then that should tell you something.  Corinthia London you are amazing. ",5,2015,04,03
143,The best hotel in London- Pure Luxury,"The Corinthia in my opinion is the best hotel in London.  Its incredibly luxurious with an abundance of amenities, including a number of restaurants, bars, the most epic SPA you will see.  Food and drinks are of the highest quality and the service matches this also.

The entry level rooms are very large and again very luxurious.  Fantastic location to explore London!",5,2015,04,02
143,Still the  best  hotel  in  London,"We  have  stayed  here  several  times  and  we  still  love  this  place ! 
The  staff  are  so  good  (Mikaela - front of house and Neil in the main lounge particularly )and  they cannot  do  enough  for  us.
It  always  feels  like  we  are  at  home  it's  all  so  relaxed  whilst  being  professional . My  husband  loves  the  atrium  area  that  has  real  fires  and  you  can  smoke  in  a  relaxed  garden  that  could  be  anywhere  in  the  world .
The  jazz  bar, staff  and  apple  martini's are  second  to  none   - simply  sublime !",5,2015,04,01
143,Good hotel,"The Corinthia Hotel--was new for me. I have stayed in many of the other top hotels in London. The public spaces in the Corinthia are truely beautiful. The flowers jaw droppingly beautiful. The location while not residential/cosy is very convenient. You can easily access public transportation and get to west or east London. 

The breakfasts were great. Best porridge in a long time. The one consistent failing was housekeeping. One day my room never got made up until turndown even though I had a lighted make up sign turned on. Every day after the first day housekeeping forgot to leave a room service breakfast menu card and I had to ask for it--once ok, but twice not good. And one night they forgot the water and the bedtime chocolate---ok on the chocolate, I really didn't need it, but not ok on the water. And my mini-bar also didn't get refilled completely. Just too sloppy, too many mistakes.

The bedroom I was in was a little small, but the bathroom was lovely.

On the superior side, room service when ordered was always on time in the am and fast in the evening and the servers were very gracious.

Sadly, I did not get to use the spa. Given the housekeeping service I am debating whether I stay here again or go back to one of my two old standards.",4,2015,03,28
143,Spa at Corinthia,"This is the best spa I have been too in terms of facilities, luxury comfort wow factor and well being. Mauritian spas have wonderful outside spaces and benefit from warm weather which I love  but for London this is simply the best.
Heated marble beds with fires, sleep pods, steam rooms and saunas on a different level than anything else I have ever experienced. Swimming pools and areas for men and women with separate facilities - a state of the art gym of gyms! All to the best standard you can imagine !
Like something out of James Bond. 
The 17 treatment pods with heated beds are luxurious and built for relaxing and comfort. Jade and Sonia my therapists were attentive, and thoughtful to me and what I wanted from my massage and facial. Espa products of luxurious quality and smells - soothing and heavenly.
After a very busy few months and feeling somewhat burnt out- a whole afternoon and evening with a light lunch and endless fruit and water- I left at 9.30pm feeling restored and relaxed. I had four treatments -all less than an hour each.
It's expensive at £380 including lunch but no tea and coffee available unless you spend more. My only observation is that they could offer access to green tea throughout the day for the cost of the whole day visit, without charging extra.
My recommendation is to visit this spa and enjoy all it has to offer.",5,2015,03,28
143,"British Empire Luxury Meters from the Thames, Trafalgar Square and No 10","The Corinthian is located in the heart of Whitehall across the street from the Old War Office Building and No 10 Downing Street, Trafalgar Square, Thames Footbridge to Southbank Centre and Charing Cross Rail Station.  The Hotel was built within a grand limestone edifice that was constructed at the height of the Empire - and it's marble, brass and crystal interiors harken back to those times.  There are a few options for drinking and dining within the hotel - and they are frequented by Whitehall mandarins as well.  The staff is polished in their custom and go to extreme efforts to ensure a private yet memorable experience for their guests.  I now live relatively near to the hotel, but occasionally book friends and family in to it when they are visiting London for the first time.",5,2015,03,27
143,"Great Location, remodeled hotel, walking distance to attractions!","We stayed in this beautiful property for a couple of nights as it was our end to our trip to Europe. What a beautiful and modern hotel. It was recently remodel, and you can tell by walking to halls and in our room smelled like new! Marble bathroom and comfortable bed. Spacious room, turn down service and coffee machine, the hotel is very quiet no noisy from the street. The breakfast/buffet areas it was so delicious and elegant. They have a flower shop/mini Harrods’ gift shop.  The staff was very attentive and I didn’t expect less from this hotel. I loved the location, within walking distance subway, to House of Parlament , Westminster Abbey, National Gallery. So many options. I would love to visit other properties. I had to booked from a 3rd party as they had a better price than the hotel itself, they mentioned I could have gotten upgrades if I had booked with them- I know that only happens if they have availability. That’s ok, no big deal.",5,2015,03,24
143,Stylish and Sophisticated,"My wife and I stayed at the Corinthia for two nights to celebrate our 1st year wedding anniversary.  We wanted to make our stay in London special so chose the Corinthia based on the excellent feedback from our family and friends.  The hotel exceeded all my expectations.  The hotel is beautiful and oozes so much style and sophistication throughout.  The décor is modern with beautiful pieces of art dotted around the hotel.  The lobby area with its great chandelier is stunning. 

Each and every staff member made us feel welcome.  Nothing was too much for them – they were impeccable in their politeness and professionalism.  Special mention to the Concierge team – they were outstanding.  I certainly recommend using them to make all reservations whilst staying in London.  We certainly noticed that because we had made our reservations through the hotel we were given a great table at a high end restaurant and the service was impeccable.  Even the restaurant manager came to introduce himself to us as he wanted to make sure we were happy with the table and of course the food.  He even gave me his business card and told me that any future reservations, I should go direct to him and he will look after the rest – this was great.    
         
We booked a Superior King Room but on arrival were upgraded to a complimentary Deluxe Room facing the river Thames on the 6th floor – it was marvellous.  The room was spacious and very clean.  We loved the décor and artwork, the colours and ambient of the room made us feel very comfortable.  The bathroom did not disappoint either, it was spacious with a separate bath tub and a powerful rain shower.  Again the décor was a mixture of marble and polished plaster which really worked well together.  

Breakfast is a real delight, I loved the setting.  The room is beautiful with big light windows that bring the old world charm into a perfectly laid out eating area.  Breakfast itself was fresh and plenty of choice.  We didn’t get a chance to try the afternoon tea in the lobby area but heard many great things.   

We absolutely loved the spa, this was right up our street in its décor and ambience.  It’s definitely one of the best spa’s we have visited with plenty of choice and great facilities.  Loved the 360 degrees glass sauna and the glass fire feature over the Thermal Pool – both were unique and very cool.   

The Hotel is centrally located and is walking distance to most sites in central London.  For me, I cannot fault the hotel in any way - our stay was perfect.  Will we stay again, of course we will – I cannot imagine staying anywhere else.",5,2015,03,23
143,Friendly and Delicious Afternoon Tea,"We arrived a little late. The staff were extremely kind and friendly. Nothing was too much trouble. Absolutely superb afternoon tea! We were made to feel very welcome! Beautiful setting! We intended this to be a one-off visit but will definitely be going back when we are next in London! The lobby was beautiful, spacious and we could take as much time as we liked! a very enjoyable experience! ",5,2015,03,21
143,Flawless,My husband and I spent 4 nights at this lovely hotel and enjoyed it immensely. We have stayed at many luxury hotels around the world and the Corinthia truly stands out. Our room was beautiful and the service provided by the hotel staff was flawless.,5,2015,03,21

Staff great, location great, room super comfortable with queen bed, television to watch in bath and liTtle veranda. Room service tasty quick and a nice little treat to chill out in gowns and watch one of the many films on offer without leaving the room. Great bath salts and little extras. Spa is gorgeous definetly not o be missed absolutely fab! Late night bar with a pianist and singer was just perfect and champagne cocktails yummy! And the food in northall was divine- spent a small fortune but worth every penny! Cannot wait to go back-actually would like to move in on a permanent basis!",5,2015,03,19

143,Mothers Day Treat,"Went today for afternoon tea with my daughter, daughter-in-law and 9 month old granddaughter and really couldn't fault it. The food was delicious and very plentiful, I defy anyone to finish the cakes! If you can't they offer you a doggy bag to take home.

We were worried about taking such a little one but they reassured us prior to the visit that they welcomed little ones and they did. The staff were very welcoming and attentive but not obtrusive.

Would recommend it to anyone looking for a afternoon tea experience in London, pricey but par for the course in London.

PS. Little one behaved impeccably!

PPS. If you are one of the remaining sinners still out there that smoke, their smoking area is in a outdoor quadrangle adjacent to the lounge where tea is served. Comfy seats, huge parasols, a fire at each end and blankets for if you are still cold!!!",5,2015,03,17

 The room was lovely and we loved the nsiute bathroom with a built in flatscreen tv and the end of the bath which was very nice. 
The dinner was nice and a reasonable price, we both tried 2 things we had never  ate before but enjoyed all of our meal.
We did not go to the spa but next time we will defiantly go

We cannot wait to return as its so close to everything you need in London :-) ",5,2015,03,15
143,Superb!,"Everything is perfect here. Fantastic atmosphere, airy lobby, lounge, bar. Friendly, professional and easy staff, always ready to help. Great food! Very good and spacious room - lovely bathroom. I love the turndown service. It is quiet and no problem sleeping here. I kept looking for things that could be better, but came back with no result.
Don't forget to book a treatment or spend some time in the spa - it is just wonderful!
The Corinthia har a super location, close to the river Thames and great views. If you want explore London by just walking to everything it is convenient. Underground just around the corner. This hotel is so good that it will be hard to return to the ""reality"" when you need to go somewhere else. Pure bliss and luxury all over.",5,2015,03,14
143,5* perfection,"The Corinthia Hotel is just across the River Thames from the London Eye. It's very central to transport/tubes and is in walking distance to pretty much everything. The hotel and service is exactly how you would want a 5* hotel to be. I stayed with my partner on 1st Feb for a night and was upgraded on arrival which was a wonderful surprise. The rooms are modern and HUGE - the bed was huge, the bath was huge, it was just amaazing! I wouldn't think twice to stay here again, it was a stunning hotel, and a luxury night away! 100% recommended.",5,2015,03,13
143,Wonderful Hotel in the Heart of London.,"The Corinthia is in a  central position just across the River Thames from the London Eye and a short walk from Trafalgar Square.   This is within walking distance to almost anywhere, and easy access to river transportation and bus/underground, or taxi. The hotel is modern and up to date. Service is as you would expect in a 5-star hotel, i.e. brilliant.    Breakfast is superb, top quality and delicious. Afternoon tea is fantastic, lots of different teas to try.  We had it in the courtyard in front of the fireplace. Our basket of fruit  was replenished daily. If you are thinking of staying here, don't think twice.  One of Londons top hotels",5,2015,03,11
143,privilege to stay here,there is nothing to fault with this hotel. I travel a lot for work and family holidays. This time I was in London for work and was booked into this hotel. I have never stayed in a hotel where the service is consistently friendly and helpful. You are truly made feel at home with no pretensions. The flowers are spectacular and it is well worth checking out the florist situated in the hotel. I love the bathrooms with a deep bath and TVNZ at the end of the bath. Only pity was the lack of time to enjoy it properly. The beds are very comfortable and loved the touch added by a lavender sachet with the evening turn down . The hotel is steeped in history particularly as it is linked to Churchill. It is well positioned to explore Westminster and Whitehall areas. ,5,2015,03,10
143,Comfort away from home,"I stayed here for a week while on business. It was a great experience. The hotel is conveniently located within walking distance of many sites as well as Tube stops and the Jubilee Bridge to cross the river. The hotel is beautiful and my room was bright (even my closet had a window) and spacious. The fitness center in the spa is excellent with good equipment, snacks, and water provided. I did not take advantage of any spa services but it looked nice. I had breakfast as well as dinner in the restaurant and the food was delicious. 3 of the days I was in one of the meeting rooms at a business off-site. The room was bright and very comfortable with plenty of food provided. There is a flower store on site near the restaurant providing a fragrant smell. Each night something new was left on my pillow for turn-down service (either a chocolate, lavender sachet or spray). Thanks for a lovely stay!",5,2015,03,10
143,Grand Hotel in a Grand Location - Great for Runners!,"This is a luxury hotel that is well worth the money.  It is truly a ""grand hotel"" with a certain old world feel but at the same time is throughly up to date and exceptionally well appointed.  It is a relatively large hotel but has a certain intimate feel.   The service is outstanding.  What makes this hotel even more worthwhile is its location.  It is in the heart of and within walking distance of some of the best attractions London has to offer.  If you're a runner, this is great location as well.  I did my morning runs on the pathway along the banks of the Thames.  A great experience I won't soon forget.  Definitely would stay here again.",5,2015,03,09
143,poor and unprofessional service for a branded luxury hotel,"I have been told by many friends that how amazing Corinthia is. However, my own experience was very disappointing, in particular the service on housekeeping and restaurants. 

Good points : We arrived at 12am but managed to check in straight away. The reception and the concierge was very professional and personal at check-in. The room is well proportioned with a jubilee balcony facing inner courtyard. It was very quiet during my stay.  The balcony makes a huge difference and in my view it was the best superior rooms (standard room) I ever stayed. 

Bad points: 1) the comfort cooling in my room seems not working properly as the room got very hot in the night due to the underfloor heating. 2) I asked for dental kits which were never delivered to my room. I assume they forgot this as I asked for those 3 hours before I was scheduled to check out 3) the housekeeping broke my belt buckle when they did turndown service 4) check-out was very unprofessional. 5) Restaurant staff were cold and unprofessional. 6) the cocktails in the bar were in my opinion overpriced and average quality. 7) the service at their best was standard 5 star quality but fall short of being personal and special.  

The services vary in different departments. The check-in was very pleasant but  1) the housekeeping was terrible not only they forgot to provide my dental kits but they also broke my belt buckle. 2) The restaurant service were cold and unprofessional. I made a reservation but decided to leave after I found nothing fancy on the menu. When I walked out, I was told by the waitress they had to charge a bottle of still water to my room bill. The water was offered while I was looking through the menu and I did not know that it was still water and payable, so I refused to accept this charge and did not sign any bill (in fact, no bill was presented to me at any time for charging this bottle of still water). When I checked out, the 5 pound water appears in my bill. This is very unprofessional. The principle is that if the customer does not sign the bill to acknowledge any incidental charge, the hotel should not just put a charge against under room bill straight away (not to mention that this charge was very debatable). The charge was eventually removed on my request when I checked out 3) the check-out staff was unprofessional. I booked this hotel through lastminute.com promotion offer (it is about value for money after all - nothing to be ashamed of if you can get a good deal) and my booking with last mintue.com stipulate that my card was charged at the time of booking. However, it appears that the charge has not been made to the hotel from lastminute.com yet so the hotel staff kept asking me to pay for the room rate (from check in till check out). When I checked out, I explained the situation again and the reception demanded me to send my lastmintue.com booking confirmation and terms & condition to hotel reception email for record. This is very unprofessional and unacceptable. The issue of payment was the matter between the hotel and its travel agent. I have acknowledged to pay under my booking with last minute.com so it is only just a matter of when and how this will be paid to the hotel. On the basis that I have pre-authorisation circa 400 pound when I checked in, such bothering to a customer at this level was a very poor and unprofessional behavior and very bad customer service for a branded luxury hotel.  So far my pre-authorisation have not been released but the bill for my stay was settled, I do hope that if there is an payment issue between the lastminute.com and the Corinthia hotel, the hotel will have the dignity to contact me first before charging the room rate against my pre-authorisation without my consent.",1,2015,03,08
143,Weekend get away,"Just returned from a 1 night stay, absolutely loved this hotel. Fantastic welcome at reception, wonderful location. Our room was available when we arrived at 11am due to their 'relaxed' check in-check out policy. Tell them roughly when you're arriving and roughly when you're planning to leave and they'll endeavour to accommodate you. 
Our room was lovely, overlooked a well tended courtyard, immaculate communal areas, very friendly and helpful staff. We will definitely come back for a longer stay. 
Do I have one slight gripe? Yes, allow interchanging of buffet breakfast and a la carte breakfast, in this quality of hotel, with the cost of rooms and breakfast, I should be able to have buffet breakfast and eggs to order without having to pay extra!",5,2015,03,08
143,An Opulent Hotel Well Worth the Money,"A one-time grand hotel turned thoroughly modern luxury stay, the Corinthia Hotel London lives up to its unbeatable central location steps from the banks of the Thames. It has  world-class dining, an exceptional four-story Espa Life spa and views any sightseer would kill for.

The long opening hours are very helpful for people with busy schedules. In addition to the usual massages and facials guests can work with trainers, nutritionists and healthcare experts… as well as get their hair taken care of in A-list favorite Daniel Galvin’s salon.

This is the hotel I will be stay at from now on when I am in London. After the splendor and the opulence hits you, the next thing that you will surely notice is the friendly and professional attitude that all of the staff members display here. From the concierge answering all of my questions efficiently, to the rest of the staff I encountered, I found them all great.",5,2015,03,06
143,QE II could move here from Buckingham Palace and be happy,"Absolutely one of the very finest hotels in the world.  Modern and yet classic; with large bathrooms that are unequaled.  They exquisitely rehabbed a vintage London building, creating a beautiful new interior from the studs out.  Impeccable staff exudes pride in being with the Corinthia.   Gold standard.",5,2015,03,06
143,Where to start?,"From the warm welcome at reception, to the fabulous lobby, to the beautifully appointed bedroom, The Corinthia exceeded every expectation that I had of it. This hotel is simply one of the best that I have ever stayed in! Lunch at Massimo was also another highlight of me visit. Having never been in here I cannot wait to get myself back. Thank you all for an unforgettable stay......",5,2015,03,05
143,Surpassing excellence at every turn,"It stands so defiantly on the corner of embankment, surrounded by institutions such as Scotland Yard, Whitehall and opposite the ever crumbling Playhouse Theatre- the Corinthia Hotel is itself nothing short of an institution in it's own right.

I have stayed for a week and returned for a weekend, both times offered painful goodbye's to a place where the rest of world can be left behind.

Shown up to an Executive King room which was like many lesser hotel suites, expansive, impeccably furnished, every detail thought through. A walk in wardrobe, luxuriant bathroom, bed to get lost in. It's all there.

This is a place that oozes class and quality- from the valet's to the concierge to the food. I felt a bit like being offered a big expensive hug from which it was hard to extract myself.

A few minor reservations, there is a big deal made of the Spa, it is set over 4 floors and many of the room are jet black. I struggled to find the gentleman's changing area, and then struggled to find my way out. After about 20 minutes of getting lost in sauna's, sleep pods, tepidariums and ante rooms i found myself in a the main thermal spa area. It is very nice, but slightly out of synch with the rest of the hotel. It's black, sexy, black and actually quite black. Don't get me wrong it is not unpleasant, I ended up managing to relax in the lovely water treatment pool- but it took at least an hour to acclimatise. It was good- just not great like everywhere else in the hotel.

The restaurant, The Northall, is magnificent- with high ceilings and cool neutral colours which contrasts delicately with the warm, cosy Basoon bar which served us impeccable cocktails by delightful staff.

This is one of the few hotels which matches up to the highest of expectations. It is a bit like a palace and it offered me a unforgettable experience.

I loved it so much, I'm going back this weekend.

HIghly recommended.",5,2015,03,04
143,Outstanding service,"Outstanding customer service, made for the ideal experience when traveling abroad. The restaurants located on the premises were great. The amenities were top notch, the heated bathroom floors were a pleasant surprise. The location made walking to many attractions quite easy.",5,2015,03,04
143,Very nice hotel by all measures,"Stayed at the Corinthia in London this last week. The entrance is very nice and reception was well managed and efficient. The staff was extremely helpful which can be a bit unusual. The room, an executive king, was nicely furnished and very clean. The overall room was very comfortable and the bathroom was large and everything worked!!
It will be a place I frequent when in London ",5,2015,03,03
143,Wonderful place to stay,"I've stayed at many five star London hotels and the Corinthia was among the best.  It will not disappoint you. The service was outstanding, the rooms were spacious and hotel amenities were great, including two fantastic restaurants, world class spa and outstanding gym. The hotel staff could not have been more accommodating starting with guest reservations who was a pleasure to speak to.  Definitely a must try for your next trip to London whether for business or leisure.",5,2015,03,01
143,Dim sum and pancakes at breakfast? I'm sold.,"A two-days business trip to London, and I found the Corinthia is now a preferred hotel of my corporation, so I decided to give it a try. It was a good choice.
Big, nicely furnished rooms, luxury all around, nice bathrooms, attentive service and beautiful breakfast buffet. Can't wait to come back.",5,2015,03,01
143,Best Hotel outside Asia I stayed at,"Very impressed with my stay this week, everything perfect. Great rain shower, heated bathroom tiles, in-room Nespresso, very comfortable bed, turn-down service leaves dried lavendel leaves on your bed to help relaxing after a long and busy day.Free Wifi, high quality.
..all the way to a bath with a tvscreen including a waterproof remote control. The Cedarwood/Bergamot showergel is also very nice",5,2015,02,27
143,Quality and little touches which impress,"It is absolutely what you expect of a 5* London Hotel but there are those little touches which don't fail to impress; The receptionist, who checked us in, personally showed us to our rooms, the kids had complimentary goody bags and soft toys waiting on the beds for our arrival.
It was a special family occasion, we had high expectations and the Corinthia certainly did not let us down.",5,2015,02,24
143,Disappointed,"I am a regular visitor to Corinthia and have always received excellent service and thoroughly enjoyed my experience there. However today myself and four friends visited The Corinthia for coffee. For my four friends it was their first experience of The Corinthia and they were looking forward to it based on my enthusiasm and past experience. We arrived at 10ish and sat down in the lounge area and waited quite a while for service. Finally a waitress came over but her customer interpersonal skills were very lacking, she asked what we wanted and that was it. We all ordered a hot chocolate (which I have had on numerous occasions and so my expectation was set). When the hot chocolates arrived we each received a cup and a teapot of hot chocolate but for five of us, we were only given a single serving of marshmallows, cream, white and dark chocolate sprinkles when we should have received one per person. I was most disappointed but at the time didn't want to complain or make a fuss. When the bill came we were all charged varying amounts from £6;50 to £5. As a waitress in a 5* hotel and a regular visitor to The Corinthia, I know today we definitely didn't receive 5* service or an experience associated with a 5* hotel. My friends and I left feeling very disappointed.  ",2,2015,02,24
143,Amazing!,"Just returned from a fabulous weekend break at the Corinthia and I already can't wait to go back again! The hotel is in a perfect location, just a few minutes from Trafalgar Square and not far from other popular tourist destinations. Embankment underground station is only 250 yards away. We stayed in a Standard room (superior king) which was fantastic! Spacious, modern and spotless. The bathroom was outstanding loved everything about it even the luxury ESPA toiletries! Breakfast was delicious, a little bit pricey but worth it! 

The staff were attentive, courteous and couldn't be more helpful. 

If you are undecided about booking this hotel just do it! you will not be disappointed! it is absolutely perfect!",5,2015,02,24
143,Wonderful Surprise ,"Location is excellent in west end. Couple of minutes walk from Trafalgar Square and few more to Leicester Square. The Hotel has a couple of good restaurants. I specifically enjoyed the Italian one. AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS!!
The room was quite spacious and nice modern decor. Very good size bathrooms. Very friendly staff. I also recommend not to miss out on the spa experience.  ",5,2015,02,23
143,Amazing,"Stayed here recently for 1 night. What a fantastic hotel in a fantastic setting. The staff were courteous, attentive and extremely helpful. The room was lovely - a really good size for London and spotlessly clean. Breakfast was excellent. I will definitely visit again",5,2015,02,22
143,Amazing,"This hotel is a must if you are planning a trip to London, the attention to detail, staff, rooms and breakfast are all just perfect. I cannot express enough how good this hotel is made me and my children's trip to London so special thank you.",5,2015,02,22
143,Fantastic Hotel well worth the visit,"I came up to London for the weekend with my wife and we took in a West End show. I stumbled on this hotel through a friend, what a find. I could go on and on but this really is a professionally run hotel with great rooms, great service and above all the spa is just amazing.",5,2015,02,21
143,Perfectly located,"My wife and I stayed here for our anniversary week while we Galavanted around England and France for a couple of weeks.  This is situated right near the Tube and walking distance to piccadilly.  Want to catch a show at the West End?  Walk there from this Hotel.  Perfectly situated by the river for convenient boat travel as well.  We could not have asked for a better location.  

When we arrived, our room had rose petals and chocolate waiting since I had told them ahead of time it was our anniversary.  The concierge here is also quite helpful.  We are just sorry we did not discover the Spa services until our second visit.  Had we know the Spa was so good, we would have gone there the first time.  Next time we are in London, we have a new favorite place to stay.",5,2015,02,21
143,Luxurious hotel with great customer service,Me and my friend came to this hotel and we very really overwhelmed how is hotel luxurious. We would like to really thanks to Zita - Guest relations. She was very helpfull and was so nice to showed us around. We really experienced hotel and found out very nice staff and great customer service. Thank you.,4,2015,02,18
143,"First class, almost perfect !!!","Just returned from a 2 night break in London.The Corinthia hotel is decorated so beautifully , attention to detail in very room you enter,it is first class.. Arrived at 11 am and our room was not ready, so left the bags and went for a walk; returned around 2pm and the receptionist said we have been upgraded to a executive room and our bags have already been taken to the room . So we were given room 230 which was a surprise, I mean we could not believe this was a hotel room , entering a large hall , a dressing room area on the right side ,,, from the hallway straight to the beautiful room that I cant describe in words how '' grand '' and tastefully decorated... the bathroom was just beautiful ,biggest bath tub ever ,with tv ,a large shower and separate toilet and bidet. The toiletries provided were a good quality and replenished as needed ( also bathrobes,slippers and all extras needed were available). We had breakfast included ( buffet or a la cart ) we went for  the buffet  which was lovely , quality food as you would expect but I feel like lacking choice , only available scrambled eggs ( no fried or boiled eggs ) no beans available to have a proper cooked breakfast ....I feel like for the price paid, everything should be available and we should not have to pay for extras ,which was the case ....  (we had always stayed in a 4 star hotel and the choice of food is so much better ). If the choice of food  was improved this hotel could be faultless. More assortments of cold and hot food to be available at this standard !!!!

We used the pool/sauna/steam room and again all was so nice and relaxed , enjoyed every minute.
Perfect location for London eye , House of P...  underground is a 5 minute walk 
I would recommend this hotel if you want an unforgettable experience ,  it really is special .We had a great time and will be hunting for a good offer to return .",5,2015,02,18
143,"Excellent Location, SPA overrated","2 mins. walking from Embankment Tube Station, its location it is one of the best asset. Clean, staff is reasonably polite, I was expecting more from a five stars, doormen was the best person, really looked after us with simple gestures and concrete support. SPA area is presented to be the best in Europe, well it ain't. It is not bad, but it isn't bombastic. Room we were in, ( suite) was spacious and full of amenities. Would definitely go back, Prices should be lowered a bit",4,2015,02,16
143,Stunning,"This is a beautiful property, very plush and comfortable. We enjoyed our short break in a standard room, which was fairly spacious for London, with super linens, bed and comfort. Helpful staff, nice and quiet, and a good location. Breakfast was good, but afternoon tea was outstanding. We have on other occasions had lunch in their lovely dining room, which was also very good. Spa great too.",5,2015,02,14
143,Wonderful hotel,"I stayed here as a delegate from a conference. Have stayed here before and I think it really is one of the best hotels in London.

The location is fantastic - 3 minutes from Downing Street, almost opposite the London Eye, 3 minutes from Trafalgar Square and seconds from Embankment tube station / Charing Cross mainline yet incredibly quiet I can't knock it at all.

I stayed in a corner room (441 I think) and the room was large; the bathroom huge and there was also a separate room with closets for clothes.

Very well presented; with various magazines and photo books as well added a lovely relaxing touch to the place. There was also a capsule coffee machine.

The room was very warm, but with an electronic thermostat it was easy to rectify.

Free wifi throughout he hotel.

The lobby was really bright and casual.

The shower in the bathroom was large, the toiletries a good brand and there were plenty of towels / dressing gowns to use.

The hotel also has a spa (I didn't use it) and the food quality and service is excellent.

The bed is big and comfortable. I slept incredibly well!

Have been before; would HAPPILY go again. Try it for yourself.

Couldn't comment on the room price - I couldn't imagine it is cheap at all. But, it is luxury.",5,2015,02,14
143,Breakfast at the Northall Resataurant - a real treat in every way!,"Our breakfast here was part of a birthday treat for my daughter.  I chose the Northall as it specialises in Fresh Seasonal British produce.  A real treat for us both, it was close to Christmas so on entering the hotel the lobby was beautifully decorated.

The restaurant is very elegant and breathtaking with plush burnt orange leather complimented by glittering mirrored panels, large picture windows allowing lots of natural light, a large island bar with wonderful chandaliers.

We ate of the a la carte menu, there is also a buffet menu.  I chose Loch Var Smoked Salmon with Organic Scrambled Eggs on a Toasted Brioche £16 and my daughter had Toasted English Muffin with Middle Dry Cure Bacon and Poached Organic Egg £15, worth every penny.

The staff were very attentive, professional and friendly, we weren't rushed, we ate around 10.30 so I guess we had missed the early rush.  It is a very calm and relaxing environment.

Wonderful!",5,2015,02,14
143,Spectacular hotel in the heart of London,"A beautiful hotel which is very modern, but with thoughtful touches throughout which made it warm and welcoming. Very new and beautiful rooms- ours had a spectacular walk in closet/dresssing room. The accessories were very modern- lighting, shades and climate controlled from centralized buttons and the room was beautifully furnished. The lobby/bar was very trendy and lively and we were able to walk to many nearby restaurants and nightspots. Staff was very attentive also. Great hotel experience!",5,2015,02,12
143,Corinthia again,"A belated review:

I was curious to try the Corinthia when it first opened a couple of years ago. I loved the beautiful lobby and high ceiling of the elegant restaurant. Charming and helpful staff. Quiet location near the water and very easy getting around for sightseeing. I prefer walking and staying above ground but there's a train station across the street if you choose.

Now that I'm bringing my teen along, we might as well stay here and make sure to check out the spa everyone's raving about.",5,2015,02,12
143,My favourite place to stay!,"Love it here! I have been multiple times and I cannot fault it. Don't rush breakfast, visit the spa, go to the Bassoon bar and use the toiletries - fantastic! There is nowhere in the world where i would prefer to rest my head!",5,2015,02,12
143,Understated luxury  ,Stunning property and service to match. From the moment you're greeted at the door by the sharply tailored doormen to the smooth check in you know this is going to be something special. Wonderful breakfast (don't rush breakfast!) and a OMG spa (can't believe people stay and don't visit it! Sure it's expensive but if you can it's an amazing treat. Didn't do it but afternoon tea is amazing and the have an incredible pre theatre dinner offer too. Will def be back!,5,2015,02,11
143,You will not be disappointed,"This was our second visit in the last couple of years.

Ask yourself:

1. Do you want to stay and sleep in the best hotel in London? (IMHO of course)

2. Do you want to stay in a hotel that is 100m, or so, from the London high life but has one of the most tranquil and quiet road side entrances you could ever wish for?

3. Do you wish to enter your room, wander around your room, shower in your room, sleep in your room and wake up in your room with a 'wow'?

If so, then stay at the Corinthia. It is as easy as that.",5,2015,02,10
143,Luxury Personified!,"This is the best hotel I have stayed in the world, service was outstanding, nothing was too much and the room was palatial. The location is perfect for traveling around London and all the sights are really close by. ",5,2015,02,10
143,Fabulous,"What a great hotel this is, the staff are amazing- constantly looking out to see how they can exceed your expectations from the moment that you arrive to the moment that they wave you off of the premises. The quality of the fixtures and fittings throughout the hotel is very high indeed, bedrooms are lovely and the attention to detail is second to none- what more is there to say? 
two tips that I have are as follows:
1) When using the spa- which is absolutely fabulous- change in your room putting on the dressing gown and slippers that are available to you. Then use the spa only elevator that stops on all bedroom floors- you get off right in the spa reception and can shower and everything before returning to your room- much better than getting changed at the spa and saves lots of time before getting ready for dinner.
2) Do take afternoon tea in the lobby lounge- however it is a bit of a throughfare as there are main entrances on both sides of the hotel with reception on one side- arriving guests therefore haul cases past diners whilst trying to locate reception - make sure you request a table to the side of the lounge so that you dont have people bumping past you.

You'll have a fabulous stay here- one of the greats- enjoy",5,2015,02,09
143,Amazing hotel,"I have to say, this is by far my most favorite hotel in London. The service is excellent, the rooms are a very generous size with big bathrooms and walk in wardrobes. The restaurants also offer a very good menu at a reasonable price.",5,2015,02,07
143,Stunning Choice,"A really great location, outstanding services and decor and restauarants and spa, plus you can walk to covent garden and picadilly in minutes. Its luxurious, but it works- outstanding service. Lots of celebrity sightings in the foyer as well. :)",5,2015,02,06
143,Awesome Stay,"Wow, just returned from two nights at Corinthia, it is a truly stunning hotel. The staff is friendly, attentive and nothing is too much. The location is great for travelling round London. There is not one thing about this hotel that could be improved and I will certainly be staying here again.",5,2015,02,06
143,Always exceeds expectations!!!,"My family and I stayed at the Corinthia for eight days at the end of December/beginning of January.  This was our fourth stay at this superb establishment over the last two years.  If anything, the service seems to keep getting better and better.  How do they keep surpassing our expectations?  Our belief is that it is all about the people---they truly seem happy to be part of the Corinthia experience--from the front desk, the concierge team, the lounge staff, etc, the entire Corinthia team goes out of their way with each and every interaction with the guests, you can't help appreciate all they do.  The rooms (we had two rooms) are so comfortable it is difficult to leave even though you want to be out and about seeing all of London.  The lobby lounge is the place to visit each and every day, whether for morning coffee, afternoon tea, or a pre/post dinner drink!!.  The restaurants are not to be missed.  We again did the New Year's Eve dinner and party at the Northall.  I cannot think of a better place to enjoy great food and service and then simply walk outside at midnight to get a perfect spot for watching the fireworks over the Thames.  Special thank you to Max at the concierge desk----he is fantastic.  We have already booked a return visit to the Corinthia for this coming March.  There are a lot of fine establishments in London, but you must pick the Corinthia if you want the perfect stay!!!",5,2015,02,05
143,Best hotel in London for seeing the sites,"This hotel quickly became our favorite hotel in London. From the time the doorman greeted us to help us from our cab we were provided excellent service.

The rooms are magnificently attired. From the heated bathroom floors and towel racks to the extremely comfortable bed, all was exactly as I would expect from such a wonderful hotel. The rooms are laid out well, kept clean, very comfortable and all around a joy to be in. The amenities in the bathroom were some of the best smelling at any hotel we have stayed in (and we stay in a lot). I truly enjoyed the bath salts, after a long day of walking around the city this was the perfect way to end the day.

Breakfast was very good as was the service. Fresh fruit, yogurt, and the traditional english breakfast items were delicious every morning (and if you don't want to go down to breakfast they will deliver to your room with no hassle). 

The evening turn down service was very nice, and each night something different was done (lavender spray for pillows, a lavender sachet, chocolate left). They also left a small bottle of water each evening which was very much appreciated.

The concierge provided excellent suggestions and very easy to follow directions. He was extremely helpful in our planning our daily activities. 

While staying here we also had afternoon tea. This was great fun and the staff provided excellent service and recommendations.",5,2015,02,05
143,Superb pre theatre ,"The best value £30 pre theatre menu in town. Gorgeous food, glass of top champagne and superb service. The salted caramel tart was the highlight. Our waiter was very aware if time limits with theatre time and even helped with directions. Recommended to all!",5,2015,02,05
143,Oh Wow!!,"I arrived at the hotel at just after midnight after my flight had been delayed by about 16hrs, so I was exhausted. The reception is so welcoming and the staff was very friendly and helpful. My room was just a pure delight- beautifully furnished, very spacious and comfortable. I loved the underfloor heating in the bathroom, that was a real treat as was the shower. Breakfast was very good and I loved walking through the flower shop to get to the restaurant! I unfortunately didn't have a lot of time to spend in the hotel  as I had a full day of meetings but it was so wonderful to return in the evening to find the fire lit in the reception area. Great central location made it easy to get to all my meetings, which is great for a business traveller. I would definitely love to come back for a longer stay in order to take advantage of all the amenities on offer.",5,2015,02,05
143,"Excellent hotel, fair price","Our stay in late November 2014 was one of our best hotel experiences ever. The hotel is grand in design and very conveniently located. The room was very comfortable and spacious with a great bathroom with a big tub and separate shower. The gym is huge with all the high- and low-tech stuff. The breakfast (included, using AmEx Fine Hotels program) was extensive, varied and delicious. The service stood out, with every employee we encountered friendly and accommodating.
The hotel is not cheap, but our rate was very reasonable for one of the top London hotels, a group to which the Corinthia definitely belongs! We will return.",5,2015,02,03
143,Worth every penny and more!!,"After previously speaking to a member of staff shortly after booking a room in this hotel we were made aware our room may not be ready upon arrival (as we were due to arrive at around 9am) but that we could leave our bags and come back early afternoon. Not a problem for us as we had a lot of sight seeing to do anyway!! However, our room was ready, excellent view of the courtyard, peaceful and immaculate!! Staff were out of this world - so helpful, polite and very genuine, really would do anything they could for you. My partner and myself stayed here for 3 nights and everything was perfect, you must visit the spa if you are staying here, its superb! I can't begin to explain how amazing everything is here - you'll juts have to book a room and see for yourself. Will absolutely be back, hopefully in the next coming months!",5,2015,02,03
143,"Outstanding, superb experience","Terrific hotel, from the reservation experience through the reception, the guide to the room and hotel, superb room and attention, great food. The spa is unusual, and worthy of its reputation. Location is ideal, and the architecture and design within the building outstanding. Best of all is the quality of service from well-trained, enthusiastic and genuinely pleasant staff. Will certainly revisit.",5,2015,02,01
143,Five of the best,"We stayed at the Corinthia for the weekend with my wife and I.
What a location absolutely fantastic as we then went on to see the Phantom of the opera.
The hotel is perfectly located for the very best of the West End.
An outstanding hotel and it really is five stars.
I cannot wait to go back again.",5,2015,02,01
143,All round great hotel,"My husband and I live in London but often stay a weekend at The Corinthia.  The spa is lovely .... Best when you manage to be in the jacuzzis and sauna alone though .... So relaxing!  We always have afternoon tea also.  
The staff is what makes the hotel.  We had to complain last time we visited due to one rude wait staff member.  This time all staff were excellent and back to the usual Corinthia standard.  Monica who checked us in and also said goodbye when we left really stood out.",5,2015,02,01
143,A wonderful hotel,"We booked to stay here as there were some good packages available. Ours included free cocktails , breakfast and use of the Thermal floor in Espa. Wow! The hotel is beautiful. Our room was the standard superior but there was nothing standard about it, huge bathroom with separate shower and bath , double sink and a television . All  toiletries were supplied and extras such as vanity kit and nail file. The bedroom itself was a good size with Nespresso machine for tea and coffee. Large television and ample seating and work space. Best of all was the walk- in  wardrobe which we really weren't expecting. The cost of the package was fair for our location in London, just by the Thames and within walking distance of Trafalger Square, Leicester Square and Covent Garden. The tube is just a five minute walk away.  The cost of breakfast is high but if you get it included you can't go wrong. A huge choice and very attentive staff. Everything about the hotel is easy from checking in to finding your way around and everyone is very helpful. The thermal floor is wonderfully relaxing as long as you miss the Childrens allocated time! All in all a fantastic hotel which I would not hesitate to recommend to friends .",5,2015,02,01
143,1st class in every regard,"We visit London regularly and started to go to the Corinthia - we only stay here now. Great location. 
From the moment you arrive the staff make you feel so welcome. The rooms are beautiful. The service from everyone is first class. Personable friendly and very attentive.  
Great jazz bar, food and facilities. 
If you want a great experience and value outstanding service then look no further. 
Our number one every time. ",5,2015,01,31
143,I feel a little guilty about only rating this as very good,"This is a truly exceptional hotel which is probably one of the nicest i've stayed in.  I rated the Connaught better.  The only thing which made me downgrade my rating was the breakfast.  The table was cramped and it wasn't easy to get in and out of my seat.  The choice was amazing but £35 for a buffet breakfast for one is a little excessive!  Additionally, if I'm being really picky, you can't get the scrambled egg out of the dish as the lid shuts on itself!  The sausage was hot but everything else was nearly warm.  Great choice of cold meats, cheeses and fruit.
Stayed in Room 203 which was superb.  Very spacious.  Strange that the coffee machine needed filling with water and that the reservoir doesn't fit under the sink tap in the bathroom.  Bed was exceptionally comfortable.  Talking about the bathroom, - amazing!  Dual sinks, separate amazing shower.  TV above the bath etc etc.  

It's a shame really; hot breakfast and a couple of other issues and I would have placed this as my No. 1 hotel in London",4,2015,01,29
143,Lovely,"This was our third stay in the Corinthia and it is honestly one of my favourite hotels and definitely my favourite in London.

On this occasion we were only in London for one night as we were hosting a party to celebrate our daughter's 18th birthday.  Although the party was not held in the hotel there was a card and cake waiting for our daughter in her room on arrival which was a nice touch.  

We enjoyed a delicious lunch in the Northall Restaurant on the Saturday and an excellent breakfast on Sunday morning.  Service at both meals was cheerful and helpful which seems to be a hallmark of the Corinthia.  The Spa was as always sheer luxury and the staff at Daniel Galvin were wonderful.

The only reason I consistently give this hotel four stars instead of five is that despite all the positives it always seems to just miss the standard you should expect on all levels in a hotel of this category.  On this occasion I ordered tea and biscuits through room service at around 5pm.  About 50 minutes later I rang to check on my order and was told it should have already been delivered.  It hadn't and so I cancelled the order.  Really a minor detail but I am picky and things like this are memorable.  Nonetheless I look forward to our next visit!",4,2015,01,27
143,A once in a lifetime experience!,"There are few things in life that make one feel really happy and content 😊 Staying at the Corinthian, was... magical! Emily on reception made us feel so welcomed and special! She went out of her way to explain all that was included in our stay and show us where everything was. 
Walking into our room was like walking into a fairytale! Thank you Iwona for making us feel so comfortable! The room was perfect and everything I've ever dreamt of having in a hotel room, was there...! And thank you Ramit for your kindness and that amazingly warm smile of yours! It does make a difference! 
And the boys on concierge? Simply brilliant! 
If you are looking for the PERFECT hotel in London, this is the one :-)",5,2015,01,27
143,Jazz Brunch 25/1/15 Vickery x 3,"We used to love the piano playing 'Georgian' restaurant in Harrods until the renovation and as a result, decided to give the Jazz Brunch a try. I am so glad we did, the food choice was brilliant, I had dressed crab and lobster and it was sublime. The free flowing Laurent Perrier was exactly that, and my glass was never empty. The service was fantastic, unobtrusive and very friendly. I wish I had taken our waiter's name in order to praise his service because we will definitely be returning due to the whole experience exceeding our expectations. The live jazz was sung from a raised level and created the perfect atmosphere in which conversations could be heard and the ambiance was perfect. I cannot wait to return as there are a number of dishes I need to try. ",5,2015,01,26
143,Experience: Lavish London,"The pluses of the hotel lie not only in its superb location but in its staff, interiors, excellent breakfast and amazing cocktail bar. The attention to detail is remarkable and certainly to be praised. The children loved it too and were reluctant to leave! Make it a point to try the granola at breakfast and the omlettes and in the evening make sure you go for a cocktail at the Bassoon Piano Bar - or two!",5,2015,01,26
143,Vastly Overpriced,"Cannot fault the hotel and the room. Everything as expected from a five star hotel. Spa was average and very gloomy in comparison to others (Marriot for example). Had the rib eye for our evening meal and scallops for starters. Have had more and better for less elsewhere (yes, in London). £22 for a rum cocktail of which 99% of the glass was filled with a single lump of ice. Congratulations for managing to fit it in.The buffet breakfast was scandalously overpriced. At those prices I want it it table served and to be spoon fed. Definitely a hotel for those with too much money and no sense. Suppose I have to give it five stars but I won't be back.",5,2015,01,26
143,Afternoon tea,"A friend and I treated ourselves to afternoon tea at The Corinthia Hotel and what a treat it was. The lounge was very inviting, tastefully decorated with comfortable sofas and chairs creating a very relaxing environment . The tea was served by an extremely efficient attentive waitress where she explained the different types of sandwiches, cakes and tea on offer. My friend and I thoroughly enjoyed the afternoon.",5,2015,01,25
143,Pricey but ....,"London and luxury. In combination they have their price... but
The location is fantastic, the service top notch, the design contemporary with attention to detail, the rooms are spacious, lush and have a very nice atmosphere. The spa is worth seeing and the breakfast worth having. I have spent one night here - could do would a couple more. Very worth it!",5,2015,01,23
143,A Very Happy New Year,"Quite simply..... The best...... From the moment we arrived, we felt spoilt.  A lovely Champagne lunch in the Lobby, a fabulous afternoon in the world class Spa, one of the best blow drys I have ever had, an amazing NYE supper and the London fireworks on the doorstep.

I love this hotel.  I wish I lived here!!! ",5,2015,01,22
143,Pleasant surroundings and good service. Pricey though.,"Popped in for coffee, toast and a diet coke - £18 including service. A bit pricey, but not unexpected given style and location of hotel. Would use it again, but only if I had too! There's just not much choice in that immediate area.",3,2015,01,22
143,the best hotel in london,"my wife and I returned to the Corinthia for our 5th wedding anniversary, and again were amazed by the beauty of this place.
We had dinner bed and breakfast there, and full use of the spa.....which is out of this world. the bedroom was sheer class. The food as usual was gorgeous.
The thing that makes the Corinthia in a class of it's own is the friendly staff, and all the little touches of magic...like the lavender parcels on the bedsheets..It,s like another world , and we will be back...Kerry and Chris Head xx",5,2015,01,19
143,Amazing hotel experience!,During our stay in Corinthia we've had one of the best hotel experience so far. Everyone  was tentative and polite. Breakfast was perfect and tea experience at the lobby was amusing. Bassoun  has the best coctails in town. Definetely we will revisite this hotel!!!!,5,2015,01,19
143,What a treat,"Corinthia was outstanding. The quality of the rooms and facilities were very good. It was the little touches that made the difference - an email before our stay asking for the age of my daughter so they could put a treat in the room for her, no rush to check-out, taking an interest in our visit, etc.  simply fantastic service.
For anyone visiting with a child, you might want to note that children are welcome in Espa at certain times only.  Once you have visited, you will understand why.  It's such a relaxing and revitalising space.",5,2015,01,18
143,Loved this hotel,"We spent our anniversary SPA week-end at Corinthia. Diner experience was excellent and the piano tunes definitely give it a more special ambience. Food was fairly priced and tasty. Cocktails need improvement. The rooms are pristine and luxurious. Everything is thought to detail: anything you can think of is there. The concierge and front desk have been very professional and exceeded expectations  by far. 

The only not positive comment I have is the SPA. I found that the beauty therapists are not listening to what you need, but rather provide you a standard service of their choice. I have booked a deep cleansing facial treatment (and discussed with the therapist my areas of concern prior to commencing) and instead received 3 minutes of face steaming and 1 hour of massaging my face and neck. When I pointed it out to the therapist, she said that this is how they do it. Anyone will tell you that a deep pore cleansing facial will include, steaming, exfoliation and extraction of impurities. That being the whole purpose and main focus of a DEEP CLEASING. I have explained her that I dislike neck massages and that I am not happy that instead of cleansing my pores, I am getting oil all over my hair. She seemed not to care about my comments and continuing doing what she thought was best for me. I have found it very distressing. Did I mention that she kept pushing sales of the products she was using?  
I have also had manicure and pedicure in my room and with Alicia  and the treatment was amazing the best nail and foot treatment I ever had. She was very professional asked all the right question, assessed expectation and exceeded them. She is also a great communicator and makes the time fly. 

Overall we had an excellent experience and would definitely come again. Thank you.",5,2015,01,16
143,Just Stunning !!,I came upon this hotel by chance after a stay at The Royal Horse Guards Hotel which is across the road from it.I wanted to have an afternoon tea but there was no availability at our hotel so I searched about & came across the Corinthia Hotel.The hotel is a hidden gem and the afternoon tea was outstanding.The hotel was very helpful in sorting me out with a gluten free option at very short notice.The food was in abundance and it was all delightful.We were not rushed at all & our waiter was a star as the food & tea didn't stop until we had no more room to eat another bite.The hotel had a lovely atmosphere & the chandelier is stunning.A top end hotel with lovely facilities.Not the cheapest but worth paying for a special treat.,5,2015,01,15
143,Another Excellent Stay,"This was our second stay at the Corinthia.  We had stayed for just a night back in September and loved the hotel so decided to go back during our Christmas trip.  All in all, we are very happy we did and we would definitely stay here again.

First, let me say that our stay was not without a hitch, partly due to me being picky and partly due to hotel operational problems.  But ultimately, Anna at the front desk bent over backwards and completely redeemed the hotel.  I will elaborate a bit.

My main point is that you need to be realistic about what you want and book that.  We wanted a larger room this time and I booked a Deluxe King.  I didn't love the one they gave us (the layout was bad and it was right over the street.  We were then offered other options.  Unfortunately, they were all quite small (I honestly do not believe they were the same room category).  But we chose the best offered.  If it was a Deluxe King it was quite small so keep that in mind.  Again, because I am picky, I just didn't love it so again we asked about a room change.  Long and short of it is that we were then able to upgrade to the Whitehall Suite (at additional charge, which was fine).  We loved loved loved this room.  Unfortunately, the heating did not work, so after their attempts to repair it, the hotel moved us, again, to the Trafalgar Suite.  Yes that is 4 rooms!!

All of the rooms are very state of the art with a panel where you can charge just about anything, including a direct USB plug which was super helpful.

This hotel has, hands down, the best showers that I have had in Europe.  I wish I had this water pressure at home!!

The Trafalgar Suite was beautiful but more traditional and less our style than the Whitehall.  I found the close configuration in the Trafalgar to be odd and kind of in the way.  This suite does have a view of Trafalgar Square though it was a bit obstructed.

The Whitehall Suite is much more modern (and bigger).  We loved the layout and wished we could have stayed but didn't want to risk the hypothermia.

Again, lots of shuffling for various reasons, but ultimately we appreciated the hotel's efforts to make us happy.

We love the main area where they serve tea and drinks.  It is just so pretty.  And the Christmas décor was awesome. 

We also very much enjoyed the breakfast.  Nothing out of the ordinary but was quite good.

We tried the spa and it just wasn't our favorite.  It is very modern, techie.  A little too futuristic for us (I don't even know how to describe it).  It wasn't cozy and comfortable like I would have liked.  It is also huge which only adds to the weird feel.

We also tried the Italian restaurant and it was fine but not great (maybe we are a little jaded given that our last trip was to a cooking program in Italy).

Aside from the hotel's interior, the location is awesome.  You can walk just about everywhere.

All in all, another great stay.  We will definitely be back and this time I will make sure to book at least a Junior Suite now that I know my preferences.",5,2015,01,15
143,Nice hotel but they need to get everything right first time.,"This hotel is lovely, although in my humble opinion, it is a little overpriced. The main lobby, bar area and Spa were the highlights of our 3 day stay. The location of the hotel is fantastic, with the river, Trafalgar Square, Pall Mall and Downing Street on your doorstep. There are plenty of restaurants nearby and Embankment tube is seconds away. 

The bar staff and the doormen were fantastic. We had breakfast included which was a choice of continental buffet and menu service. On two separate days we had to send food back as it was cold. Once it arrived for a second time, it was hot and tasty. We also had dinner in the lobby which was served by a rather rude waitress who got our drinks order and food order wrong, twice.

The room was nice but worn, the carpet was really filthy and tatty (possibly the worst I've seen anywhere) and a few things such as the under-floor heating was not working. They did rectify these problems once they had been told for a second time. The in-room tea's and coffee were not replaced and we had to call for replacements, in no way a big deal but at over £400 a night, I expected more attention to detail.

We did complain about some of the negatives and the management responded appropriately.
I liked this hotel and would stay again but it would have to be at a more competitive rate or in a room which was superior to the one provided on my previous stay.",4,2015,01,13
143,Afternoon tea !!,"Such a lovely hotel in the heart of London, if your looking for posh this is the hotel for you lovely ambiance classy surroundings and interior, lovely food and drink very expensive but worth it for the atmosphere and a treat.",5,2015,01,13
143,lovely hotel!,"stayed here for over a month and i love this place!!
everything from the service food rooms etc is excellent. staff are very nice as well! spa is good too! the protein balls in the gym.. you got to try them!!
my choice of place to stay in london!",5,2015,01,12
143,Magnificent hotel,"Stayed 3 nights and found hotel to be as close to perfection as possible.  Lobby, restaurants & bar were gorgeously decorated.  Staff was consistently attentive & helpful.  Our room, while on the small size & lacking any real storage space, was tastefully & luxuriously decorated.  Bathroom was all we could ask for.  The spa was amazing, loved the pool, the steam room & the very large jacuzzi!  The location was perfect for Trafalger Square, the underground & a Thames bridge to the National Theatre.  I must return to this hotel!",5,2015,01,12
143,Excellent Hotel,Stayed at this hotel in October 2014. Excellent from the moment we walked through the door. Very helpful & pleasant staff. Beautiful hotel entrance / reception. Hotel room & bathroom very spacious & very well appointed. Restaurants & bar both excellent.,5,2015,01,12
143,Excellent,"My wife and I traveled to London and arrived early morning at the hotel. The manager was very considerate and provided  tea service while we waited for our room to be ready.  The rooms were well appointed and clean, very spacious.  The quality of service was beyond expected, great breakfast and the staff were very friendly. We would revisit on our next London trip",5,2015,01,11
143,Just love this place,"I stayed at this particular hotel last Christmas and decided to stop there for the first two nights of my trip in Dec 14.I wanted to see if it was as good as the last time and it did not disappoint. i arrived at the hotel at about 11am and so earlier than the usual check in time which I think is 3pm.  I was hoping that i would be able to check in as my fight had arrived into London from Sydney that morning and as you can imagine I was tired. The lady on reception said that I could check in but at a cost of GBP50 per night and to be honest it was worth it just so that you can shower, change and get on with the day as I had a lot to do. The room which was an Executive King room was just beautiful ( the same as last year).

If there was one slight annoyance ( and you have to remember that this was just before Christmas) was that the room overlooked the atrium and at the bottom was the Ball Room. There was a Christmas party on that evening and the noise from the party came up through the atrium. Its just something to be mindful of. I did call reception and they had already been made aware of the issue by some other guests  and were trying to resolve with the party organiser, which they eventually did.

Apart from that you really should try it. The location is great next to the Embankment Tube station. I also love walking so for me it was a pleasant walk to Soho, Regent St and on to Oxford St. I am back in the UK Dec 2015 for a family event and I will be looking to stay at the Corinthia again.",5,2015,01,11
143,one of the best in London!,"I absolutely love Corinthia!!the only reason I do not give it 5 stars is its  location, while I do love covent garden and embakment, I would rather prefer Mayfair.Rooms are beautiful and well appointed. bathrooms are gorgeous and the bathtub is deep and large, quite adequate for relaxation.
concierge is excellent, could arrange several hard to get restaurant reservation on a very short notice, spa is extraordinary, breakfast high quality and with good variety.Staff is smiling and willing to help.
The hotel is on the expensive side, but worth every penny,if you can afford it just stay there.",4,2015,01,10
143,"Excellent location, friendly staff","My husband and I spent one night here for a birthday treat. I wish we had stayed longer! We arrived early and our room was ready, with a welcome upgrade and a beautiful birthday cake thrown in. We refreshed and then walked out for lunch, a show and an evening meal. Back to the hotel for a peaceful evening, beautiful breakfast and efficient departure. Would definitely recommend.",5,2015,01,10
143,One of the mystery hotel,I liked this hotel. We stayed for one night. The hotel genuinely busy and staff are really friendly and helpful. Room is very clean and fresh. I would stay here again as its so convenient and shopping is accessible very easily. 3 minutes walk to Kensington High Street.,4,2015,01,09
143,"Perfect Location, Suberb Service","My husband and I stayed at the Corinthia for 2 nights as our Christmas present to each other and what a wonderful choice.  We stayed in a ""standard room"" and thought it was lovely.  We loved the facilities - including the Nespresso machine and the bathroom was lovely - loved the TV at the end of the bath, whilst enjoying a soak in the bath after a day sightseeing with a coffee and lovely bath salts from the spa.  The bed was very comfortable with lovely linen.  We ran out of the bath salts (they really are lovely in such  big bath!) called housekeeping to ask for some more and a very polite man arrived in just 5 minutes with sachets for us.  We loved the turn-down service - a lovely touch.

We visited the spa 3 times - bathrobes and slippers in the room and there is a special lift to reach the spa - make sure you ask where the lift is.  You need to sign in at the spa reception - there are plenty of towels in the spa for you to use.

We didn't eat in the restaurant but did enjoy a wonderful cocktail in the bar!  Breakfast room very well decorated and we thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast.  Plenty of choice.

The hotel lobby was decorated with magical Christmas trees and the atmosphere in the hotel was one of discrete elegance!

However, for us, the highlight was the courteous, friendly and professional staff.  From reception, the spa, housekeeping, door, conciege and breakfast room - nothing was too much trouble.

The location of the hotel is perfect.  Just a few minutes walk to Trafalgar Square, Covent Garden and Soho.  We enjoyed a great evening at Ronnie Scotts and great meals in Soho too -not fogetting Gordon's Wine Bar (just under the railway bridge at Embankment) - perfect for lunch - a bottle of wine and cheese plate!

Would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel - hope to be able to visit again soon!",5,2015,01,09
143,Beautiful designed brilliant service,"We stayed at the Corinthia as our Christmas present and it fulfilled every expectation and more. This is the best hotel we have had the pleasure of visiting and I cann fault it. From room service to the cocktails in the bar it was perfect. My highlight was the TV in the bath! I look forward to my next visit, hopefully for my birthday ",5,2015,01,08
143,Way below expectations,"We usuallly stay in Jumeirah Carlton. good pool and fitness facilities plus location determind our choice. Room is way too small, hardly can locate ourselves there. Very dark and airless. You wouldnt expect it in the room for over £400. Some simple amenities like dental kits, decaf coffee, milk and drinking water was not in the room so had to call for them. Very grumpy doormen. Staff  doesnt know wher is what in hotel and cannot direct you.
Good location, good spa.
As I spend most of my days in different hotels around the world and this one is the biggest disappointment I had. Definitely not value for money. Advise to use other hotels within same pricerange.",1,2015,01,08
143,"Comfortable rooms, Excellent restaurants, incomparable service","If I were a hotel manager, I would hate to have a guest like me. I have exceedingly high - perhaps impossible - expectations about comfort, cleanliness, courtesy, and prompt service. Unfortunately, I usually have to compromise on my standards, because most hotels simply cannot live up to them. There is one exception. The Corinthian in London. It is the finest hotel I've ever stayed at. The rooms are tastefully furnished, the Wifi is excellent, the room service is outstanding, the restaurants have an excellent menu and a terrific wait staff. For people who like to walk the location is excellent.   For those who prefer transportation, a cab stand is right outside the hotel  But what makes the hotel non pareil is the staff. Imagine a hotel where every member of the staff acts as if he or she is an owner and you are a cherished guest. That's how you'll feel from the moment you enter.  And you'll continue to feel that way throughout your stay.  I have stayed in hotels from Tel Aviv to Istanbul, from Boston to Berlin, from New York to Rio.  When I visit New York I stay at one of the best hotels in the nation, but nothing and I mean nothing has ever equalled the experience I had at the Corinthia Hotel in London. I recommend it unequivocally and enthusiastically. And after you stay there, I can almost guarantee that you will too.",5,2015,01,07
143,First class,"We only stayed one night but wished it was longer!! The decor was lovely and was made even more lovely with the Christmas decorations, especially the Christmas tree made from gingerbread! The spa was amazing the marble heated chairs were lush would love one at home and my treatments were sooo relaxing! Dinner in the Northall was lovely. Although the starter was nothing special my chicken and parsnip risotto for main was delicious. As for dessert well I am a trifle fan and this was the best trifle I have ever tasted!! Above all was the service all the staff were so friendly, professional and helpful but without being intrusive. I would 100% go back.... If I could afford it..! It is a bit pricey but worth it if you want to treat yourself! 
My only constructive criticism would be the rooms are a bit dark and the shower head next to the steam room in the spa is rusty and the switch was hanging off the wall. I only mention this because it's such a lovely spa it would be a shame if it wasn't maintained properly. Also I left my charger in the room and e-mailed the hotel twice about it but they never replied. However these are minor things when overall had an amazing stay. Book it!!",5,2015,01,07
143,Fantastic Place for NYE Fireworks,"We have been to london a few times and usually like the knightsbridge/mayfair area but we decided to stay here since it's in the fireworks zone and that means you automatically get admission to the fireworks area (this is the first year tickets were required). We were so happy with our choice. First, if you are want to see the NYE fireworks (which are fantastic by the way), this is such a great, great spot to do it from. We had a late dinner and strolled outside 5 minutes before the big show. It was the best way to do it! So much fun and no need to stand outside freezing. Beyond that, the hotel was just perfect in every way. We stayed in an executive king room. It was large and very well designed with a beautiful bathroom. There is an entry foyer which buffers the hallway door from the bedroom and an actual door between the foyer and the room. This makes the room quiet, immune from the dreaded hallway noise (if you have read any of my other reviews you will notice quietness of the room is a HUGE thing for me and this configuration--hallway door, foyer, bedroom door-- is one that I love and think all great hotels should have). In fact, this was the quietest hotel room I think we have ever stayed in; we even joked that we must have been the only occupied room on the 4th floor since we never heard a sound from anyone else the entire time we were there. The hotel is surrounded by government buildings so at night it's very quiet and we slept great every night.  The fabulous thing is that even though it's in this quiet location, the hotel is still surrounded by everything you could want: trafalgar square, the west end (theaters), historic sites (big ben etc), the river thames, and a subway station right across the street. The service was top notch, we had room service probably 8 times while we there and it was great every time. We also ate in the lounge area and enjoyed that too. The spa/fitness area was superior to most european hotels I have stayed in and was very posh. The hotel was decorated for the holidays and was so festive and lovely. The only downside for us was the expensive cab rides to knightsbridge/mayfair for shopping. But we could have avoided those by taking the underground. I don't have a single negative thing to say about this hotel. Oh, and the wifi was free, which I really appreciate with all our devices.",5,2015,01,06
143,A trip to see art and theater,"My wife and I decided to spend 5 days in London to see the wonderful new art exhibitions at The National Gallery, The Royal Academy of Art and The Victoria and Albert. In addition we attended two excellent shows in the theater district. We chose the Corinthia Hotel because of it's location, reputation and amenities. It did not disappoint on any of these. The service is wonderful, the food excellent and the rooms and gym are comfortable and well appointed. We recommend it, but check your wallet before making a reservation, or book through an agent with the ability to arrange a good package.",5,2015,01,06
143,Jewel of Westminster ,"My husband and I were fortunate to stay 9 nights at the magnificent Corinthia. I arrived very early on the 18th December and our rooms were ready . Do yore self a favour and stay, its beautiful rooms , wonderful staff, is a credit to management behind the scene that makes a hotel run so well. We felt at home and found it sad to leave. We actually came back 4days later after travelling to stay another 2 nights . It's a warm, comfortable, beautiful place to stay. Well done to all at The Corinthia. Aphra and John Natsis Melbourne Australia ",5,2015,01,05
143,Excelent,"My experience with Corinthia Hotel Londo was very pleasent. The Hotel has outstanding services and localization, near Trafalgar Square but in a very quiet place.

143,Wonderful Experience ! New Year's Eve and New Year's Day at the Corinthia London,"From the moment I rang the hotel to book a room for New Year's Eve and New Year's Day I was impressed! The lady and gentleman I spoke to at Reservations couldn't have been more helpful especially when I told them I was booking our stay as a surprise Christmas present for my partner. They described the room in great detail and assured me they would do their best to make sure that we had a room with a view of the London Eye and therefore the fireworks.  They sent very detailed information about the road closures and how best to get to the hotel. On arrival we were met at Northumberland Avenue by hotel staff and escorted to the hotel.... needless to say they carried our bags! Checking in was efficient and took very little time... all staff we met were extremely friendly and polite. We were given wristbands that gave us access to the viewing area for the fireworks. 
The room we had was extremely spacious and beautifully decorated!  Everything you could possibly need was provided for and the attention to detail was second to none!!  We had Room Service on New Year's Eve as we didn't want to attend the ball and just wanted to rest before 
the fireworks. The gentleman who brought the food laid it out beautifully again with great attention to detail. We ordered oysters, crispy squid and a pizza. unfortunately the only thing that we enjoyed were the oysters. The squid was very chewy and the pizza was dry and not very tasty at all. We did tell the gentleman who collected our dishes but he didn't really pass any comment. I put it down to the fact that it was New Year's Eve and they were very busy. The fireworks were an amazing experience... and the fact that it only took us a minute to get there and back certainly helped!! We tried to get into the Bassoon Bar for a cocktail when we came back but it was crowded so we sat in the Lobby. We were seen to very quickly and the gentleman who took our orders apologised that he could not make some cocktails and if we wanted them we may have to wait quite a while. My partner was disappointed but settled on a beer and I had a mojito which was lovely. When we came to sign the bill the waiter insisted that we didn't have to pay as we didn't really get the drinks we had wanted. What a lovely touch!!  We had a wonderful sleep in the biggest and most comfortable bed I have ever been in! Breakfast was amazing.... I can't think of anything that wasn't available. We had tickets to view the Lord Mayor's Parade from a grandstand on Whitehall... again a lovely touch provided by the hotel. After the parade we spent an hour in the Vitality pool..... so relaxing and such beautiful surroundings.  We had an evening meal in Massimo's which we thoroughly enjoyed! Service was excellent and the food was delicious. Again they couldn't do enough for us. I requested an Italian dessert Zabaglione which wasn't on the menu  and they were kind enough to make it for me. To finish all I can say is our time in London at the Corinthia Hotel for New Year's Eve and New Year's Day was a very special time for us.... We felt like we were staying with family .... very wealthy family.... who wanted us to have the best time ever.... and did everything they could to make that happen!! Thank you to each and every one of you at the Corinthia Hotel!",5,2015,01,03
143,Very nice but NYE dinner price ridiculous!,"We stayed here for NYE and NYD.  As mentioned by others the location was fantastic for the fireworks, which is why we treated ourselves.  It turned out that a friend of a friend was one of the concierge managers, which should in theory have been great for us.... However, he suggested we book for NYE dinner but neither he nor anyone else told us the price - an eye watering 350 pounds!  It was not until we had been in the restaurant for over half an hour that the menu was provided, which had the price shown.  I was distinctly unimpressed and immediately complained.  To the hotels great credit they did then agree to charge us only the A la-carte price for the items that we actually ate, which reduced the price by approximately 7 fold (wow!).  However, we noticed one other large family suddenly ""disappeared"", having abandoned all their drinks so I don't think we were the only ones in the same boat, but perhaps they didn't complain?  The ESPA is beautiful, but they have very restrictive access and times for children under 16 (can only use the main pool for 3 hours per day, and nothing else is permitted).  While I can understand the time restrictions, some of the other prohibitions are excessive, and indeed we saw many guests flouting their rules (including us!) until ordered out!!  Rooms are fantastic and my daughter certainly enjoyed the TV in the bath.",4,2015,01,03
143,Another great stay....,"I have now stayed at the Corinthia six times over the past few years.  It is a great hotel, great service, comfortable rooms, and great location.  It is comparable to any five star London hotel. You need to check this one out.",5,2015,01,02
143,Very Posh!,"Me and my husband stayed here on New Year's Eve for the fireworks. Lovely hotel great service. We had ordered room service on the evening, as I also didn't want to pay £350 for a dinner party as the previous reviewer had also mentioned. Although the gentleman at the reception desk said that the party was for all staying guests, but the lady at the door of the resturant said its only for guests who have dined in the resturant,  which was abit of a let down.

I did find the whole experience over priced. Food was very expensive with a 12percent Service charge on everything. For a luxury hotel I found the bed very uncomfortable. But I did have a lovely New Year's Eve and it was great to watch the fireworks which was literally a minute walk from our hotel. ",4,2015,01,02
143,An example of a great hotel,"Rooms, decor, style, furnishings, public areas were amazing. Staff were attentive and knowledgeable.r +big breakfast buffet +very good Italian rest and service esp with the wine recommendations. I will recommend this hotel!",5,2015,01,02
143,Wonderful Hotel,"We spent Christmas Eve and night, we has such a lovely experience(again). The staff can never do enough for you, they're so helpful. The rooms are beautiful, 640 has an amazing bathroom. The ESPA Spa is to die for, perfect wind down after Christmas lunch. Highly recommend staying.",5,2015,01,01
143,"Lovely hotel, just let down by poor service","We stayed one night over New Years Eve so we could easily watch the fireworks and not have the hassle of getting home.  It was our Christmas treat to ourselves. We live in London, so it's a bit crazy really.

The Good

The hotel is stunning, perfect location for the fireworks.  We walked outside at 23:30, walked 10mins and stood directly in front of the London Eye to watch the fireworks.  We walked 10mins back, and into the hotel.  So in terms of what we wanted to do it was perfect, and if you're thinking about it for 2015 then book now before the price doubles closer you get.  We booked a year in advance.  The hotel gives you a wrist band, but were not asked to show it to anyone as you are in the ticketed area.

The room was easily one of the better rooms I have stayed in.  We were in their best room, before the suites.  The room is large with lots of nice touches.  Good technology in the room, simple lighting system, free FAST wifi.  The bathroom even has a Japanese toilet!  Arcane is a little odd, but worked it out in the end, just needs clearer instructions.

We had room service in the evening, as we were not in the mood for their £350 a head NYE dinner option which I am sure would have been great as a small group, but not as a couple.  The room service menu was very good, if only let down by the food arriving a little cold.

The Spa with steam room, chill out areas, sauna, swimming pool and separate spa pool is stunning, and worth a visit.  It's small but perfectly formed (in a good way).

The Bad

The hotel has the looks, a lovely Aqua based spa, lovely public areas and stunning rooms.  My issue was the service, there was something just a bit off with it.  Take Four Seasons in Park Lane or the Savoy, where you are just taken care of the second you walk up to the door.  You are made to feel like a VIP.

We received a letter before our arrival to say that we needed to enter via the Northumberland Road entrance due to the NYE road closures.   This entrance is NOT the main entrance, which is the other side.  There were no staff on this door when we arrived, so we walked in looking very confused as we ended with people having afternoon tea.  After a few minutes we found the reception, although no signage to explain what was the reception and what was the concierge.  Just annoyed me.  We had arrived an hour early, and hoped for an early check in.  The staff member we were talking to was checking, and looked to another colleague who took a look at us and said “no” under his breath back to the person dealing with us.  Not a good start!.  Thankfully, someone else, then came out, who looked more senior and found us a room.

There was an extra bed in our room, which I assume had been made up for someone else.  Took a couple of calls for it to be removed.

If I was paying £200 a night I would not say a thing, but when you're paying £500 a night you expect a certain level of service.

Saying that we would stay again, its a stunning hotel, but the staff needs some training and a think about how when you arrive at the hotel via the different entrances how new guests are treated.

The service in the Spa was very good and helpful.",4,2015,01,01
143,"Memorable, Comfortable Stay","We spent three nights here in October on the ""stay 3 pay for 2"" special, which lessened the sticker shock considerably. Our Junior Suite was beautifully appointed, facing the inner courtyard, ensuring a quiet night's sleep. The expansive buffet breakfast in the Northhall was expensive but delicious, and enough to keep you going until afternoon tea. The location of the Embankment tube stop nearby was a godsend! Sometimes we came back so tired from walking everywhere that we were grateful to emerge from the station only a few steps from the hotel. The inviting public spaces are dramatic and warm. We also enjoyed the pool at the spa. The staff was always helpful, prompt and friendly. You do get what you pay for here, and the experience is five star all the way. Well done!",5,2015,01,01
143,Good,"The hotel is clean and beautiful, but the staffs tend to be racist towards Asians. They do not greet or open doors for Asian people, they do not leave the elevator open and instead try to shut it as quickly as they can. And they do not take the Asians to their room and treat them with less respect. So overall a 4",4,2014,12,31
143,Luxury Coffee break,"After viewing the Rembrant Exhibition at the National Gallery we happened to pass by the Corinthia Hotel and thought we would just pop in for a Coffee  -  What a treat -  this newish hotel is just the most stylish place  -  so chic and elegant and the most beautiful Christmas decorations from the ginger bread houses and tree in the flower shop to the table decos and main tree in the foyer  -  just gorgeous.
As for the coffee and service in the Northall Bar - excellent.
Will definitely be going back for a meal in their Massimo Bar or possibly afternoon tea just off the foyer which looked superb -  cannot wait.",5,2014,12,31
143,Amazing hotel and worth the price!,"We stayed at the Corinthia only one night on our way back home to Toronto from Amsterdam.
The porters were friendly and attentive as well as the Reception staff. The room was beautifully decorated and the washroom was well stocked and impressive.

We had drinks and dinner at the hotel as well as breakfast the next day in the courtyard. Everything was superb and the service was simply amazing.

I would definitely recommend this hotel to other travelers. Yes, it is a bit pricey, but well worth it.",5,2014,12,30
143,Excellent,"Only a short stay but a memorable one. What a great hotel; they seem to have just about everything well thought through, there is no doubt we will visit again (and again) and recommend that our friends and family do the same whenever they have a special celebration or just want to indulge",5,2014,12,30
143,ideal for London,"Great for the clever  traveller. We booked three nights at the Corinthia Hotel. It suited our needs perfectly. This is a charming sofisticated  hotel in the heart of a teeming London. The hotel itself is beautiful, and the staff are all so friendly. There are a few different restaurants to eat in, to which you should reserve. I would highly recommend..",5,2014,12,27
143,Amazing,"My husband and I stayed for three nights leaving on Christmas Eve. We arrived early morning and a room was already available. We had brunch - which is a must, the spa - wow everything was 5 star. This is our new favorite london hotel.",5,2014,12,27
143,Well Worth the Money,"My recent stay was wonderful . The staff was superb. The rooms were modern, I especially appreciated the expresso maker in the room. The bathrooms were spacious.The fitness center was escellent. I will definitely return in the future.",5,2014,12,27
143,Perfect,Luxury..Luxury..I love this hotel and it is one of my favs in the world. The spa is top notch and worth a visit even if you aren't a guest in the hotel. The restaurants are perfect as is the bar. This is as much a destination as London. Worth the expense.,5,2014,12,27
143,Knocks the socks off Hotel 41,"We've stayed pretty much at some of the best hotels we could afford, including Hotel 41 some years ago and I reckon this hotel tops the lot ever. It's even better than the Wynn in Vegas but it's really weird because the Wynn is full of bling and £50k flower arrangements but the Corinthia isn't loud at all. I can't put my finger on why I think the corinthia is the best as it's lots of things, almost small things. 
When we come back from an evening the bed has been prepared and pot pourri scents placed by the bedside with herbal sprays to spray onto your pillow to give you a sound nights sleep. Our room was virtually sound proof, the bed was the comfiest ever.  The staff really care, it's not like they are getting paid to care. The breakfast is great, the cocktail bar is fab and our Les. Mis pre theatre al a carte meal was fantastic. 
So I can't tell you exactly what it is that made this the best one because it was lots of small little things. All I will say is try it out and you won't be disappointed. 
Just make sure that you've got enough for the mortgage once you've paid up on checkout.",5,2014,12,25
143,My God!,"I stayed here late 2013... But I had to write a review. This is probably one of the top 5 hotels I have stayed in my life. It is amazing! The gym, the room... There is absolutely nothing wrong with this place. Probably just the price... But you get more than what you paid for. There is no risk here. Go there, and be wowed.",5,2014,12,25
143,Pricey but lovely,"All hotels in London are generally more expensive than I am used to in Sydney - and this one is no different. Having said that it was really lovely. We had an extra large room that gave us the space we love. Bathroom was huge and the room design a little odd given the space available to them but all in all really delightful. 

Staff experience was that of a big hotel - so not overly personal - but certainly nothing wrong with it either. 

Loved being near the train stations as made getting around much easier.",4,2014,12,25
143,Simply Superb,"What an outstanding experience - the room was magnificent, the was food cooked to perfection and I have to say, the spa was one of the best I've been to, especially the sunk sauna that looks onto the indoor fireplace. The staff couldn't do enough to make my stay comfortable and I'd highly recommend staying here.",5,2014,12,24
143,Heaven,"One of the best experiences.  The lobby, bar restaurants and the services of the staff are very impressive. Value for money, very comfortable and the services are excellent. It's like heaven staying in this hotel.--The best Hotel in London.",5,2014,12,23
143,Must be the best hotel in London,"I lived in London for many years and today live 30 miles from the centre - so I know the city pretty well.

I've stayed at most of the famous hotels in the city and usually left feeling that the reputation and price were a little overstated for the experience I'd had.  My travel agent has told me for years to stay at the Corinthia.  Last night I did for my anniversary.

What a revelation!  A spacious quiet, comfortable, temperate room in central London!  We stayed in an executive room and I really could not fault it at all.

The common rooms from the hotel were stunning - although we were in town to eat at a specific restaurant.

Location is position A for tourists and shoppers.

I will stay here whenever I'm in town - and can afford it!",5,2014,12,20
143,I've found my new London 'Go To',"The Corinthia wows you upon entry. The lobby, bar and restaurants all feature dramatic and impressive décor. There are high ceilings, with a mix of contemporary and old-fashioned lighting and art work. The building is  ideally located  for the West End and the Thames. 

We stayed in a spacious Deluxe King. The décor was warm and welcoming, with muted greens, greys and beiges. The room felt quite masculine with lots of wood, leather and autumnal colors. Included were nice touches like a luxury espresso maker, a high-end hairdryer and interesting art books. Everything felt brand new. The rooms are less dramatic than the communal areas of the hotel, but are cosy and luxurious. My only complaint was the lack of view / natural light, as our room looked onto a dark internal courtyard.
The bathroom was spacious with an enormous tub. Great shower and toiletries – tick.
Service was top notch. Friendly, courteous, professional. I ate at the restaurant for breakfast which was good, albeit not cheap. 

To conclude, I would stay here again in a heart-beat. The great location, friendly service and comfortable rooms outshine other London hotels. I wish I’d had more time to check out the rest of the facilities (e.g. the spa) that are on offer.",5,2014,12,19
143,Valeriya's advice,"The best hotel in London.. A home is  away from home....I felt like a princess.. Stuff was very helpful.I stayed twice here (in august and begining  of November) and I would like to return,I had an unforgettable experience at SPA. Value for money. Very comfortable rooms and beds.The best breakfast what I have  ever tried in London (a lot of fruites and vegetables juces,barries)..I highly recommend this hotel to everyone///",5,2014,12,19
143,The Only Place To Stay In London,"I've stayed at most of the 5 star Hotels in central London but this one is special. Most friendliest staff, superb rooms, excellent restaurants/bars and only a couple of minutes walk away from Covent Garden & Leicester Square. 
Give it a try and see for yourself",5,2014,12,19
143,The perfect London hotel!,"We arrived in London quite early in the morning and were very impressed right from the moment we arrived. We were greeted by the doormen and then by the check in staff. Isabel, the guest relations manager, personally greeted us and was lovely. She advised us that our room wasn't currently ready (which we expected for such an early time in the morning), but said that it wouldn't be long and offered us a complimentary hot beverage in the hotel lobby. It was amazing service.

The rooms were very modern, clean and comfortable and the bath even had a built in plasma with a water proof remote! The location was superb, only being a couple hundred metres from Embankmant tube station, right across the Thames from the London Eye. The breakfasts were also amazing, being able to choose off the menu or help yourself to the buffet.

I hope to return to the Corinthia next time I'm in London. I couldn't ask for anything more!",5,2014,12,19
143,Simply breathtaking ...,"My wife and I spent 5 nights here last week and loved it.

We had an extra large room with a huge bathroom (with big bath) and walk in robe. The room was extremely comfortable and met all our needs.

The service was very good and we especially enjoyed tea in the lobby lounge sitting in front of a warm gas fire. 

Breakfast was excellent especially when ordering from the a la carte menu. 

We had a special surprise when Kenneth Branagh hopped in the lift with us and had our own little 'Notting Hill' moment with the cast of ""In the Woods"" doing media on Level 1 on our last day.

Tip 1: use a travel agent that can book via Fine Hotels group as this provides additional benefits such as room upgrades, breakfast and an amenity.

Tip 2: choose the a la carte option for breakfast as it is both cheaper ( pleasant surprise) and we found it better quality especially if you like scrambled eggs. 

",5,2014,12,17
143,"Excellent, if you can afford it","This was my second visit to this hotel and it is truly one of the best. The rooms are spacious and very well equipped (Nespresso machines!). Large king-size beds, quiet rooms at courtyards. Gym is fantastic and so is breakfast, the breakfast room being an attraction in itself. The only drawback: incredibly expensive (around 500 pounds per night)",5,2014,12,13
143,Fabulous junior suite,"I have stayed at a lot of hotels in London, and Claridge's has been my current favorite. However, rates were just too high this month, and Corinthia had a great AMEX Fine Hotels and Resorts rate. I have read mixed things about the Corinthia, and I can't speak to all their room types. We were upgraded to a regular junior suite, however, and it was fabulous. One of the nicest and most comfortable rooms I have stayed in for a while. Huge closet. Lovely bathroom and perfect bed. Very quiet, with good maid service, that mostly came when you called. The room was so nice that I can overlook a couple of service issues, and breakfast in my opinion was mediocre. Even though we ate six breakfasts there, as breakfast was included with our room, I just couldn't find anything that really suited me. The buffet was just okay. I think they could focus on some more healthful options. The buffet scrambled eggs seemed to be loaded with butter. However, the breakfast room is gorgeous and relaxing. So not a perfect experience, but I wish all hotel rooms could be like the Corinthia's junior suite. Really great. I'll be back.",5,2014,12,12
143,Luxury in the right place,"Great location for a city centre break. Beautiful hotel with a stunning restaraunt plus charming and attentive staff. Top prices, however, you will remember this hotel for a very long time. Breakfast was a must absolutely delicious. Rooms were fabulous.",4,2014,12,11
143,Beautiful hotel but slightly dissapointed,"We spent three nights here last weekend in an Executive King room.

The hotel is lovely and brilliantly situated.  We chose it as we wanted a wow factor which a lot of the public rooms have.  The lobby and Northall rooms are stunning.  Unfortunately we were underwhelmed with our room.  The picture and description on the website gave us really high expectations but we must have been very unlucky with the room allocated.  We actually came away wondering if we had been in the right room category but have corresponded with the hotel since our return who assure us this was not the case and they did seem genuinely concerned that we were disappointed.  The bathroom however was superb - heated floors, huge shower, nice toiletries, masses of towels and a deep bath with a tv at the end.

Everything else about the hotel did impress us.  Breakfast was very good and all the service we received was excellent.  The afternoon tea being served in the lobby also looked particularly good.

We had a lovely stay and with the right room would imagine it could be faultless.",4,2014,12,10

-housekeeping is a bit carefree, they do not pay attention how you organize your stuff in the room, they just reorganize everything to factory settings :) they also lost a piece of clothing we left on the bed while making the room.

-false fire alarm on a sunday morning",4,2014,12,08
143,True luxury,Quite possibly the best hotel we have ever stayed at. From the moment you see the hotel in the distance you cannot help but be impressed. The room was absolutely stunning and the breakfast was to die for!,5,2014,12,08
143,It's all about the details - Amazing!,"We were here for a wedding and truly had no idea what to expect (that was another story, I am only covering the room and experience - wedding was even more amazing), but from the moment you walk in - it's the detail that grab your conscious and subconscious attention.  It starts with the staff who are professional, but seem to know just the level of friendliness and engagement you are looking for.  Next is the opulent, and modern lobby with the chandelier of individual white lights and one perfectly placed red one.  The various open spaces, shopping, and drinking/dining areas were similar.  Detailed beauty and experience focused.  

The next surprise was the room.  The hallways were beautiful with a mix of wood floors and carpet, the doors were solid wood with all trim perfectly placed.  The construction obviously used craftsmen - no sloppy joints or filler.  Some that takes a minute to realize - what is different.  Your eyes say, just walls, doors and trim...but your brain says this is different, luxurious, and special.

The standard room was massive on European standards with a perfect lay out.  Large bedroom with fresh walls, modern technology, focus on comfort - yet blended in with the history of the building.  The separate dressing area also had fine finishes, a nice window, and plenty of space for two.  The bathroom was perfectly designed for an array of relaxation - separate spacious bath with a window, shower with fixtures I want to take home, dual shower for rain or spray and a segmented toilet area.  All with heated floors makes you want to sleep there.

It almost goes without saying, but worth a note that the bed, mattress, pillows, and lindens were extravagant, comfortable, and led to blissful sleeping  - I know it was a wedding so the second day we would have slept on the bathroom floor, but the night before was a good test.

I can only say this is a MUST stay place at some point in your travels.  Oh yeah...good location, although we loved the hotel so much we really never left.

Thank you Corinthia.  We love your home, family, and hospitality!",5,2014,12,06
143,Outstanding hotel,"My husband and I stayed here for a corporate event and Christmas party. The hotel is beautiful, staff attentive and did excellent. House keeping were over zealous and whilst turning down our room during the evening took/ tidied away our coat hangers which we required to carry our clothes home in a suit carrier bag. This was efficiently resolved following a call to reception. There was lots of choice at breakfast, it I was being super picky my only slight complaint would be that the self serve cooked breakfast items weren't very hot! Overall fabulous stay and wouldn't hesitate to recommend.",5,2014,12,06
143,Wonderful Hotel!,"I stayed at the Corinthia Hotel in London for three nights in November and I'm glad I did. Usually, I stay nearer to Hyde Park but this location was excellent because it was near everything and I could walk everywhere. My courtyard room was quiet and beautiful. The staff was discreet and very helpful. The spa is huge and the fitness areas are fantastic. The pool is a bit short for swimming laps but I managed. We enjoyed tea time in the lobby and breakfast was very good with great service. I will definitely stay at the Corinthia again!",5,2014,12,06

Push the boat out and stay here.",5,2014,12,05
143,A wonderful experience.,When visiting London take my advice and stay at the Corinthia.This hotel is a dream come true.I could not fault it in any way.Whoever designed the rooms is a genius or someone who has travelled a lot as the design and accessories  are more than perfect.One could go on and on with praising this hotel and as for me I can't wait to return.,5,2014,12,03
143,Best spa! ,"Spent a Saturday night here with my boyfriend for our anniversary. The hotel is beautiful! We were upgraded which was a great touch. Room had a pleasant balcony overlooking the gardens. Bed was huge and bathroom even better! Had room service for dinner which was pleasant if a little pricy, £21 for a burger etc. But worth it for relaxing in the room! Breakfast we had delivered to room in the morning which was lovely. The spa was the best part however. Not busy and beautifully set out. Cannot wait to return! ",5,2014,12,03
143,A magical birthday treat,"My daughter took me to the Corinthia as a birthday surprise.  From the moment we entered the hotel we had five star treatment.  I had a surprise birthday cake delivered to our exquisite room with a birthday card from the hotel.   Our room was truly spectacular and spotlessly clean.   The breakfast catered for everything you could wish for and more.    Our final day at the Spa was magical and just totally relaxing.    My daughter discovered she had left her mobile phone in her robe at the Spa and, after a frantic call to the Hotel once home, she was telephoned back within 20 minutes to say they had searched the robes and found the missing phone.   How amazing!   This hotel, and more importantly all the staff, go above and beyond what is expected of them to make my stay one of the most memorable experiences I have ever had.   What a wonderful birthday present.  Thank you to everyone at the Corinthia for making me feel so special.",5,2014,12,02
143,"Amazing hotel, outstanding service","We stayed for one Sunday night and all I can say is, amazing. Check in was effortless, the room (superior double) was the cheapest of the bunch and yet paid amazing attention to detail. Great size, perfect coffee machine, a bath tub I seriously did not want to leave (huge, quick to fill up and with a tv in the wall). Housekeeping came to my hair emergency quick as a flash with some straightening irons, and the concierge service was the best we've experienced. We treated ourselves to breakfast in bed, which came bang on the time we asked for it and wonderfully hot. I have no shame in admitting that we completely abused the fabulous spa area, staying long enough to resemble a shrivelled prune on leaving, and each member of staff we encountered couldn't do more to make our experience memorable. No pretentiousness, just pure class. Would stay again in a heartbeat.",5,2014,12,02
143,excellent hotel,"I absolutely loved this hotel. The attention to detail is meticulous and deeply satisfying. The rooms are gorgeous, the bed is heavenly and the employees are very helpful and friendly. The food is A+ and the Spa is fabulous. Definately going back to Corinthia Hotel when I'm in London next.",5,2014,12,02
143,"Corinthia Hotel, London","I stayed at here with my partner. It was a good experience. The hotel is located centrally and offers easy access to Parliament Square, Trafalgar Square and the Strand leading to Covent Garden. When arriving the doorman opened our London taxi door promptly and took our light luggage, escorted us to reception to check-in. The clerk was very helpful and took the time to walk us to the best lift to use for our excellent room on the fourth floor. The room had stunning views across this smart part of the capital, the bathroom was stylish and modern with the now fairly commonplace TV in bath. The king size bed was very comfortable. Mood lighting built in to the bedside table was smart, easy to use and convenient.
My partner enjoyed the magnificent spa facilities whilst I was happy to explore the hotels other points of interest including some excellent restaurants and bars.
This hotel is deservedly a five star property and one of the most beautiful I have experienced. They have combined tradition and contemporary styles seamlessly and tastefully.
I have been bringing VIP groups to five star hotels in Europe for more than twenty years and The Corinthia is definitely in our London top five.
My score: 9.5/10",5,2014,12,02
143,Quality at its highest. ,"Stayed at the Corinthia for a weekend break with my partner. We had an interior superior king.

Where to start.  Check in was fast and although the room wasn't ready (we arrived early) we were seated under that glorious chandelier for afternoon tea. A simple cup of tea becomes something special in that environment,  and the service was top notch.  Decor impeccable. 

The room is faultless.  We had the 'cheap' room which at over gbp200 a night is still expensive but WOW. The design is awesome, the bed is the most comfortable I have ever experienced, the decor, the walk in closet, nespresso machine, table and chairs, large flat screen, tv in the bathroom, gorgeous bath, seperate rain shower, choice newspaper every morning...the list keeps going on. The room is turned down at night, with a bottle of water, delectable chocolates,  and slippers next to the bed. The attention to detail is marvellous. 

Had dinner at the Northall. Service was again terrific,  friendly waiters, lovely ambience and mouthwatering food. 

Breakfast has a decent selection although I'm not a fan of the scrambled eggs and would prefer an omelette station (available but at cost). Again,  I simply can't fault the service.  The moment you get up for another plate,  the staff refold the napkin on the table and remove any plates, almost like sitting to a fresh table each time. 

That spa.  Won't go into too much detail,  it is ridiculously beautiful,  something special. Quiet, opulent,  soothing. 

Leaving this place was difficult.

If you can afford it,  this hotel is very special. Well designed, super clean,  attention to minute detail and faultlessservice.  You certainly get what you pay for.  Thank you for such a special experience.

143,Absolutely Fantastic!,"My wife and I stayed for a long weekend in London at the Corinthia. The hotel itself is beautiful. Great architecture and the ""heart of the hotel"" chandelier in the lobby is truly inspiring. The room was great, service outstanding and our stay absolutely fantastic. The concierge gets a special pat on the back for advising on best hangover medication on a difficult Sunday morning.",5,2014,11,29
143,"Beautiful hotel, just a shame they were ripping us off at every oppportunity!","A beautiful hotel, with impeccable decor and brilliant service, but unfortunately all of this was eclipsed by how ripped off we felt! We booked an executive room for £700, arrived and it was really quite a small room in comparison for what you can get elsewhere for that money. Horrified to find out that breakfast was not included in that rate! I have never heard of this before and I have stayed in several similiar hotels. Breakfast came in at £35 a head and for that it was either continental or English, not the choice of both. A film from the TV was £19, the same price as the cinema! Just a real shame. ",3,2014,11,28

143,Wonderful!,"Our second stay at the Corinthia was perfect. Our room had a view of the London Eye and the Shard yet was really quiet. Housekeeping was invisible,but impressive both in the morning and the evening. The staff in the Bassoon Bar remembered our choice of drinks. We were addressed by name in the Northall. Our meals in both restaurants were a wonderful experience. We will be back next year.",5,2014,11,27
143,Love London - Love the Corinthia,"My sister-in-law and I visit London every year for a little Christmas Shopping.  Each year we try a different hotel, however next year we will definitely be returning to the Corinthia.  From arrival to departure the service was impeccable.  

On the day of arrival we enjoyed a fabulous Champagne Afternoon Tea which was delicious.

Room absolutely immaculate, spacious and well appointed with wonderfully comfortable bed.  Wonderful bathroom, fantastic rain shower.  Every area of the hotel was absolutely spotlessly clean.  Every member of staff was attentive, polite and professional with a genuine smile.

Breakfast had a good selection, fruit was amazingly fresh particularly enjoyed the yoghurt topped with muesli.

We did not have the opportunity to use the Spa, however we have obviously missed a gem and will most definitely pay a visits during our stay next year.

We we're both very sad to leave and can't wait to return.

Thank you to all of the team.

Merry Christmas

143,The Northall,"Though not staying at the hotel,  I was recently taken to dinner as a guest, we were a group of five.  The food was certainly of a high standard, but the evening was utterly spoiled by the terrible service.  After mineral water was served there was an interminable wait for the wine list and a further long delay before the wine arrived.  No menus appeared and when one of our party got up from the table to ask someone if we could have some menus, she was peremptorily told "" I'm rather busy at the moment madam, I'll get someone to bring them over"" - extraordinary!
When we eventually gave our orders and were served the wine, on both occasions, the member of staff did not think to deal with the two ladies first, we very tactfully had to point this out.  
Two of us had desserts; big mistake, another lengthy delay.  Perhaps we were just unlucky, but at an establishment at this level with prices to match,that should never happen.",3,2014,11,26
143,Perfect 5 star hotel,"My fiancee and I stayed in the Corinthia for 2 nights in December 2014 shortly after we got engaged. We have both stayed at luxury hotels across the US (Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton, etc.), but neither one of us had stayed at a place like this...simply the nicest hotel we've ever been to. Fortunately, I was able to book the room through my former employer, who maintained a corporate rate at the hotel for clients/employees staying in London. Without this reduced rate, we likely would have never booked at the Corinthia, but having stayed there now, I would certainly pay the full rate next time I'm in London.

The common area decor (lobby, restaurant, bar, etc.) is stunning. The front-desk staff and concierge were amazing. Immediately upon arrival they offered to upgrade us to a nicer room, and the concierge gave us handwritten directions to navigate the underground across town both days we stayed there.

The room was incredible, with a very comfortable king sized bed (never seen one in Europe), high ceilings, wood floors, heated bathroom floor, huge tub with a flat screen TV at one end, and a waterfall shower...it even had a few North American outlets for those w/o a converter. We also used the gym on one of the days which was pretty big for a hotel.

Overall, just an incredible hotel. Definitely will be back.",5,2014,11,25
143,perfect,"This is the second time my wife and I have stayed at the Corinthian and it is simply amazing , the attention to detail in the hotel is truly 5 star plus , rooms are designed to a very high standard the public areas ,bars and restaurants a joy to visit , but most of all it is the staff which make this hotel what it is , very caring and professional from doormen to cleaners , I would like to single out the young lady who offered my wife a cushion and blanket in the open smoking area because it was cold . We can't wait to return",5,2014,11,24
143,First class stay,"Fantastic birthday treat as a gift from a member of the family who is a regular visitor. Stayed in standard room which was more than adequate. Breakfast superbe and champagne afternoon tea is a must and really good value. The spa is a must visit and wished we could have stayed longer since we were only in London for one night. Definitely will save up to return and spend more time in the spa. However, one downside was chaos at massimos restaurant so definitely avoid there are better restaurants elsewhere since in a perfect location.",5,2014,11,23
143,Amazing 5 star experience,"We recently stayed at the Corinthia Hotel which is a gorgeous building a few steps from the Embankment. Upon arrival at 5pm the helpful reception staff looked for an available double room, as we had booked. They very kindly gave us a double upgrade to an Executive suite which was on the 4th floor. The hotel is beautiful and the the decor, staff and service are very high quality. Our room was wonderfully furnished with walk-in wardrobe, spacious bathroom with bath and shower and large bedroom with king sized bed, chaise longue chair and table and chairs. The coffee machine and fruit were beneficial complimentary touches. 
We changed into our robes and slippers and took the 'Spa Lift' to the spa which is set on 4 floors. It's the most stunning spa I have been in and to be in central London is very impressive. The large jacuzzi, swimming pool, ice shower and sunken glass walled sauna (beautiful). 
We opted for the buffet breakfast in the Northall restaurant which gave plenty of options, from fruit and pastures to a range of cooked items. The staff were friendly, happy to help and we would recommend the hotel. You don't have to check-out until 12noon so enjoy the facilities whilst in London.",5,2014,11,23
143,beautiful hotel - still room for improvement,"beautiful hotel with lovely spacious rooms. the spa is probably the best one of any city hotel i have ever visited. great location. 

breakfast service was rather slow. i waited over an hour for my pancakes. also coffee service took too long. also some phone calls to reception remained unanswered or it took a long time for them to pick up.",4,2014,11,22
143,"If you want a room large enough to open your suitcase, do not stay here.","Stay a couple of months per year in London and decided to try the Corinthia this time given the positive reviews on this website. Had high expectations, but was extremely disappointed when I arrived.My room was a small box that just fitted the bed. I can't even poperly open my suitcase. Have stayed in many 5 star hotels in London and this is by far the smallest room I have ever experienced. Definitely not a great experience. Assume they have larger rooms as well, but if you don't want to end up in a room that can hardly fit your bed with no real windows, then I strongly advise staying somewhere else. London is full with great hotels. The bathroom is nice as is the breakfast in the morning. Bed is comfortable and Nespresso machine in the room is a great feature. Other than the ridiculously small rooms, it is a good standard hotel.",3,2014,11,22
143,Beautiful hotel first class service,"This hotel is pure luxury. Stayed for 2 nights in a suite. Loved every minute of the stay. The spa is a must visit. I absolutely love the decor in the spa, was so relaxing after a work out in the well equipped gym. The staff cannot do enough for you, amazing food on the I room ding menu and in the restaurant. Will definitely return",5,2014,11,21
143,Wonderful & Welcoming Stay,"My husband and I recently stayed for four nights at the Corinthia Hotel in London.  I had researched hotels to stay at through Tripadvisor and then booked our stay through my American Express card.  They had a very good offer and I was impressed with the rate I was given.  First, the location is wonderful.  There is a tube stop located directly across and you can easily walk to many attractions, shops and restaurants.  We stayed on the fourth floor overlooking the street.  At first, I was concerned there may be noise but they've added interior windows which did a great job of blocking any noise.  The room was a good size and was very clean and nicely decorated.  The king sized bed was very comfortable and had quality linens.  The bathroom was beautiful and both my husband and I absolutely loved the rain shower (the best water pressure of any hotel I've stayed at).  The floor was heated and the toilet facilities were separate from the rest of the bathroom.  There is also a flat screen TV installed in the wall above the bathtub.  Each day, they provide you with a newspaper of your choice which is placed on a table just outside your door. There is maid service during the day and turn down service at night where they provided a bottle of water for each guest by the bed along with a chocolate.  They also place your slippers by the side of the bed. They pay attention to detail in every way. They left a plug converter in our room in anticipation of our arrival which I thought was a nice touch.  What really impressed me was the friendly service from the staff.  For such a luxury hotel, they were very welcoming and warm.   It did not feel ""stuffy"" which is not what I want when relaxing on a holiday.  The food and drinks are a bit pricey but you receive quality and service for what you're paying.  The hotel is beautiful and I would recommend to anyone looking for a hotel in London.",5,2014,11,19
143,Luxury treatment,"Beautiful  interior (that you can see on photos) is just for background for the quality of service. A lot of small details that are totally priceless like: In the morning during breakfast room service make your bed for a day, in the evening they prepare it fot the night - brings a robe and slippers and chocolates. You can turn your big bathroom into provate SPA thanks to excellent cosmetics amd good music. For brekfast you can have organic energy drink, natural yogurt with fresh fruits or finest prosciutto crudo. 

The hotel is next door to the most beautiful major tourist attractions.",5,2014,11,17
143,Six Stars!,"This was my second stay at the Corintthia London in two years.
There is only one to describe this hotel: PERFECTION!

From the elegant common areas, the impeccable service and luxurious rooms, to the spa and thermal pools... everything is top notch.

Corinthia Hotel is the place to stay in London if you want the royal treatment.  

 Check my first Corinthia London review: ""Second to None"".",5,2014,11,16
143,Worth the Money,"We usually try and stay in small boutique hotels, but having had a great experience with the Corinthia brand in Budapest, we just had to stay in this one when we were in London. It's expensive (and that's an understatement!) but if you're looking for a top notch experience with plenty of luxury, then the Corinthia is well worth the investment. We had a lovely time here and would stay again.",5,2014,11,15
143,amazing,"what an amazing hotel,service is second to none,we saved up hard to afford just 1 night for my wife`s birthday and it was worth every penny.
Every member of staff we encounted was excellent beyond what you expect,i really can not find a fault with anything the room was perfect the service to the room was 1st class,breakfast was great best orange juice i have ever had must recommend the smoked fish as well.
The staff are just wonderfull it`s not just someone doing a job you can tell they care they want you to enjoy your stay,to be treated at this level for just 1 night makes going to work and saving hard for a treat worthwhile.
Also location is fantastic everything on the doorstep.
Please thank all your staff for giving us an amazing weekend.",5,2014,11,14
143,Faultless,"If you are lucky enough to be able to afford it, The Corinthia is close to faultless. I always try to stay here when in London - sometimes going out of my way to experience their understanding of service. Why can't all hotels be like this..",5,2014,11,12
143,Lovely London at it's best,"We stayed at Corinthia last December and loved it so much that we splurged with a repeat stay during our layover en route to Africa. A bit excessive perhaps, but the Corinthia is worth every penny (or pence). 

We went last December to see how the Brits do Christmas. Perhaps it's a bit cliché, but we love the film ""Love Actually.""  The Corinthia was decorated perfectly for the holiday season. They even had some carol singers, mulled wine, and roasted chestnuts one night.  Oh do we wish we could go back his December!

We had a champagne tea time one afternoon and it was glorious. We also had cocktails in Bassoon which made us feel glamorous. Perhaps our favorite, surprisingly, was their in room breakfast. Simple yet so delicious. It was a perfect start to every day. 

Our stay this September was equally splendid, though brief. The location is perfect so we could walk to some of the sights in the short time we had. With a quick walk over the millennium bridge we retuned to Ping Pong for for delightful dim sum. 

The service at the Corinthia is fantastic. Everyone is professional and friendly - never stuffy. Fancy at it's finest!  We can't wait to return for a three-peat!",5,2014,11,11
143,Great location and attentive service,"We wanted something very central within walking distance of everything - which this is. Also it's a tiny walk to the embankment tube station. The room was immense compared to anything else I've stayed in in London. Probably accounts for a big part of the ostentatious cost. The breakfast buffet was excellent. And the staff in general were very helpful and pleasant. They went out of their was to help solve problems we encountered on the trip right done to helping find a lost iPhone and change theatre tickets. The access to the awesome spa is also included and well worth a daily visit to use the gym ( Better equipped than average) sauna, hot tubs and so much more. ",5,2014,11,11
143,In.... yet far from the madding crowd,"Corinthia's central yet quiet location offers convenience and easy accessibility to restaurants, shopping and entertainment, with  the privacy you want when you most likely would appreciate some ... like after a day out amongst the madding crowds that throng the streets of London , regardless of time of year.
The hotel building is beautiful and the rooms are spacious, tastefully and well furnished. Service is great  - the concierge provided a great recommendation of a restaurant and helped with a last minute request for a reservation. On checking out a few days later, there was a mistake with the pick up arrangement (made by another party) and again, the concierge helped sort that out. Housekeeping is prompt and very thorough, and the public areas are spotless and well maintained. 
Would definitely like to return...",4,2014,11,11
143,Our fourth stay and outstanding each time.,"My wife and I recently stayed at our favorite hotel in London!   The hotel, food and service were outstanding.   The location is superb to visit different parts of London.   One of our friends who usually stays at the Ritz London, but stayed here this time, has the Corinthia as his favorite London hotel as well.   Well done!",5,2014,11,10
143,Everyone needs a night at the Corinthia,"This is quite simply the best hotel we have ever stayed in.  From the minute our taxi pulled up outside to the moment we got in the taxi back to the station the following day, we were made to feel as if we were really special guests.  The decor is outstanding and everywhere is clean and I mean really clean.  I even looked on the skirting boards in the corridor outside our room (not because I wanted to find fault but because I simply couldn't believe it), there wasn't a speck of dust to be found.  The staff are exceptional, well presented, well mannered and everything works like clockwork.  The rooms are unbelievable.  Under floor heating in the bathroom, what a luxury. A deep bath for a good soak, two sinks, a separate cubilce with wc and bidet and a separate shower cubicle with the option of an overhead rain shower or the traditional shower head - fantastic.  If you've looked at this hotel and are wondering whether to book, don't hesitate any further, what are you waiting for?  Go for it and be treated like royalty for a night (or two if you can afford it!).  We have promised ourselves a return visit next year.  Oh, by the way, the location is great too, right near Trafalgar Square, theatres, embankment etc.  Get booking and experience how the 'other half' live!",5,2014,11,10
143,When only the best will do!,"This is by far the best hotel I've ever stayed in ever! Pure opulence, friendly helpful happy staff & nothing is a drama. The facilities are fantastic & spa lounge is an experience in itself. if you are a normal everyday person & want to know how it feels to be treated like royalty- go to this Hotel it won't dissapoint!",5,2014,11,08
143,The BEST Service in all of London,From the moment you walk in the door of this hotel you are made to feel special. Every detail of your stay is planned with precision and staff are friendly and helpful in every way. The waiting staff actually look like they enjoy helping you and this is very rare in London. A great place to celbrity spot also. Try the gin in The Northall (all of them). 10/10,5,2014,11,07
143,Good vs Great,"I'm feeling compelled to write this while in the middle of a repeat stay at this hotel. I had stayed at Corinthia back in May and had a most wonderful experience - my regret then was having checked in really late and having barely enough time to sleep, much less check out the facilities, though I spent many minutes just pacing around the bathroom marvelling at the under-floor heating. 

I'd subsequently gushed endlessly to my work contacts about how great this hotel is, focusing primarily on the sheer size of the rooms and the aforementioned under-floor heating. A business trip now in November led to a repeat stay at this hotel, and I kept telling my work mates how awesome it will be. 

Upon check-in, I was given my key which unlocked a room that seemed to be an after-thought size-wise. (This would be the ""restricted view"" equivalent at a theatre.) It was a whole lot smaller than what I had remembered from my previous stay, and when I logged onto the hotel website to take a quick look, it became quite clear that this was a mis-represented product. The website indicates 345 square feet for the superior King (and helpfully has a scale map and some photos to show what one should expect). There is no way that room clocks in at 345 square feet. When the bellboy brought my trolley luggage to the room and asked where I would like him to put it, I asked him where he would usually put it in this room. He looked somewhat embarrassed as he pushed the luggage flush against the wall at the entrance to the bedroom, so that about a-third of the entrance was effectively blocked by the luggage. I wanted to ask him so what happens when I need to put this on a luggage rack and, you know, open my luggage, but that would have been mean, because there just would not have been a solution. 

I headed down to reception to ask if the hotel was fully occupied (it was not) and requested for a room change. I was then asked if I would like to upgrade to the next level of rooms for a fee. It did not dawn upon me right then to ask if accepting the sub-standard room I was given would thus entitle me to a partial refund of the good money I was paying to stay here for two nights, but that would have been funny. I declined to pay to upgrade myself, and requested for just a change, and was told that the room in question was not yet ready. Since I was about to head out for dinner, I asked to sort this all out when I returned. 

Fast forward a few hours and I did get a new room. Another bellboy helped bring my luggage over to the new one, and when I remarked how much smaller the other room was, he agreed. I also noted that the room had not been turned down (no chocolate treats for me tonight!). I then headed to the bathroom only to find that the under-floor heating was not working. A call to the reception led them to send an engineer up to take a look. He potted around for a few minutes, before declaring that the under-floor heating and the towel rack was not going to be working tonight, but would be fixed tomorrow, though I could turn up the heat in the bedroom (I'm not sure how this would help with the cold floors in the bathroom though). This story has yet to reach its conclusion, so we shall see what happens tomorrow - stay tuned. 

As a reader who has gotten this far, you might ask ""why are you making such a big fuss about under-floor heating?"". Sure, this remains one of the best London hotels I'd stayed at, but this is a hotel that prides itself on being highly-rated and a luxury option in a fantastic location. When you are competing at this echelon, it's the little things that differentiate good from great. People pay good money to stay here, for a certain type of product, and not just simply a bed to rest for the night. I liken this to an airline passenger travelling transcontinental on business class, only to be told his entertainment system isn't working and they've run out of food so he'll have to pick something from economy class - sure, it gets you to your destination all the same, but it isn't quite what you'd paid for.",3,2014,11,06
143,If James Bond had a favourite hotel in London it would probably be the Corinthia!,"You get a fair idea of all that the Corinthia could offer you during your stay purely from the reception lobby alone. Your eyes are immediately drawn to the magnificence of the enormous Baccarat Chandelier, demanding attention via all it illuminates. 

The minimalist reception does not mean less attention, more a feeling of discreet personal appreciation of guests in detail. We found during our stay recently the reception staff  were some of the most efficient  and conscientious we have ever encountered in London or anywhere in the world, also the most accommodating to special requests, like a later check out time.

The rooms reflect their designers as both arty and functional. Our club room had a small balcony overlooking the lobby lounge and the al fresco inner courtyard, which on passing gives a real sense of London past via the combined aromas of: the tea sommelier’s fresh brews combined with a now truly unique smell of old London past... fine cigars wafting through the courtyard. 

One small lack of attention to fine detail from housekeeping was a stained footstool and chaise longue at the foot of the bed.

Only one big niggle again... I don’t care if a chef has 1000 Michelin stars to their name, I only count those as truly eXtraordinary if they can produce a superb meal for anyone vegan! This is where most hotels let themselves and their guests who don’t eat animal produce down badly. No vegan only options for breakfast and honey was also sent up to the room showing little education of vegan requirements. Again, how difficult is it to have some vegan breakfast treats in the freezer as required or simply source from some of the finest vegetarian/vegan restaurants and cafes in the world,  many within a short distance when you know you have vegan guests staying.

We inquired if the kitchen could produce a vegan meal for us in the evening on our first night or recommend a local restaurant? Seems the kitchen couldn't so the concierge arranged a visit for us to a local restaurant which was a absolute disaster bar their attentive staff.  The restaurant was a depressing basement, more like an empty nightclub, the food was terrible and we found out the following day the hotel 'could' have booked us into one of many veg/vegan restaurants nearby. Lack of professional knowledge again we suspect, so easily remedied.

Overall a superb hotel reflecting expected standards from a top price range.",5,2014,11,06
143,Please let me move in....,"I chanced a lunch time check in as I was between business meetings, and they proficiently took my case and reassured me that when I returned later my key would be waiting.  And at 7pm... There it was.  My room was well stocked with everything you might need, although I couldn't find a kettle or work out how to get hot water from the Nespresso machine!

I ate alone in Massimo and I was very well looked after by my waiter, and enjoyed a delicious three courses with a wonderful glass of red.

In the morning I had an 80 minute massage in the most impressive spa I have ever been to (and I like a Spa..!).  I can honestly say it was the best massage ever, and I didn't want it to end, then I didn't want to leave.

Reluctantly I checked out and I was politely popped into a taxi to make my way home.

I will definitely stay again, and I cannot recommend this truly wonderful hotel more highly.

143,"Corinthia Hotel - Class, class and more class.","A two day stay in September 2014 was all that was needed to verify my wife's opinion that this is on elf the "" Classiest Hotels "" on the planet earth.

Situated in a quiet side street just enough to be away for the hustle of bustle of London.

A great welcome from the doormen and reception staff and a useful familiarisation tour of the hotel facilities.

Great room with all amenities expected, only downside that the lighting was a little dim.

The evening turn down service was the best I have ever experienced, immaculate and faultless , housekeeping deserve total recognition in for providing this very classy service.

Restaurant bars , really excellent, food quality to the highest of standards, great service and friendly bar staff.

This is a very well managed establishment, with great attention being paid to every detail of the hotels appearance , ambience and customer attentiveness. I even saw one ember of staff cleaning a stair carpet with a tooth brush !!

If you are staying in London , this has to be your number once choice, can't wait to stay again.",5,2014,11,04
143,The most Luxurious & Glamorous Hotel in London !!!,"Stayed here for a special occasion recently and it is without exception the most luxurious hotel in London. 

I have stayed at all of the other famous 5 star hotels in London and wanted something really special this time so picked The Corinthia.  

I was so impressed with the customer service from the initial contact with reservations on helping me choose the perfect room (which was the stunning Trafalgar Suite) and the five million questions I had, to the thoughtful extra touches they did to make my trip 'personal and special' and the attention to detail from 'every' single member of staff helped make a very special birthday celebration 'unforgettable' !!!

I am a self confessed Hotel Snob and make no apologies for wanting a 5 star service.  The Corinthia Hotel was absolutely perfect, and try as I might I can't fault it !!!

She is literally the diamond in Londons crown right now and other hotels in Central London need to up their game to keep up !

The decor is 'stunningly glamorous', customer service 'outstanding', restaurants 'Amazing', and the largest award winning Spa in London !!! A girls Heaven !!! 

I loved it so much I've invented a reason to back again in a few weeks ;)",5,2014,11,03
143,"Excellent hotel, cannot fault it","Excellent hotel, Spa is excellent, service second to none.  Small issue with Air Con in the room and the manager did all that he could to resolve ASAP.  Food in the Spa and North Hall very good.

I would visit again in a shot.",5,2014,11,03
143,Amazing hotel with 5 star service,"We stayed here for a weekend during August 2014 in an Executive King room, which was stylish and very spacious, with a large bathroom, hallway and bedroom.   The staff were very helpfu and professional. The great housekeeping service sorted out a minor problem in our room within hours of being notified and the evening turn down service was great. The concierge was also very helpful during our stay.

The hotel is beautiful, spotless and luxurious. The food was delicious and menu varied. Yes, it is a little pricey, but in this case you really get what you pay for, a top class hotel and facilities.  One of the best in London. Made our trip special and can't wait to return.",5,2014,11,02
143,Great hotel bar,Lovely hotel bar exception service great place to have afterwork drinks in the Charing Cross area if you want to avoid the large crowds and want a more civilised atmosphere. I regularly visit this bar after work with a colleague and find the courtyard to be an oasis of calm.  Always great attentive service particularly from one of the waiters (Joe Carter) who is exceptional in terms of customer service. ,5,2014,11,01
143,Perfection,"We stayed here back in July 2013 and loved the hotel so much we came back for my 30th birthday.

The Corinthia is, in our view, perfect. The hotel is stunning, everything is pristine and the staff are wonderful. The rooms are beautiful, in a very calming colour palette. Everything is of such a high quality. There was a lovely chocolate cake waiting for me in the room.

We managed to visit the spa this time, and it was just wonderful. By far the very best hotel spa I have been to, it was an absolute delight. I could easily have spent a few hours there, the sauna and steam rooms are both beautiful and the thermal pool is wonderful. I just wish we had longer to enjoy it.

If Tripadvisor allowed us to rate out of 10, the Corinthia would be a 10...there are other hotels that I have awarded 5/5 that are not a patch on the Corinthia. The staff make you feel that you are the most important guest there, and that is something to be treasured.

Thank you for a wonderful birthday stay.",5,2014,10,28
143,The Corinthia Hotel’s Bassoon Bar.,"Perfect for early evening meetings before it gets busy, the Bassoon Bar in the Corinthia Hotel offers Art Deco style with smooth service. The barman was accomplished, nothing was too much trouble and the “nibbles” that accompanied the perfect dry martinis were delicious. All in all a real find and a delightfully cool haven away from Trafalgar Square and the Embankment.",5,2014,10,28
143,Exceptional luxury hotel,"Can't fault the service we received, from start to finish the staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was a deluxe double room and very large and luxurious, lovely touches of slippers and chocolates by the bed when we returned from an evening out. The hotel is spotlessly clean, breakfast was amazing, so much choice and all freshly cooked and fresh ingredients. Also walking distance from everywhere we needed to go. Overall lovely hotel and would stay again, only thing that was annoying was that the lifts take forever!! ",5,2014,10,28
143,A beautiful hotel with amazing service,"A beautiful room, cleaned and tidied more than once a day. I particularly liked the button to let staff know you were leaving and they could 'make up' the room. Chocolates on our pillows were delicious! The bath was amazing and the shower was unbelievable! The flies in the bathroom were heated which was so luxurious! Every member if staff were so genuinely nice and couldn't do enough for you. The room was beautiful but quite small considering the price. The hall entrance and bathroom made up for this though. The wardrobe space was perfect. An iron and board would have been appreciated but I'm pretty sure they would have bought us one up if we had asked. Dressing gowns and slippers were lovely! The location was perfect... So close to so many attractions! I loved my stay :)",5,2014,10,25
143,Five star luxury,"Not much to say that hasnt been said already- the hotel is exceptional- the staff were very helpful, letting me leave my bag at reception and use the spa before we had even checked in. The best of both worlds, with a clean modern feel, but classic chic luxury. Suite was beautiful- lots of bells and whistles, huge marble bathroom, gorgeous. Cant wait to return.",5,2014,10,23
143,Exceptional Hotel,"Everything about our stay at the Corithia was perfect.  When you walk in and utter, ""Wow"", you know you have picked the right hotel.  We were able to check into one of the rooms early, before noon.  I booked standard rooms since we were here for a short visit.  The rooms were outstanding.  We stayed at the Royal Horseguards a few years ago, which is directly across the street, and it cannot compare to the Conrinthia.  I paid to upgrade at that hotel just to get into a room that was not nearly as nice as the standard rooms at the Corinthia.  We love this area of London.  You can walk to so many places.  Right around the corner is Trafalgar Square, then on to Westminster, Parliament, Ministry of Defense, Big Ben ,the Horse Guards Parade.  A major tube station is right across the street.  The Sherlock Holmes pub is right across the street.  London Eye is across the bridge over the Thames.  This beautiful hotel has wonderful restaurants and a fabulous bar.  You can enjoy traditional English tea service in the afternoon.  The hotel is very chic, but you don't feel under-dressed in casual attire. There are all types of people and all types of attire in the lobbies.  They have the top rated spa in London, but sadly we did not have time to enjoy it.  The beds were super comfortable and the tub and shower were so roomy.  Enjoyed the tv while soaking in the tub.  The rooms have mood lighting and a a charging area that has all of the plugins from around the globe.  Mini bar with nespresso and tea are also in the room.  Large walk in wardrobe.  One of our rooms had a bidet. Everything was spotless and very nicely decorated.  We cannot wait to return to London and will not hesitate to stay here.",5,2014,10,22
143,The Perfect 40th Birthday Celebration,"My husband and I both turned 40 this year and decided to start our amazing European celebration vacation at the Corinthia London for 3 nights.  It was suggested by a friend who lives there and loves it.  For 3 weeks before our visit I was emailing back and forth with Max (who is amazing!!) at the concierge desk to give me some recommendations and make reservations.  His responses were witty and prompt.  Upon arrival, the hotel itself is truly breathtaking.  From the moment the doors opened, we felt the amazing level of service this hotel provides.  We had a special birthday treat in the room when we checked in, what a fun surprise.  Dinner at Mossimo the first night was phenomenal.  Perfectly crafted cocktails at the bar first and then a delicious dinner with amazing flavors!  Breakfasts, cocktails and snacks throughout our visit in The Northall....superb.  This hotel is in the perfect location also!  Cannot rave enough about this hotel!!!!  Thank you Corinthia for a wonderful celebration!!",5,2014,10,22
143,My Wife's Special Birthday,"This was my wife's birthday treat and we spent two nights at the Corinthia and everything was excellent.  I had told them it was for a special occasion and  we had been upgraded to a better suite so there were fresh flowers and fruit in our room each day, and on the actual day of her birthday a very rich chocolate cake with a hand written birthday card!  The Bassoon Bar was a great experience with a pianist and singer on both nights, and an impressive range of cocktails and snacks.  From the hotel it was short walk to everywhere, on the first night we walked to the Globe Theatre and when we returned to the hotel still had time for a late night drink in the bar.  The breakfasts in the Northall restaurant were equally impressive with a wide range of foods, juices and fruit!  The rooms were spacious and well fitted out with sufficient storage space and places to sit to relax after a hard day of sightseeing.  And the bathroom was splendid with a wide range of products to use, a separate shower cubicle and of course a television to watch while soaking in a warm bubble bath.  Overall experience was fantastic, not cheap but worth every penny!",5,2014,10,22
143,Wonderful Hotel,"This is a beautiful hotel, with a great location. There is easy walking access to Waterloo Station, the Tube, the Thames, London Eye or Trafalgor Square. Lots of restaurants in the area. Rooms are generous in size, very clean and the bathrooms are spacious with wonderful rain shower heads. All the staff we encountered were polite and friendly. Large breakfast buffet or choice of menu in the am. Comfortable lounge for evening drinks and snacks, a couple of restaurants in the hotel itself.",5,2014,10,21
143,Like a fairy tale,"My boyfriend and I stayed 5 nights here and there really is only one way to explain this hotel. It's like living in a fairy tale. Every detail of our stay was amazing! The hotel is breathtakingly beautiful. The bed so comfortable I didn't want to get out of it... unless it was to relax in the rainfall like shower. EVERY staff member we encountered greeted us with a smile. Housekeeping (immaculately clean room but never saw them), room service (quick and delicious), and breakfast in Northhall (unforgettably delicious and with so many options we stuffed ourselves to the point we often skipped breakfast) was perfect. Even the ice cubes were perfect! Large, perfectly square, crystal clear. 

As others have mentioned it is within walking distance of many landmarks and 2 tube stations which we used quite a bit. 

I truly can't speak highly enough of the Corinthia and their staff. Of course it is expensive but well worth every penny. I have stayed in equally expensive hotels and not recieved the same experience. Ever. You must stay here!",5,2014,10,21
143,Supurb,"My wife and I stayed at the Corinthia for 2 nights for our anniversary and the hotel was nothing short of supurb. From the moment we arrived we were looked after by the exceptional attentive staff. We were lucky enough to have our room upgraded to an Executive Room which had the most amazing bathroom. The amenities in the room and bathroom are great with excellent attention to detail.
We ate at the bar in the on the first night, the surroundings were relaxed with excellent food and wine. We then had drinks in the elegant Basoon bar which had live music. As this was our first weekend away from the kids in 3 years it was just delightful.
We used the spa on Saturday morning and had massages, again, supurb. The spa is one of the best that I ahve been to in the world and is over 4 floors in the hotel.

If you get the chance, stay at this hotel! We only live 30 miles away and would love to be back soon.",5,2014,10,21
143,Excellent Stay,My husband was in London on business and for the week we stayed at the hotel were the mtgs were taking place. For the weekend we wanted to stay somewhere special and the Stay here was fabulous. The room was wonderful it had all of the wonderful amenities that you would have expect from a high end property. The staff was very customer focused and very friendly. I would highly recommend staying here.   Although it is on the high end it was worth it.  The breakfast was very good as well. Look forward to coming back and staying there again.,5,2014,10,20
143,5 star stay,This is a late review for our stay in Nov 2013. We were at the end of our 6 week tour of the UK and I wanted somewhere special for my husbands 50th birthday and our wedding anniversary. I was lucky to book when they had a special for 50% off and we were even upgraded on arrival without asking. There was a chocolate mudcake in the room for my husband. It is less than a 5 minute walk to Trafalgar Square and the tube stop. This hotel deserves its rating and I would recommend for that special occassion.,5,2014,10,19
143,An amazing time in London and all thanks to the Corinthia!!!,"What a fantastic experience. My husband and I stayed one night at the Corinthia as part of a birthday treat and it really was a treat.  

The hotel's decor is elegant and stylish with a fresh modern feel.  Each member of staff were extremely helpful, friendly and welcoming making us feel instantly relaxed. 

The Buffet Breakfast was beautiful, just wished I could have fitted more in....it was so good!  Lunch was equally delicious; I had the Fillet Steak Sandwich which was easily the best sandwich I have ever eaten and worth every penny of the £25.

Dinner however was slightly disappointing! We booked a table at the hotel's Northall Restaurant.  There was nothing actually wrong with anything we had and the service was great BUT the dishes were very expensive and I did expect a little more from a restaurant in a 5 star hotel. I wanted to be wowed by it (as I was with breakfast and lunch) but I just wasn't.

If you're not watching the pennies and need a real treat I strongly recommend the Corinthia. We will most definitely be going back.",5,2014,10,18
143,Best in London,"Not cheap but the Corinthia remains the premier hotel in London. Clean and classy with the most stunning spa , I have stayed 3 times in last year and the service remains faultless.
It's only when you go to other equally expensive 5 star hotels in London that you realise how good the Corinthia is.
 Business or spoiling the other half-this is currently the only place I choose.",5,2014,10,17
143,AMAZING!,"This was my first stay at the Corinthia and I don't know if  I'll ever stay at another hotel here in the UK. It is absolutely amazing in every way from
The service, to the room decor and the location. This hotel made my business trip a truly pleasurable experience and I will definitely be staying here again! ",5,2014,10,16
143,True luxury in central London,"My recent stay at the Corinthia was one of the nicest stays I had in a while.

The place is faultless.

Stunning warm interriors, super clean bright rooms (with a nice smell), fast reacting air-conditioning and huge bathrooms with heated floor. They obviously thought of every little detail here and the staff are supper professional and friendly.

These are just the few highlights I can think of. The list goes on.

I would recommend this place to everyone who can spend the extra pound or two.

",5,2014,10,15
143,Pre-theatre dinner,"We made our first visit to this hotel's restaurtant after searching online for somewhere in the neighbourhood. We really fell on our feet and had a wonderful experience. The ambience and staff were fantastic, the food from a set menu was great and the service was prompt yet not rushed. It couldn't have been a better pre-theatre experience. Will visit again.",4,2014,10,15
143,Serene and superb,"Perfectly located for guests who want to walk to  theater and other top sights in central london.  Sleek contemporary design in rooms is  frankly a relief after so much history everywhere. Spotless and luxurious, with  non-intrusive housekeeping. Concierge services are the best I have experienced. Breakfast buffet is outstanding. Cannot find fault with any aspect. Looking forward to returning.",5,2014,10,14
143,Magnigicent!,"Stayed for three nights in a king room early October. Was amazed at the standard overall of the hotel, the decor, and the quality of the room and furnishings. Room reminded me of those in the Peninsula Tokyo, which are unforgettable! Breakfast in the restaurant each morning was excellent, concierge did an excellent job arranging a rental car for me. Staff were efficient and very polite.
Location was excellent, near to the river, and close to Trafalgar Square. Excellent wifi included.",5,2014,10,14
143,Luxury in London,"I joined my husband for a business trip to London recently and we stayed at the Corinthia.  What a pleasure! It's an ideal location located near many of London's sights.  I enjoyed running past Buckingham Palace and into Hyde Park during my stay. The staff are very accommodating and are anxious to meet your every need. 
The room was large and luxurious, with a walk-in closet and a heated floor in the bathroom.  The beautiful lobby is an excellent place to enjoy afternoon tea. There's also a great little bar in the hotel which we stopped in a few times and enjoyed an after dinner drink. It's certainly a splurge but I would definitely recommend the Corinthia as your home base in the beautiful city of London!",5,2014,10,12
143,Splendid hotel but housekeeping just walked into my room twice!,"Overall I was impressed with the hotel but sadly I cannot give it a good rating. Check in staff were friendly and smiley, and, because it was my birthday I got a room upgrade. The room was beautifully furnished and there was a little birthday cake waiting for me - thank you for that. 

However what really upset me was that twice housekeeping just walked into my room without knocking! The first time it was a man and I was just about to get in the bath - thank God I still had my dressing gown on. He started to chat about housekeeping turning my bed into a double bed - I didn't know whether to scream at him to get out or chat back! I then dithered about wondering whether or not to have my bath as I did not want this man just letting himself into my room again.Then to add insult to injury when they did come to change my bed - they just let themselves in again! At least this time it was 2 women but it completely ruined the whole experience for me.

This was my birthday treat to myself and I paid an obscene amount of money to stay here - not good.",2,2014,10,10
143,"Well, well! Finally a 5* hotel in london that can go toe to toe with Asia","Having been unable to check into an increasingly oversubscribed South Place hotel this business trip I checked into the Corinthia.
Its expensive yes, very expensive. However this is the first London hotel I have every stayed in where the rooms compare with The Four seasons in HK or the Peninsula in Tokyo or Shanghai.

Firstly the bed is first class. Fantastic and very comfortable. The rooms are around 35sqm for the most basic and very well thought out. The bathrooms have a separate shower in all rooms and the shower is the best I have seen in terms of the rain forest head. Its a bit inconvenient for those that want to run the shower to heat before stepping in but this it the first London hotel I have been at where the basic rooms have a separate shower and it makes all the difference.

The minibar is good and the room service tasty but the best thing is the service. It is exceptional in terms of what they do. They took my laundry in and fixed a nasty tear in my trousers with minimal input from me. They are super fast and competent.

The only thing I didn't like is the lifts that are too slow for even a 7 floor hotel. 

So overall its superb but it IS expensive - the business rate for my company was good value but the rack rate is not at all. However if you need the best hotel in London this is pretty much it.",5,2014,10,10
143,"If you can afford it, stay here...","Only in London for one night so didn't sample anything other than the bar, bed and breakfast. 
This hotel is beautifully grand and classically British. Standards are superb, of the highest quality as are the staff. Although for the prices they charge you would expect no less.  Our room was one of the 'less expensive' and quite small but beautifully furnished (my only gripe, no dressing table! Please designers, think of the ladies!) also a lovely, huge bathroom. The cocktail bar was intimate and comfortable with relaxed atmosphere. Cocktails, although pricy were fabulous.  
Great selection for breakfast and a perfect cup of tea! 
Situated in Whitehall, very handy for all things military and touristy and surrounded by stunning buildings. Also fairly quiet area for London.",5,2014,10,09
143,Very nice place,"Great rooms stunning swimming pool and spa facility greatly located and service is brilliant, the restaurants are brilliant and there is even an harrods shop in the hotel, we loved our stay there and wil use again",5,2014,10,08
143,Excellent experience,"My partner and I stayed at the Corinthia hotel for two nights after making a booking through Booking.com to celebrate my partners 40th birthday. I had booked an Executive King room which was not ready when we arrived at 11am (check-in is 15.00) but we were told it could be made available in 1hr. We declined the nice offer, left our luggage, and went off around London, returning at 15.30. 
The room, 101, was ready with our luggage in on our return and what a room it was! We had a view of the street next to the hotel and of the hotel, The Royal Horseguards, opposite. The bedroom was tastefully decorated with an excellent mix of modern gadgets and a homely feel with the quality wood furniture. The wardrobe was a walk-in type, the bathroom was marble, with a shower wet-room, separate toilet and bidet, and a bath with a T.V. There were loads of bath amenities. The main T.V. had over 70 channels (you could purchase a film to watch as well but they were priced at £19 – which even by London standards is a bit of a joke!) and a Nespresso machine was in the corner. The whole area was spotlessly clean and all rooms had an interesting lighting arrangement with different controls for night lights and mood lighting. The air-con was very quiet and worked very well.
We chose not to eat in the two restaurants or book breakfast and order room service as, like the mini bar with snacks in our room, it was too expensive. We did, however, eat in the spa café as part of our spa day stay and if the food here is like the main restaurants, it is excellent and very tasty but expensive!  
The Spa
If you visit this hotel you must use the spa. It is amazing and free if you are staying in the hotel. My partner had a fantastic spa day and we both used the Thermal floor and, as mentioned, had food in the Café. In fact, she enjoyed the floor so much; we went back down the following day before checking out. The floor contains from left to right, a steam room with peppermint aroma; next to the infinity swimming pool with reflective ceiling, then the Ice Fountain for the brave or foolish after the Sauna, the Sauna which is glass for a full 360 view, the Jacuzzi pool with four different jets and finally three heated marble loungers to relax on. In between are two atmospheric gas lights which highlight the black marble effect of the whole spa. All the staff we spoke to were friendly and helpful especially the first girl who showed us around, we didn't catch here name but she shared the same birthday at my partner and was taking five days off, and Rebecca who did the spa treatments.
Overall, the hotel was very clean and tidy with professional and friendly staff.",5,2014,10,07
143,Fantastic second stay at the Corinthia London,"Second time back to the Corinthia London. 

Love everything about this place. 

Great service, great location, great dining choices, true five star quality throughout. 

Can't wait to get back. 

Don't hesitate to book this hotel. It's a gem!

143,very nice style,"Excellent customer service,very nice atmosphere.t is not a typical Classic Hotel but really modern look.really nice the restaurant atmosphere and also amazing lobby.
Rooms very comfortable and really stylish",5,2014,10,06
143,5 star quality!,Beautiful surroundings!  VERY attentive staff! I was able to be seated having 45mins free before my show started @ the Playhouse Theatre across the street! Strong pot of English breakfast tea just how I like it & melt in your mouth scones with delicious preserves & clotted cream! Will certainly spread the word on the quality of service & food! Smiling @ the thought of my experience!  Thanks from a VERY happy customer! ,5,2014,10,06
143,Amazing,My girlfriend brought me here for 2 nights as a present for my 18th birthday. I had never been before but she told me it was amazing and it certainly was. Arrived to find out we had been upgraded for no extra costs and got shown around the hotel. The room was huge and had the comfiest bed and even a TV in the bath. Throughout the whole visit the staff were amazing. We had breakfast included and that again was amazing. It is very classy and everyone that works there is polite and very helpful. This hotel really made my 18th memorable. I highly recommend this hotel.,5,2014,10,05
143,Perfect,"I recently stayed at the Corinthia with a friend and I cannot fault the experience at all. 

The Room - We stayed in the Executive Suite which was incredible. A massive room with two (almost double-sized) beds - very comfortable. My favourite aspect was definitely the bath with a TV installed so you can watch as you relax in the bath! There was a small balcony as well which was nice. Fruit was provided for free and bottles of Hildon water are given before bedtime (along with a nice chocolate!). There is a great Nespresso machine in the room along with coffee capsules which they replenish on request (for the Nespresso fans, the capsules provided are Arpeggio, Decaffeinato and Fortissio Lungo). They also supply lovely body lotion, shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and bath salts. Shower caps, nail files, combs, q-tips, cotton pads, loofahs and dental kits are also provided free of charge. There is free wifi available, however it was quite slow in our room.

The service -  Exceptional. The staff are always happy to help and the room service was especially impressive. Many of the food options on the menu are rather over-expensive (Pizza £20), but I guess it is expected. 

The spa - This was a lovely treat!  We had forgotten to bring our swimwear but spa guests are able to buy £10 disposable ones from the spa reception. I would recommend bringing your own as they are quite hideous and ill-fitting! The use of spa facilities was completely free for hotel guests, including the pool, the hydro-pool and the sauna. They provide you with robes, towels and slippers. I definitely recommend making use of the spa during your stay.

Breakfast - Unfortunately, I was not hungry at all when we went for breakfast, however there was a lot of choice, hot and cold options and many different drinks.

Overall, I had an incredible experience here. I would recommend this hotel to everyone!",5,2014,10,05
143,Great place,Nice hotel with perfect location. Staff was professional an friendly. The spa is ellegant and offers a full range of services.  Afternoon tea can complete with Londons best. Definitely comming back soon.,5,2014,10,04
143,Fabulous,"I stayed here with my wife and my 5 months old boy for two weeks last August. We came in with high expectations and this place certainly met (and at times surpassed) our expectations.

A luxurious property in a central location. The staff hold themselves to exemplary and flawless standard of service.  The breakfast at Corinthia offers a great way to launch into the day (good food selection, courteous staff and bright place). The lobby is always teeming with concierge staff (not 1,2 or 3, literarily many) eager to help and guide. The housekeeping staff were always able to work around our erratic schedule and took care of our room while we were out exploring.

This place is fabulous. ",5,2014,10,04
143,First Class Establishment,"Stayed here with my wife for 3 nights. Superb experience on every level. Rooms are spacious and luxurious. Service by all staff was amazing but a special thank you to the staff at Massimo Restaurant who were exceptional. Massimo restaurant is one of London's finest. Beautiful setting and stunning food. 
Save up and treat yourself to a wonderful London experience.",5,2014,10,03
143,Perfect Place,"Third visit and it has won our heart.  Beautiful suites, beautiful common space, great receiption, Max, the concierge we worked with was outstandding.  The spa is stunning and the manicures great.  The only weakness is its third rate fitness area where few of the equipment televisions work and no on cleans the equipment after use.  The hotel is so special in every other way.  The manager is apparently not into exercise.",5,2014,10,03
143,WOW,"Awesome location, the service was something I dream about in a fairy tale where everything is perfectly, perfect, for my soldiers & eggs, to having Sherlock Holmes Pub across the road, to the spa, wonderland!",5,2014,10,02
143,Second time and won't be last!,"Another fab stay here. Went for the spa Monday break and I am still speechless about how wonderful the spa is! Wow wow !!!
One thing which might be useful is to have a sign up where the beds are by the vitality pool to say no noise?!!
I was trying to chill but the people next to me would not stop talking!! Just an idea. Or have a quiet zone?
Anyway lovely stay but the lunch in Lobby lounge took a while. 45 minutes for club sandwich?!
Will be back though!",4,2014,10,02
143,"Exceptional, Extraordinary, Expensive","Pure indulgence at its best. My wife and I had 3 days at this fantastic hotel on the first leg of our European vacation. We had a beautiful king room overlooking Whitehall Place which was tastefully furnished and very comfortable. Being in the heart of central London, it has every thing you could want it its fingertips. The staff were very welcoming and we got the feeling it wasn't a snobbish hotel given its quality and cost. We had a lovely evening in the Bassoon Bar which we thoroughly enjoyed. We would love to visit the Corinthia Hotel again.",5,2014,10,01
143,Short stay quality,"The staff were always friendly and the service was excellent.
Spa was fantastic, great facilities with professional staff.
Rates are quite high and are the only reason I would give a ""very good"" rating as opposed to ""excellent"".",4,2014,10,01
143,ideal if you can afford it,"wonderful location next to downing street and many london attractions.
 wonderful service. big comfortable and silent room with a comfortable bed and all needed facillities.  good breakfast. who can ask for more. ",5,2014,10,01
143,Can't get better than this!,"We just returned from an eight night stay at the Corinthia in London. The hotel and staff exceeded our expectations in every way. The accommodations, the restaurants, the beauty of the hotel and lobby and the superb staff made this visit very memorable for us and assured that we will return again. Additionally, the location can't be beat for our interests in museums, parks, etc. A special call out goes to Neal and Flower (work in lobby area) for their attention and for their excellent service during our entire stay! This is definitely a ""keeper""!",5,2014,09,30
143,Beautiful!!,Stopped in for afternoon tea and was just mind blown! Beautiful setup and dining area for the tea/lunch. Service is spectacular and the many sandwiches and desserts are delicious! A bit pricey but well worth it at the end for such a wonderful experience in London. ,5,2014,09,29
143,Lovely hotel...,"Have had the fortune to visit the hotel several times and been able to have a look at a selection of the rooms on offer.
The branded suites are fantastic, certainly one for all tastes with amazing views too.
During my most recent visit, I had afternoon tea in the 'lobby lounge' area which was very good - the selection of teas (with its own menu) was vast and the sandwiches and cakes on offer were of a good quality.
A lovely, warm hotel - good atmosphere, decent decor and well designed...would definitely recommend a stay here.",5,2014,09,29
143,A truly exceptional experience!,"My girlfriend and I celebrated our anniversary weekend at the Corinthia London. 

Our experience at the Corinthia was outstanding and I would like to address special thanks to the Guest Relations team for their great work! Upon check-in we received a complimentary upgrade from a Superior Room to a Deluxe Room. Check-in was quick and very efficient. One of the team members showed us the hotel facilities and then guided us to our room. Once again very friendly and professional. After an introduction to the in-room services and different lighting options, we could explore everything by ourselves. The room was lovely, we really liked the interior design, warm colors, high-quality products and the huge bathroom (bath tube with TV, walk-in rain forest shower).

A true highlight was the lovely cake surprise on our dining table plus a hand written congratulations card. We felt so spoiled! The first impressions of the Corinthia could't be better!

We stayed for two nights on the weekend and therefore also wanted to try out the hotel's own spa (ESPA). I have to say it's one of the best spas I have ever visited - and I have been in many luxurious spas all around the world! The thermal floor is free for hotel guests and you will find everything you need - steam room (works absolutely perfect - hotels often underestimate how hard it is to install a proper one), sauna, swimming pool, relax areas and even a jacuzzi pool. The design is amazing. We used the spa a couple of times and I have to say it is added value to the hotel stay.

We also tried out room-service (dinner and breakfast) and the quality of food was always very good.  The Corinthia's fish and chips come are among the best I have ever had! Only issue was that someone must have forgotten the butter for our breakfast delivery. This problem was solved quickly after a phone call. The butter was brought up to our room within 5 minutes.

Another exceptional surprise was that the hotel was in touch with the restaurant manager of Berners Tavern (romantic restaurant in London). We had a reservation for Saturday evening and it was all great! We have been surprised by a complimentary dessert and the congratulations of the staff members.

The Corinthia did fantastic work during our stay. Service and the great facilities make a difference! We felt like royals and enjoyed our stay to the fullest! We already have plans to return to the Corinthia in December 2014.",5,2014,09,29
143,Splendid in every way!,"We travel to London many, many times a year. We are always looking for the right balance of value, luxury, amenities, and service. This was our first stay and now it will be hard to choose other hotels in the future. The staff are impeccable. We stayed in the smallest room offered, and it was fine. Bathroom was divine and my husband commented that it's the best water pressure of any hotel we have teri in London. The spa is elegant and offers a full range of services. The exercise facilities are top notch and were hardly being used when we were there. Breakfast offers every food imaginable. Afternoon tea can compete with London's best. The location is close to the Thames. A true gem. We can't wait to return!!",5,2014,09,28
143,Must Stay,"A beautiful hotel and elegant experience. Enjoyed tea by the fire each night in the lobby. Great location, close to tourist spots but not on the main strip -- which I prefer.

Pros: nice amenities, concierge was helpful with recommendations

Cons: room was small and space was tight, but still a nice room

Bonus: Manchester United stayed while we were there which made for fun elevator run-ins ",5,2014,09,27
143,Excellent stay,Although I was only staying here for one night on a business trip I would not hesitate in going back. Service and staff were excellent and the hotel is generally of a very high standard as you would expect. The room was particularly well appointed with an enormous bathroom. Excellent location for visiting anywhere around Westminster and the south bank.,5,2014,09,27
143,Value for money,First time at the Corinthia and was not disappointed.The staff were very polite and the room (741) well appointed and clean.We have paid a lot more for rooms in London and got a lot less.Would certainly come back and stay again.,5,2014,09,25
143,Beautiful,"outstanding hotel. My room was very large with equally large bath with separate shower and tub, heated tile floor. Spotless and well appointed with quality soaps and shampoo. King size bed with fine linens. Large closet and good media access. Free wifi too although a little slow. Great spot near Big Ben. ",5,2014,09,24
143,Beautiful Hotel in great location.,"Lovely hotel with very friendly staff, I found the spa reception staff not the warmest and could be more helpful. The hotel and its furniture, art and decor in general are fabulous with no expense spared. Our suite was lovely with a very comfortable bed and the best power shower I have ever
experienced. We found the hotel  expensive for food and beverages with a small cappuccino including service costing a whopping £6.15.
We think this is expensive but please feel free to make your own mind up!!!.
I would recommend this hotel for location but be warned it was very noticeable that the two bars, the lounge area and the two restaurants very quiet throughout our visit which did not help
with the atmosphere within the hotel.  I wonder why???.",4,2014,09,24
143,Great hotel and fabulous location,"This was a lovely find near Embankment and Whitehall. The hotel is beautifully laid out and quiet for an inner city hotel. We had a room on the first floor which looked out on to an inner courtyard. The beds were very comfortable and the room was beautifully appointed with a fabulous bathroom and separate dressing room. Morning tea and coffee was complimentary and the breakfast was fantastic. The location  and setting very is hard to beat. Around 400m south of Trafalgar square on the bank of the Thames. When we were there it was easy to walk everywhere including Harrods, St Paul's, Tate Modern and Buckingham Palace. The staff were lovely but the hotel bar is very expensive indeed. The main reason for the 4 rather than 5 stars is the WiFi which was very poor. Still, the rest was great and thanks to The Corinthia",4,2014,09,23
143,Beautiful Hotel and Spa,"I stayed here with my sister for my hen night. A mild affair that started with a visit to the hotel spa (dark and cosy) and ended with a drink in the bar after midnight (dark and cosy) spot the theme here.  Our room was large and exceptionally well designed and appointed, I loved the tv in the bathroom.  The hotel staff couldn't have been more helpful and breakfast was stunning.  Highly recommended if your budget allows.",4,2014,09,23
143,The best hotel in Europe,"I love the Corinthia. And everybody I knows loves it too. It has beautiful rooms, the beds are very comfortable and the pillows are soft as marshmallows. The food for in-room-dining is also amazing. 
For breakfast I would recommend getting out of the room as the breakfast is a great selection. Otherwise the in-room-breakfast is also great if you want to spend more time in your room. ;-) 
If you get a room with a bath you can also watch tv whilst taking a bath. It's pretty awesome. The shower has a rain shower option. You get a bathrobe in each room with very comfortable slippers (must take home). Also the soap and the shower gel are good enough to leave your own stuff home. The flower decoration in the Corinthia is very special. They always have the most beautiful arrangements. Well, just treat yourself and book the Corinthia. It's the best hotel in Europe (and I have stayed in many 5 star hotels as a comparison). ;-)",5,2014,09,22
143,Fantastic hotel in the heart of London,"We stayed here last week in an Executive room (approx. 50sqm). Nice hallway and walk-in robe, very spacious bedroom and bathroom with separate toilet and shower. The room was absolutely gorgeous, high quality and pleasant neutral décor. There was nothing to fault. My toddlers were given baby amenities and toy gifts, quite a nice touch by the reservations staff. The hotel is quite large and at times impersonal. We found the check-in staff a touch 'cold' without being rude. Having said that the rest of the service during our stay was friendly and impeccable. The room was a touch pricey ($1150 per night, which I believe is high for a non-suite room for Australian standards) however it was worth it. The location was fabulous, walking distance to just about everything and the rooms were totally welcoming, spacious and comfortable. I would highly recommend this hotel and would most definitely stay here again when I visit London.
I do wish to touch on one unfortunate experience upon check-in that could have been handled a lot better. We arrived after a long flight with 2yr old twins and were informed that our room wouldn't be ready for 20mins. No big deal, so we went to the restaurant to have lunch, we were exhausted and hungry. When we returned 45mins later our room was still not ready, it would take another 20 minutes of waiting. I found it interesting that none of the check-in staff showed us to a comfortable waiting area (given that one of twins was asleep in my arms the entire wait), offered us a drink or at least a snack for the kids. We made no fuss, these things happen, but a small gesture by hotel staff in such a situation can mean a lot to exhausted guests.",5,2014,09,19
143,My favourite Hotel in the world,Our second stay at the Corinthia recently and it never disappoints. Fantastic hotel. Great cocktails and the best spa of any hotel we've stayed in. Will return for sure. Staff really friendly and polite. Fantastic hotel. Mr J Dennis,5,2014,09,18
143,Loved it!  Already Booked Our Next Stay!,"We have tried various hotels in London over the years (see my other reviews) but after our recent stay at the Corinthia, we have a new favorite - hands down.  This one just works for us.

Due to flight times, we had a 1-night stop in London at the end of August and decided to give the Corinthia a try and are so happy that we did.  Our only disappointment was that we only had one night and couldn't try more of the amenities.

We booked a deluxe king so that we would have a bit more room.  Granted, the room was not huge but it was so well laid out and so wonderful that we loved it.  Our room overlooked the inner courtyard and, as others have noted, was incredibly quiet.  The view of the hotel's interior dome is also pretty cool.

The entry led into a small walk-in closet which was perfect.  To the left was the bedroom which included a small table with chairs, mini bar, etc.  To the right was the bath which, again, was not huge but well laid out with two sinks, separate tub and shower - my hubby particularly liked the lights in the shower.

During our trip we stayed at two other 5-star hotels, both of which were fabulous.  But the Corinthia had the most comfortable bed and the best shower.

Our rate included breakfast which was excellent.

For such a short stay, the Corinthia made quite an impression.  We only returned a few days ago and I have already booked our next stay between Christmas and New Years and am looking forward to having more time to try the other offerings - high tea, spa, restaurants. . .

This hotel really wowed us.",5,2014,09,17
143,Awesome,"One of the nicest hotels I've stayed in for a while. Beautiful common areas and very well appointed rooms. Super king bed, walk-in wardrobe, separate bath, shower & WC. 
Great atmosphere with a good buzz in the bar in the evening. Lovely singer in late bar. 
Service was excellent in all areas, the doormen were particularly helpful and engaging. Can't wait to return.",5,2014,09,15
143,5 star hotel with a little bit more,"We picked this hotel due to its location, price and the fact you had use of the UK's number 1 hotel spa included! It is a superb 5 star hotel, very centrally located yet in a quiet thoroughfare. The staff are also 5 star from the moment you arrive at the door to the second you leave. Nothing was too much trouble to any member of staff. The room we had was fantastic and offered every possible touch you would expect of a top class hotel but with a little bit more. Breakfast buffet was excellent, house keeping was superb and with a great Spa on top we cannot wait to return. Special thanks to Jaime in Front Office too. If you are looking for a special treat in London, or cant decide on a 5 star hotel to stay, I would recommend this as a perfect place to stay",5,2014,09,15
143,Amazing!,"Easy 5 Star review, excellent all round. 

Yes it's pricy, but it's Central London and the quality stands up, so too the service! 

Great nights sleep, amazing breakfast and looooved the Gin Cocktails - a must try",5,2014,09,14
143,"Good hotel, over priced, over rated food","On arrival we were greeted by friendly staff of this amazingly decorated hotel. We checked in and strangely the receptionist took an extra £150 off my card for ""extras"" I may have! Which I found very rude and almost untrusting of their guests who pay a substantial price to stay.

We had a deluxe room on the 7th floor which is stunning. Very clean, tidy and impressive with all the usual mod cons. However you'd at least expect a complimentary bottle of water ! Nope they want you to pay £4. 

The windows are a death trap ! If you've got young kids keep them away! Ours was unlocked and the restrictors removed.

We booked a food safari ! Big big mistake. We started a Massimo's where we were put in the corner with one plate of cold meats (still on a sheet of cardboard) with stale bread! Service was shocking to say the least. After complaining we were then ushered away to the other restaurant. The service was much better but the food was sub standard. We both had steak which simply is something you'd cook on a week night at home. Very very poor.

Great hotel but DO NOT EAT HERE!

I've been to many top end restaurant and hotels in London.

Drinks hugely over priced.",2,2014,09,14
143,Amazing Hotel,"The hotel which is centrally located is superb. You will not feel to be impressed with the gorgeous, spacious rooms. The staff are attentive and friendly. Definitely our number one choice for London. I would highly recommend.",5,2014,09,13
143,Luxury in every detail!,"My husband and I came to London to celebrate our 10 year anniversary and the Corinthia hotel exceeded our expectations in being pampered. Every detail in our room was thought out, from lighting, to technology, to ease of use and even the turndown service that made this a comforting stay. The high ceilings and furnishings made us feel like we were in a penthouse suite, although our room was a deluxe king room. 

The service from the staff was professional and prompt, and everything you could hope for. The location makes it even more appealing since its a 5 minute walk to Trafalgar Square and Charing Cross station, making it easy to get anywhere in central London. 

If we could rate this 10 stars we would, and will always make a point of staying at Corinthia when visiting London.",5,2014,09,13
143,"Style, elegance and service","Had lunch here recently with a client and everything about the hotel was first class. I thoroughly recommend it as a venue for business meetings and for leisure. The food was excellent, services was impeccable and the price was very reasonable. Thank you.",5,2014,09,12
143,6-star!,We stayed at this lovely property for 2 days and couldn't have been more pleased! This is by far the best hotel experience we've had in London and will only stay here on future visits. Outstanding! The staff go above and beyond to make your stay unforgettable!,5,2014,09,10
143,Our Favorite Hotel in London,"The Corinthia Hotel is a true luxury hotel.  We have stayed here twice, and it is our favorite place to stay in London.  The hotel has a great location.  It is an easy walk to Westminster Abbey, Parliament, Big Ben, and the Churchill War Rooms.  In the other direction, it is an easy walk to The National Gallery, theaters, restaurants, and shopping.  Both times we were in a Deluxe King.  The rooms were spacious and comfortable.  The bathroom was very spacious, and soaking and relaxing in a bath watching tv was an indulgence.  Totally enjoy the Corinthia, and we will definitely be back!",5,2014,09,10
143,This is what 5-star means,"I've visited this hotel twice now and it is one my favorite hotels around the world.  It is classic luxury with a modern twist and an unbelievably friendly staff.  The service here is top notch at every level and they even anticipated a few needs before I even asked.  Great lobby bar for drinks or afternoon tea.  Cocktail bar has fantastic drinks with live jazz music or a lovely piano player/singer each night I have visited. In the rooms attention was paid to every detail.  You truly get the luxury feel you are paying for, nice well appointed rooms with all the amenities of both classic and modern luxury.  This hotel has style and grace and not too stuffy or pretentious and doesn't take itself too serious like some luxury hotels do.  This hotel is a great fit for all ages or travelers. The location is great for London as well with many sights all within walking distance and very close to a lot of nice restaurants and pubs.  Just an all-around fantastic hotel that you will truly enjoy and far better than something you would get at the Four Seasons.",5,2014,09,09
143,50th birthday break,"We went to this wonderful hotel for a friends 50th birthday, girlie break. What a stunning hotel!
All staff were exceptional, especially Jamie from the 'Weir'. Such a pleasant and helpful young man.
Angie, ( from Munich, i believe) in the breakfast room was also corteous and nothing was too much trouble.
The spa was incredible, and very relaxing.
I really the fact the hotel, although very classy, was not stuffy at all.
All doormen and concierge were all friendly, and attended to us with great speed.
When next in London, i shall certainly be returning to this gem.",5,2014,09,09
143,Simply Amazing!,"The Corinthia London is truly a 5 star hotel! Everything is perfection from the beautiful and well appointed rooms, the exceptional staff and level of service offered and the hotels great location.  In our 8 night stay not one detail went unnoticed. Would highly recommend a visit to the spa and breakfast at the Northhall.",5,2014,09,08
143,"Amazing hotel, amazing staff - what more do you need?!","My wife and I got married here in August. From the moment I walked through the door, to the moment we left (4 nights in total) the staff were incredible. They thought of everything, on a number of occasions they had done things before I had even asked. It is a well oiled machine and you would be hard pressed to find better in London, if not the world. The food is excellent (the afternoon tea and the burger deserve special mention), the rooms are incredible (especially the Lady Hamilton Penthouse) and the spa is beautiful.

Nothing was a problem for the staff - they seemed to genuinely care about our and our guests experience.",5,2014,09,08
143,Brilliant Cocktail Bar and Cocktail Bar Manager,"We recently had the pleasure of visiting the Cocktail Bar at this hotel after a very enjoyable night at the Savoy Theatre. We were on our way home and popped in for a late night cocktail and we were wowed! Stefano Cossio the Cocktail Bar manager is a mixology genius and is so charming, professional and passionate about what he does. The cocktails were amazing- best Pisco Sour ever enjoyed and the King's Speech Champagne cocktail with raspberry foam was a dreamy delight! 
Thank you so much Stefano for ensuring a most enjoyable evening ended spectacularly- you are a true craftsman and a cocktail making legend! 
In addition the hotel is lovely and the other staff we met were also very charming and polite and pleasant- a great place in the midst of London.",5,2014,09,07
143,True Five star hotel in a great location in London,"We are finishing a week at this great hotel. The location is fantastic to see all of the sights that London has to offer. We walked to Covent Gardens area almost every night and there are tons of Pubs and restaurants to choose from there. We were able to walk to most attractions. The rooms at this hotel are spacious,modern and very well designed. The shower is one of tops that we have experienced in any hotel. You just want to stay in there forever. We had a deluxe room and the size was perfect. We requested a room that over looked the courtyard with a balcony. Very quiet room, we never heard any external noise. Housekeeping was spot on all of the time. The concierge staff were really remarkable and very friendly. Everyone we encountered at the hotel was very nice and professional. I used the gym and pool facilities a few times and both were extremely clean and the staff will help you with anything you need. We travel to many five star hotels around the world and this one is right up there as one of the top ones. I highly recommend the hotel and would stay here again without question.",5,2014,09,06
143,Afternoon tea at the lobby lounge,"Myself plus 7 others visited the lobby lounge in the Corinthia Hotel in London today for afternoon tea for a hen party. We had tried to book to go to the savoy & the ritz but these were fully booked so I took a pun and booked here. I was a little skeptical as the name 'lobby lounge' suggests it to be quite casual (well in my mind!) but to our delight it was stunning, but relaxed. Lovely comfortable seating and an easy environment to be in, not too formal or casual. The food was awesome, they catered for the fussy ones in the group with no fuss at all removing certain things from certain sandwiches etc. Our waitresses customer service skills were impeccable, she was very friendly, accommodating and approachable and asked whether we were there for a special occasion and we stated we were celebrating the bride to be! Moments later she arrived with a little cake on a plate saying 'congratulations' which was just bloody marvellous, a nice little sentiment! Cakes, scones, champagne were all exquisite! There was no rush or feel of being under any time constraints and enjoyed a leisurely afternoon of almost 3 hours in there. Once we had finished the waitress bought out a little bag of gifts to the bride to be as another 'congratulations' surprise which included some wedding tea that she had been drinking plus some little spa goodies - this was completely off the cuff and not asked for but yet the staff went the extra mile to do this!! Completely overwhelmed by how accommodating the team was in the lobby lounge. The thing that topped it off was there was an undisciplined mother letting her child (10 years old!) scream and shout and a member of staff asked them if he could be quiet and escorted them away. This is world class service. The staff were always offering extra sandwiches, tea, scones etc I would recommend anyone to try here instead of the mainstream hotels for afternoon tea. You will not be disappointed!!",5,2014,09,06
143,London's Best Hotel!,"The Corinthia London is a spectacular place for luxury travelers. In a perfect location within walking distance to many of London's top attractions, but fair warning that the hotel is so enjoyable that you may not want to leave to tour the town. Top-notch staff, welcoming and gorgeous lobby bar, and don't forget to visit Bassoon for a drink (it's a step back in time). Extremely comfortable and lovely rooms and suites. I highly recommend it. 

Cara Goldsbury",5,2014,09,06
143,Amazing spa,"I didn't stay at the hotel but went for a spa day here. The spa is very cool with the added luxury of a beautiful pool area. The tretements (massage and facial) were very good, not the best but the setting compensated and would happily revisit.",5,2014,09,05
143,Stunning hotel in the centre of London. Amazing!,"Stayed for a wedding and was bowled over by the sheer elegance and level of service. Fantastic rooms and facilities, spa, bars and places to eat. It had it all!

Loved our rooms and the wedding venue/ballroom was outstanding.

The staff were throughout helpful and courteous. I had a slight ""wardrobe malfunction"" one evening during the wedding celebrations, my bow tie came apart at the stitching and I ran back to my room to see what could be done? luckily for me housekeeping were turning the bed down for the evening and I asked the very helpful lady if she could possibly help? she ran downstairs and appeared a few minutes later with a very sturdy, well stitched back together tie! I have to say what an oustanding, superb level of service that was provided it literally saved me from entering a very well attended wedding improperly dressed.

We spent most of our stay in awe of the hotel and its facilities. The spa was superb with several saunas and pools available to us.

Overall what a fantastic, well staffed and facilitated hotel.. I cant think of any other place in London, so close to the Embankment tube station with everything around it- that I would want to stay at.",5,2014,09,05
143,Gorgeous Spa,"Great hotel, wonderful rooms - The one bedroom suites are really roomy, lovely entrance hall, dressing area and great bathroom. The lobby lounge is a nice spot to meet over tea or drinks. Nearby to the Thames and the south bank and the west end. Gorgeous Spa - lovely hot and steam rooms and pool. Lighting makes it for me - was able to recharge for the new day.",5,2014,09,05
143,Wow Wow Wow,"We stayed here for a wedding and the venue was absolutely stunning. Not to mention the spa and the rooms, probably the best city hotel I have ever stayed in. Also got to see one of the penthouses as the happy couple were staying in it, never seen anything like it, it had more outdoor space than my garden. Unbelievable.",5,2014,09,03
143,Basoon Bar - Wow,"Unfortunately myself and my girlfriend aren't rich enough to stay in a luxurious hotel like this.... we stayed at the premier inn! We did however treat ourselves to visiting the bar of this hotel as we were advised it's one of the best in London. We weren't disappointed! Service was fantastic and very friendly, cocktails were incredibly expensive for our standards but it was worth it for the atmosphere. It was fairly quiet when we visited, we had a pianist who also sang who when we first walked in both thought it was a CD until we saw him sat in the corner! We were both amazed with the quality, the atmosphere and how 'the other half' must live. We just need to win the lottery now....",5,2014,09,02
143,Thanks - you made a hard week doable,"My husband and I were attending my Fathers funeral. It was going to be a tense, miserable occasion with little support from any quarter. We'd blown most of my savings on last minute flights from Australia. So, why not blow the rest and bd brilliantly well looked after. That was my thinking and it worked. All the hard stuff was mediated by staying somewhere beautiful. Flowers, spa, pool. View. Generous towels. I even felt  human.",5,2014,09,01
143,Afternoon Tea,"Afternoon tea at The Corinthia is marvellous and it's very easy to relax the afternoon away. 

The setting is effortlessly chic and there is a nice selection of seats and tables you can sit at within the Lounge.  

The tea selection is outstanding and some of the blends are bespoke to the hotel. The staff are thorough with menu explanations and the quality of food is first class.

Everything was delicious!",5,2014,09,01
143,New Luxury in London,"When looking for a hotel in London with so many beautiful options, we looked for a modern recently renovated luxury hotel near the center.  I have to say that Corinthia was the best selection for us as it fit our criteria on several levels. It is a beautiful restoration of an old historical London building with impeccable finishes and furnishings.  We had two connecting rooms for our family and they had high ceilings and very nice bathrooms. We arrived in London early and they had our rooms ready with something for our ten year old and a selection of fresh fruits.  The hotel while big had a very nice scale and we did not feel like we were one of many. The location is superb and convenient to it all. They had a couple of dining options and we had dinner at The Northall one night and we had breakfast there ever day we were there.  The food was consistently good.  Service was very attentive even though the hotel was busy and they were many patrons.  All in all Corinthia fit the bill and, it is I suspect, perhaps the definition of new luxury in London.",5,2014,09,01
143,Number one hotel in London,"The Corinthia hotel is stunning.
Great Building in a very good location walking distance to the Horse Guards, Trafalgar square, Buckingham Palace,Piccadilly Circus etc
The staff are very courteous and attentive to your need,
It has a great lobby and lobby lounge with life music. Great space with high ceiling give you the real feeling of a Palace.
The breakfast at the Northall restaurant is outstanding with great flower arrangement done in a very beautiful flower shop at the entrance of the restaurant.
All the facilities are grand.
The Spa is dramatic and Luxurious and is the best in London. It provide spa treatments, Gym,
water facilities with silver steel swimming pool, vitality pool, a stunning amphitheater Sauna, steam room, ice fountain and experience showers.It is run by the best spa management company in the world call ESPA
The rooms are nice but unfortunatly for us being use to the 55Sqm standard room in Asia we found it small .
Great Hotel, Great Location",5,2014,09,01
143,Vegas standard 6 Star,"Absolutely blown away by this hotel - we've stayed at a lot of nice hotels in London, but the Corinthia beat them all! The location is great, and although Whitehall and Trafalgar Square are quite touristy, it was nice to pass some amazing London landmarks travelling to and from the hotel. It's also a couple of minutes away from the Southbank which is always great. 

The staff are fantastic and checking in was a breeze. We were immediately upgraded and our room was wonderful. Tastefully decorated, big enough and a lovely large spa like bathroom. Even the corridors smelled gorgeous as we headed off to our room. 

Please make sure you try the Bassoon Bar - gorgeous cocktails and a fabulous singer, and the Spa - 4 floors of heaven.

After a one night stay this hotel has quickly jumped to the top of my list - we'll be back (sooner rather than later I hope!)",5,2014,08,31
143,A great Gem in London,"With a number of hotels in london under renovation and the Savoy losing its charm. the Corinthis has filled a much needed gap.

The delivery of the perfect stay in a big city - Great Concierge that can get you anything you need is a must in a popular place like london -  fending for your self on bookings in a no no .

The rooms are perfect and as for the tables rather than desks I love the fact that two can sit at it - so both my husband and I worked on the table - electricity point are ample.

I loved the breakfast room - warm with great staff, big light windows that bring the old world charm into a perfectly laid out eating area.  Doing tea in the lobby is a missed opportunity for hotel  as not as charming as other london hotel - esp the outdoor area that could be a perfect formal tea area.

Love the location as you can walk to almost any part of london even south of the river the bridge is next to the hotel . Canary wharf  is a short tube ride away - taking a taxi is a challenge - with all the congestion in and around its not ideal .

Everyone and everything in the hotel was perfect. my only reservation was the Doormen - when compared with other similar hotels around the world were distracted and not very responsive and not welcoming the hotel indoor staff had to help on numerous occasion to fill the gap - this is based my stay in June and in August",5,2014,08,31
143,Perfect in every way,"The Corinthia is centrally located just across the River Thames from the London Eye and just a short walk from Trafalgar Square. This give you access to both sides of the city within walking distance to almost anywhere, and easy access to river transportation and bus/underground, or taxi obviously. Everything in the hotel is modern and up to date. Service is as you would expect in a 5-star hotel, i.e. as good as it gets. Most rooms have an interior view of the courtyard, if you want an exterior view (preferably River View) be sure to book the appropriate room category. Breakfast is superb, top quality and delicious. Afternoon tea is also delicious (try the Churchill tea if you like a smoky flavor). We had it in the courtyard in front of the fireplace. Our children were welcomed by the hotel with gifts for them in the room and a fresh basket of fruit replenished daily. If you are thinking of staying here, don't think twice.",5,2014,08,30
143,Great Hotel in the Heart of London,"Corinthia is a great hotel in the heart of London. Standard rooms are nice an cozy, bathrooms have heated floors (which is pretty useful in cold UK), and the spa is great. Breakfast are amazing too, they have a lot of healthy options including fresh fruit, berries and vegetables.",5,2014,08,28
143,Great hotel,"An excellent hotel. The doormen will notice your name on a luggage tag whilst getting bags from the cab and then address you by name as you alight - a small detail, but typical of the level of service you can expect. Public areas are great, with lots of quirky architectural and decorative touches - note the large lift floor indicators above the rear lifts. 
Superior room was indeed superior, and was a great combination of classic features with a modern twist, and with a really excellent bathroom. 
Location is also very good, close both to The Embankment and Trafalgar Square
Okay, it's on the expensive side, especially the extras, but I would still stay here again",5,2014,08,27
143,Amazing hotel in central London,"Everything is jsut as you would hope it would be in a five star London hotel. Grand building, great setting, close to everything, polite staff. We did the Stay Sunday Spa Monday deal and had a great time exploring the thermal floors on both the sunday and Monday. 

Room was lovely and a great size, with a balcony overlooking the courtyard. Rooms have all mod-cons. Obviously eveything in the room is exceptionally overpriced e.g  a miniatrure of gin is £14 and a 200ml mixer is £4.5 so you couldn't have a little drink without baulking at the price. 

Our room wasn't completely made up when we checked into it but no one seemed to have noticed. This then led to 2-3 people running back and forth to make sure all the glasswear was now present and the correct number of apples were in the bowl. 

The only real downside for me was that the bed was small. By all means it was a big, wide bed (probably king or super king), but my legs were hanging off the end for the whole night. I am not an extremely tall chap and neither is my partner but we both struggled with the length of the bed. Beds should be long enough, and wide enough. 

Spa is nice but doesn't have mthat much int he wasy of offerings unless you want to pay a lot for a treatment. The treatments are definitely overpriced. the spa has very small pool, spa pool (partially broken when we were there), large sauna, large steam room, and three heated loungers. 

You will be glad to stay herem just don't look at the price of anything.",5,2014,08,27
143,Fabulous Corinthia in London,"I visited the Corinthia for afternoon tea last week as a guest of the hotel manager. The team went out of their way to make it a special visit for us. Everything was excellent, a standard I have come to expect from this hotel and which they deliver every time. The director of F&B dropped by to say hello too which was very much appreciated. 
  
After tea we went for cocktails in the Northhall bar, where I was served THE best french martini I have ever tasted.

If you want to go to a great venue for a special treat or just to have a wonderful experience, try this hotel/venue.",5,2014,08,26
143,A place I wouldn't mind spending eternity...,"If you stay here I promise you'll be ruined forever.  Everything is so nice, so lovely, so comfortable, so absolutely everything you want that regular nice places seem almost depressing.  
If I had my way I'd stay here every time I visited London, but it is expensive.  Not the rooms, mind you, it's the breakfast and the afternoon tea and that one more cocktail by the outdoor fireplace with your lover that you just can't say no to..... that's how they getcha. 
Completely worth it if you're taking a luxury trip for romance.  I'm so bummed we're staying somewhere else for our next visit.  Please enjoy it for me.",5,2014,08,25
143,Great Location,"For business travel I have often stayed at the Cronithia Hotel in London, at Whitehall.  The location is great - it is pretty quiet and allows for a morning run to Buckingham Palace and Hyde Park but is an easy tube ride from the finanical district and a healthy walk to many trendy restaurants. The rooms are somewhat typical big-city small-ish, but are beautifully appointed.  There are generally tables and not desks, so working in the room is not easy, but I use our local office. I once had a room for handicapped travellers which was not very comfortable and I mentioend it at check-out and was upgraded the next time I came, so they were responsive and helful.",4,2014,08,25
143,Outstanding!,"We were fortunate enough to have 4 days here during a wedding celebration, which we will not soon forget. The lobby is breathtaking, and the decor is chic, witty and sophisticated. Our rooms were not ready upon our arrival so we were offered complimentary breakfast at the Whitehall Restaurant in the lobby. The front desk staff couldn't have been nicer, and brought our keys to our table and then escorted us to our rooms. The bathrooms are large and well-appointed. The rooms are slightly smaller, compared to American standards, but the decor is absolutely brilliant, down to the books, which are different in each room. The built-in closets show the attention to detail.  My only (mild) complaint was that there are no electrical sockets in the bathroom, but there is an ample supply in the room itself. Housekeeping and, in fact, every service in the hotel is exceptional. 
The gym was a beautiful and welcome surprise as was the spa. The art work is spectacular. We attended a brunch with the wedding party the final day, where the presentation of the food was among the best we've ever seen. Even if you don't stay here, marvel at the flowers and decor in  lobby and come for an exceptional brunch.",5,2014,08,23
143,Magnificent from the flowers in the reception to the wardrobe in the room,"A real mixture of old world charm combined with London chic. The rooms are fantastically well appointed, including a TV that can be watched while bathing. A coffee machine in the room was a great feature. On returning from a morning jog in the parks or along the banks of the Thames the staff welcomed me back with a dry towel and a cold bottle of mineral water. Great service, awesome rooms but at a price!",5,2014,08,23
143,Perfect!,"We only nipped in here for mid-morning refuelling and it was utterly charming. Beautiful setting and ultra-stylish décor, the staff were exceptionally professional yet approachable and the food and drinks were scrumptious and generous. Truly five star. There is also an outdoor/enclosed courtyard with sofas and fires which looked cosy. Would love to stay here now! ",5,2014,08,22
143,In one word,"WOW!

Normally I am a man of many words but this one word will suffice. The rooms,service,brunch and Massimo's all without fault. Room was ready early. Bed was supper comfortable and compared to many hotels in London the room was HUGE! I was in the UK for a Tank Regiment Parade and I forgot that right out the door in Whitehall was the statue in honour of those who have served their country in peace and war from The RTR!

I normally stay at either Duke's or The Connaught but will try to make this hotel my landing pad of choice 

Do yourself a favour.",5,2014,08,21
143,Bond...James Bond,"Thats how I felt upon entering this fine hotel...

I had heard about this hotel from someone who works in the film entertainment industry and has stayed at the best of the best hotels. He said it was a great hotel so I decided to check it out.

I loved this hotel.  From the moment you arrive they greet you with top quality service. The hotel is very close to everything but on a side of the street that was quite in terms of street noise. My room was not ready when I checked in at 12  so they had me wait and served some tea and snacks. It was quickly made up and I was sent up with my bags waiting in the room and fresh fruit. The lobby is a beautiful place to sit and relax. The rooms are very well appointed and are designed with good taste. All the amenities and bathroom was first class. Ill be honest and say that I didn’t want to leave but when it was time to go the service was impeccable. I had to get to the tube so I was personally escorted across to the station and shown how to operate the ticket machine.  It was a quick visit but I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. I wish i had another day to visit the gym and spa which looked amazing. I hope to stay there again soon!",5,2014,08,19
143,London's hottest hotel!,"Stay here. We came with our two 15 year old, and we all just loved it! Rooms are great, food is delicious, hotel is beautiful, great location, very quiet street, service is great, spa is huge, so cool and fabulous, concierge staff is so helpful.  Bar lounge is very chic. Winston Churchill hung out here. Not one complaint! We will definitely go back here!",5,2014,08,19
143,Truly Great Hotel,"We stayed for six nights recently on a family trip.  Every detail exceeded our expectations.  The building is beautiful inside and out.  The amenities are modern in function with a classic style.  The rooms are large and very nicely designed.  The king sized beds are North American sized kings not the UK king which I think of as queen sized.  The staff were very helpful and pleasant.  As an example, on our departure day, there was a bicycle race which had closed the nearby streets to traffic.  Taxis and limousines could only come within about three blocks of the hotel.  Advance notice was provided so people could adapt.  Unfortunately, there was also torrential rain that morning.  It seemed that there were a number of extra staff brought in that day to help guests by transporting luggage to the closest taxi while another held the umbrella.  I was impressed that the hotel responded so well to a situation beyond their control.  

I will stay at the Corinthia next time I'm in London.",5,2014,08,18
143,Believe the hype!,"This was our second stay at this fantastic hotel.  Our first time we had a room upgrade.  That didn't happen this time but our room was still fantastic.  The whole hotel is so beautiful.  We made time for a visit to the Spa this time and the thermal floor is stunning - make sure you make time too.  The Northall Restaurant for dinner was great, with excellent and friendly advice from the Sommelier.  The breakfast buffet was fantastic.
I cannot recommend this place highly enough.  Yes - it's not cheap, but it's a Five Star hotel in London on the doorstep of some of the main sights and areas.  To treat that someone special you will not find better.",5,2014,08,18
143,"Understated, Exquisite & Modern Luxury","Perfect blend of understated luxury and highly professional service. The dramatic lobby has stunning flower arrangements, lighting and décor. All in understated, calm colors, like the room décor. The standard room is quite spacious for standard London and is furnished beautifully, yet very cozy. It feels like the perfect guest room at your wealthy friend's weekend home. Well furnished, rich fabrics and many thoughtful touches, like the latest edition of Vanity Fair, instead of some glossy advertising-driven magazine about London. Also, the room is remarkably quiet for central London.
The bathroom is large and also well thought out, including a marvelous waterfall shower with a built-in foothold for shaving. The service is perfect, almost invisible. At check-in, they asked us what time we would like turn down service. Smart, very smart. I would highly recommend.",5,2014,08,18
143,Great Hotel!!!  Highly recommend!!,"This hotel is amazing. The staff is absolutely over the top helpful. The hotel lobby is beautiful, the rooms are comfy & the spa is amazing!!!  Great location as well. Wifi works perfectly. An amazing hotel all around.",5,2014,08,17
143,"Amazing brunch, can't wait to plan my next trip.","my partner arranged a surprise Sunday brunch in the Northall Restaurant. The hotel was stunning and I was delightfully impressed from the moment I entered the main gate. We were greeted by a lovely lady at the restaurant who took us to our tables. Our served was brilliant an asian fellow Anorag he presented the brunch menu along with the special bloody Mary menu and was more than helpful explaining all the different options available. We went with the free flowing champagne  and we recommended the crab cocktail to start and the Seabass and Roast beef for man a great recommendation which was amazingly beautiful.

This is by far one of the best brunch's I have had, the food was sublime and very well presented, the champagne truly as free flowing not once did my glass get empty, the service was attentive and helpful and made you feel like the only people in the restaurant which was beautifully decorated and made for a grand setting. Anorag recommended the cocktail bar which we did not get a chance to visit but it is definitively on our list to do in London. It's the best place to spend a Sunday in London thank you for a wonderful experience.",5,2014,08,17
143,EXCELLENT IN ALL RESPECTS !!!,"We stayed for just over a week & everything was perfect from arrival to departure. The doormen, reception, housekeeping with any special requests, the concierges and the staff in The Northall and Lobby Lounge were all most accommodating, helpful & gracious. The breakfasts, lunches, dinners & snacks were very good. The location is excellent. We had a spacious family interior courtyard room that was dead quiet and the beds perfect. We'd stay here again in a heartbeat !  Thank you !",5,2014,08,16
143,"Thank you , Thank you , Thankyou !!","Being the 1000th reviewer of the Corinthia hotel, they very generously offered us 2 nights free accommodation plus dinner on one of the evenings (breakfast included of course!).Needless to say we jumped at this fantastic offer. Yet again it was phenomenal!!! service, food, staff accommodation were all exceptional and nothing was too much trouble. We had a room overlooking the inner courtyard which is lovely and with the french doors open in the bedroom, we were serenaded by the music being played - joy !

Thank you so much Corinthia especially Bettina who is a Star and extremely helpful. I have to say that the icing on the cake was when we realised that not only had the hotel paid form our evening meal, but had also picked up the tab for the drinks that we had - simply class !!",5,2014,08,16
143,Fabulous!,"A nicer place you will not find. Fantastic setting, exceptional service, and perfect location. Wonderful breakfast and bar area to boot. Will do my best to make my visit not a one time event. London done right!",5,2014,08,15
143,Sophisticated Corinthia,"Had a fabulous stay at the Corinthia, our room was very quiet with a beautiful and spacious white marble bathroom and stunning walk in shower. The interior of the hotel is sophisticated and The Lobby Lounge is a beautiful and peaceful place to enjoy afternoon tea. 

We specifically stayed at the hotel as we wanted to try the luxurious hotel spa, it definitely has the “wow factor” and worth a visit. The pool area is spectacular with floor to ceiling black marble and we absolutely loved the amphitheatre sauna!  A pity that during the adult only times both the pools were overrun with children jumping in and out of the pools. 

The hotel concierge also recommended an excellent sushi restaurant within walking distance of the hotel called ""Sake no hana"". We finished off the evening with a walk to Victoria Tower Gardens to view the WW1 light art exhibition called Spectra. An amazing 49 individual spotlight column, which was installed to commemorate the night the 'lamps went out across Europe' at the start of WWI. 
The hotel is within walking distance of many great London landmarks.",5,2014,08,14
143,A step above the rest...does not disappoint,"For my 2nd time at this hotel, I was not disappointed. 

Pros: 
location-near tube, London eye, Thames river, Trafalgar Square, etc. Gym-by far the best facility I've had while traveling,
food-Masimos was splendid taste & service. lobby lounge-afternoon tea is a must! So phenomenal & relaxing. 
Espa-amazing tranquility pools, the best massage therapist I've had in all of my travels (Angel). 
Concierge-knowledgable & always willing to help. They recommended a great Gordon Ramsay restaurant called Petrus. Excellent   
Fully equipped business center. 
Housekeeping-the most thorough cleaning & very on point. 
Check in-easy & friendly staff. 

I can really go on & on but you get the point. You cannot go wrong staying here. 

Cons: there really aren't any I can find aside from the cost but like anything else in life, you get what you pay for. I will say that if you book early enough and at the right time through the hotel direct or a hotel booking site, you can find deals. You can also save $ by booking things like drivers on your own. 

Stay here! ",5,2014,08,13
143,Stay classy,"Where to start?

The Corinthia manages to pull off what many other hotels try and fail to and that is to pitch the feel at exactly the right spot between traditional and contemporary.

The traditional starts with the elegant Victorian building itself, situated a stone's throw from Trafalgar Square and continues with the top-hatted doormen.

Step inside and you cannot fail to be impressed by the spacious reception areas and this is where the contemporary kicks in. Trendy but not gaudy but perhaps classy is the most fitting description.

We booked a Deluxe King room and were on the third floor overlooking the front of the hotel and the MoD building I believe. There was no traffic noise that disturbed us. The room was very spacious and easily accommodated the extra bed we required. The room includes a huge walk-in cupboard with ample hanging space and a simply stunning bathroom topped off with having a TV in the bath (well, not exactly in the bath but I'm sure you catch my drift..). A lovely King sized bed ensured a restful night's sleep and a Nespresso machine was provided for a caffeine boost first thing. If there was a fault it would be that there was no docking station which is pretty much standard these days in hotels of this calibre.

We dined in both restaurants and enjoyed them immensely with the pre-theatre option offering extremely good value.

Overall, it's not cheap but it's just a fact of life that hotels in London are not cheap and relatively speaking, we felt it offered value for money.

I understand from a cabbie that Sylvester Stallone was staying in the hotel at the same time as we were and to quote one of his co-stars of his latest film ""I'll be back"".",5,2014,08,13
143,London at its best!,"We stayed at this lovely property for 5 days and couldn't have been more pleased!  This is by far the best hotel experience we've had in London and will only stay here on future visits.  Outstanding! The staff go above and beyond to make your stay unforgettable!  We also utilized  many of hthe hotel's amenities to the fullest during our stay - amazingly efficient concierge service (Justin, Scott & Zahill), massages at Espa, Ricky at Galvin's hair salon, and Stefano and his colleagues at Bar Bassoon.  We had a magnificent suite on the 5th floor looking into the lovely atrium.  We hosted a dinner for eleven friends at Massimo's - excellent restaurant serving top quality food and wines  Our server, Jacob, was exceptional!  Thank you Corinthia London for making our stay ""over the top!""",5,2014,08,12
143,exceptional place,"Would love to come back, really. Very beautiful, modern rooms, especially those close to roof are awesome. The food - above any expectation. The location is outstanding as well. In general - everything u may dream about.",5,2014,08,11
143,Anniversary Perfection,"Consistently exceptional service and stunning interiors at every turn. Excellent restaurants and an unbeatable spa experience. A very good location, a short walking distance major landmarks in the heart of Whitehall.",5,2014,08,10
143,True 5 star experience,The hotel does not disappoint if you are looking for a celebrity experience. The room is specious for London standard including a walk in closet. Can't complain about the service though I think it is more pretentious than friendly when comparing with other hotels I have been in London. The room is very well equipped including converting plugs. Highly recommend to spend some time in the spa and sauna too!,5,2014,08,10
143,Northall Resturant - Fantastic,"We went to this resturant as we had been before and enjoyed it.  We had a pre-theatre meal and not only was it excellent value for money but also fantastic food and service.

We took our teenage daughter who is a ""foodie"" and can be quite critical of mediocre food establishments.  We were all totally impressed.  The waiter and waitress were really attentive and very helpful describing what was on the menu so we could be certain it would be to our taste.  It was the start of a new menu and we were really impressed.  The food was delicious and when we asked for time between our main course and dessert they left us alone and did not try and rush us.  Everything was amazing and we will certainly be making another visit when we go to London.
Thank you to everyone concerned both those at the front of house and the hard working chefs.",5,2014,08,10
143,Champagne and Jazz,"We were bought tickets for a Champagne Jazz breakfast. We had the most fantastic time and we want to go back.

We were looked after by the staff very well, the Champagne, food and jazz flowed endlessly, and the train journey home on a Sunday timetable made much easier, we just didn't notice...",5,2014,08,09
143,Its so true what they say.... it's simply the best place to stay,"We thought very carefully and compared a number of 5 Star hotels in London in which we would spend our 25th Wedding Anniversary.

We chose the Corinthia and we were treated like royality, attentive yet never intrusive, excellent service throughout our stay, accomodation that met the highest standards and staff you would hope all other hotels could match in quality.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone coming to London.",5,2014,08,06
143,Perfect relaxation,"I went for a solo relaxation for 2 days 1 night as I had a bad virus and went to rejuvenate. Service- impeccable sometimes over the top. Great location. Room-Very comfy bed, bathroom top notch, TV signal in room intermittent on some channels. Spa-One of the best ever!!! Massage-Excellent.Food-Superb (Chicken Biryani a must try!!) Wi-fi-could be better. Would highly recommend and go back in the future. ",5,2014,08,06
143,Fantastic service,"We spent six nights at the Corinthia in our first holiday to London as a couple.
The good:
The staff were fantastic, across the board. We're not really 5Star Hotel travellers - we walk places even in the rain, we're jeans wearers, etc. We were never made to feel out of place by staff, and on several occasions, the reception and door staff were very helpful, particularly with the hire car.
The breakfast was outstanding, offering a choice a la carte and buffet breakfast, so freshly cooked kippers with a fresh fruit accompaniment was easy. Good-for-London coffee once we worked out how to order it.
The hotel was very quick and cheerful to anticipate and resolve problems, once the price was set (which took a little negotiation beforehand as I changed dates) it was generously followed by the hotel, who credited us back for services we hadn't used without asking. The place isn't cheap, but it wasn't stingy either. Services like the platter I ordered were generous and worth the money. This stuff makes a real difference in how you feel about the hotel while you stay there, and the Corinthia gets it exactly right.
The 'meh'
It's a upperclass hotel with an atmosphere to match. Sometimes the service was too omnipresent for us - a trend with 'luxury' accommodation I'm not a fan of (but apparently the rest of the world is). It is expensive, and I'm not sure in the future if there aren't better places for us to put our travel money, depending on how important the ease of having everything organised is.",5,2014,08,05
143,Amazing !!!,"We stayed at the corinthia hotel on the 3rd August for my partners birthday which was a surprise . This was the first time we had ever visited the corinthia hotel but had heard many good reviews which is why we stayed . Firstly we was greeted by the doormen who took our luggage and also brought them to our room then we was greeted by the amazing reception staff who also showed us to our room . We then decided to have lunch in the bar and the food was outstanding along with the bar staff who were very helpful when you have a very picky partner. The hotel is a 2 minute walk away from the tube station and around a 5 minute walk to all the areas around such as the London eye, Big Ben , Trafalgar Square etc . Our room was an executive suite and it was outstanding I have never been to a hotel which such a high standard of class before. The only down side to the stay was having to ring downstairs for an iron twice as none had delivered this when I first asked but there wouldn't be anything else I could have faulted on the stay . We also saw joey Essex and silvester Stalone at the hotel. Overall I would give this hotel a 15/10 for the outstanding staff and also the location of the hotel . My partner has now decided we are booking again for next month . Hope to see you again soon Corinthia !!!!",5,2014,08,05
143,Good location,"I have stayed in this hotel on a couple of occasions. 
We find the location excellent. 
Rooms are nicely decorated. 
staff are friendly. 
Bathrooms are nice. The only thing I would say is it a little expensive at times.  ",5,2014,08,04
143,"Amazing hotel, pure bliss","Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights just before Christmas last year. It was our second visit to the hotel. Both times have been an incredible experience and I would not hesitate to choose this hotel again over any other in London. The spa is also out of this world, along with the rooms and the dining areas. Although quite pricey, you will find it is still good
Value given the quality of the accommodation and service. Located within walking distance of the Southbank Christmas market which was a nice experience at Christmas time. Any questions please do not hesitate to contact me. Thanks Corinthia for an outstanding stay ",5,2014,08,03
143,"No better Hotel, nor London Location","First class all the way.
And right near Parliament, big ben, Westminster abby, Buckingham palace, and just across the Themes from the London eye.
staff ultra friendly, beautiful lobby and rooms, we all were throughly pleased with every aspect",5,2014,08,02
143,The new gold standard in London high end hotels,"I've stayed at this hotel 3 times now on business for stays ranging for 2 to 4 days and it has steadily grown on me after each visit to become my new favourite London hotel.  On the first stay after it had recently opened the hotel was finding its feet and lacked a bit of identity and atmosphere and there were a few gaps in service levels which is not surprising for a new hotel of this size and aspiration.  On subsequent visits service consistency has been fixed and the hotel has some of the most attentive and thoughtful staff of any London hotel I've stayed in, as a result of good hiring and attention to detail on service, f&b offering and cleanliness/check-in etc the Corinthia now has a distinctive identity and soul and is now a large living breathing high end hotel that differentiates versus the more vanilla/formula-driven international 5 star chains. I would have no hesitation booking this hotel for a family visit to London now.

What makes this hotel special:
- Quality of the decor and fit out of the rooms, very high standard and classic/refined style despite being a new hotel
- Spa/fitness and pool area, by far the largest and most extensive spa facility of any metropolitan hotel I've visited globally. 5 levels of pampering, relaxation and exercise that you could get lost in for the best part of a day and a spa so large it is not hard to get an appointment at short notice after a long flight into London.  Pool, jacuzzi, sauna and steam facilities best I've seen and open to kids for a few hours a day.
- Atmosphere and quality of public areas, the atrium is now one of the best places in London for high tea and breakfast in the main restaurant is always a treat and well executed.
- Standard of service: It is clear they have hired very well and ensure they have experienced staff of the highest quality and attentiveness that have been trained well.

What are the downsides to the hotel:
- Location is a little bit further out of West End than other options in Mayfair/Park Lane so this isn't the very best location for those wanting to shop and see the key central galleries etc. That said it is a bit quieter than west end with less traffic and tourists so can feel like a real oasis within Zone 1.  Walking distance (for healthier legs) to most sights either way and plenty of black cabs available for a 5 pound cab ride to Bond Street etc.
- Standard rooms a little smaller than standard rooms at other hotels at similar price point (Claridges, Mandarin Oriental, Berkeley, Haymarket) but still just big enough. Would ask for a room with a juliet balcony onto the central courtyard which feel more spacious when windows open.
- See above re kids only being allowed in pool area at certain times of day, not an issue as long as you plan around it and manage expectations of children accordingly.

Give this place a chance and it won't disappoint. Unique location close to river but not far from West End, Hyde/Green Park and Mayfair make a nice change from the usual selection of hotels in this price range.",5,2014,08,01
143,"Elegance, service, location!","We wanted to end our European vacation with a bang and the Corinthia delivered. The room--graciously upped to a suite--was perhaps the most lavish I've ever encountered, although I never did decode the lighting. The location can't be beat--walking distance to Whitehall, Trafalgar Square, Westminster Abbey, St. James Park, the London Eye and much, much more. The service is unparalleled. We were there on a busy weekend night and yet the lobby staff always greeted us by name whenever we passed through. Impressive. The concierge warned us away from the tourist-trap pubs on Whitehall, but we were too tired to take his advice and taxi over to an establishment he recommended. Our mistake.",5,2014,08,01
143,10 Star Resort,The Corinthia Hotel in London is simply amazing. The decor is gorgeous. The food is incredible. The service is perfect. From the front desk to the 3 concierges that they have on duty at all times to tea in the large sitting area to the restaurant. Simply magnificent. ,5,2014,08,01
143,The Spa - a relaxing oasis in a busy city,"I've been to the Spa twice now and it hasn't failed me yet!  The treatments are professional and effective and topped off with an hour or so in the various pools, warm stone loungers and steam and dry saunas on the lower floor.  The changing rooms are serene, the little cafe serves healthy food efficiently and the products smell nice.",4,2014,07,30
143,Stunning Hotel,"This hotel is pure class, The customer service was outstanding and the place was immaculate . We spent a whole afternoon in the spa which was a lovely relaxing experience . The hotel is a short walk to south bank which has stunning views and great restaurants. I would highly recommend this hotel when staying in London.",5,2014,07,29
143,Outstanding,"This is a combined review for our stays in February & March .

In February we stayed with our two children, we enjoyed the visit so much that we cancelled our booking at The Berkley for the following month and booked here instead !

I love the location of this hotel and the appearance as you approach it , it's a beautiful building and once you enter the lobby you cannot fail to be impressed by the beautiful flowers and the stunning chandeliers .

The first time we stayed in standard rooms and they were gorgeous , they are probably some of the biggest hotel rooms in London , decorated beautifully with dark wood and touches of purple . The bathrooms are really big with TV's which made for two happy children at bath time !

There was a lovely welcome gift of cuddly toys , children's toiletries and robes waiting on their beds with an Xbox as well. Later on they were sent up cookies & milk which was a nice touch .

In March we stayed in the executive rooms and they were really spacious .

The food throughout was fantastic . Breakfast in the Northall is outstanding , lots of choice and beautifully presented . We also had dinner one night there and it was beautiful and a nice atmosphere .

We had dinner in Massimo, the food was gorgeous but there wasn't many people there and because it's such a huge room it did feel a bit empty .

The highlight of our trip was afternoon tea in the lobby , it was fantastic , leave about 2 hours for it , they keep coming back and checking if you would like more sandwiches or cakes , what we didn't eat they offered to box up for us to take away, it's one if not the best afternoon teas I ever had .

We had late drinks in Bassoon and I loved it in here, really dark with a great atmosphere, a perfect spot to finish off the night .

We also used their babysitting service and the lady was lovely , our children really liked her .

Rooms turned down every night with lavender bags left on the pillow.

All the staff were lovely , friendly and accommodating . I can't think of one bad thing to say about this place , if you want a five star experience in London then this is the place to go .

",5,2014,07,27
143,Pretty amazing....,"Stayed here in May of 2013 on a girls trip to London.  Absolutely stunning hotel, very conveniently located to Trafalgar Square, Portrait Gallery, Hyde Park, London Eye, etc.  the spa was very nice, but the best was afternoon tea....which was, pretty amazing.  Highly recommend for a splurge stay....",5,2014,07,26
143,Another Successful Visit,"This was our sixth visit to the Corinthia London.  As always we reserved an Executive King.  Formally the hotel allowed 24 hour check in / out but this has now changed to check 3pm or after.  We arrived at the hotel for 2.30 and our room was ready for us.  I think more regulated check in check out process works better and prevents lengthy waits for your room.  

We were welcomed back by the receptionist and they remembered our specifics from the previous stay. We were then shown to our room by a Guest Relations Manager.  We had a beautiful room on the 3rd floor located in the corner of the triangle that forms the hotel looking over an ornamental roof garden.  We had a small terrace a perfect size bedroom area with occasional seating, hall way, separate walk in closet and spacious bathroom.  The room was impeccably clean and as expected very tastefully decorated.  We had pre order ordered champagne and scones (an odd combination perhaps!) and they were waiting for us upon arrival.  The scones were fresh, light and delicious served with a selection of jams and fresh clotted cream.  

As usual we choose to dine in the stunning and relaxing lobby lounge. The service was excellent as was the food, coffee and wine! We then had a night cap outside in the courtyard.  Whilst we had been dining housekeeping had freshened the room and turned down the bed leaving a little parcel of lavender on each pillow.

The following morning breakfast was delivered to the room bang on time along with complimentary new papers.  The breakfast as always was excellent.  This must be the only hotel I have ever stayed in that can actually manage to deliver a hot and tasty full English to your room! The cooked breakfast was accompanied by fresh juice, hot coffee, toast and pastries! Faultlessly presented as always.  

Check out was speedy and friendly and the receptionist finished by saying that they hoped to see us again soon.  We genuinely could not fault any aspect of the hotels performance on this visit.",5,2014,07,26
143,Afternoon Tea at the Lobby Lounge,"Located in The Corinthia Hotel, the Lobby Lounge is the perfect place for the afternoon tea. Corinthia hotel was not our first choice for a Saturday afternoon tea, infact we tried to have a reservation at Savoy or Ritz. Then, we loved Corinthia Hotel and we were very happy to spend our afternoon in this wonderful place.
The place is very nice and lovely. 
My friend and I chose the traditional high tea tea and it included sandwiches, pastries, macarones, chocolate and small cake. The sandwiches were very nice, 5 different types and complementary extras if you required. 
Afternoon Tea at Lobby Lounge – Corinthia Hotel  is an experience not to be missed.
Sorry if my English is not perfect but I am not English mother tongue.",5,2014,07,26
143,Exceeds the standard for luxury ,"I stayed at the Corinthia for a week while in London on business and holiday. From the moment I walked through the front doors I was treated like a honored guest and the accommodations of this hotel are second to none! The amazing hotel, staff, and perfect location has made this one my favorite destinations in London. ",5,2014,07,26
143,As Good As It Gets,"The Corinthia is expensive and is not in or adjacent to a residential neighborhood as are many of the finest hotels in London. It doesn't have great views from many rooms. It doesn't contain a world-class restaurant. Having said that, I think it's the best hotel in which I have ever stayed.

The rooms are commodious. The bathrooms are fantastic, well-equipped and with plenty of storage space. The closets are capacious. The service levels are truly outstanding without being intrusive. The design of the entire hotel is ""modern classic"" with a few additional touches thrown in with just the right proportions. The breakfasts are fabulous, served in a fabulous setting. The afternoon tea (which for many becomes the afternoon cocktail or fine scotch hour) is splendid. The location turns out to be just about perfect if you are interested in spending time at the South Bank as well as at the more typical tourist attractions in this great city. I could go on. But rather than delve into innumerable details I will just say that we would not even consider another hotel for our future stays in London. As a traveler who has stayed at a number of the bigger ""names"" in London, I would say without hesitation that this is the best of a very good bunch.",5,2014,07,26
143,World Class Luxury,"If you're accustomed to the finest, the Corinthia will not disappoint in any regard.  Impeccable service from the desk staff to the concierge to the personal butler...overwhelming at times in the most positive sense.  We received a suite upgrade via the Amex FHR program and the room was really magnificent...down to every detail with incredible style, fit and finish...stunning!  Really one of the finest hotel experiences we have ever had, a perfect location very near Trafalgar Square and a style and aesthetic that was perfectly luxurious.",5,2014,07,24
143,Super duper,"I stayed here whilst facilitating a retreat and the service was excellent - my room was simple and well appointed. 
The crystal chandelier is amazing in the bar area. 
The food was exceptional and the staff were so helpful and nothing was too much trouble. Great location for swiping rhetoric sights of London. Highly recommend it",5,2014,07,23
143,Excellent hotel,"We spent several nights at the Corinthia last June and found the hotel and its staff to be excellent and a delightful place to spend time. The staff was as accommodating as one could want. Our executive suite, while not as spacious as one could want, was sufficient in size so that we did not feel cramped and was consist with the size offered in similar establishments on the Continent. The hotel is well located and within easy walking distances to theatres and good restaurants. I found nothing to criticize save that the air conditioning was not well functioning, which the staff said would be remedied shortly after we left. The food was excellent, save a bit pricey. All in all, a good choice.",5,2014,07,22
143,The small details add to the great stay,"I stayed at the Corinthia for a number of nights in July, it was a business trip and the hotel ticked all of the boxes.  My room was possibly one of the more simple rooms but there was nothing simple about it, the bathroom was huge and the heated floors were a welcome surprise on the morning feet, the wardrobe was excellent, being there for business it was a great space to spread everything out and be ready for the day.  The bed as excellent but I could have done with a pillow that wasn't feather. The evening turn down service was a treat, after a long day the lavender bags were a welcome addition.  

I found the staff to be very helpful, particularly the door men who offered advice on the weather or directions or just greeted you with a smile at the end of a long day. 

The location was excellent as there was no need to hop in a taxi as you could walk everywhere or the tube was at the doorstep.  

My only suggestion for an improvement would be that consideration should be given to more affordable breakfast options rather than elaborate meals that were not what you were after when heading out on business.

in all a great stay and I would highly recommend it for a stay whether work or pleasure,",5,2014,07,22
143,Loved the Corinthia!!,"I loved my week long stay at the Corinthia.  The hotel is best described as modern British elegance (as compared to old school British, e.g. Claridges or trendy and modern, e.g. The Edition).  As such, I think this hotel would have very wide appeal to all ages and all types of travelers.  I stayed as a business traveler, but after seeing other properties in London, I'd stay at the Corinthia.  (I saw The Langham, Claridges, The Edition, and the Westminister InterContinental).  My room was very spacious, and the high ceilings only emphasized this more.  Also, the layout in my room was well-used.  Great vanity for getting ready in the morning, large table that easily converted to a work space, generous king sized bed, separate toilet closet, small foyer.  And then there is the shower- my shower was probably the BEST shower I have ever experienced.  (My other colleagues couldn't stop raving about the showers too).  Perfectly sized rain shower with just the right amount of pressure and excellent temperature control.  If there was a chair in there, I'd probably hang out there for hours.  The other detail that I greatly appreciated was the Babyliss hair dryer in the room.  Very few hotels provide such a quality hair dryer, and any woman will tell you that the difference between a good hair day and a bad hair day is really the hair dryer.  I could not believe that I had great, frizz free hair in London (where there are constant rain showers!).  The food in the hotel was also great- I had afternoon tea, ate in the restaurant and ordered room service.  Everything was fantastic.  Also, if you are allergic to perfumes, be aware that many London hotels have strong signature scents (e.g. The Langham).  There were fresh flowers at the Corinthia, but no strong scents.",5,2014,07,22
143,It's All About The Details!,"My husband and I spent my birthday at the Corinthia Hotel and every detail was impeccable!! We were graciously greeted by the staff at every opportunity. They were very polite and warm.

Our room was amazing! We were surprised to find a beautiful bottle of champagne, a sweet and delicious cake and an elegant bouquet of hydrangeas. 

The room layout, decor and use of materials were very luxurious. Some of the features that impressed me were the all wood details in the foyer, closets and flooring. Our room had beautiful carpeting with about 1 foot of wood floor outlining the carpet and walls. The ceiling heights made the room feel large yet cozy as well. The tv and bedside cabinets had built-in sliding fronts to conceal the tv, bar and what I used as a vanity area. The restroom was gorgeous and so high tech! Even though we did not use the tub, I could imagine it being so relaxing. The stone floors were heated and the toilet was super high tech ;)

Every turn-down service was so thoughtful and sweet. Lavender  sash, gourmet chocolates and fine bottled water bedside. 

We spent the day getting services at the Espa in the hotel. Now, being that I have been in the fine beauty & spa business for almost 20 years, the Espa is the most incredible spa I have ever been to!! Where do I begin?!? We enjoyed their spa lunch menu with specialty salads and soup tastings as well as their lovely teas. This lunch totally set the tone to what was waiting for us. Wow!!! The therapeutic whirlpools and the hot sauna were a work of art!! This spa has set the bar very high for the future standards of spa features and decor. Award worthy for sure!!

Thank you Cornithia and Espa for making my 1st time in London one I'll always cherish! I am dreaming of the day I can return. Maybe next year?? ;) ",5,2014,07,22
143,Purely wonderful,"One of the very best London can offer. Have stayed in a few but the spacious room and luxurious bathroom is a must! We were kindly asked if we were celebrating, which we were, our wedding anniversary and they kindly upgraded us. The room had the WOW factor, everything you needed. Rain forest shower, lovely huge bath with LED tv, plenty of towels, bathrobes, slippers and plenty of toiletries. Well stocked mini bar if you wish to use, complimentary water and apples! Tea and coffee making facilities.
A really nice touch was a dessert was sent to our room with congrats written in chocolate and a card from the team. Location you couldn't ask for better, embankment one way, horse guards the other, Trafalgar square minutes away.  Would recommend the afternoon tea at the National Portrait gallery.  After attending a show we came back to Massimo for late dinner, truly lovely with excellent service.  We then retired to Bassoon bar for cocktails and live music from Daniel Walker, lovely end to the night. Can say from the minute we arrived to the minute we left the service from all staff is excellent.  Hopefully be back in October as we will be celebrating our children's 18th and 21st birthdays .",5,2014,07,22
143,Magical Evening,"It was my girlfriend's birthday and I wanted to take her to somewhere we had not before dined which was no mean feat as we have both dined in London extensively. I decided upon the Corinthia and am so delighted with the choice. The entire experience was not only faultless but breathtaking on every level. Both of us are experienced diners at good quality establishments and I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. We commenced in the Bassoon Bar where the service was exemplary especially from Tomasz. Superb cocktails. Helpful but not intrusive advice on the cocktail menu. We then dined at the Massimo restaurant except that, knowing that this was a special occasion, the restaurant arranged us a smart but stylish table in the Courtyard. It was intimate and refreshing as the roof to the Courtyard is the open sky! The food was absolutely delicious, well presented, and the attention to detail quite remarkable. Special mention must be made of Joe, our waiter, who attended to our every need but in a respectful and unobtrusive way. Courteous and kind, I cannot praise Joe enough. The maitre'd of the restaurant took time to visit us in the Courtyard to ensure that we were content - as content we were. Again, courteous to a fault and highly professional. The wine was perfect for a summer's dining experience. On every level, this hotel must rank as one of the best in London. We have experienced many levels of service and fare in the capital and beyond but I cannot recommend the hotel enough.",5,2014,07,22
143,Overall experience,"Excellent  hotel, in all respects from Food and drink to service and attention to detail.  Staff were welcoming and made one feel at home pointing out the various locations around the hotel area that were important for the guest to know.  Hotel had background music but this was subtle and not intrusive.  Although busy there was no rushing around with sufficient staff available to meet all guest's needs. Impressive bathroom with a large shower room easily accessible if guests disabled and impressed by the ability to watch television in the bath.",5,2014,07,21
143,Back Again!,"A return to London so a return to the Corinthia. As excellent as I remember. Rooms are spacious, elegant and tastefully appointed. All the restaurants are great as is the the Bassoon Piano bar, the latter a lovely place to bring friends for a pre dinner drink. Centrally located ,I still cannot fault this wonderful hotel. Try the Spa for an amazing experience. I'll be back again!",5,2014,07,20
143,Business Trip,"I used the Corinthia for a corporate trip for 30 people. The service was outstanding, the location brilliant and the accommodation was excellent. My only gripe would be the cost of breakfast which was slightly excessive. The staff on the conceirge desk were excellent as were the staff in the meeting rooms who were on hand and able to look after every query. The waiting staff in the lobby area were also excellent, in particular Joe who looked after us amazingly. I would use the hotel again and highly recommend it for corporate use.",5,2014,07,18
143,"A hotel worthy of the word ""amazing""","The Corinthia hotel is an exceptional hotel. The Corinthia was in the BEST spot for a tourist, right by all the big monuments, but on a street that is not very busy. The only thing about the location that was annoying (but this is the case with basically ALL of London) is that it is 1 hour and 15 minutes to Gatwick airport, 45 minutes to Heathrow airport, 1 hour to Stansted airport, and 30 minutes to London City Airport; but for travelers taking the train, the St. Pancras International Railroad Station is only 15 minutes away. The Corinthia hotel almost couldn't have been better. The staff (other than one concierge), the rooms, the guest's (we saw Jim Parsons and Pharell Williams), the spa/gym, and the food was all simply amazing. Here are the following ratings for the following categories.

Cleanliness: 10/10 (very clean)
Staff: 9/10 (all very good, one very rude concierge) 
Room: 10/10 (REALLY big for European hotel rooms)
Gym: 10/10 (SUPERB)
Spa: 10/10 (like nothing you have ever seen before)
Location: 9.5/10 (really good other than the fact it was really far from the airports)
Hotel Grounds: 9/10 (beautiful)
Sleep Quality: 8/10 (really comfy beds, the shades weren't great and the A/C wasn't so good)
Service: 9.5/10 (very good service)
Restaurant: 10/10 (GREAT FOOD)
Room Service: 9.5/10 (really great room service)
Airport Transfers: 7.5/10 (the driver was very nice but didn't really get that we weren't in the mood for a long discussion and a quick tour of the area of the hotel)
Bathroom: 10/10 (very deluxe bathrooms)
Hotel Amenities: 10/10 (hotel had many amenities and all of them were amazing)
Room Amenities: 9/10 (a decent amount of amenities, just some of them were VERY expensive)

OVERALL SCORE: 151/160 (94%)",5,2014,07,17
143,Simply the Best!,"My family had stayed at this hotel on a couple of previous occasions and raved about it.  This was my first time and I have to say that I was quite impressed.  The location is ideal as you are able to walk to the London Eye, Embankment Pier (to access river boats), Buckingham Palace, the Mall, Whitehall, the Houses of Parliament, and many fine restaurants.  We were greeted upon arrival and our room was ready at 10 am so we were able to drop off our bags and start sightseeing right away.  The room was beautifully appointed, spacious, and impeccably clean.  If we needed anything, the housekeeping staff were extremely attentive and took care of any of our requests very quickly.  The concierge staff were very helpful...helped me solve a problem I was having with tickets for an event and always found us a wonderful place to eat.  We enjoyed the full breakfast in the dining room and everything was delicious...yes, it is expensive, but the food and service were impressive...the staff called us by name and knew any dietary restrictions we had.  Overall, a wonderful experience and I (any my family) would definitely stay there again.",5,2014,07,14
143,One of the best,"This is definitely a favorite hotel of mine - its smart and classy and beautiful. The service and atmosphere is quality. The room decor is beautiful although not modern
it definitely feels like an world class hotel with an impressive reception.
its pricey but worth it. You feel expensive",5,2014,07,14
143,First rate accomodation,"The Corinthia Whitehall is a very classy and modern establishment.  I had to spend a night in London recently and a friend had suggested that I stay at the Corinthia and I must say that I was pleased that I did.  The lady at check-in and the concierge were most helpful and made me feel very welcome.
There was dim sum available for the buffet breakfast and that was definitely scrumptious.
The only negative was the set up of some things in the room and bathroom were a bit awkward.  From the set up of the tea/coffee things, you were definitely not being encouraged to make yourself a cup of tea.  The towelling robe in the bathroom was also quite inconvenient.
All in all though, a good experience and I will recommend this hotel",4,2014,07,14
143,Classy Hotel in a Fabulous Location,"We were part of a group, slight delay on check in (at 1300hrs), some of the group's rooms were ready and some weren't, as we had a set itinerary this was a little annoying, the receptionist kept saying official check in was at 3, not overly apologetic and we had no where to freshen up for a couple of hours, and ate our afternoon tea without the chance to freshen up,because of this I rated the hotel very good instead of excellent. The Northall bar service was hit and miss and had to ask for our drinks on more than one occasion, we all had a set meal and the food was good, again, there was a wait and the sauce for my steak arrived far too late ( we had all pre-ordered so not difficult) 
The rooms were lovely, very clean, no water on arrival and a bit bemused by a plate of three apples and knives and forks on the table, however turn down service provided the water.
The bathroom was fantastic, double sinks, shower and a fitted LED TV on the wall at the base of the bath, pure luxury! the AC was quiet and effective. would love to stay here again but must sort out the service and reception welcome could be improved.",4,2014,07,13
143,Fantastic Hotel!,"We had a spectacular time staying at the Corinthia Hotel. The location was great - basically within walking distance to almost everything and very close to a tube station and a river boat pier. We were there to celebrate a very special occasion and the Hotel upgraded our room to a junior suite at no extra charge. The suite included a large bedroom with beautiful built in shelves/cabinets, a king size bed, a dressing room/closet, and an enormous bathroom. All the staff were friendly and very accommodating. The concierge staff were very helpful, and their desk was always well staffed. In particular, Sebastian could not do enough to help with plans and arrangements. He was very enthusiatic, had great ideas, and patiently explained everything. There were usually taxis waiting right outside the door, but if not, the door men were quite resourceful at getting a taxi there within a few minutes.

The only negative: The continental breakfast and any other snacks, etc. served at the hotel were ridiculously expensive, even for hotels. After suffering sticker shock on our first morming, we found a nice cafe right around the corner that had much more reasonable prices.

Some sightseeing highlights: Hyde Park, river boat tour, Tower of London, Harrod's, Oxford Street shopping area. The Borough Market was amazing and not too far from the Tower of London. The full market is open Wednesdays through Saturdays.  Hyde Park is fantastic and quite large. There is a bike sharing station right near the Wellington Arch, which we noticed after we left the park. Riding bikes into the park would be a great way to explore it. Buckingham Palace is fun to see, but the Changing of the Guard was very, very crowded. 

When we come back to London, we will definitely stay at the Corninthia.",5,2014,07,02
143,One of the best,"This is definitely a favorite hotel of mine - its smart and classy and beautiful.  The service and atmosphere is quality.  The room decor is beautiful although not modern edgy as expected - the themes are neutral and in offensive.
it definitely feels like an world class hotel with an impressive reception.
its pricey but worth it.  You feel expensive.",5,2014,07,02
143,London Stay at the Corinthia Hotel London,"Our experience staying at the Corinthia Hotel was amazing, the hotel is tucked away from the busy streets of London, yet it is within walking distance to many tourist attractions.  The hotel staff is great, very friendly and always ready to please their customer.  We highly recommend the Corinthia and we look forward to staying there again upon our next trip to London.",5,2014,07,01
143,Weekend Break - Still Amazing,"This is our second stay here and we were in a Deluxe Junior Suite. It had a nice small balcony that faced the inner courtyard. Compared to our last stay which was in a regular room, this room was huge, especially the bathroom and walk-in closet. 

We had a black-tie affair to attend so we had the hotel press our suits and shirts, which they did a splendid job of. The only quip that I have is that for a hotel of its caliber, offering to press a garment free-of-charge would be a nice touch. I didn't like having to pay an extra 100 quid after already paying what we did for the room. This is the only issue I had, however, as everything else was up to the wonderful standards we had experienced on our first stay here.

We were given a complementary bottle of champagne on arrival which was a nice touch, and also fresh fruit and bottled water each evening.

We had cocktails in the Bassoon Bar again. This is by far the most amazing cocktail lounge I have ever been in. Having aperitifs before our party was so nice, being all dressed to the nines. 

We also had Sunday brunch at the Northall, and it was amazing. We were not rushed, and the food was impeccable.

We will definitely return. Keep in mind that this is not a cheap hotel, but the service is what makes it stand out!",5,2014,07,01
143,One of the best in London,Stayed in a junior suite. Brilliant room and bathroom. Easy checkin. Brilliant staff. Great bar with great range of cocktails made to perfection. Lobby is brilliant with afternoon there. Their restaurant has a great range of food and is priced well.,5,2014,07,01
143,Luxuriously modern yet comfortable.,"This hotel is in the perfect location for those wanting to explore London while staying in beautifully luxurious surroundings. The rooms were very comfortable and very well designed. The highlights were definitely the bathroom (with a tv over the tub and Espa toiletries) and the much needed Nespresso machine. They were also spotlessly clean and a good size, perfect for a short city break. 

The breakfast had a great selection of both healthy food with plenty of vegetarian options and the service was both friendly and attentive. Another highlight is the Espa Spa which is a welcome retreat from the busy city. I highly recommend it,partly for the fantastic service, and partly for the great location.",5,2014,06,30
143,Wonderful Hotel!,"My family of 5 stayed here for three days and wished we could have stayed longer.  The rooms were modern, spacious, beautifully appointed and functioned well.  The A/C worked perfectly, the bathrooms were wonderful-rain shower and hand held in the shower stall, nice deep soaking tub, separate room for the commode, lots of amenities.  Lovely fruit plate awaited us on arrival.  Excellent in-room tea and coffee, nice linens and pillows.  Our rooms faced the inner courtyard so were wonderfully quiet.  Service was excellent from the front desk, to the concierge, to housekeeping, breakfast and the spa.  The spa is large and beautiful.  Children under 16 are allowed in the pools 3 hours every day.  It is a nice break after sightseeing to spend a little down time in the various pools, sauna and steam room before heading out again for the evening.  The location is great, walking distance to London Eye, Globe Theater, Parliament, Trafalgar Square, Covent Garden and right across the street from the Embankment tube stop.  We have been to London several times and out daughter recently stayed at a Corinthia in Budapest so we thought we would try the London property.  We plan to come back here again and hopefully allow time for a spa service!",5,2014,06,30
143,"Wow, simply perfect!","As you can see in my prior posts I travel often with my family and have high expectations.  On every count location, sleep quality, service, comfort The Corinthia simply exceeds.  As a family, traveling with 6 & 9 yr old it beat all Four Seasons we have stayed at and equaled he Montage Deer Valley.  If you have any reason to be in London you would be hard pressed to find a more exceptional hotel!  Three nights was not enough we look forward to out return.",5,2014,06,30
143,New luxury in London,"Recently stayed at this newer beauty right at the Thames.  The place has terrific space and scope, from the public areas (they even have a mini Harrods kiosk off the lobby!) to the guest rooms, this hotel was designed & built by folks who definitely know what they are doing.  The flower arrangements in the  public areas remind me of the Georges V in Paris.  The color palate is soothing, the furnishings stylish yet comfortable, and the hotel has an overall vibe of hushed luxury.  All of this comes at a price, and a rather high one at that; they ran a special in April when we stayed there and it was expensive but worth it, but when I checked the prices for my return last week, the price went up nearly 40%, putting it at the same price level as the Connnaught, Savoy and Berkeley.  The bathrooms are large and very well put together.  However, beware of ordering the Continental breakfast- the menu is misleading and you are charged per person, not per  double occupancy.  The breakfast is of only average quality yet is extremely expensive.  But the afternoon tea is of average price for this type of establishment and is very tasty.
If the hotel were located in a nicer area (Mayfair, Kinghtsbridge, Belgravia), I might consider returning, but it is in the Embankment area, right along the river at the Waterloo bridge, which means for the most part one has to trudge through the throngs of tourists to get to those areas which have the best shopping and restaurants.  If you need to  be in this area or don't mind the crowds, this hotel is a real beauty.",5,2014,06,29
143,Perfect in every way!,"Can't say enough about this wonderful hotel!  The location was perfect to walk everywhere.  The service was outstanding - no need to ask for anything but if you do the request appears instantly. The rooms were lovely and spacious and the entire feel of the hotel was wonderful.  The concierge staff was excellent - special thanks to Sahil and Max for great restaurant suggestions and overall help directing us to where we wanted to go - bonus was securing fabulous seats for Book of Mormon!
The only suggestion I would make, is to provide an electrical outlet for hair dryer in bathroom!!",5,2014,06,29
143,Afternoon tea and drinks.,"I have had afternoon tea three times previously but have finally decided to write a review.
Upon arrival I was greeted by name and seated promptly.
We opted for the Wimbledon Afternoon tea with champagne, the scones, gin & tonic jelly and chocolate ganache were my personal favourites. It also wouldn't be Wimbledon tea without a bowl of strawberries which were also nice. All our requests were readily attended to, so many thanks to the lobby lounge team especially Magda.
Afterwards we decide upon some cocktails at the Bassoon bar, many thanks to Domenico and his team for the wonderful cocktails.",5,2014,06,29
143,Best hotel in best location,"Loved our stay at the fabulous Corinthia. Not only is the hotel gorgeous, with large rooms and huge bathrooms, it is situated centrally close to everything you want to see in London! Each of the bars and restaurants were different and beautiful. We easily walked to the Trafalgar Square, Covent Garden Market and theater district, Parliament, Westminster, and Buckingham Palace.",5,2014,06,29
143,"Not Recommended, Not Justified for its Price!!!! ""Beware"" & ""Stay Away""","With the price they charged, is way-overvalued, over-rated.. 
I stay in Deluxe for 4 consecutive nights just the past week, the only 2 good I could highlight is room make-up staff and the F&B restaurant's staff.

But their concierge, don't expect you can call them once you are outside the hotel, 2 occasions when I was outside trying to call concierge to amend restaurant reservation time. No one @ concierge picked my call. One time I tried calling 4 times no one picked, and hotel operator tried to connect twice also not successful. I am a traveler from Asia and wasted my roaming charges on my phone. Another case was when I was in room, asked them to make a reservation of a restaurant, they said will call back, but half hour after I called them back, the concierge said no one had my instruction, I was astonished what kind of service is this when you are being charged with a Palace service rating price per night at Corinthia but they provide you service worst than what you could think of. What's wrong?????  Before I went London, I was at Paris, staying with Le Royal Monceau, their consierge service is like heaven (true Palace rating), while Corinthia.... vice versa. Because of this, I dare not to ask any shops I visited in London to send merchandises to Corinthia, I am not even sure if anyone will take care of my stuff.

Restaurant, nicely decorated with most part of the hotel, staff as mentioned great, but the breakfast buffet disappointing because is not providing a full English breakfast.... even you have nice waffles / berries doesn't help at all.... big buffet table but makes me felt use ""less""...

Security, perhaps the hotel has high hope on its hidden camera or no ones dare to commit any bad things in the building, but no staff or anyone attending at the other side of the door facing Charing Cross Station.  One night when myself and my wife came back taking elevator at the R level which is the lowest level on the concierge floor. 2 suspicious men were in the elevator claiming the elevator was going down, they don't look like hotel guests to me due to their unfamiliarity to the elevator. I felt a bit unsafe given the complex is so big.  Fortunate my room is near the elevators, but if you live farther away the corridor and if you know non-hotel guests could walk around the premises this feeling is not good.

In all, even the hotel sales tell me how much the owner of the group spent hundred millions pounds on renovating this.  With such service, I doubt how far can this business model maintains. perhaps over-pricing us the customers helped them to survive another day.  I am not sure if they provide corporate rate for its corporate customers, but personal stay, I say ""Beware"" & ""Stay Away""!",2,2014,06,29
143,Perfection!,"This is the first review I have ever written a review for Trip advisor, and I am doing it because I had the absolute best stay at the Corinthia hotel London. Complete perfection from check in, room, SPA, room service, breakfast, location, staff, to check out! If you want a luxurious stress free stay, in the perfect location to see everything in London and indulge in one of the best spas, and eat some of the best food, book your self a room at the Corinthia! You will be a happy person, and leave counting the days till your return! Thank you Corinthia for making my anniversary trip pure PERFECTION!",5,2014,06,28
143,Stay Here,"My wife and I have stayed in 5 Star hotels all over the world and this it at the top of our list.  It is always easier to complain then say something nice.  At this hotel I have not one complaint.  Location is great, especially if you like the theater, beds and bathroom are wonderful, great restaurants, wonderful staff, including Justin at the concierge desk who found great theater tickets with very little notice.  In all fairness it didn't hurt that we were in a suite which made our stay even better. This hotel is not for the budget conscious (as is the case with many London hotels) but if you can afford to stay here, do.",5,2014,06,28
143,"Wimbledon Afternoon Tea, Feel Short Changed","This was in celebration for my mother's birthday and gathering with my Auntie.  
The Venue is lovely and cosy, overall we did enjoy the experience as it was a nice gathering for Mum and Auntie.  

The disappointment which we did not expect to experience within a 5 star hotel for a 5 star afternoon tea is that we felt short changed and overcharged for what we received.  We ordered the 3 Wimbledon Afternoon Tea sets at the cost of £45pp and when it was served it was not 3 Full sets and for most of the cakes it was either one or 2 of each kind (we looked at each other and said, should we be sharing some of these cakes as we did not get one each).  I questioned the waitress that there seem to be some cakes missing should we not get one of each cake per person?  Was not sure if she understood what I mean and then she went away and came back with a few more cakes but still not complete the 3 sets.  We felt uncomfortable to ask her again to complete the set because she already brought over 3 more cakes, and it would look like we were being greedy for asking more cakes when we had not even started.  The principle of things is that we ordered 3 sets therefore 3 FULL sets should be served and we should not feel that we are sharing 2 afternoon tea sets between 3 persons and paying for 3!

Although we can request for more cakes but it should only be if we want extra not because cakes were missing from our set. Therefore, we did not feel  satisfied that we did not receive the full set for the full price we paid.  Consequently have been overcharged.

Would advise that if you do go for the afternoon tea and if there is more than one of you, check that you have received the full sets each and should not be the case that you have to share the cakes!",3,2014,06,27
143,Very nice indeed.,"We stopped at the Corinthia over a weekend found it extremely pleasant. Although we were on a hectic schedule we managed to meet many of the staff and, as I suppose you would expect, they were politefulness and hospitality personified. Great 'indoors/outdoors in the middle of the hotel with the fires burning where could have a cigarette - very civilised and, as it was February, very much appreciated. Superb breakfast in bed and great place to stop.",5,2014,06,25
143,Anniversary Celebration,"We have used a number of hotels in London and did not seem to have the found the right one for us.  The Corinthia solved this issue for us, the overall architectural style, great staff, good location and brilliant accommodation set it apart.  In all details it has outshone all previous stays; the breakfast room and food was excellent and the bar area very relaxing for both evening drinks and a short business meeting.  Staff all levels were very polite and helpful.  We would might chose a room facing Whitehall or the internal garden next time; but I think we have found our London destination hotel",5,2014,06,24
143,Great service and beautiful hotel,"Very impressed with the service by all the staff members as well as the cleaniless of the rooms. Typical to all the rooms in England, the room wasn't the biggest even though we were staying in a superior king room. 

The hotel is centrally located right by Trafalgar Square by the Charing Cross and Embankment stations. The doorman and the concierge were extremely friendly and always available for any assistance. 

Actually ran into a number of celebrities staying at the hotel as well as an added bonus.

I highly recommend staying here (if you can afford it). By far one of the best hotels in London that I have stayed at.",5,2014,06,22
143,Afternoon tea delight,"The afternoon tea started wonderfully with a glass of champagne , then followed by delicious sandwiches. Then I ordered the wedding white tea and it was amazing. The waiter was super friendly and helpful. The only thing that I wanted was more scones because they were just so delicious and I only got two. The desserts are the reason I only give four starts, a bit of disappointment and I didn't really enjoy  any of them. More scones next time!",4,2014,06,21
143,Spoil yourself!,"Simply wonderful!  We had the joy of celebrating my daughter's wedding at The Corinthia, which in turn meant we stayed the weekend there too.  The staff are the most professional I have ever met, everyone is friendly, courteous, and helpful.  Nothing is too much trouble. We were all upgraded upon arrival, and the bride and groom were given The River Suite on their wedding night.  The bedrooms are simply sumptuous, the bathrooms luxurious, towels plentiful, I don't want to say too much more, discover the little treats for yourselves....if you have something special to celebrate in London, this is the place to do it!",5,2014,06,19
143,"Excellent hotel, nice blend of old and new, good location and service","Great stay throughout, from check in and the staff, the room, the bathroom, the bed, and room service and general atmosphere.  The room was great with a large bathroom with floor to ceiling marble with a great shower head / water pressure (and a tub).  They rushed up appropriate power converters and the bellman went out of his way to bring me extra bottled water.  Would highly recommend for business travelers or otherwise.",5,2014,06,18
143,"Elegance, Service beyond description, location, location!","After spending three glorious nights at this beautiful hotel, all that one can think is 'how lucky we were to have found it'. The renovation of this landmark building is magnificent. Attention to detail is obvious at every look. The immense chandelier in the lobby is breath-taking. Food and drink are plentiful and quite delicious. Breakfast buffet has all the luxury items to start a great day. Drinks after the theater or opera are a great way to close a perfect day in London. 

Our room, an upgrade to a suite, could not have been better. Large, modern, stunningly designed and decorated. A closet that was immense. The bath, as many have mentioned, is sumptuous. Very large shower and deep, deep tub. Hidden doors close off this area from the main bedroom. The large work table, aka desk, actually works. Great for planning your next adventure. Who needs to work when there is so much to see and do within easy walking.
The best aspect of this great hotel is the staff. Concierge are knowledgeable and super friendly. All staff seemed to love being a part of making this the Premier hotel in London. Can't wait to return!",5,2014,06,17
143,Excellent hotel and wedding venue,"Everything about this hotel is amazing. My wife and I had our wedding at the hotel and during the planning process we got to know it and the staff quite well. Simply cannot say a bad thing about the Corinthia. Everything is excellent, all the restaurants, the bars, the ballroom, the rooms and suites. Highly recommended!",5,2014,06,17
143,"EXCELLENT HOTEL!  We are ""world travelers"" and this hotel is the best hotel we have ever stayed in.","I took my Family of eleven, ages 20-78 May 18-22, 2014.  We had five gorgeous rooms--all very large along with a Jr. Suite.  Our rooms were on the 5th floor with #543/546 (balcony) being the largest with a hall, walk in closet, huge double sink bathroom w/separate toilet & bidet, separate shower and tub.  The bedroom was  very large with a Nespresso maker (we just bought one because of that experience.).  The building was a prior Defense building converted into this luxurious hotel three years ago.  it is lined with copper making it the most quiet room we have ever been in.  The bed linens were like climbing into a silken womb.  Even more extraordinary than the hotel's amenities and size was the STAFF!!  Whenever we entered the lobby or the restaurant, we were hovered over by this amazing group of people.  Our slightest wish was immediately acted upon.  Above all, the Concierge were exceptional.  Max Endacott, Concierge, helped me plan our trip in London since last December.  We must have exchanged at least 200 emails.  Max never failed to get back to me.  If Max had the day off, others immediately emailed me to answer my questions.  Sahil, the first concierge I was in contact with in December actually called me to help me create an itinerary for me to present to my Family as their Christmas present.  I have never encountered such a caring Staff in any hotel I/we have stayed in; and, we always stay in 5 Star hotels.  The location is perfect.  The buffet breakfast is outstanding.  We would meet for breakfast and have lots of fun discussing the day's itinerary and really enjoyed the wide variety of food along with the very responsive wait staff.  all of my children and grandchildren ""loved"" the Spa!!!  I can never say enough about this glorious hotel.  We all want to ""live"" there.  I continue to dream about our experience and cannot wait to go back.  Donna/Aspen",5,2014,06,14
143,Luxury day spa visit.,Went with my daughter for a relaxing day.  The spa is really beautiful and the staff were lovely.  The treatments were very good and the whole experience would have been excellent except that I was taken to have my pedicure in a robe and had to sit on a dais beside a fully clothed man who was bellowing into his phone.  Apparently there was nowhere else where I could be seated.  I go to the spa for peace and quiet so I was on the point of cancelling my pedicure.   I had to ask him how long he was going to be on the phone as the therapist said it was up to him.  Fortunately he agreed to finish his call up. However I do not feel that it was my responsibility to police other guests and I am surprised that there is not a phone free policy.,4,2014,06,14
143,Outstanding,"We stayed in the Corinthia last night. It was a surprise gift and we were absolutely delighted. The level of service is excellent. Everyone who dealt with us was helpful, efficient and very friendly.  The hotel itself is beautiful - the attention to detail is really noticeable. We spent as much time in the spa as we could. It is the best I have ever been to. I could go on and on - the food was superb, the flowers were lovely, the room was beautiful. I really can't praise this hotel highly enough. We will definitely return. ",5,2014,06,13
143,An experience!,"Let me first ask you the following: Is there such a thing as perfection?

The Corinthia hotel in London is a 5 star hotel, perfectly positioned in the centre of London and is known as one of the very best hotels in the city. Trafalgar Square, the London Eye and Big Ben are all close by (walking distance). You can reach this hotel easily by public transport, taxi or car. 

When you reach the Corinthia you will notice the beautiful building. It once was the majestic hotel Métropole, which opened in 1885. Later it became the building of the Ministry of Defense. In 2011 the Corinthia hotel in London opened its doors. Today it still is the flagship hotel of the Corinthia hotel group offering the most luxurious accommodations in London and even in the entire United Kingdom. 

As we entered the hotel, the lobby was one of the nicest we had ever seen. We were greeted immediately with a smile, always nice! During check-in we were told that we had been upgraded to one of their Junior Suites. A very friendly lady showed us the room and as soon as she opened the door we were very impressed by how unbelievably luxurious and clean those rooms were. It was like this room had never been used before. The Junior Suites at the Corinthia London have an average size of 47 m². They all have a “super king sized” bed, a dressing room, a most comfortable sitting area and a chaise longue. The Italian marble en-suite bathroom features an oversized bath tub with in-built high definition tub TV, a separate tropical rain shower and ESPA products. I actually took the ESPA shampoo home with me, it smells and feels SO nice! Never had such great toiletries.

After inspecting and getting a feel of our gorgeous room, we went on to explore the hotel. Believe me that around every corner there is a new surprise waiting for you. This hotel is well known for its service and details and I can understand why. Every single staff member I saw during my entire stay greeted me with a smile and most even remembered my name, which left me very impresse! As we went back to the lobby, a staff member showed us around the hotel. We went to the Spa area and to be honest, I couldn’t believe my eyes when I entered this dream world… In 2013 the ESPA Life at the Corinthia was voted best spa in Europe! It also is the largest spa in London with 4 floors of black marble luxury. There are 2 pools: one steel 9 meter swimming pool and one vitality pool, a large amphitheatre-style sauna and steam room, marble heated relaxing chairs, ice fountain and so on. There are relaxing areas all over the place. You should definitely check out the “sleep pods” with the central fire place in the changing rooms: these are very quiet and intimate spaces where you can chill out while enjoying relaxing music, fresh fruit and water. The fitness room is well equipped with high class training facilities. There are personal trainers on duty as well. Oh, and don’t bring your own headphones, they have some right there waiting for you.

The Corinthia London has 2 restaurants: the Northall (British cuisine) and Massimo (Italian cuisine). We had dinner at Massimo. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and truly has this Italian vibe. The food was delicious. I can highly recommend the beef carpaccio, which was the best I’ve ever had! Service again was top-notch, not snobby and they really make you feel at ease. Very nice! The sommelier is a very kind guy with an outstanding knowledge of wines.
The next morning we were able to try out the other restaurant, the Northall. Again, very classy! Breakfast was of a very high quality and offered a  good variety of hot and cold items. There were several options: buffet, à la carte or both. We tried both and did not regret it. From the delicious latte macchiato to the freshly made carrot cake… I loved every single bite and sip. By the way, the “Corinthia’s hot chocolate” is to die for! It comes with marshmallows and fresh whipped cream…

The Corinthia in London is not just a hotel, staying here truly is an experience. After having stayed at many hotels, I was really impressed by this one! It offers a perfect mix of elegance,  gorgeous rooms, delicious food and the most attentive staff. Perfection does exist and I can easily understand why the Corinthia is rated as one of the very best hotels in London!

143,an Excellent hotel,"There is nothing  which is too much trouble. The service is exceptional and consistently so.
The River Suit we had was fantastic - great layout, view of the river.
We will definitely be staying here again.",5,2014,06,09
143,First Class Experience,"From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave, it is absolutely brilliant. 

All the staff from beginning to end we're extremely polite and helpful, but not so much it was overwhelming - it was just right. Every single one of them seemed to strive to be as helpful as possible and I never felt as though I was being rushed or stupid - even when I left my key card in the room and had to ask for a new one! 

We were taken up to a fantastic room with excellent facilities. The room was very large - we were in an Executive King - and had everything you could possible want in there. And even if it wasn't in the room, you could almost guarantee that you could ask Housekeeping and they would have it for you. 

After settling in, we decided we would use the spa facilities. It was very easy to get to, via the dedicated spa lift, and very easy to use. Unfortunately, we did not get chance to sample any of the treatments, but I have no doubt that these would have also been excellent if the pool & vitality pool are anything to go by. Robes, towels and shoes were provided for the spa area which was a lovely touch.
I can also recommend the Daniel Galvin hair salon which provided me with the best haircut I've ever had, for a rather reasonable price considering its fame.

In the evening, we decided to use the Northall bar and Bassoon. Both of which were fantastic, but the cocktails in Bassoon were on another level. I can thoroughly recommend Bassoon for both it's cocktails and it's setting. 

We decided to eat in the Italian restaurant and Oyster Bar, Massimo. Based in the hotel, it was five star food at convenience. There are few restaurants in London with better food than here. The beef carpaccio was superb, as was my tagliolini with crab and chilli. The wine choices were great too. 
Our waiter was absolutely brilliant, he made us feel very welcome and comfortable and as though nothing was too much trouble. 

After our meal, we came back to the room to find water by the bed, the bed turned down, slippers laid out on the floor and mood lightning on which was perfect after a tiring day in London. The pillows were unbelievably comfortable which allowed me to have an excellent nights sleep.

In the morning, we chose to use the extensive breakfast buffet in The Northall bar. Everything you could possible want was there and all of it delicious. The staff were, again, lovely and happy to get you anything you could ask for. 

Finally, checking out was very easy, and the concierge were very accommodating with taking our luggage for a few hours.

All in all, I was extremely impressed and would absolutely love to come back again - even if it was just to go to the hair salon!",5,2014,06,08
143,Stunning in every way,"From the moment you walk up the steps and enter this fine hotel you get the feeling it's going to be good, and you won't be disappointed.
The staff are highly professional, yet still manage to have personalities, to me that's a very good sign of the high standards of the Corinthia.
The rooms are lovely too, nice little touches all over and the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. The only food we ate in the hotel was breakfast, that was pretty outstanding also. Although this place is a little bit of a luxury, we will definitely return. Great location to boot .. It deserves it high rating on trip advisor   ",5,2014,06,08
143,Classy and the staff are well trained which I enjoyed most...,"I have been to many hotels in London from The ritz,Dorchester,Savoy,etc,..but tell you honestly,what I really enjoyed here was the professional and treatment of the staff.i never feel neglected or neither unwanted not bec.im Asian but I feel the sincerity of their service and this is the most important thing that a customer should look for,,over all from the 3 main course food and drinks superb and totally generous amount serving..this hotel deserve highly recommended to everyone and for sure will coming back soon....",5,2014,06,05
143,Words cannot express how wonderful our experience was.......,".......but I will try my best to explain.

Corinthia London has been on our 'list of hotels' to stay in for a couple of years now.  We had regularly visited the Northall restaurant for Sunday lunch, and had vowed to make a weekend of it one day.  With an Anniversary and and my husband's birthday within the same week it was the perfect opportunity.

The way we were treated upon first stepping foot into the hotel was seamless and perfect.  The brisk yet gentle approach of the porter to whisk our bag away before we'd even approached the check in desk was excellent, and it was delivered to our room moments after we entered it.  

We were very, very grateful for the kind upgrade to an Executive Room. We were personally escorted by the same lady that had checked us in, and given a brief rundown of the rooms facilities.  It was beautiful, perfect and with superb attention to detail.  The bathroom is out of this world and the wonderful bath with built in television was well used. The rainfall shower was fantastic and the ESPA toiletries a luxurious addition. 

The room was a very good size, with a separate lobby and walk in wardrobe. The decor was 100% our taste, and the bed really was like a dream to sleep in.

We visited the spa for an hour in the afternoon and very much enjoyed using the facilities. We had debating between visiting St Paul's Cathedral or going to the spa - this was a silly thing to even debate; the spa was superb - next time I'll be booking a treatment too.

Sunday Jazz Brunch in the Northall was a treat as always.  The staff were very accommodating of some of the tweaks I requested to my dishes and the Sommelier was great. Our only regret was not visiting the Bassoon Bar and next time we'd have a post-theatre dinner in Massimo - in other words we'd plan to spend as much time in the hotel as possible despite what London has to offer!

I can't say much more, other than to agree with all of the other glowing reviews - Corinthia really is 'all that', and more.  I was concerned that I'd be expecting too much due to the excitement that had built up in the days leading to our special (child-free) stay, but expectations were not only met, they were blown out of the water. 

There is this constant, serene, elegance that flows around you when you are in the hotel and I am pining to go back to experience it all over again. We are already planning our next trip in January, see you again soon Corinthia, and thank you for a most memorable stay.",5,2014,06,03
143,Devil's in the details!,"Expectations were high when we checked in using the Fine Hotels and Resorts program from American Express, which promises a free upgrade, when available. I asked the young woman registering us if we had been upgraded and she assured me that we had, but this was not true. The two rooms we received were exactly of the category we had reserved. I was peeved about this and made note that the hotel was far from full. Most of the rooms on our floor did not have newspapers or do not disturb signs, and the elevators and lounges were not heavily occupied--all a clear indication that there were likely better rooms available. I haven't yet sent my feedback to Amex, but they should know that the Corinthia misrepresented the rooms as an upgrade.

The rooms were beautifully designed and furnished, very luxurious and well thought out. However, the bathrobe provided surprisingly had several tears in the lapel. I draped it over the chair to expose the problem, and the next day the housekeeper had put it right back on the hook in the bathroom. Sloppy!

We had a good late dinner at Massimo's-- a beautiful room, but the service was sorely lacking. Our wine and water glasses were not refilled without repeated requests, and the food took a very long time to appear.  Yes, it was late, but the prices do not go down as the evening wears on, and neither should the service. 

Even worse was the breakfast  the following morning, when we were herded into a waiting area, and after a half hour had been jammed into a tiny table next to a sea of dirty dishes and not served a thing. The manager apologized and said she had been brought in to rectify the service, which was clearly a problem. The table was reset, and we finally ate, but the experience left us convinced that our breakfast the following day would be via room service.

Finally, I inadvertently left behind a pair of shoes and have had repeated correspondence with the housekeeping department at the hotel trying to get them sent back to me. Apparently, they require an authorization to use my credit card to ship them to me, with no estimate of the cost or limit on the price they will charge. 

The hotel is beautiful, the staff was friendly, and the night engineer was kind enough to deliver some batteries to my room for a luggage scale I had purchased. I travel to London often, and usually stay at smaller boutique hotels where the attention to detail is better. The Corinthia is very beautiful, but there is definitely room for improvement.

If management reads this review, please let me know how I can reclaim my shoes without spending more than they are worth!",3,2014,06,01
143,So much more enjoyable than the Savoy!,"My partner and I stayed for 3 nights at the Corinthia last weekend.  I had been wanting to try the hotel for a while and a business and leisure trip afforded me the opportunity.  From the moment of arrival it was a wonderful experience.  The hotel itself is understated elegance with considerate but discreet staff, many of whom remembered our names throughout our stay.  The suits was beautifully finished with the most amazing shower and bathroom….. thats what I call proper water pressure - as it should be!  We enjoyed a relaxing Saturday afternoon in the Espa with gorgeously relaxing treatments.  Having stayed in the Savoy earlier in the year I can say the Corinthia wins hands down in every possible way.  Amazing, thank you.  I look forward to returning very soon.",5,2014,06,01
143,Blown away,"Wow what a hotel. Although rather large which often looses the charm if any hotel this visit was simply amazing. The staff were wonderful from check in to check out. We arrived and visited the spa which is out of this world, much better some of the others in London hotels now. We stayed in a delux junior suite which had everything you needed and a beautiful balcony. We stayed up for drinks in the bassoon bar with some great live music and even better cocktails. 
Will be back to this hotel in an instant, a new favourite for our London breaks. ",5,2014,06,01
143,A home away from home,"I have had the pleasure of staying at the Corinthia in London for about 7 weeks over March-April 2014 as we were visiting London for business. I had stayed in other Corinthia hotels in Malta and in Prague but I was just taken aback by their flagship hotel in London. 

From the impeccably stylish décor, the magnificent lobby which is decorated daily with fresh flowers, the little details in service and the friendly yet courteous staff, we felt very much at ease and it really did feel as a home away from home. 

The rooms are bright and airy and the beds are just so comfortable! The spa area which is spread on 4 floors serves as an oasis of tranquility in stark contrast to the hustle and bustle of the city. As great food lovers we were entirely spoilt for choice. A lavish breakfast buffet is served in the Northall Restaurant, I used to stick to a lighter option- eggs benedict which were always prepared to perfection. High tea is served in the lobby under a magnificent chandelier or al fresco in their internal courtyard. We used to have dinner at Massimo's (try the fresh pasta with lobster!). The in-room dining menu is vast and service is truly efficient. 

We would like to thank the whole team of management and staff because they really are the heart and soul of the hotel. I cannot not mention in particular the team of butlers, these guys pre-empt your needs so you won't have to ask! This hotel is run by true hospitaliers and that makes all the difference!",5,2014,05,31
143,Superb Hotel,"This is the most gorgeous hotel with the most spectacular room, views. excellent staff.  I can't rave enough about the service, the beautiful hotel, the great location! We will recommend this hotel to all of our friends. The food and restaurants in the hotel are excellent.  The staff all seem so happy to be here, as were we!!!",5,2014,05,30
143,An Excellent Stay!,"My wife and I stayed for 3 nights during a quick trip to London.  We were already fairly familiar with the area which is one reason we picked the Corinthia.  It is very convenient to get anywhere as the Embankment tube station is just across the street.  Charing Cross is also a very short walk and Waterloo is a brief walk across the river.  
Our stay was amazing from the moment we were picked up at the airport to the moment we were dropped back off.   The drivers in both directions were very polite and did a good job of talking up the hotel.  Our return driver put special emphasis on trying out the Spa which we did not have the opportunity to try on this trip.  
Check in was smooth and quick.  We booked through Amex FHR and were offered an upgrade to an Executive room which was very nice.  They explained the various benefits available to us and then escorted us to our room.   Our bags followed shortly thereafter.  
The room was terrific.  Nice and large, clean, and the rainshower and heated floors in the bathroom were great.  We couldn't find any way to adjust the heat in the floors however, and if we left the bathroom doors closed overnight the bathroom would be very hot in the morning.  I am sure we could have simply called to have it adjusted but we didn't really think about it until the last night.  And let's be honest, complaining that my bathroom floor is a tad warm is not a terrible complaint to have.   
We did stop for a couple of drinks in the Bassoon Bar which was nice.  Although the beer selection was extremely lacking.   The Scotch selection wasn't too bad though so I stuck with that. My wife enjoyed a nice Champagne based cocktail called the King's Speech.
Our rate included breakfast in Northall so we ate there each morning.  We stuck with the buffet which was good although I do wish they offered other hot items or at least varied them a bit each day.  Service was very good each time.  I do recommend sitting in the restaurant section instead of the bar section.  While it is farther from the food, it is a bit quieter.  
All in all, an amazing stay.  The staff were great and the first individual that greeted us when we arrived, made sure to greet us by name each time he saw us.  We will definitely be returning.",5,2014,05,29
143,An excellent and stylish hotel,"The location of this hotel, by Whitehall, transport links and the river, are all excellent. The staff are amazingly helpful and the rooms are well thought out and more modern than the classical architecture of the building would suggest. Did not try the restaurants, which seem on the pricier side, but given the location, there are plenty of options. Highly recommended.",5,2014,05,28
143,Elegant luxury,"This review is a little past due The hotel deserves the high praise it's received and I'll add to that chorus.

First off, there's hard to find any downsides to staying in the Corinthia.  It is truly an elegant and beautiful hotel and you will certainly feel privileged staying there (which you are if you do).

We stayed with our young daughter and they treated her with the same respect and attention as us grown ups; one quality of a great hotel.

What we liked:
- the timeless elegance of it's beautiful design
- the food and restaurants
- drinks in the courtyard
- very quiet rooms

Minor quibble:
- the location isn't as convenient for shows and restaurants, but they really can't do anything about this, so can't be faulted..   Consider the Covent Garden hotel for a better location (IMO).

Highly recommended.",5,2014,05,26
143,Maintaining the highest standards,"Having enjoyed a superb first time stay in January we returned for one weekend night to find that we had been given a room upgrade and that standards are as high as ever, from everyone we encountered including the doormen, check in, bar, waiting & housekeeping staff. We actually arrived before 10 am but there was no problem in early access to the room. We had tickets for a wet Chelsea Flower Show, but would have had a more enjoyable time remaining at the hotel for the day !",5,2014,05,26
143,OUT OF THIS WORLD!.......,"We have just returned from a weekend in London, staying in this luxurious hotel.  This occasion was extremely special as I proposed to my partner in the hotel with the assistance of the fabulous staff.

I had been emailing Alessandra prior to our arrival and with her assistance was able to have a floral arrangement set up in rose petals in our room following afternoon tea.  The staff were so helpful and were prepared to assist in anyway they could. I can not thank Alessandra and the other members of staff that were extremely kind and helpful on the day.

Our room had an amazing bathroom and the bedroom was stunning, just out of this world.

We could not fault it one bit, and would certainly recommend anyone thinking about it to take the plunge and book.....

The spa is truly beautiful and relaxing, the best we have ever been to.

We will definitely be back to stay again ...... Outstanding .....",5,2014,05,25
143,Just perfect !,"Was there only for one night ! If you are up for discrete but top elegance and great service, and you are in the heart of London and have the budget this is your choice !! Was upgraded in executive suite, but am sure all rooms are just perfect: the meeting rooms are great, the reception hall beautiful ...in room : top bed comfort, spacious and warm toilette (heated floor is a gr8 treat), and various comfort amenities (digital phones all over, powerful WiFii, comfortable desk...). Absolutely excellent! Breakfast is also fresh and rich. Am sorry I could not try the SPA. ",5,2014,05,25
143,"6 stars, wow","i normally post a review after check out, but this time i can not wait till check out time and would share my great experience with others.and writing this review from my room in the hotel. DO NOT MISS THIS HOTEL!
as you can see from my profile i am from dubai, UAE, where the all hotels are really luxury; been in 7 star hotel and so many 5 star hotel in dubai, since i always have guest and spend some of my times with them, so i know the meaning of great service. this hotel is the best hotel that i have ever stayed.
nice staff, lovely spacious room with great bathroom, comfortable bed, best pillow, great room service and lovely breakfast.
their SPA is the best, i think it should be the biggest spa in london since it is 4 floor with fabulous service. the decoration of their spa is really amazing, sauna, swimming pool and their lovely jacuzzi which is kinda special that can massage your neck, your knee, your back and ETC.... wow, this is lovely hotel.
more over it is so nice when i received a welcome letter from hotels manager. it shows that they care about everything and value their customer and this is what i like.
i personally recommend this hotel to ARABs and Muslims because of its washing system in bathroom. 
i forgot to mention that its location is great. walking distance to underground and so close to tourist attraction areas.
thanks very much Corinthia team.",5,2014,05,24
143,Stay at this hotel!!!,"I've visited the hotel numerous times over the last two years and every time I is wonderful. The staff are attentive but not too fussy and are always happy to help. 
It's expensive but you really get what you pay for. The rooms are large, quiet with bathrooms to die for. If you are looking for somewhere to stay in Central London then I can't recommend the Corinthia highly enough. I would be happy staying in the bathroom they are so luxurious!
The attention to detail is divine from  the hand soap to the running maps.",5,2014,05,23
143,6-star service at the most glamorous hotel in London,"Let me start off by saying that this hotel is stunning. The décor oozes timeless elegance and the attention to detail is second to none. I challenge you to not say 'wow' when you enter the lobby.

We began our stay with afternoon tea in the lobby lounge which turned out to be fantastic value for money. I've never been full up from an afternoon tea before - I was on this occasion. The sandwiches and pastries were delicious. The waiting staff were very warm and friendly. 

We then moved onto the spa by ESPA. I am familiar with ESPA from my stays at Gleneagles in Scotland so my expectations were very high. My expectations were certainly met. This spa is dazzlingly beautiful and the massage I had was executed brilliantly. My therapist was so lovely. I wish I could remember her name... Ariana maybe? I think she was Spanish. 

We spent the rest of our afternoon relaxing in our upgraded Junior Suite. It's a very sophisticated room with a bathroom to die for. I have to admit though - I'm not sure that I would have paid full price for it. £700 can buy you quite a lot in London. It can by you a view at least. I have stayed in an Executive Room before and I thought it was just a good so I will probably stick with that in future.

Cocktails in the Art Deco Bassoon bar is a great way to start and finish your evening. Breakfast in the Northall is absolutely fabulous. The food, service, ambience and views of the London Eye are all excellent.",5,2014,05,21
143,Favorite hotel out of 2 week europe trip!,We were upgraded to a deluxe room on our arrival which was absolutely fabulous. The room had heated bathroom tiles and a heated towel rack which was a nice touch.  Very elegant room overall. Staff was very friendly.  Also really enjoyed the afternoon tea everything was delicious!,5,2014,05,19
143,Great all purpose hotel,"I have stayed at this hotel many times on business to London and am always pleased to return.  It delivers what one would expect, correct service, helpful staff, clean and well serviced rooms.  Its location not far from Parliament Square is reasonably convenient to all points.",5,2014,05,19
143,Excellent Hotel Experience,"After a long trip on the road, I decided to extend a few extra days to unwind in London.

I found the Corinthia Hotel based upon it's proximity to the National Portrait Gallery and the wonderful reviews it already had on this site.

I have to say, that all of the rave reviews still left me somewhat unprepared for the experience.  This was easily one of the best hotel experiences I have had in all my years of travel and I have stayed in literally hundreds of hotels all over the world.

One could literally enjoy an entire weekend of tea, drinks, dining, spa and relaxation without ever leaving the hotel.

My room was flawless.  Everything was maintained to such a degree that it seemed as though I was the first person to have stayed in it.  The decor was esthetically pleasing and it felt more like I was staying in the master suite of a private home than a hotel.  The bathroom was worthy of Elizabeth Taylor at her opulent best and the bed was as comfortable as one could possibly hope for at home or away.  When your hotel room comes with a walk-in closet and personal entrance foyer, it's a luxury worthy of the name.

The service received at all points in the hotel was extraordinary.  There is quite simply nothing to complain about with the service.

Even the follow up is exceptional.  I had received a survey after my stay and made a comment about bathtub only to receive a personal response from the manager within the same day, even though I am 6 hours behind him in time zones.

The food in the restaurants was great and they pour a great drink in the bar.  

I will stay here again.  In fact, I think it has become my European decompression stop for all of my multi-week business trips.",5,2014,05,19
143,weekend trip,"Faultless! Perfect location.we were upgraded to a fantastic room.loved the attention to detail. staff were 1st class,nothing was too much trouble.customer service second to none. beautiful hotel with stunning decor. stunning florist within hotel which smelt beautiful. spa was so relaxing. will def be returning. x",5,2014,05,19
143,Champagne afternoon tea,"Generally lovely!  Great service, fabulous place just a little disappointing on the champagne...we opted for champagne tea, had a glass each and the waitress came round to refill our glasses asking if we wanted another glass.. As well as more sandwiches/cakes even a doggy bag to take away.. When the bill came I was shocked to see we had been charged an extra £32 for the two glasses champagne!! I couldn't see on the menu anything in terms of additional charge but it really took the shine off the afternoon...",4,2014,05,18
143,"A beautiful hotel, well appointed, with friendly staff and generally high levels of service.","Having stayed at a number of London’s leading hotels over the last few years (Claridges, Savoy, Langham, Browns, Dorchester, etc) I looked forward to the short stay at the Corinthia having heard several good reviews. In all a very nice hotel, comparable to Café Royal in age and style, with – on the whole – high levels of service.

Reception:
On arrival by car, the doorman quickly took care of the luggage. Initial impressions of the hotel foyer were excellent, and the reception staff were friendly and efficient. A request for a late checkout was happily accommodated. Check in was not, however, overly informative – e.g. no orientation (other than pointing out the lobby), no information on dining, no information on the pool or spa.

Room:
The Deluxe King room was luxurious, and well-appointed and maintained. With a small seating area, balcony, and large bathroom with separate bath and rain shower, the room was spacious for London. See photos. Turndown service was good (mood lighting, music, chocolates). The air conditioning in the room was poor – noting the lowest setting was 21oC and at that the room was still quite warm overnight.

Bar:
Staff were pleasant however not engaging or attentive. The drinks list has a reasonable albeit not overly exciting selection of wines, cocktails and spirits. The Bloody Mary was excellent. Food options for vegetarians were very limited on the bar menu.

Breakfast
With a small buffet, and a la carte menu, there is a good selection. Service was attentive and friendly. The scrambled eggs were somewhat of a disappointment though – quite dry.

Afternoon Tea:
Please refer to my separate review.

Pool & Gym:
The gym is well equipped with ample cardio and weights equipment. Disappointingly the swimming pool is very small (9 metres in length) and also – due to the close proximity to the spa – has very warm air temperature. These factors combined would make it unsuitable for exercise purposes.

Service in General:
Throughout the hotel staff were friendly, and in most interactions staff made use of the guest’s name.",4,2014,05,17
143,Amazing treat!,"Beautiful Hotel......what a pleasure to stay here. Can't find fault with anything,amazing food,superb service scrupulously clean........heaven!!
We spent 3 fabulous nights here, certainly puts most other hotels in the shade. Thank you!",5,2014,05,17
143,WOW what a place,"We stayed here for two nights and had the best time we have every had in London. It was fantastic. I really enjoyed the spa and had a massage one day. It was the best massage I have ever had in my life!
We had tea in the hotel and it was delicious, the best bit was the carrot cake! 
The best thing about this hotel is that the location is superb, the staff are so nice and happy to help. 
At the end of the day you really look forward to going back to the hotel.

Perfect stay",5,2014,05,17
143,Spa is out of this world!,"Just came back from one night at this lovely hotel. Very impressed and the decor is stunning and staff very professional.
Only couple of things to have a moan about.  We had come on a package where we got champagne and cake for my birthday but we had to call and remind them and we waited a long time for some club sandwiches but fair play to them as we got them free as it took so long!
Ok the good stuff! 
I am a total diva when it comes to spa's and beauty products and I can honestly say this is the best spa I have ever seen. Recommend the hot stone massage and they have wonderful beds that are heated you can lie on.
We were lucky to get upgrade but I would imagine the standard rooms may be quite small as it was fine but not massive.
Bit of a celeb haunt too so keep eyes peeled! Even saw and oscar winner!
Will be back soon I hope.",4,2014,05,15
143,Exquisite on every detail,"What can I say that has not already been said?..The Corinthia is as near to perfect a hotel as you would find in London or anywhere else for that matter. We spent 5 nights at this amazing property and they set the bar so high other hotels will no doubt pale in comparison.  The rooms are lovely and well appointed, every small consideration has been attended to. The staff are top-notch, and went out of their way to make us feel welcome and special. We treated ourselves to tea in the lobby on Mother' Day (i was travelling with my senior citizen mom who loved every moment at the hotel), and the food was delicious and the cakes almost to beautiful to eat! It's a splurge no question, but worth every cent. Would never stay anywhere else in London.",5,2014,05,13
143,Amazing hotel,"An amazing hotel from start to finish. I stayed for 2 weekend nights, with a work party, and enjoyed every minute of it. The staff were friendly, helpful & polite. The room was beautiful and every small touch had been thought of. Big comfortable bed, a small balcony looking onto an inner courtyard, fantastic walk in wardrobe, great coffee machine, great shower, lovely toiletries... I could go on. The Bassoon Bar has great cocktails. The Spa is quite simply the best I have been to. Great location in terms of tourist attractions and transport links. Will never stay in another hotel when in London.. Well done the Corinthia.",5,2014,05,11
143,All Around Fantastic,"We stayed here for 3 nights in March to attend a soccer match in London. The common areas are beautiful and inviting when you enter the lobby. We arrived early one morning and our room was ready for check-in when we arrived. The room, bathroom, linens and sitting area were over the top. The service was on par with the best we have ever had. They replied immediately to any request and knew our names quickly. We had afternoon tea, breakfast and a late dinner in the restaurant - all were superb. Another huge bonus was the location. We were in walking distance of most major attractions in Central London. This is an expensive property - but well worth every dollar spent.",5,2014,05,11
143,Amazing afternoon tea,"We went for afternoon for my birthday an it was so wonderful!
The staff were professional and friendly. 
The food was just wonderful and the cocktails from the bar were perfect.
I would highly recommend it for afternoon tea or for the cocktails!",5,2014,05,11
143,A new London favourite,The Corinthia is a stunning hotel. Our rooms were luxurious and beautiful with great facilities to make you feel truly pampered and the public areas are amazing. We had a fantastic breakfast in the restaurant with a great buffet selection and the staff were warm and friendly. We will definitely be going back.,5,2014,05,10
143,Great bar and restaurant - next time will stay over!,"Quick visit to the Corinthia, starting with drinks in the Northall Bar. Lovely atmosphere, attentive yet unobtrusive staff and great house champagne!
Then on to Massimo's - modern Italian. Again, excellent service, this time coupled with delicious and imaginative but unfussy food.

Worth saving up for an overnight stay next time!",5,2014,05,07
143,Almost perfect!,"This was my second stay here.  First time was with my daughter for a girls' weekend and this time was a Friday night stay with my husband.

I would love to have given this hotel five stars as it is a wonderful place to stay but a couple of things still let it down.

I checked in before my husband on Friday afternoon and was given an upgrade to an Executive room which was stunning.  The rooms here are precisely what you would expect from a luxury hotel.  The bedroom was beautifully appointed and the bathroom impressively luxurious.

Both my husband and I had Spa appointments on Friday afternoon.  I had a facial and my husband had a massage.  This Spa is beautiful and continues to be my favourite world wide.  We had booked dinner outside the hotel but decided to enjoy a cocktail in the Northall Bar before we left.

On the plus side the cocktails were delicious and my husband (extremely knowledgeable on the cocktail front) said that his Lychee and Rose Martini was possibly the best he had ever tasted, better even than the martinis at Dukes Hotel which is high praise indeed.  Unfortunately having been seated and our order taken we then had to wait ten minutes and tell the barman three times that we had already placed our order - this is not the level of service you would expect in a hotel of this standard.

The following morning after an excellent night's sleep we went to the Northall for breakfast.  We were seated promptly and asked if we wanted the A la Carte menus for breakfast.  We asked if we could have a look at these.  We then asked for the menus on three separate occasions before receiving them.  Having finally received them we waited another 15 minutes trying to catch someone's eye to order.  In the end, not wanting to waste our morning, we gave up and helped ourselves to the buffet breakfast.  This was delicious but we wanted the opportunity to order the A la Carte menu and the service was chaotic.  Again not what you would expect from a hotel of this standard.  The staff seemed flustered and unable to cope with the breakfast rush.

On a more positive note we were able to have a late check out with no problems and our car was brought promptly from the garage on request.

This hotel is in a wonderful location and the accommodation is superb.  We will definitely stay again because of this and the beautiful Spa but as a five star hotel it needs to work on its' service issues.",4,2014,05,06
143,Problems with room but excellent management,"Booked fo 2 nights in a de luxe room last week. Selected hotel on basis of good reviews and proximity to Royal Festival hall during tube strike.
We were a bit disappointed in the size of the room - we thought it would be larger but the bathroom was big but the room and bathroom were nicely appointed in high quality furniture /fittings. However we had a string of problems with the lighting, first the bathroom lights would not switch off and after the technician had fixed those we found it had upset something else because when we went  to bed the bedroom lights would not switch off. A technician was sent again but to put the bedroom lights off he had to disable the bathroom lights completely - a bit of a fiasco.
The following morning on the way to breakfast (which was excellent) I left a note for the Duty Manger detailing the problems , when we went back to the room after breakfast the Duty Manager (Mr Arbona) had already responded. He offered us an immediate move to a suite which he took us to within 5 minutes. When we returned to the suite after lunch there was champagne , chocolates and fruit waiting for us.
So I have given the Corinthia 5 out of 5 despite the lighting problems because of Mr Arbonas swift response as soon as he was made aware of the problem.
I can also say that we found all the staff extremely helpful and friendly - especially the doormen.The public areas of the hotel especially the lounge and indoor garden were both comfortable and elegant.",5,2014,05,04
143,terrific on a lot of levels!,"really great stay.  loved the service, the location, the gym/spa, ate at the informal restaurant and loved my room.  I chose the hotel because it was so convenient for my needs, was a great surprise... decor is a great balance btwn traditional and modern.  very comfortable. also loved my bathroom.  very long tubs!  very pleasant stay and i will for sure go back on my next business trip.",5,2014,05,02
143,Truly outstanding,"Stayed here for two nights with family during the Easter weekend.  I booked the family offer which meant two rooms for the price of one, although the rate for the first one was about what one would pay in most other 5* hotels for two rooms!  The rate did however include a free bottle of champagne and full breakfast for two adults and two children.  The beds were extremely comfortable and the rooms were quiet which for such a central location is very remarkable.  Service everywhere in the hotel was exceptional. Breakfast buffet but also a la carte was truly exceptional in terms of quality and freshness.  We had dinner at the hotel restaurant on Saturday evening and the food was excellent.  We had our Easter lunch in the hotel restaurant - superb.  The service is excellent throughout the hotel.  This hotel cannot be faulted. My only wish is for their rates to be lower so that we can afford to take more short breaks at the Corinthia.",5,2014,05,02
143,Just a few small steps away from perfect,"Wonderfully located and lavishly decorated, I'm not new to this hotel but it'd be unfair not to mention for those choosing the first stay. Location and the building finishes are second to none. I'd dare say for the size, the best 5* hotel in London. 

Really lovely pleasant staff across all outlets - and we did use them all, quite a bit! Superbly appointed bedrooms and cleverly executed bathrooms, all you'd expect from this market. Some wonderful little touches, from fantastic bar service through bespoke amenities. 

So, why 4 out of 5? Little things. Only little but, to be honest, in this category (and let's be frank, at the prices charged), they should be none... 
Toiletries - odd selection. If ESPA doesn't do dedicated bath salts, source elsewhere. If shower gel doubles up as bubble bath, declare on package (although two in one always a bit budget-y). Not great having a wonderful bath and having to use shower gel... Or no comb / toothbrush. I know they're flimsy. And not environmentally friendly. But it's just kind of expected at this level without having to request them (particularly for us numpties who think we packed properly only to discover these basics missing!)... I didn't (request any - I'm sure if I did they'd be brought up), but would have been nice to have found them in room... 
Room service breakfast coffee: if a guest orders cappuccino / latte, is it too much to ask for a proper barista coffee rather than awful machine stuff? I know there are Nespresso machines in rooms but it was not what we ordered. The whole RS breakfast was in that tone actually. Coffee influenced or not. Scrambled eggs not great, bacon sandwich very dry... I know it's the hardest meal to get right and there'll always be little quirks every guest sees / wants differently, but worth a shot, Corinthia - as otherwise it'd be a straight 5 out of 5!!

",4,2014,05,01
143,PERFECTION!,"My 6 year old daughter and I just returned from a 6 night stay at the Corinthia in London.  This is my second visit to London and it was definitely more enjoyable than the first.  Even though my first trip to London was good,  I owe part of my great second visit to the Corinthia.  The staff truly looks after EVERY single detail.  Their concierge is world class as well.  You will definitely be taken care of. I have traveled extensively, and I think this hotel may out rate any of the Four Seasons/Ritz Carlton hotels I have stayed at.  

In addition to the great service, the hotel is located 2 minutes away from the Embankment Underground station. Ideal if you want to get out to see the city.  Additionally, you are a short walk from Trafalgar Square, the London Eye and Covent Garden/Leicester Square (10 mins).

I appreciate the fact that the staff took the time to interact with my daughter and ensure she was comfortable and well cared for during her stay.  We visited during her spring break from school.  She had to return to school today. On the car ride to school she actually told me that she wished she was still in London at ""the hotel."" This coming from a kid who absolutely loves school.

Thank you Corinthia for an amazing experience.  We are already looking to come back to your amazing city and equally amazing property at the end of summer. Keep room 103 open for us!",5,2014,04,28
143,Wow!,"We stayed at the Corinthia on the 26th April which will now always be a special day, as my partner and I got engaged! Fantastic stay, absolutely beautiful room. Forgot to mention to the hotel that we got engaged in the madness of it all! A perfect 5 star hotel in every sense. We're already dreaming of our next stay at the Corinthia!",5,2014,04,28
143,Fantastic Hotel Fantastic Location,"We stayed here for the first time and it was a superb stay. Great hotel and location,fabulous rooms and top class food & cocktails ! Great ambience and location can't be beaten. Staff are very nice and overall its a real  5 star experience.",5,2014,04,28
143,Lovely experience,This is beautiful hotel and restaurant the food was fabulous well presented and full of flavour. The staff were amazing and couldn't do enough to help us. The wine selection is good. I would gladly return anytime.  ,5,2014,04,28
143,Very simple: Superb!!!,"Honestly one of the best 5 star hotels I have ever been. Perfect location for business and sightseeing, really very high standard rooms and facilities and absolutely nice and service oriented staff. Really modern mindset e.g. free wifi - no extra charge for small things - everything feels good there. Everybody is prepared to go the extra mile and it´s authentic. Concierge really has the network to organize even hard to get tickets (not the most expensive ones) - as he has done for us and they don´t stop with service after you have paid. For us they had to send us a toy of my son which we forgot in the room - one call - they found it - no problem. To make it short: I have found my preferred hotel in London for business and for a stay with the family.",5,2014,04,27
143,"Beautiful hotel, excellent location","This is one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in my life. The room (a regular room) was very nice and very big. The lobby, cafe and restaurant are modernly designed. 
Location is just one block from the Thames (across from the London Eye) and one block away from Trafalgar. 
Excellent overall. ",5,2014,04,27
143,MUCH IMPROVED - LOVELY PLACE,"Our secind visit and we love it more. 
Such a nice building and the feel of the place is nice.
Excellent bar service with great cocktails and oh what a breakfast.

On our last visit we had need to complain, see previous review but this time all was good and we will certainly be back.",4,2014,04,25
143,Wish we could return,"I booked this hotel via a laterooms special offer to celebrate my husband's birthday. It's a wonderful hotel in an excellent location. All the staff were very friendly and helpful, no request seemed to be too much trouble and was always handled with a smile. The room was beautiful. over looking the old quarter, an excellent bathroom, heated floor and a tv to watch whilst soaking in the lovely deep bath. My husband also had a Birthday cake waiting in the room upon arrival. The courtyard has open fires each end and was a relaxing place for an afternoon glass of wine, In the evening we went to the Bassoon bar, the cocktails were amazing and the live music an added bonus. The Spa is a beautiful tranquil place to relax after a day out or for a refreshing dip the morning after the previous nights' cocktails. Our biggest regret, a mistake on my behalf, was that I booked a so called romantic restaurant in Covent Garden for Sunday lunch, which turned out to be a disaster, I really wish I had stuck to my original plan and gone to the Sunday Jazz Brunch at the Corinthia.  I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel. Thank you for a lovely stay.",5,2014,04,25
143,The Best,"This place is awesome. The spa is really incurable. The pools are just wow! I also really enjoyed the gym. Great equipment with friendly staff. The tea, is just special. I don't know a better place to meet someone for tea.

143,Nice Experience,"I stayed here on a business trip for 3 nights. It was quiet and had a nice ambience. The room was nice and clean, I absolutely loved my bath and the concierge and doormen were extremely courteous. I wasn't a big fan of the breakfast, but I must say, this was a really nice hotel.",4,2014,04,22
143,One of our TOP PICKS in the world! ,"We have stayed in many 5-star hotels throughout the world but this has to be awarded 6-stars. Last trip about three years ago we stayed at The Berkeley for 7-9 nights which was already fantastic - refer to my previous review on the Berkeley (close proximity to shopping) however Corinthia beats it becoming our favourite choice of accommodation in London for future visits! It's just a block away from the underground station but we had no problems in taking the cab as there was always two doormen waiting to service you. Excellent prompt services! I had wanted to book Corinthia in the previous visit but it wasn't ready yet so it's a fairly new refurbished modern hotel with fine elegant furnishings. The bathroom is HUGE, elegant & luxurious, absolutely love the bathroom!! We love Corinthia and I'm sure you would too! Highly recommended! ",5,2014,04,21
143,One of the best,"My  wife and I stayed here over Easter friendly and attentive staff . Beautiful appointed rooms great service. We have stayed at many 5 star hotels in London this is definitely one of the nicest.
We will be back for sure.",5,2014,04,20
143,Still great,"We just completed our second (3 night)stay at the Corinthia. We were traveling with our two children and we had connecting Executive Deluxe rooms. 
The service was impeccable. We thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast each morning in Northall.   The concierge arranged dinner reservations and a babysitter and both were excellent. 
We love the location because it is very central, but in the evenings the area surrounding the hotel is very quiet. The West End, Regent Street and Trafalgar Square are within easy walking distance. 
The spa facilities are excellent. ",5,2014,04,19
143,Fantastic Time,"Stayed at the Corinthia for one night(15th April 2014) for our anniversary,and was given a room upgrade.The whole experience from begining to end was fantastic. The room was superb, all of the staff were very helpfull and efficient but most importantly so very friendly you really were made to feel relaxed and at ease. We drank in the lounge area and in the bar,again great friendly service,not to mention Laurent Perrier as the house Champagne.Location is ideal for Covent Garden,Trafalgar Square,and the Embankment (2 mins).Definatley the best 5 star hotel we have stayed in in London.Can't wait to go back.Special thank you to Elena on reception who handled our check in and made us feel very welcome,a great asset to the Hotel.",5,2014,04,15
143,3 night stay Sept 2013,"My husband and I stayed for 3 nights last Sept. The room was nice but a little on the small side. We found breakfast service was good ( we ate from the buffet). We were disappointed with the hotels restaurant after returning from a show (approx. 10pm) we were told there was no meal service just snacks and drinks. We usually stay at Four Seasons properties and found this a bit lacking in comparison. The spa was very nice, we enjoyed our time spent there. Location was good. We will try a different hotel next time in London as the lack of available food choices was disappointing.",3,2014,04,14
143,Worth the 4 nights at price of 3 deal,"Slightly out of the way of the shopping district but the proximity to the embankment makes it a pleasant place to stretch out and walk after a long day. 
Very courteous  pleasant staff. 
Nice rooms. Well kept. ",4,2014,04,13
143,1 star service,"Wow what a disappointment! Booked this hotel through Amex FHR and will never return. First, upon check in it took almost thirty minutes for them to figure out our reservation and find our room. Once we get to the room we decided to go down to the ""famous"" afternoon tea. There were a few tables open when we got there. We waited by the host stand for about ten minutes before a very rude waitress came over and said ""what do you need?"" I told her we would like to do afternoon tea and she very rudely said "" no we are fully booked."" That's when my husband got very upset and told her we were guests and she should not be having such an attitude with us. Then she huffed and puffed and magically ""maybe one table is open, I'll check with my manager."" Another ten minutes and we are finally seated. The service there was virtually nonexistent and after 2.5 hours of being ignored we flagged down a random server to get our check. Then later that night we decided to go to the bar for some late night drinks and dessert. After being ignored again for ten minutes we finally got our drinks and kept asking for a dessert menu which never came. Again no service and had to flag down the server for a check. At this point we are very annoyed - what is the point of paying a premium for a 5 star hotel when they have such awful service? We called front desk and asked to speak to the general manager, Matthew Dixon, and were promised he would call back. Of course he doesn't call but has the ""assisting front desk manager"" call who doesn't know anything about anything. I see Mr. Dixon responds to all the reviews here so he must have a lot of free time to write to his guests on the internet but no time to call guests back while they are at the hotel. The complete lack of service here is appalling and we would never come back. Please save your $$ and go to the St. Regis",1,2014,04,13
143,Excellent !!!,"I love Corinthia London. The best 5 star hotel I've ever seen. I My girlfriend and I we stayed just for one night, but we really enjoyed as much as we could. We started with afternoon tea in the lobby right under  the''Full moon''. What a feeling! Than we had an amazing dinner in Northall restaurant. Brilliant tasty food and professional 5* service! After lovely romantic dinner we decided  to have some cocktails in Bassoon bar. Maestro Bystrik showed us how the best cocktails taste like! He was excellent! We had lot of fun as Tomas is also man on the right place. He knows how to approach to the guest with a specific sense of humor. Next day we woke up very early to have a bit of time to join astonishing Spa facilities. Breath taking experience! I don't know what to say. Just big thank you to all of you. Special thanks to AMAZING CONCIERGE TEAM and very kind manager Nuno! I'll see you soon.",5,2014,04,12
143,Perfect rooms,"We recently booked three rooms for our family of six and had the most wonderful stay. The beds were the most comfortable and the showers were the best we ever experienced in a hotel room. The lobby area was spectacular and if there's one thing that I thought was a bit substandard was the quality of breakfast especially for the price. I expect London to be expensive but for 34 pounds, I thought would have been better. Also when they say a la cart for eggs, they mean it. Overall I would not hesitate to recommend it.",5,2014,04,12
143,The way hotels should be,I stayed the weekend for a spa/shopping trip and was truly delighted. I was upgraded to a lovely suite and although this hotel is one of the best there is no super fuss like you would get at the Savoy or Ritz which I was grateful for. The spa is dreamy but the pools can get a bit crowded. All pretty amazing though. Another bonus was that breakfast room service came for no extra charge…again no fuss at this hotel and perfect for the one who wants to get away. I loved the bars on site and they had superb wine lists! Very relaxing stay in an amazing location.,5,2014,04,10
143,Absolutely beautiful experience !!!!!!!,"The stay at The Corinthia was a Christmas present - and what a present !! We had a Junior Executive Suite on the 3rd floor which was fabulous. Lounge area, bedroom, TV at the end of the bath - you get the picture ! Staff were attentive at all times and nothing was too much trouble for anyone. I had a Spa treatment while at the hotel which was OK. I'm not as in love with this Spa as other reviewers seem to be. It was very busy with a hen party whilst I was there so that could have had a bearing on my experience. The buffet breakfast was very good (but it should be for £32 !) and once again we asked for fried eggs and they were cooked beautifully and brought to our table quickly.Went into the bar after we had seen a show and the atmosphere and service was very good. Need to do something about the live music though !

Saving up to go back again !!!!!!!",5,2014,04,08
143,Mixed experience,"I stayed 2 nights at this hotel recently. The hotel is in a great location, across from the Embankment tube station and a short walk to Trafalgar Square and the Houses of Parliament. I checked in at about 8am, and was given a room and a free upgrade immediately, which was great. The room (Deluxe King) was huge by any standards, especially London norms. It had a balcony overlooking the lovely inner courtyard.  The bathroom was also huge. All items and furnishing were plush and of a very high standard. Toiletries were frequently and generously replenished. Breakfast was tasty with a decent variety although they should change some of the items daily. Now for the negatives. When I checked in, I was not shown or told about the facilities and restaurants. This should be the norm for expensive luxury hotels. The service was generally good but impersonal. Everyone from the doormen to the concierge to the bar and restaurant staff were pleasant but did not exude any warmth, which is a shame. This is in direct contrast to other hotels I have stayed at in London such as the Hyatt Churchill and Intercontinental Westminster. That said, I would definitely stay here again, but I hope the staff manage to live up to the high standards of the rest of the hotel.",4,2014,04,08
143,Can't wait to go back!,"I stayed at the Corinthia for a second time, this time with a friend. My first time there with my mother was unbelievably amazing, and the second time was even more so (if that's even possible to say!) The staff were superb, and the concierge especially were all amazing! They made a few calls and got my friend and I set up for a couple of great evenings out to some great bars/clubs and restaurants. I really can't say enough great things about this hotel, and am excited for my third time around this June to celebrate my mother's birthday! 
Highly recommended to anyone who wants great service, lovely rooms, and an overall amazing stay in London.",5,2014,04,07
143,Fantastic hotel - new favorite in London,"This hotel is really fantastic.  When it was renovated, I think they really took into consideration all the little touches that make a difference to a frequent traveler.  The service is AMAZING.  Friendly and competent.  If there's a problem, they fix it (we had a issue with the reservation - it was fixed so seamlessly).  The rooms are beautiful - decor and functionality together - no tradeoff of one for the other.  The food is fantastic (best egg benedict's I've ever had) and the spa is amazing.  Would highly recommend staying here.",5,2014,04,06
143,London At Its Best!,"We stayed here at Christmas time last year and it was just beautiful. When we first got to the hotel it was so nice to have been greeted to the lovely doormen, who not only opened our taxi doors, but politely and so elegantly opened the doors to the amazing Corinthia. 
The lobby was elegantly decorated for the holidays and it was IMPOSSIBLE to miss that gorgeous crystal chandelier that they have hanging in their foyer. 
First of all, I cannot tell you how impeccable the service was. Everyone seems genuinely happy at what they do and were very happy to help you. This was my first visit to London and the Concierge Desk was always happy to pop open a map, get me theatre tickets, and give excellent recommendations for dinner. 
We stayed in a Deluxe King Room and it was just perfect for us. Our windows were in front of the hotel as we requested a high floor, and that gave us a peek-a-boo view of the River Themes and The Embankment Pier. When you first walked into the room, straight ahead, was an AMAZING walk in closet that held both of our luggage and growing number of shopping bags, beautifully. It also acted as a little bit of a changing room with full length mirrors in front of the doors to the closet. To the left of that was a marbled floor bathroom that was just gorgeous with a sunken tub and a tv to keep you company for those relaxing holiday bubble baths after a brisk London Day. Of course, they had a walk in shower and a heated floor near where the toilet was. I was very happy with our bed and had many comfortable nights here. However, one little draw back – the hotel is right near the Embankment Tube Station – so early morning garbage trucks (possibly picking up recycling bottles or the such) were VERY LOUD in the morning. We like to sleep with our windows cracked and heard the cacophony of bottles crashing every morning. It was fine if you closed the windows – as it made the room nearly sound proof – so there was a work around. No big deal. I just wore ear plugs on some nights. 
Service – I have already spoken about how lovely everything and everyone was. However, I MUST TELL YOU HOW GREAT our housekeeping service was! From what I understand, the people who come in the early evening and ‘turn down’ your room - are different from the people who do the morning ‘clean up’. BOTH were remarkable and very attentive to your needs. We once came in one day and were in need of a tea cup – whoever was on shift came up, right away, and not only gave us a tea cup but gave us more tea, made sure that we were fully stocked at our mini bar,  and gave us a couple of chocolates to enjoy our tea with. I’m telling you: SERVICE, SERVICE, SERVICE. 
Location - Speaking of the Tube – Having that station nearby was also a plus as it served to get around London and all its landmarks very easy. Telfagar Square and The National Gallery was a mere 5 minute walk from the hotel. It was fantastic! Also, was able to take a longer but doable walk into the Theatre area of London – Where I saw Jude Law in Henry 5 (Thank you, Corinthia for getting me VERY HARD TO GET TICKETS- as they were SOLD OUT )!
Spa – Go. Just Go. Sit in their amazing hot tub, use their steam room, and bask in luxury. I happened to get a massage and was able to enjoy their facilities. Do this. Yes, it’s pricey. But, so is everything in London. I had THE best time and experience. 
I was so happy with this hotel and know that I will be back!",5,2014,04,05
143,Special birthday stay,"From the offset the Corinthia Hotel London was amazing. When entering the hotel the staff were welcoming. We checked in and had an upgrade on the room, this was fab. A truly and refreshing hotel with good staff.
If you decide to take a trip to London and are thinking of spending over £250 for a hotel, stretch that little more and stay here you will not be disappointed.  
The pool area was very clean, with an excellent sauna. 
The food was excellent and afternoon tea a must.
We would differently look at treating our selves again.

143,Great location.,"We stayed here for several nights. The room was nice. Not much of a view. The staff were very good, however there were a number of missteps. It was my first time staying at a Corinthia Hotel but for the ""luxury hotel"" it missed the mark for me.",4,2014,04,05
143,fantastic,"been there once with family and we really love the place, everything from the view to the decoration and food , service was really great, we were served to the high standard and satisfied , over all super",5,2014,04,05
143,Amazing - AGAIN,"This is my favorite hotel. Hands down. Location is excellent, you are a stone's throw from Trafalgar, Covent, Westminster. We stayed here two years exactly and I counted down the days til we came again. The decor of the hotel is gorgeous, the service is excellent and the rooms are perfect. Even the smaller of the guest rooms are huge by European and London standards. The front desk manager made sure that the room we had was to our liking - the first layout of the room we received was better suited to someone on business so he went out of his way to find my daughter and I a room that was more to our needs. Beautiful fresh flower arrangements and littel satchets of lavender on your pillow at turn down. Heated floors in the GORGEOUS bathroom, best water pressure ever in a shower (these things matter!), comfy beds, best sheets. I could go on and on. 
Tea in the lobby lounge is a MUST. Worth every pence!! They are so very accommodating and even split the full tea for my 11 year old daughter and I as it is quite a large amount of food. You might need to reserve ahead of time for tea as they get quite busy. We did not visit the ESPA this trip which I regret so don't miss it! At least go peek at the spa amenities - nothing like I have ever seen. 
All in all Corinthia is the BEST hotel in London hands down. 5 star hotel in every facet and an experience that should not be missed!!",5,2014,04,05
143,Would love to say perfect,"Almost everything about thus hotel is first class. Beautiful decor, great location and highly professional staff. The room was fantastic and the TV in the bath is a nice touch. Room service food was very good. The vast majority of the staff were fantastic.

Just two relatively small things that took the shine off our stay.

1. Our table, trays, mess etc from room service lunch were left, despite us leaving the room for the whole evening and leaving the 'make up room' sign clearly on. We had been on the hotel's 'dining safari' which was lovely, but it was then a real shame to come back to our room after midnight to find it in such a mess (bed not made etc). The situation was however fixed pretty quickly once we alerted reception. 

2) although the dining safari experience was mostly great, it was a shame that the wine we ordered for our main course wasn't available. Not a problem though, we chose another. But that wasn't available either. The sommelier then recommended us another which, surprise surprise, was a lot more expensive than the two we had selected. Not a massive deal, but again, took the shine off what was otherwise a very good experience.

The manager did apologise to us personally on checkout for the room service issue, and that was really appreciated. I would definitely stay again, but for the price I would expect it to be perfect next time. ",4,2014,04,04
143,very lovely,"I was lucky enough to be bought a gift certificate for a room and dinner at this prestigeous London hotel. Everything from the room to the food was excellent, but the only thing missing was ""personality"". This is a large hotel with fabulous staff, but there was nothing personal about the service when compared to hotels like Browns, the Goring or The Savoy. This is a very smart place to stay, but it has an international focus and I felt that there was nothing here to remind you that you were in a hotel in London. I have nothing to complain about, our room (a deluxe junior suite) was fabulous with a great bathroom, but for a personal touch I'd rather stay at one of the great London hotels...",5,2014,04,03
143,The most amazing hitels in london by far,"From the moment we arrived our stay was superb. Having been in contact with guest relations before hand, they made the stay so special. On arrival they met us and whisked us up to our upgraded room - a junior suite. The flowers and fresh fruit that had been arranged we're waiting in the room, beautifully displayed. Nothing was too much trouble, any requests were dealt with so swiftly as soon as you put down the phone they were at the door. The spa is truely amazing and a wonderful place to spend a few hours relaxing. 
We had dinner as massimmo which was devine; I recommend the lobster linguine. At breakfast the next morning guest relations enquired as to how our stay went  and offered to extended the room until the afternoon. Such a lovely touch.  This hotel really does go the extra mile and nothing is too much trouble for their guests. I would recommend this hotel.",5,2014,04,02
143,Stunning,"Having stayed in a lot of hotels in London, this stands out as one of the best. The location is great. We were travelling as a family with young children and all of us were made to feel special. The kids were given their own toiletries and cuddly toy which made their evening! Lovely touches that made the whole experience extra special. The staff are all lovely and deserve extra credit for making our stay so memorable. The spa is fabulous and it is good to have certain hours that children can use the pool. I can't wait to return.",5,2014,04,01
143,Attentive staff and good location ,"The Hotel is good with good location, the bathroom was one if the best with its great bathtub and rain shower. The room had everything you would want with its coffee maker and complimentary water. Though the carpet was full of stains which I really did not like .

The Hotel facilities looked attractive and welcoming the reception staff specially Mr Josh were very attentive and kind though the gym was not great as it had few machines ( not to mention the many treadmills and bikes)

Walking to Charing Cross Station is less than 10 minutes.

Overall it was a good experience.

",4,2014,04,01
143,Attention to detail,"I can honestly say that this is one of the best hotels in London and certainly one of the best I have ever had the privilege to visit. Every visit is a real treat. The staff are friendly, attentive and make every effort to go the extra mile. Their attention to detail in everything they do makes all the difference. ",5,2014,03,31
143,Fabulous Hotel,"Got a corporate rate here for a few days.  I have to say this is a beautiful hotel, with gorgeous public rooms, a nice cocktail bar and two great and beautiful restaurants.  The room and bathroom were excellent with TV above a giant bath and a walk in dressing room (had a fairly standard room).  My one problem was that this hotel is geared to Americans.  That means that you have to order your eggs in the morning American style - ie for an Englishman over easy and over medium just results in underdone or overdone eggs.  Eggs should be cooked  in a frying and and basted with the fat.  This is London after all, not Manhattan.  And even though the black pudding was excellent, serving 'middle' bacon (more like streaky) instead of back bacon and having pancakes and syrup.... disgraceful really as our breakfasts are the best in the world.  At least they met the requests for lattes with a firm ""no"".  We drink tea.  This is England.

Still worth the full five stars though.  Wonderful spa and fitness facilities too.  ",5,2014,03,29
143,What a lovely Old-Worldy hotel,"We stayed here over a weekend and thoroughly enjoyed it. Very nice room (if lacking in closet space), fantastic location, great concierge service, a very sweet Dutch guest relations manager, nice restaurant and bar. All in all a great hotel, especially if you are looking for an Old-Worldy Grand' Hotel of Europe kind of experience.",5,2014,03,29
143,Expected more,"As many of the reviews mention this is a very good hotel in many aspects,when you walk in you feel the professional conduct and welcoming of a well trained team.The lobby is of a very high standard of decor and is tastefully laid out.

My disappointments were in the room and here I expected more.As with much in life if you start seeing one or two negatives they seem to accumulate.First the room was very small 201 you can not open drawers and the position of the wardrobe behind the entrance door made in difficult to access.The room was very hot,I was unable to cool,it down so engineering came adjusted and then in the night it became too cold.The towels were hard and not soft as you would expected.My biggest issue was the comfort of the bed the pillows were very thin and although I stacked 3 I still felt uncomfortable.

I reported to management and they listened and offered options I moved rooms and did find the level of comfort and space better however I do compare to other London hotels and still have to say as a overall package the soho hotel for me offered a higher quality for the price....",3,2014,03,29
143,Amazing!,"went here for a spa day with a friend! What an amazing experience! The interior was contemporary and very posh!! Glass walls, chandeliers simply beautiful!

They had a huge steam and sauna room which was simply the best steam and sauna i have seen! 

The sleep pods were blissful! Very quiet. 

Refreshments every where to rehydrate! 

Heated loungers to relax after using the spa facilities! 

The treatments were amazing too! Very professional and very relaxing! In fact i fell asleep! 

Went for lunch, which was light and delicious. Bumped into one of the girls for Girls Aloud and got her signature too. 

I would certainly come here again!

One of the best spas i have been too!",5,2014,03,24
143,Superb,"I travel on business on a frequent basis and this is probably the best hotel I have stayed in. Recently also stayed in the revamped Savoy hotel in London and this is simply far better. It is expensive but definitely worth it. 
I was upgraded to a junior suite - so tastefully laid out and with all the facilities/systems you could expect. I also ate in the attached Massimo restaurant which was also very good.

GO FOR IT AND ENJOY!",5,2014,03,22
143,This could be my favorite hotel in the world,"I've stayed at the Corinthia twice - most recently for 5 nights. This hotel is amazing. Service was perfect, upgraded to a huge room, amazing gym and spa. Cocktails in the bar and by the fireplaces outside are musts. It's wildly expensive, but each time I've left thinking ""yeah...but it was worth it."" Highly recommended",5,2014,03,20
143,Amazing !!!!,The most classiest hotel......outstanding customer service....amazing atmosphere....Have stayed in amazing hotels...but this surpasses them all ....The afternoon tea  was wonderful....We had an absolutely wonderful time ...I would recommend this 100 X !!,5,2014,03,19
143,Perfect in every way,"I'd eaten in the restaurant a few times and spent sometime in the cocktail bar, we had always enjoyed our visits and I thought as a treat this would be the perfect place to start our honeymoon as me and my husband got married on Sunday. The staff could not have been friendlier or more attentive with drinks in the bar while waiting for our room and a bottle of champagne with strawberries and chocolate left in our room to congratulate us, the perfect touch. The room was spacious and extremely clean with a lovely balcony over looking the court yard. 
My husband booked us in to the safari dinner which meant a course in each restaurant finishing off with a cocktail. All the staff made a point of congratulating us and really making us feel special. Thank you so much for making the start of our honeymoon so brilliant, it was a truly wonderful experience.",5,2014,03,19
143,Perfect Stay in London,"We stayed at the Corinthia over the weekend to celebrate a birthday. We had experience of the Corinthia in Malta and wanted to try the London hotel. The whole experience was perfect from the friendly doorman to our amazing room, the food and the stunning spa. Its not cheap but its was great value and I would not hesitate to go back. Location wise its perfect - walking distance from Charing Cross and Embankment tube. Its right next to old Scotland Yard and it 5 mins you are in St.James Park, Trafalgar Square or walking along the Thames. Its also not pretentious like many 5 star London hotels. We felt relaxed and comfortable from the moment we arrived to the time we collected our bags to leave.",5,2014,03,17

will be more than happy to reyturn",5,2014,03,17
143,The best place to stay in London,"We stayed in this hotel just for the weekend but we didn't want to leave. The hotel staff was incredibly kind and helped us for any kind of problems: restaurant reservation, taxis, traffic information..you can ask really everything and you'll have a perfect answer. The room was very clean and perfectly equipped. The wellness center was over the top, after walking all day around London it was a pleasure going just downstairs to the amazing spa. 
I suggest to have breakfast there 'cause it's THE best breakfast that I've ever had..I mis it already!
A must go!",5,2014,03,17
143,Wonderful Afternoon Tea,"The review is split into three areas:

Firstly the food: it is delightful. The quality and freshness is compelling and moreish;

The staff: the attention and service is second to none. The staff are attentive but not pressurising. 

The atmosphere/ambience: the hotel is quality. Relaxing. Comfortable. Friendly. Warm . Inviting",5,2014,03,16
143,"Sunday Lunch at The Northall, Corinthia Hotel","Lovely place with gorgeous, classy dining room, live jazz and fantastic food. 

However, the first 30 minutes of service were a massive let down and marred what could have been a perfect meal. We went for the 3 course lunch with a glass of champagne for £45. We'd ordered and been served 2 glasses of white wine, a bottle of red and our starters before being given a glass of champagne, which we'd asked for 3 times whilst others were being poured champagne all around us. 

The sommelier joked that our table was full of glasses and we were asked why we were not eating our starters yet when all we had wanted was to arrive at the restaurant, be given a glass of champagne as an aperitif whilst reading the menu and then have our order taken. Despite asking 3 times, no one seemed to realise or acknowledge they'd made an error and no-one apologised.

It was such a basic hospitality error and all the more disappointing in a such a lovely restaurant. 

I would go back again as the food and dining room were wonderful. It was just such a shame that the service was so sloppy to start with.",4,2014,03,16
143,Nicolas Monaglio is terrific!,"What a wonderful first experience at the Corinthia hotel.  My husband had spent a night here last September, and had suggested we stay here on our next time passing through London.  I checked us in with the immediate assistance of Nicolas  Monaglio, who upon  my arrival made me feel instantly welcome.  The rest of the staff,  including but hardly limited to Alessandra and Scott, were equally helpful.

Many thanks to General Manager Matthew Dixon and his staff.

Sincerely,

Laurel Beth Chaykin

143,Excellent. ,"Amazing service. Great location, fantastic rooms. Cannot be faulted. Service the way it used to be !!! Excellent for business or leisure. The friendliest and most efficient doormen in London. 
Is this the new Dorchester?
The rooms are very well appointed and well thought out. There is one thing only. Kettles are not standard in the room (Nespresso machine is which is great) however tea bags are provided. Should they either both be stocked in room or both available on request ? But I drink coffee..... so just an observation.

143,Northall Bar at Corinthia,"Was very disappointed after receiving poor service at Northall Bar last weekend, we sat at a table only to be moved after 10 minutes waiting for a staff members to come to us. Instead of asking about our order, we were told that the table was reserved despite no sign on it (other tables had reserved signs). 
There were what appear to be two wedding parties in the bar and we were clearly to casual looking for the team there...
The hotel charge £9.50 for a very small glass of wine, possibly the smallest I have ever been served, coffee was good but at £5.50 (all prices before service charge by the way!), it would need to be....
I also had to ask twice for the bill, left after what felt like a very bad experience, I will not be in a rush to return!

143,Perfect in every way,"My wife and I enjoyed a fantastic weekend break in London staying (not the whole time!) in The Corinthia. We arrived on Friday lunchtime after a half hour transfer by underground and on foot from Euston. Our room was ready on check in and we were asked if we wanted to book a late check out on Sunday, which was really useful. The staff were all brilliant and really friendly. The room we had was perfect, in room facilities and bathroom top top class. The location of the hotel is also ideal, with easy access to the West End, Westminster, the river etc etc. Breakfast, afternoon teas, champagne service - all second to none! Only drawback to the weekend was Everton getting beat by Arsenal hey ho!",5,2014,03,11
143,Afternoon tea,"Lovely surroundings,  excellent sandwiches and cakes and perfect services. Lots of gorgeous sanwiches - trout and cucumber, smoked salmon, coronation chicken, cheese and pickle and roasr beef and horseradish cream. Cakes are works of art and named after films. The surroundings are lovely, quiet because the acoustics are so good.  The staff are super helpful but unobtrusive.",5,2014,03,09
143,Best hotel in London,"The reviews on TA don't lie about this place, simply divine and a real treat. We stayed 3 nights on a ""staycation"" and absolutely loved the tranquility and comfort inside the hotel whilst being right in the centre of London. We had views over the river, a beautiful outside space along with the biggest bed I've ever seen, beautiful furniture, and a luxurious bathroom. Staff are superb and help provide an experience that is a cut above the rest. Yes the price is high but you absolutely get what you pay for. We also made use of the spa which is a little on the small side but highly functional and feels like a real retreat. We chose not to have breakfast as there are lots of (much cheaper) nice eateries within walking distance. I cannot recommend the Corinthia highly enough.",5,2014,03,08
143,Simply beautiful!,"A beautifully elegant hotel in the heart of London which I just can not fault.  We stayed in the Trafalgar suite which was a very comfortable space. The spa, gym were both superb, and the two restaurants served up some very tasty dishes.  I highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a comfortable stay while in London on vacation or business.",5,2014,03,07
143,"Class, hi tech, quiet (in the rooms), superb service","I've stayed at Corinthia about 7 times now, mostly one night business stays. But last weekend, my wife and I ventured into London for a city break ... We were not let down ...

There's a great Afternoon tea vibe in the hotel, in an atrium between the main doors of the hotel. Ie a great people watching opportunity. 

For us, dinner in Massimo. Best mojiitos ever. Fine Italian food. Great service. 

As all the rooms do, a great balance between tech and comfort. Not so much as to bamboozle you, just enough for everything to work easily and we'll. But critically for me, all the rooms I have stayed in are quiet ( I'm a light sleeper). 

Then just before check out, a trip to their e'spa spa. Very cool. Amongst the best we've been to anywhere. All marble steel chic. 

Enjoy!",5,2014,03,04

It was everything we had wanted, classy , excellent qualit and great customer service. I asked our  waitress to chose an unusual tea for me, she chose mange and it was brilliant.
With the inclusion of the champagne  made for  a great experience , there were no time pressure placed on us to rush through.
It was absolutely excellent but pricey , but you get what you pay for and this was top quality",5,2014,03,03
143,5 Star Luxury in London,"This hotel is in a wonderful spot.  You can literally walk to all the major attractions including St James Park, West.

You will feel like a royal yourself in the spacious rooms, large bathroom and exquisite service and attention to detail",5,2014,03,02
143,Not the best spa I've ever been to,"I decided to drop by ESPA at the Corinthia hotel during a quick business visit to the UK. Having won the top spot in a UK spa ranking, I thought I'd be in for a special treat.

The treatments themselves were truly top notch, but what almost destroyed the experience for me was that someone in a neighboring pod kept banging cupboards all through my massage. Even though I told my therapist to try and tell them to keep it down a bit, it took them about 15 minutes till they were back to that ugly habit!

The whole point of a spa is for you to relax and unwind and, when it comes to that, other places do it better.",3,2014,03,02
143,Corinthia how I love you!,"The Corinthia London...where does one begin? We have wanted to stay here for a long time and finally made it. In fact we are here just now and I am writing this review from a Deluxe Junior Suite. This hotel is exquisite. It is beautifully presented. The attention to detail is incredible. The standards are unlike anything I have experienced before. I could wax lyrical but what raises The Corinthia head and shoulders above the rest  is the extraordinary staff. Nothing is too much trouble, they anticipate your every need and it is all done with a smile and great good grace. This hotel sets the bar and in my opinion deserves to be No 1 on Tripadvisor. I say this as someone who has recently stayed in Hotel 41 - in my opinion there is no compare. Try The Corinthia and every need will be met.  Andrew C",5,2014,02,28
143,Jazz Sunday Brunch,"Spending a weekend in London staying with family - we decided to spoil ourselves with Sunday Brunch in the Corinthia - with a Jazz Trio to add to the ambience. The service was excellant, presention and taste of food top class - three course menu in the Northall with plenty of choices and a glass of champagne to enjoy. They were very quick to offer me alternative vegetables when I mentioned I had an allergy to those supplied. An overall relaxing, enjoyable afternoon  -if a little costly.This hotel is very well positioned for tourist attractions.

Would definately return again and would like to sample the delights of the hotel too!",5,2014,02,27

143,One of the best hotels I've ever stayed in,"This is a new property, with awesome timeless decor. Even if you don't have the chance to stay here, at least have tea in the central lobby. The room was incredible, the pool/spa was interesting and original, the staff was excellent. If I could rate this hotel with 6 stars, I would. The location of this hotel is also ideal. Great Tube access, and in walking distance to many of the main attractions.",5,2014,02,26
143,Simply wonderful,"I booked the Corinthia as a treat for my husband for Valentine’s weekend.  I wanted to prepay so my husband didn’t see the bill.  Aldo took control of this for me with ease (thank you) so I had every confidence of a special visit even before arriving.  I was right.  This hotel is simply stunning, operated by friendly and welcoming staff.  It exudes style, confidence and beauty.  We were upgraded to an Executive King which was a lovely surprise - where a delicious chocolate cake and handwritten card was waiting for us.  A nice gesture.

Attention to detail is the best I have witnessed in the UK.  Highlights in the room were the mood lighting, the water pressure in the most fantastic shower and bath and turndown chocolates in their own individual boxes.

We visited both bars which were buzzy and fun.  Breakfast was a delight of hot and cold choices.    

The whole ambience of the hotel was quite special and refined without being in any way pompous.  Everything just flowed and seemed effortless.  The staff should be very proud of what they achieve.

Yes, it is expensive but save up and stay at the Corinthia at least once.  You will not be disappointed.  My visit was over a week ago and I am still in awe of the experience.  I am saving for a return visit.",5,2014,02,26
143,5 stars in every sense,"This is a 5 star hotel in every sense.
The hotel is stunning in its design, the rooms & public spaces are superbly thought through with really fine attention to detail. The rooms are lavish, comfy & quiet, leaving you feeling utterly pampered. Breakfast was excellent with a fantastically varied menu & excellent service. The bassoon bar serves up a great drinks menu in relaxing surroundings. If i had a minor quibble it's that it's too dark inside. A little more lighting would not only help when reading the menu, but mean you could properly see your drink & your friends. One other real joy was the flower displays. They were simply stunning.

143,Sshh. . . sleep well at this wonderful Hotel,"This is a short review just to marvel again at this fabulous hotel.  Excellent and courteous service all the time from every member of the staff.  A nice room which was very well appointed - heated bathroom floor - what's not to love about that?  Most importantly for me is the quiet. The rooms are so beautiful in design - but also very clever with padding on the walls which is decorative but sound insulating.  Not once at any point did I hear any other guests, which is why I will always stay in the Corinthia. Each night is so peaceful and you get a brilliant night's sleep.  Another very important factor for me is the location.  It is minutes from Trafalgar Square and a short walk to Covent Garden.  Seconds from the underground and the river.  We had breakfast in the Northall on this visit and it is most pleasant with an extensive choice.  I'll be back - can't wait.",5,2014,02,25
143,Afternoon tea,"Went for afternoon tea in February.  

Cakes were exceptional.  Demonstrating craftmanship and precise skill throughout all of the cakes. They really were impressive. 

Sandwiches were unimaganitive however.

All in all it was a lovely experience in a fantastic venue but was it value for £45 per person as we only got one type of cake each? I would say no.

We did stay for cocktails in their fantastic cocktail bar which was very enjoyable. 

Had a good look around bedrooms as well and was very impressed.

143,Perfect,"We booked day spa combined with a lunch week ago. It is not our first time. Spa is very beautiful and luxurious. The SPA therapists made us feel welcome. Lunch was amazing, with a burning fire place, which is truly relaxing. The waitress is so lovely and attentive, fabulous service! She was very busy but every one was served on time. Fabulous service! We left very happy and we will definitely come back. I think her name is Greta. We also had afternoon tea in a beautiful lobby lounge, service was good. 
I would highly recommend to try!

143,"Finest hotel I've stayed in, bar none.","I stayed here for three nights earlier this month (February) as part of a business trip. The tariff was covered by my hosts — I could not ordinarily afford nor would I necessarily spend the nightly tariff (rack rate about 255 GBP) on my own.
Now that I've stayed here though, the next time I'm in London, I will make every effort to return here, even if only for one or two nights.
First off all, as this is not ordinarily in my class, I felt exceedingly self-conscious, as though I did not belong. I needn't have worried. The entire staff — from reception to bellmen to the concierge to restaurant staff to housekeeping — made me feel welcome.
The location — directly opposite The Playhouse in London's West End, adjacent to Old Scotland Yard in Whitehall, one block from Trafalgar Square and within easy walking distance of the Parliament buildings and River Thames, is unsurpassed.
Look up ""Corinthia Hotel, London"" on Wkipedia. and you will learn the astounding history of this building.
What Wikipedia can't tell you, though, is how elegant, comfortable, modern and high-tech the interiors are. The rooms are gorgeous, with dual wash basins, a large, twin faucet shower, hot water for the asking (you turn ""hot"" and you get hot water instantly, without waiting).
It may sound silly to talk about TV in a luxury hotel but they have not skimped her — all four BBC channels, and all three Sky Sports channels, including English Premier League soccer, as well as the usual foreign-language news and business channels, movie channels and drama channels.
The minibar is well-stocked, if pricey (there's a well-stocked, reasonably priced corner convenience store on the corner of Trafalgar Square.
The room service menu is well-appointed. The bed is large, and comfortable. Power plugs accommodate UK plugs (obviously), but also European two-prong and US/North American two-prong plugs. Unlike many luxury hotels I've stayed in, the Corinthia is set up for business guests as well as vacationers and pleasure seekers: The Wifi is complimentary and, just as important, lightning fast.
Many luxury hotels I've stayed in are pretentious, and not nearly as good as they think they are. The Corinthia is the opposite: This is truly a first-class experience, in every way. I can't imagine anything better: If you can afford it, I urget you to give it a try. Even if only for one night.",5,2014,02,20
143,Ultimate luxury in every way imaginable..,"We have recently visited the Corinthia SPA in London combined with a lunch at the hotel, which was truly spectacular. 
The SPA therapists are attentive, knowledgeable and made us feel welcome. 
The relaxation room is out of this world, with a burning fire place, which truly relaxes all senses. 
I would highly recommend to try!
Enjoy!",5,2014,02,20
143,Stunning Afternoon tea -  Superb Waiter Service,"I treated my friend to afternoon tea here as it looked so visually stunning that I wanted to sample it!  Light, spacious and modern decor, lovely to look at. Liked that the cakes where on separate trays to the sandwiches, meant more room on the table. The tastes and textures where divine, my friend is an avid foodie and even she was impressed with the quality. The crème brulee macaroons where my fave!  They catered well for vegetarians too, hooray, refreshing! The Waiter that served us Zsolt was awesome, he recommended a divine tea for us, was extremely attentive and made sure we sampled lots of tea and also that we had enough to eat. He was confident, professional, attentive and also humble, the best afternoon tea waiter I have come across so far! Definitely 5 star service. 

The only points for improvement would be:

I really like to have the same person during the whole tea experience!!!
£45 is quite expensive for afternoon tea (and not too much more added value than the Ritz or Claridges etc) and with a service charge as well (£12.50) it makes it not great value for money. surely the £45 includes the service for afternoon tea as really that is what one pays for???",5,2014,02,20
143,Best hotel in London by far,"As regular visitors to London and always staying in five star luxury  hotels with my family,I would like to point out why this hotel stands out head and shoulders above the rest. 
We have stayed here on two occasions now. The first time we stayed here we had a few problems with regards to room and our meal which got dealt with in a very professional way by the amazing staff in particular Jean fiesta who as managers go is top notch. Jean fresta made the rest of our stay fantastic and said he would hope to see us in the near future. With this there was no hesitation to book for a second time.
We have just returned from our second visit which did start with a few minor hiccups but once again got dealt with by Jean fresta  and the wonderful staff. This is a beautiful hotel with great facilities the children love the swimming pool and the little touches in the room with the sweets and Teddy's for the baby. We would love to thank all the staff and managers who really make this hotel stand out and make you feel very welcome as a family and hope to return again in the near future.",5,2014,02,19
143,Excellent afternoon tea,"My boyfriend booked to take me here for afternoon tea for Valentine's Day and we both had an amazing time. We'd like to have stayed overnight, but unfortunately for now, the rooms are a bit out of our budget - though we WILL be back to stay! Staff couldn't do enough for us and were only too happy to make our sandwiches as a special order (I am fussy and don't like sauces in sandwiches) - so the staff put all the sauces in little containers seperately so my boyfriend could use sauce for his sandwiches - such a special touch. Also, our waiter was LOVELY - such a credit to your hotel. Great service and can't wait to come back. Food was lovely and the waiter even got the kitchen to add some red onion to our cheese sandwiches. Can't wait to come back - hopefully very soon :)",5,2014,02,19
143,Believe the hype!,"I had originally planned to take my girlfriend to The Savoy for Valentines weekend (having previously stayed there and loving it).  However, after a quick review on TripAdvisor there were a few negative comments, and one person in particular loved The Corinthia.  So, after a review of the comments on this hotel I booked.  And I am really glad we did!
The hotel is truly brilliant.There was one slight issue - I had requested Champagne and Roses to be in the room on arrival.  I e-mailed to confirm this would happen on the morning of our arrival and received a response confirming it was all in place.  However when we arrived in the room - no roses!!  Approximately 15 minutes after I sent an e-mail there was a knock on the door -  a beautiful bunch of Red Roses which actually made it more of a surprise for my Girlfriend (who was already loving the room and champagne!).  This was followed by a phone call apologising and advising I wouldn't be charged - so then I enjoyed the champagne too!! This was dealt with so well it did not spoil our experience at all.
On arrival we were told we had a free upgrade to an Executive King - the room was brilliant.  The most comfortable bed I have ever slept in and so quiet.  Heated floor in the bathroom is amazing, as is the shower, and TV in the bath.  In my youth I was a lighting engineer for a number of bands/clubs so found the lighting controls for the room quite straightforward, however.....!!
On the morning of the second day we woke to see some filming happening across the road - Downton Abbey no less, so this was an added perk! In the evening we had cocktails in the Bassoon Bar - not cheap but very good and no more expensive than anywhere else of this ilk.  This was followed by Dinner in The Northall.  Food was excellent with great service - a very knowledgable Sommelier.    One slight negative - I had been told there was only the Valentines Menu available (which was an excellent menu) but did notice other diners having another menu.  
Breakfast served in the room each morning was very good.
I have never written such a long review, but this hotel deserves it. I sell Land Rover/Range Rover and this hotel had only a few days before been held up as an example of 5 Star Service that I am expected to supply to my customers, so I was extra critical.  Even when things went ever so slightly wrong they handled everything really well.
Believe the hype and stay here you will not be disappointed.  I certainly aim to stay here again.",5,2014,02,17
143,A beautiful property,"I chose this hotel for celebrating my parents silver anniversary and it was a great decision. The hotel has large, high-ceiling beautiful common areas and an enormous italian restaurant. The Deluxe suite was great and we had a wonderful time at the hotel!",5,2014,02,14
143,Our problems during our stay,"It is not our first time at the Corinthia, we have stayed there several times. The hotel is really nice but we noticed that the quality decreased. 
Our problems:
-no mobile connection in the rooms, we had to go to lobby/street to use our mobiles
-wifi connection gets disconnected frequently
-housekeeping problems: housekeeping took away dirty coffee cups, glasses, plates etc. but forgot to bring new ones...not a good surprise before your morning coffee. They left the windows open in the rooms so when we returned in the pm, it was freezing in the rooms. Not a nice surprise in winter with 5 degrees outside....I found dirty glasses next to the minibar in the cupboard that was left from a previous guest..disgusting! I saw greasy hair left on the hairdryer from another guest...I almost threw up.
I am very sensitive about these hygiene issues so I was unsure if the room was properly cleaned at all and I did not feel good staying in the room.
It is a shame because I think it is a beautiful hotel but I am afraid I will not come back for a while.",3,2014,02,14
143,Truely 5 star hotel,I had a priviledge to stay here.  I always have been disappointed by London hotels since they are not value for money.  The Corinthia is guranteeing what you get by what you pay.  It is an expensive hotel but it worth it.  But travellers are advised that this is not a business oriented hotel.  There is no desk fit for work. Just relax and enjoy this hotel.,5,2014,02,13
143,Exquisite,"I chose the Corinthia for a weekend away after scouring the internet for luxury hotels in London.  It was my boyfriend's 30th birthday and I wanted it to be special.  The second we arrived, I knew it was going to be that.  The smartly dressed Concierge immediately assisted us out of the taxi, taking our bags, which reappeared in our room.  

As you walk into the hotel you are greeted by high gloss floors, beautiful flower arrangements and gigantic chandeliers.  It certainly has the wow factor.  I never take much notice of photographs provided by management on Trip Advisor, as I worry that they are touched up or portray something better than the reality, but I can honestly say that even the photographs on the website of the Corinthia do not do this place justice.  You simply have to visit to experience it for yourself.  

At check in, we were informed that we had been given a complimentary room upgrade, before being offered a short tour of the hotel's restaurants and bars.  The public areas are luxurious and clean.  The hallways smell of new carpet.  

The room itself consisted of a huge bed, a fitted wardrobe, a flat screen television, two arm chairs and a desk area.  We had two small Juliet balconies opening out over the inner courtyard. The colour schemes are muted and pleasant.  The bed sheets are of such high thread count that they feel like silk.   The bathrobes are white and fluffy and replaced daily, as are the slippers.

We discovered a square birthday cake adorned with a macaroon and a small box of chocolates next to a handwritten welcome note, which was a very luxurious touch.

The bathroom was like a spa in itself.  There was a small flat screen television at the end of the bath, two sinks and a separate walk in shower.  The shower head was so large and powerful that I could have stayed in there all day.  The products provided are produced by ESPA (the same as the spa) and smell divine.  Most importantly, everything felt brand new.  I don't usually take a bath in a hotel or like walking around in bare feet, but in the Corinthia I felt completely at home.

The service was also impeccable.  We had brought a selection of DVDs only to discover that the room did not have a DVD player.  We telephoned reception and they quickly attended to install one.  The turn down service involved leaving a small selection of sweets on our pillows, which added some fun.

We visited the Massimo restaurant within the hotel for dinner and tried oysters for the first time.  The staff were attentive but not overpowering, explaining the different types of oyster and where they are sourced.  The ambience and lighting in the restaurant is perfect for romance.

We also visited the Bassoon Piano Bar for cocktails and live music.  The cocktail menu is extensive and each cocktail is prepared like an art form.  They are expensive, we spent around £70 for 4 drinks, but we wanted to have the full experience and it isn't something we would splash out on regularly. You are provided with a small stand of nibbles, such as nuts and olives, which are frequently replaced even when they are not yet finished!

The spa is like no other spa I have ever visited.  Again, it is extremely clean and luxurious.  There is a dark relaxation area with beautiful other-worldly light fittings.  The sauna is a glass theatre in the middle of the spa.  The Jacuzzi or Vitality Pool is spacious and equipped with internal lounging areas and spray jets.  Cream leather sofas line the pool area on one side.  I was a little apprehensive when I saw these in the photographs, thinking that by now they are probably grubby and a bit damp from the splashes of swimmers but I shouldn't have worried.  They were immaculate.

So far this review has been glowing, but there were 3 areas that I thought fell slightly below perfection.  

At breakfast (which is served in The Northall) and consists of a fantastic buffet and made to order selection, the bread was a white, shop bought loaf.  For a hotel of this standard, I would have preferred a selection of rustic uncut loaves.  

During our visit to the Bassoon bar there were a rather roudy group of Russian visitors, who were drinking excessively, dancing, arm wrestling and moving furniture.  Bar staff and security monitored the situation and apologised to other visitors, but did not ask them to leave.  Eventually, they spoilt the enjoyment for ourselves and another couple and we retired to our room.  I can only assume that due to the amount of money they were spending, their custom was worth their chaos.

Lastly, we accidently left one of our DVDs in the DVD player.  After realising this on arriving home I didn't bother to call or write it off as any great loss, but it would have been a real 5 star service and surprise if this had been returned to us in the post.   

I have visited the Corinthia again but only for cocktails in the Bassoon bar, as I was with friends and desperate to show them why I couldn't stop talking about it.  I would stay here every time I visited London if my budget would allow, but until the next special occasion I can only admire from afar and recall what a sanctuary it is.

I have one last thing to say before I finish my review and that is about me.  When I read the positive reviews of others, I am concerned that their standards might not be as high as mine and so never completely believe a hotel or restaurant is great, until I see it for myself.  Rest assured, I am a very harsh critic, uncompromising when it comes to hygiene, cleanliness, service and quality.  And I promise you this, the Corinthia really is, absolutely exquisite.",5,2014,02,12
143,Best Stay in London,"The Corinthia is located in an old government building, with immediate access to Charing Cross station, the Enbankment bridge for a breath taking view of the River/Big Ben/London Eye, and a 5 minute walk to Trafalgar Square. Since it only just opened in 2011, everything is spanking new.

Unlike a lot of hotels in London, the lobby at the Corinthia is full of light. Immediately I was greeted with a large table of flowers and a beautiful chandelier. Never really one for those gigantic bouquets, I thought having the flowers in multiple smaller vases were a nice modern touch. The lobby lounge is open and airy, thanks to the super high ceiling and modern decor. You can get afternoon tea here or casual bites. There’s an outdoor area if you prefer that.

I had a Deluxe Junior Suite, a large space of 700 sq ft. There’s an informal foyer leading into the office, which is separated from the bedroom (with a door). The office has a flat screen TV, mini bar, Nespresso machine and a large working desk. Perfect if you want to get some work done without disturbing whoever is in the bedroom.

The bedroom is a large open space, which you won’t find in too many London hotels since they tend to be smaller and more traditional in structure. The room features a gorgeous dark wood floor, a king size bed, LED tv, a sitting area, a cute Juliette balcony that overlooks the courtyard and a large walk-in closet with motion sensor lights. Marble bathroom has a relaxing soaking tub with built-in TV, tropical rain shower and luxurious bath products from their spa. 

(When you book your room online, in addition to room photos, you can also see a floorplan and the actual size of the room. A feature I personally find helpful because hotels in Europe tend to have smaller rooms compare to the US)

Speaking of, I wasted no time to check out the spa and gym. The gym is 24 hours, but you do need to access it from the spa elevator after 10PM, with your room keycard. What I really liked about the gym was it had a fridge stocked with water and fresh oranges, an extremely rare find in London hotels.

The next day I headed to the spa, which spans over four floors: the spa, the thermal spa with heated pool, the gym and the changing rooms.The reception area is beautiful with plush seating and refreshments. There’s a small dining room if you want to eat. My therapist took me to the changing room, which had fireplace and relaxation area, a steam room, a sauna, a large shower room and of course, individual private ones. The individual massage room is also equipped with a relaxation area and a plush shower. My massage was so good I actually fell asleep.

I had breakfast every morning at the North Hall restaurant, which was MASSIVE. It spans over 3 huge rooms (I had no idea ‘til I was sat in different rooms every morning). The breakfast buffet was probably the best I’ve had in London. A huge variety of breakfast pastries, fresh juice, fruits and hot foods. It’s not cheap at 30 pounds a person (but this is where the Amex FHR comes in handy, complimentary! but in all honesty, I would pay 30 pounds to eat here every morning if I lived close enough), and there’s the option of ordering a la carte if you prefer that. 

However, what really made my stay at the Corinthia hotel was the service. Someone walked me to my room, checked in with me twice during breakfast and she was also the one that sent me off at the end; the flowers in my room were changed everyday; I never had to wait more than 5 minutes for any in-room services; one evening I had complained about slow internet, which was no fault of the hotel (just busy aka slower on weekends). The hotel manager personally came out and made sure I wasn’t unhappy with my stay because of it. Of course not! I couldn’t be happier with my stay at the Corinthia and would absolutely recommend this fine hotel to anyone that is looking for a five star experience in London. I’m already plotting my next stay!

Ps, one thing that made a big impression on me was my welcome card. Usually I would get a generic typed letter, with the manager’s signature. But my note at the Corinthia was 100% written by hand. It’s the little things that matters most.",5,2014,02,11
143,Stunning hotel but charges to use the pool!! Classless.,"This hotel is stunning - probably one of the most beautiful hotels in London. But at a minimum of £400 per night, I was flabbergasted when asked to pay £25 for my morning swim. The reason I was given? ESPA is independent of the hotel. Well of course it is - most top hotels use ESPA, Elemis or some other established spa brand. But they do not charge hotel guests for use of their pools. If ESPA at Gleneagles don't charge then ESPA at Corinthia shouldn't charge either. If ESPA wants money from each guest that uses their pool then they should take this up with Corinthia and collect the money from them instead. 

I swim every morning and every evening. My stay was for 4 nights. If my wife had been with me then I would have had £400 of swimming charges added to my bill. Completely outrageous. I declined the offer to pay £25 for 3 hours maximum in the pool and went to a nearby gym instead. One of the main reasons I chose the Corinthia was for it's thermal floor. I left the hotel feeling duped as the policy is nowhere to be seen on their website - nor is it mentioned on check-in. If Corinthia wants to be considered one of the finest hotels in London then it really must address this pay-as-you-swim charge. This is a 5-star hotel - not an easyjet flight.",3,2014,02,11
143,"Luxury hotel, location good","Classic London luxury, location is great both for business (between West end and the City), concierge service and front desk very helpful, SPA and especially the various pools, sauna etc very good. Roomservice menu good and service very dependable, which is great on a business trip. All in all my favourite hotel for business stays, but restrictive policy re children in the pool, keep me from bringing my family here",4,2014,02,10
143,Good hotel but not flawless!,"We stayed in this lovely hotel during a Business Conference. The staff are all very friendly and most helpful at all times. Our bedroom was very comfortable but the light switches are too complicated for someone my age although I expect a teenager would master them in seconds! Watching the Olympics on the television in the BATH was a novelty! On arrival our luggage was whisked away and we were told it would be delivered to our room. When we returned to our room after a couple of hours we discovered that one of the cases in our room was not ours and one of ours was missing. Luckily ours was discovered in the reception fairly quickly but this was not the case for one of the others in our party who had to go and rent a dinner jacket as his case which contained his clothes for the evening had completely disappeared....We also had trouble trying to contact the Spa on the phone as we were cut off twice after asking the hotel operator to be put through.   In the restaurant the wine list is massive but don't expect all the wines on the list to be available and don't expect the years which are printed on the list to be correct as they aren't! The delightful waiter kept coming back to our table to apologise that the wine I'd ordered was either not in stock or from the wrong year! You may think that I'm being harsh but as this hotel is one of the most expensive in London, I do feel that it should make more effort to get the little things right.",4,2014,02,10
143,Nicest hotel I've stayed in to date ,"Very luxurious hotel, comfortable and elegant.

Brilliant location for city centre London, I just about scraped this one through the work expenses policy.

Lovely spacious rooms, plenty of room for my few days worth of stuff. 

Made use of the spa facilities, although to be honest the en-suite with rain shower and deep bath was an experience in itself.

Thought the breakfast menu was steepish so we ate elsewhere. 

Will be making a point of booking here again though if I get the chance. ",5,2014,02,09
143,Awesome Luxury Hotel,"Spent a week in this hotel when I was on business trip to London. Service was excellent. The daily breakfast was one of the best. Fresh blackberries, blueberries, raspberries and strawberries every day was a real treat. You can not beat the location. In one evening I was able to walk to Big Ben, London Eye and Trafalgar Square. The shower at the bat room is more like a water fall, never seen such a good water pressure any where. The staff were super nice and went out of their way to  make you comfortable. The breakfast staff even remembered my favorite location to sit every day. 

I had a problem with the bed sheets though. The comforter is embedded in the sheet. I was sweating in the middle of night but there is no way to choose the layers. This is some thing that they can improve.",5,2014,02,09
143,Still nice but not what it use to be,"Our third stay here, this time for my wife's birthday and although it was another great getaway, it wasn't the same as our previous stays. 

The hotel provide great service as usual, with friendly and helpful staff. The room was clean and comfy so no faults there. All the perks like tea/coffee machine, hairdryer, espa shampoo/conditioner, umbrella etc. The location of the hotel is great for visiting the sites London city has to offer, with short walk to the National Gallery, Trafalgar Sq, Leicester Sq, Covent Garden. 

The only fault this time was the change to the use of the thermal pools underneath. Previously, this use to be included with the room but has since changed to £25 per person. The main reason for staying there was to provide the wife with a relaxing stay, so use of the spa facilities was the main reason for booking the room. Unfortunately there wasn't any mention of the cost during the booking or checking in phase, and we were only informed about it once we were down there in our trunks ready for a swim. The facilities are still great but it would have been nice to be informed earlier, so please keep this in mind if you plan on using the spa.",4,2014,02,09
143,One of the best!,"Great hotel. Big rooms with multiple luxury amenities and extraordinary service. Bathrooms are spacious and full of nice features, like heated floor. Room service and hotel restaurants are incredible, like Massimo. Of course the hotel is in the expensive side, but every single detail is worth it. ",5,2014,02,08
143,Fantastic,"Gorgeous hotel, must be among the top 5 in London now.
Pros:
- Great location, close to Trafalgar Square and therefore to 2 subway stations. Yet, it is located in a relatively quiet corner. 
- Everything is very modern, from the door locks to the room light controls and amazing bathroom.
- Courteous staff. 
- Silent room - no noise from outside, or from the air conditioning or minibar. 
- Quick room service. 

Cons:
- It comes at a high price. 
- Quality of room service varies. I ordered food 3 times. Two meals were very good, but a sirloin sandwich I ordered was atrocious. ",5,2014,02,08
143,Visit to Northall Restaurant,"On 14th January I visited this lovely restaurant with my friends.  I was served by a lovely waiter, Janis, who went through the whole menu explaining what everything was, which was great for me.  All the dishes we had were delicious.  Great wine, great atmosphere, not cheap but well worth it.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a lovely treat and when I return to London I will bring my family and be treat like royalty.",5,2014,02,08
143,First Class Hotel with Very Courteous Staff,"Pros:
1. Excellent location - within walking distances to major attractions eg House of Parliament, Big Ben, Covent Garden etc
2. Very spacious rooms - huge bedroom (especially when compared to other London/European hotels) with walk-in closet between bedroom and bathroom
3. Large bathroom - double basin with built-in TV at bathtub
4. High power showers - the BEST water pressure I have ever experienced in hotels all over the world
5. Very courteous staff - some were able to greet me by last name, all took pro-active and efficient actions to assist my sick daughter during our stay (without making us feel embarrassed at all even though she vomited on the floor of the main lobby)
6. Professional concierge team - knowledgable, energetic and welcoming (run to fetch over-the-counter medications twice early in the morning without any hesitation)

Cons:
1. No loyalty program yet (upcoming though as I was told)

In all likelihood we will stay here again for our next visit to London.",5,2014,02,06
143,Amazing hotel - amazing rooms,"Been in Corinthia last spring. And was blown away with this beautiful hotel. I don't remember unfortunately which suite was I in, but it was probably the best suite I have ever been. Beautiful design, love the silence in it. Location is also one big yes to this hotel, just around the corner is Trafalgar, and everything else is on 10 minute walk from the hotel. Great breakfast, excellent service.",5,2014,02,06
143,"Great location, amazing hotel","Loved the hotel design, modern rooms, warm bathroom floor, jacazzi with TV and technology in the room and that all in the amazing location: near the Big Ben, St. James park, Buckingham palace and walking distance from Knightbridge. And what really surprised me was that the staff knew our names despite the size of the hotel.",5,2014,02,05
143,A bit special,"This hotel is ideally located by Embankment, with Trafalgar Square one end, the Thames on the other. It's the perfect base to do London by foot, which is always the best way to experience it. 

Let me assure you, this is quite simply excellence. It comes at a premium alright, but the old saying in advertising is ""reassuringly expensive""

Be reassured, myself and the other 95% of people who have rated the Corinthia as excellent can't be wrong (ignore the other 5%) - this place is a special way to experience a special city. Look no further.",5,2014,02,04
143,Very special ,On the recommendation from friends we attended the jazz Sunday brunch here and we're not disappointed. We were treated like royalty! Service was first class as was the menu... Drinks a tad expensive but for a special occasion it's very worth it,5,2014,02,03
143,Best hotel I have ever stayed in,"Absolutely out of this world.  Our family booked four rooms for a early Christmas break.  In our party was a one year old baby. The rest all adults. 
From the moment we arrived to the moment we left I can't praise the hotel, it's staff and just everything about it enough.  The hotel was spotlessly clean. The Christmas decorations phenomenal.  Our room was huge and the baby cot was immaculate.  Staff even brought a teddy bear for her.  All the little touches that made it amazing. .I loved the tv in the bathroom. 
The spa is beautiful and very clean.  I loved the location of the hotel , we were able to walk to the Thames and the South Bank Christmas Market in seconds. 
No review of this hotel is complete without a huge entry on the breakfast. OH MY WORD.  I have never ever had a buffet like that. Home made fresh carrot cake, dim sum, crazy cheese and meats, sushi plus the worlds best fry up. That's all I had room for but seriously they had more types of bread than our local supermarket.  The breakfast meant we didn't eat until tea time.  It was out of this world. 
I can't recommend the hotel enough.  The staff are so friendly abs made the stay perfect. Ps free wifi",5,2014,02,03
143,A revelation,"Unaccountably this comparatively new well situated hotel had slipped beneath our radar, and we came across it by chance when looking for somewhere topflight for a weekend in London. Having been shown a selection of rooms by an enthusiastic member of staff, we made a booking in person with the charming reception staff for a few weeks ahead. Our stay was exceptional - friendly staff, from the doormen to the managers, all of whom seemed pleased to see and serve us. The large quiet room with walk in wardrobe etc was everything we could wish for. Breakfast was one of the best we have ever had in London, both as to the choice of food and the organisation & management of the restaurant.",5,2014,02,03
143,perfect!,"everything was perfect; beautiful practical room, huge bath room, great closet, helpful, smiling efficient staff, good food, location is not my personal favorite but central enough, if you can afford it just stay there!",5,2014,02,01
143,Basson Bar,"We visited Bassoon bar just out of curiosity, and we experienced a great place, so good that we booked a birthday party. This bar has it all, outstanding and tasty cocktails, very entertaining live music, and friendly and welcoming service. We had been looked after by Stefano, very charming and elegant bartender that amazed us with his creations as well with his politeness and kindness. He convinced us to host our party in Bassoon bar and we didn’t regret it.
So quick theBassoon bar at the Corinthia hotel became our favourite bar in London, highly recommended.",5,2014,01,30
143,Best hotel in London,"Great location, near Embankment subway station. Great ambiance and magnificent suites. Stay at the Corinthia is real pleasure. I wish I could return.
Personel is really well trained and makes everything possible to make your experience at the Corinthia a unique one.",5,2014,01,29
143,Location and The way hotel should be !,"I was traveling with my 6 year old for the 1st time in london , I wanted an Top class experience for her and me , and it was in every way great , the room was spacious , the bathroom was great with tub with its own flat Tv which made it easier for my daughter get as she would watch cartoons when getting ready , The breakfast was the best meal we would have in the central london , the local phone call was almost 4 pounds a minute and i ended spending like 45 pounds for 11 min local call which is around 90 dollars more expensive than a iridium phone call , but the WIFI was free that i guess offset the phone calls , in all it was best possible hotel in the to location in the whole of central london  just on the bangs of thames ,
The way the hotel should be !!!",5,2014,01,27
143,Opulent Spa,"I took my niece for a girl's day out at the Corinthia spa.  We weren't staying.  From the welcome to the facilities to the treatments, we were in heaven!  The thermal room with steel swimming pool which reflected the ripples on the ceiling as you swam, the plunge pool and jacuzzi pods, the glass sided sauna and steam room was sophisticated, glamourous and beautiful in black and white.  We lay on beautiful white sofas to relax around the pool in cocooning warmth.  The modern chandelier in the first room with more white sofas was stunning!  And that was just one floor.  Above us on the next floor was a gym and above that the chill and relax girls changing rooms and treatment rooms.  And above that was the reception and lunch area.  Beautiful open fires graced each floor with some having warm relaxation beds - which were blissful to lie on.  We tried a manicure, pedicure, tailored facials, neck and back massage in private treatment suites.  All were fabulous with information and advice carefully provided.  The level of professionalism is sky high.  I cost us a fortune but we loved it and will go back on a special occasion.  Lunch in the spa restaurant was well-prepared and the menu diverse.  Honestly the only fault I could find was a lack of facial moisturiser after I had the final shower of the day before I got dressed and left.  Did I mention the cristal curtains in the changing rooms.  I could go on... it was amazing!  After that we had a quick drink in the central lobby bar.  Amazing cocktails and beautiful flowers.  We were so relaxed that we didn't wake up until midday the next day - sadly back at home...!  Next time, we'll stay!",5,2014,01,27
143,What all 5 star hotels should be,I stayed at this hotel for a week and it was excellent.  Its everything I wanted for my trip to London.  Everything was 5 stars. The staff was always helpful and courteous.  I have nothing to complain about.,5,2014,01,27
143,Fab u lous!!!!!!,"The Corinthian hotel is the best hotel I've ever stayed in! The staff are great, food perfect, the room was just right, bathroom with a fab shower, separate from bath, all marble, television at the end of the bath! Turn down service. Room service was quick, lovely cup of tea! The guys on the doors were so smiley and friendly. An experience I would love to have again someday! Thankyou",5,2014,01,27
143,Wow,"Corinthia is like a dream come true for me. Checked into a serene, comfortable room today, headed down to the immaculate spa for sauna and a treatment, did some work in the room (with the effortless and correctly-functioning wifi, a rarity in many hotels), and just now I polished off an excellent room service dinner. In between, somebody shined my shoes and made up the room twice. Service is genuinely excellent -- the staff try their best to be helpful. Special thanks to Josh in reception and René the bellman, but really everyone (from housekeeping to spa to doorman) seem to enjoy their jobs and do them very well. This is a well-run establishment, and my only concern is that they've spoiled me for any other London hotel.  ",5,2014,01,26
143,Truly Unbeatable,"Myself and my husband visited the Corinthia for my 30th birthday. We wanted somewhere special to suitably mark the occasion and we certainly found what we were looking for. From start to finish the whole experience was faultless. When we arrived our bags were swiftly taken from us and our car parked. Our room was ready for our slightly early arrival and we were given a complimentary room upgrade and birthday cake. The room itself was divine: the highlights being the very spacious bathroom with rainforest shower and the large bath with television screen. Every little detail had been accounted for - from the gorgeous Espa toiletries, the  efficient turn down and our complimentary chocolates. The bed was enormous and the furnishings luxurious. We had lunch in the Lobby lounge with champagne which was very relaxing. We then paid a visit to the spa, the highlight of our stay. I have been to several spas but none as glorious as this one. The design is quite simply phenomenal and you feel like you have entered another world. We left feeling totally relaxed and invigorated. We had dinner in the Northall restaurant which was delicious. We followed this with sublime cocktails in the bassoon bar. The buffet breakfast was second to none. All in all an unforgettable stay. Having stayed in a few five star hotels , this was undoubtedly the best so far. It's charm being the warm environment, positive staff who couldn't do enough for us and the outstanding attention to detail. Luxurious but at the same time welcoming and a sense that every guest is treated as if they were the most important. We will definitely be back.",5,2014,01,26
143,Disappointing Afternoon Tea ,"Having just read the last review on afternoon tea maybe they had an off day when we were there ? We were really looking forward to a family tea at the Corinthian last weekend after being shown to a very nice table we were given menus . It said that the assorted sandwiches are served on speciality breads! What in fact turned up was boring plain white & wholemeal bread ,the sandwiches were  very bland the scones were nice but the cakes were very disappointing one would expect more for £200 for four of us with a glass of champagne each .The only saving grace was the excellent service ",2,2014,01,25
143,Great place to based for a trip in london,"Its lovely hotel with all the old English charm , they upgraded me to a larger room ... Thoroughly Enjoyed my stay . very close to all the local attractions in case u want to stroll around after work....",5,2014,01,24
143,Heaven on Earth,"I work and stay in hotels for living, and typically always interested to see and learn from colleagues who had a nice budgets,great designers, craftsmen and fit out specialist at their disposal. The Corinthia Hotel London is hands down one of the best luxury hotels I stayed in, superbly renovated. The hotel room has a calming effect on you. The color scheme, layout and attention to detail is sublime. One of the most memorable bathrooms with excellent lighting in the walk in shower. The bedding and sleeping experience was first class truly luxurious.
We tried the afternoon tea which was memorable. In fact we tried all their restaurants and they all were excellent, and of high culinary quality.
My only regret was that I missed the opportunity to visit the Spa, which I understand is one of the best in London. ",5,2014,01,23
143,This is what Perfection feels like,"We recently returned from London after staying 5 flawless nights at the Corinthia London.  After staying at many high end hotels/resorts on previous vacations, (Ritz Carlton, Four Seasons, Jumeirah, St. Regis) I can without a doubt say the Corinthia London was the nicest hotel we've ever had the privilege of being a guest.

It started with our luxurious Jaguar sedan that picked us up at the airport and avoided most of the rush hour traffic.  Our driver was professional and quite knowledgeable when it came to touristy questions. 

Next, we checked in quite early as our red eye flight from the states came in around 6 AM.  Typically most hotels will not allow a check in until later in the afternoon.  To our surprise, our junior suite was ready the moment we walked into the hotel lobby.  After a long flight such as ours, there is nothing better than having the room ready for a quick recovery nap before hitting the sites.

As for the room - there was a separate sitting area with ample seating, a desk, flat screen TV, mini bar and fridge.  The bedroom itself was quite spacious giving us plenty of room for our suitcases and other belongings.  The gargantuan flat screen TV came equipped with all the cable channels one could want.  We even had a gorgeous balcony overlooking the courtyard.  What truly set this room over the top was the bathroom.  The Corinithia pays meticulous attention to detail as evidenced by the heated floor, dual head (one of which being a rain head) over-sized shower, spa like soaking tub, the largest TV I've seen in a bathroom, and exquisite marble flooring and counter tops.  Also it should be noted that the interior designers who assembled the furniture, picked out the colors, designed the layout should be commended; it was tasteful, functional and everything we enjoy in a five star hotel (is it possible to give the Corinithia 6 stars?).  

Another nice detail was the housekeeping service.  When leaving our room we turned the ""make up room"" switch on and presumably the staff is notified electronically that we are leaving and would like service.  Every time we left the room and came back they always had the room cleaned and ready for us.  Their turn down presentation was also a treat, we definitely enjoyed seeing what surprises awaited us each evening!

Regarding the service, specifically the concierge:  Months up until to arrival I had the pleasure of working with Max and his team.  Not once did they fall through on a request or question I asked them.  While their service was stellar via e-mails prior to our arrival, their in person service transcended any of our expectations. They knew us by name, knew our itinerary almost better than we did, consistently inquired how each meal/tour was and insisted they do everything possible to ensure our holiday was one to remember.  One example of how they achieved such a feat was a brief conversation we had with them regarding one of our meals at Locanda Locatelli where the service at the restaurant was anything but praiseworthy.  When we mentioned our disappointment to one of the concierge team members (I wish I remembered his name but it escapes me), the look on his face (and the two others who were happening to listen in) was that of being mortified.  They were so upset we didn't have a fantastic meal and informed us they would be phoning the restaurant to speak with management and figure out why were were mistreated.  We told them, it wasn't a huge deal and it didn't ruin our night, we just wanted to let them know it wasn't a place we'd return.  But again, they insisted they follow up with the restaurant.  Max's team went out of their way time and time again and instances like these illustrate their consummate professionalism.  Many many kudos to the concierge team!   

As for the rest of the hotel -  The common spaces, bars, restaurant and gym were all immaculate and well maintained.  We were too busy to take advantage of the spa but we did manage one quick work out session in the gym which had state of the art machines and had everything one needs when trying to get an excellent workout in on vacation.

In sum, I can't thank Corinithia enough for making our London holiday truly magical.  We simply have one request, perhaps they could open a Corinthia hotel in America somewhere?",5,2014,01,22
143,Excellent Cocktail Bar,We came here for cocktails. The service was impeccable and they were willing to make cocktails not in the menu. Good selection of nibbles provided with the drinks. Lovely atmosphere with a live pianist.,5,2014,01,20
143,The best hotel in London,"As an extremely active traveller I must say that without a doubt The Corinthia Hotel is the best hotel in London, if not one of the best in the world.

From the intelligent and elegant doormen to the efficient and polite front desk to the discrete bellmen, waiters and other staff not a moment was missed that made one feel like the most important person in the world.

Of course, at prices like these they most certainly should, but service at this level should never be dismissed no matter the cost - there are plenty of other hotels with the same prices that could never hope to reach the level of attentiveness that Corinthia achieves.

The hotel itself is unbelieveably beautiful (especially the floral arrangements). I loved spending a rainy English morning watching tv in the bathtub while nibbling the amazing (but pricey) breakfast.

I will most certainly return!",5,2014,01,17
143,What a beautiful hotel and great location,"My Partner and I stayed in the Corinthia Hotel on the weekend of the 28th Dec 2013. The hotel looked amazing with all of the Christmas decorations in white. The service from the moment you stepped into the lobby was just what I would have expected from a hotel of this calibre and thats just what we recieved. We had a deluxe room which was perfect, after wondering around London all day I just wanted to soak in the bath and watch the TV in my own littel world. The bed was huge and very comfortable. We met with some friends for breakfast in the hotel and we also enjoyed high tea..both of which I would recommend. Its also in a perfect location, close to Trafalger square, Soho, etc, you can walk anywhere, its perfect. When we left for the next stage of our European trip to Stockholm, before we knew it we had checked  and our bags already in the cab as we walked out of the hotel...I would never stay anywhere else when in London but in this hotel. We will see you later again this year ...",5,2014,01,16
143,Afternoon Tea...mmmmmm,"Reading the reviews, I chose this venue for a surprise afternoon tea for my hubby's birthday.   Upon entering the Lobby Lounge you're immediately drawn towards the spectacular chandelier  and directly beneath it a stunning floral display.  You're made to feel welcome and I cannot fault the service.  The ambience was relaxed without being pompous or stuffy.  I have to mention our waiter as he truly made it an occasion.  Following our scrummy sandwiches, the waiter bought a little candlelit cake with happy birthday piped on a piece of chocolate.  What a lovely touch.  We tried 3 different teas, a wonderful array of cakes and my hubby had more scones!!  All I can say, it was indulgent but worth every penny and we'll definitely be returning. 

This is a 5 star hotel which doesn't fail to impress.",5,2014,01,15
143,Stunning hotel,"With meetings in Canary Wharf, I was looking for a hotel which wasn't so far from the financial district, yet still in the centre of London. The Corinthia was my find and I was especially pleased with this choice.

This ancient building has been renovated to a top standard and is a joy to admire and appreciate as a guest. The room I stayed in had plenty of bright space and a good working area. The bed was large and very comfortable. No issues to report here.

The staff are well trained and on the look out to assist you in any way. No request seemed to be a bother to anyone I approached, which positively reflects the 5 star status of this hotel.

Embankment tube station is a few paces away and you are equally close to Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. In my book, this hotel is competing with The Lanesborough and no other.",5,2014,01,12
143,Excellent cocktails!,"I went to Corinthia with some friends because they recommend us the cocktails in the bar. The bartender, Rocco ( a Italian guy) was outstanding! He gave us some tips about the cocktail and drinks that we could order. Never stayed in the hotel but if it is as good as the bar and the service definitely will consider it. ",5,2014,01,11
143,Best hotel in London bar none - and as a Londoner I can vouch we have some good and some really bad!,"I am from London but now live abroad so always end up in a hotel when there and have stayed at the Savoy, Waldorf, No 1 St Martins Lane etc. and this is by far the best.  The rooms are really modern, beautifully designed and also practical.  The staff are helpful and efficient without being 5 star hotel officious.  I have stayed here 3 times and twice there have been problems at check-in (lost my booking) which is probably the only issue we faced  - everything else was really good.  A little pricey but worth that little bit extra.",5,2014,01,11
143,The real test is when things go wrong...,"We had a less-than-perfect 3-night stay at the Corinthia in June 2013 and I wrote a less-than-stellar review here on TripAdvisor. Our main complaint concerned noise in the room. Well, you can't imagine how shocked I was to be contacted directly by the hotel's General Manager, who without any prompting offered us a complimentary future stay -- in effect, giving us a ""do-over"" at no cost. I was very impressed with how well he listened to what I had to say, responding without any defensiveness and addressing the issues I raised. I really felt my opinions were valued.

Attention to detail and making guests feel appreciated are two things that separate the best hotels from the merely mediocre. Yes, it's great when a hotel gets everything perfectly right the first time, but things can go wrong even at top hotels, and the way problems are handled makes a huge difference.

We recently (December 2013 and January 2014) stayed at the Corinthia twice -- taking the GM up on the free stay and also booking a paid stay -- and I'm happy to report that both stays were excellent. The rooms we were assigned were some of the quietest we've experienced anywhere in London. As is often the case when we arrive in London, we were exhausted and it was so wonderful to sink into a comfortable bed and sleep uninterrupted.

We had some excellent interactions with hotel staff and found everyone very helpful. The food in the restaurant was very good. There are a lot of restaurants and theaters within easy walking distance, and the hotel's proximity to the Embankment tube station makes it super convenient.

I'm sure we'll stay at the Corinthia many times in the future.",5,2014,01,10
143,Wow - out of this world!,"It has taken me a while to write this review due to a combination of circumstances, but  I can genuinely say that my experience at the Corinthia in early September was truly awesome. My wife had booked a one-night stay for my birthday weekend, and from the minute we arrived we were treated to superb service and a room to match!

In fact, my wife and I were so blown away by the experience, that I've returned the compliment and have booked us in for a 2-night stay for her special birthday weekend at the end of May - we can't wait!

143,Terrific Service,"Frankly, we can be a little picky about things, but to me a good judge of a hotel is how well they respond to requests.  We stayed over the holidays for 10 days.  During our stay my daughter was sick and need a doctor.  Not only was the physician in our room right away, but the persciption medication was purchased and delivered to us in our room, promptly on Christmas eve.  Then on Christmas morning at 2 am, none the less, the hotel was very responsive to help with the illness, call the physician and procuring more medicine when the entire city was closed.  

Many other aspects of our stay were handled with grace and ease.  The service was always ""right there"" but not too much.  For anyone who wants and expects good service, go and enjoy.  

The raspberries were beautiful each morning.  The tea service was wonderful in the evening and the food in both the Northall and Massimo was excellent.  My mom and daughter enjoyed the spa treatments.  My 5 year old really liked the swimming pool which was warm and the room with the pool was also warm so that you could really relax.",5,2014,01,07
143,Faultless – this hotel is amazing!,"I have stayed here twice for work and this is by far the best hotel I have ever stayed in.

The location is also great for sightseeing, with Parliament, the London Eye and the West End all within very easy walking distance.

The rooms are luxurious, tastefully decorated and the beds are amazingly comfortable.  The rain shower is incredible but the TV at the end of the bathtub will make taking a soak more tempting.

More than anything, the service is exceptional – staying here is a wonderful experience.

One thing to note however, all extras e.g. room service, minibar, spa treatments, seem much more expensive than the nearby 4 star hotels I have stayed in on other visits to London.
This probably won’t be a problem if you can afford the full price of a night in this hotel, but if, like me, you are staying at a discounted rate (corporate discount) it’s worth knowing there is quite a noticeable difference in price.",5,2014,01,06
143,A great weekend at the Corinthia.,"My wife and I have just returned from our second stay at the Corinthia and, once again, we loved it. The service is absolutely first class with nothing seeming to be too much trouble. Service throughout our stay be it in the restaurants, at reception or the concierge desk was always of the highest standard. We upgraded our room this stay and, though the one last time was perfectly fine, this larger one was even better. As for the location well, frankly, it must be about the best in London, only a stones throw from Trafalgar Square and many of the theatres yet so quiet and peaceful.
Be assured, we will be back!",5,2014,01,05
143,Perfect location and delightlful British service,"My husband and I surprised my daughter with a trip to London for her Sweet 16. We also brought along one of her friends. We wanted to show the girls as much of the city as possible. The Corinthia has THE perfect location. We were walking distance from the London Eye, Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, House of Parliament, Buckingham Palace as well as a short walk to  the National Gallery, Liescester Square and Piccadilly Circus. The only time we needed to take public transportation was to the Tower of London and Harrod's which were only a couple of miles away respectively. The staff was extremely attentive and pleasant without being overbearing. We spent a day at their spa. It was a magnificent experience. The ESPA was immaculate and the spa services, spa lunch and facilities were truly a treat! The rooms were very spacious and are state of the art. Our bathroom had heated towel bars and radiant heated floors. The lobbies and restaurants are beautiful as well. I highly recommend!",5,2014,01,05
143,Best hotel in London!,"We have stayed at a few hotels in London and this is certainly one of the best. We went for a standard room which was beautiful. I can only imagine how nice the bigger rooms are with River Thames views! Spa out of this world, just give your self plenty of time. Outdoor bar with fireplaces was my highlight. ",5,2014,01,05
143,The Absolute Best Place to Stay!!!!,"London is our favorite city to visit and our favorite hotel is the Corinthia.  We have stayed ther a couple of times and are planning to stay many more.  We plan our travels well in advance and from making the reservationto departure the service is first class.  The concierge made all of our dinner and show reservations for us as well as transport to and from Heathrow. They also took care of making changes to out dining plans when we changed our minds, and making sure our car was cleared for the Virgin Atlantic check in.  The hotel gave us adjoining rooms so our teens could have their own but close. The rooms are amazing, comfortable, well adorned almost better than home.  The restaurants are great, terrific food and ambience.  The spa and workout facilities are awesome.  I can't say enough good things about the Corinthia or recommend it highly enough. We have stayed at a few other high end hotels in London but this is the only one we""ll stay in from no on.",5,2014,01,05
143,Beautiful and Professional Inside Out,"The hotel is beautiful in the lobby, restaurants as well as inside the rooms. The Lowe TV  is a bonus. The heated floor bathroom made the whole 7 days stay very comfortable. Water pressure was the best I ever had! The lining was clean and soft. Even the hairdryer was professional!

Breakfast and afternoon tea were good. Joe at the lobby lounge was genuinely friendly and attentive. All staff were very professional, particularly the concierge team.

Location is great, it is literally at the centre of all tourist attractions.

The VIP seats for the new year parade was so memorable that I am planning to pay another visit.",5,2014,01,05
143,Perfect!,"From the moment you arrive at the Corinthia you are transported into a world of pampered tranquility despite being located right in the heart of the city. The staff were excellent, attentive and professional without being overbearing and nothing was too much trouble. The rooms are fantastic, we'll appointed with amazing bathrooms and exceptionally comfortable beds. I particularly like the rooms with the central hallway, I'm not sure what these are classed as but worth asking for if you stay here. Can't recommend this hotel highly enough, a must for any type of stay in London.",5,2014,01,05
143,THE BEST,"My wife and I booked a reservation for the ""The Northall "" restaurant for new years eve,we have
eaten in the restaurant on several occasions and like the food, as it is situated in the""Corinthia""
hotel and as the Corinthia is allmost on top of the fire work display that was going to take place that evening,it was going to be impossible to get home due to the roads being blocked off so we decided to stay a night in a suite, well the rooms were enormous with tv's in all rooms including the bathroom,the bathroom had under floor heating, spa bath and many other features.
There was just one thing that we did not like and that was an over efficient air con. unit that we could not control,it was still the same after the engineer had left ,so after another phone call we
were moved to another room,they said it would be warmer with log fires and under floor heating
well it turned out to be the penthouse suite,well needless to say my wife and I felt like royalty.
The resaurant meal and the liverly evening was also fantastic.In the morning the manager came up to us as we were checking out to opolgize for the faulty air con.unit,and hoped we were pleased with the change of rooms,well what more can we say only that if it was possible to give the ""Corinthia"" and staff a six star we would.We will certainly be coming back and will be  highly recomending the hotel and resaurant to others.

143,Fantastic Corinthia,"My wife and I spent NYE here. Fantastic location, fantastic hotel, fantastic staff and atmosphere. 
Rooms, staff, food, drinks are exactly what you would expect from a top London hotel. Reception/Concierge could not have been more helpfull. 
Very Very  Highly recommended. 
Great stay. ",5,2014,01,03
143,"Beautiful hotel, excellent service...go on, spoil yourself!","After a hectic year, my friend and I really wanted to treat ourselves to a weekend of luxury and pampering; this hotel didn’t disappoint!  From the time of our arrival to the day of departure, every aspect of the service was impeccable; the staff are clearly highly trained, competent and happy to go above and beyond to ensure you have an excellent stay.  Antigoni (Reception) was a delight and a true credit to the hotel; she was professional, helpful and always had a smile.  

We had a deluxe room (No. 132) with a city view located on the first floor, Northumberland Road side of the hotel; despite being a main road, the room was quiet and peaceful.  The room was elegant, tasteful and extremely comfortable; the nespresso machine, the huge rain shower, the heated bathroom floor, the deep bath with view and TV, the abundance of Espa toiletries, the extremely luxurious beds with quality linen, mood lighting and access to your room bill via the TV were all added extras that really made this hotel stand out above the rest. 
 
The spa was amazing and we enjoyed a couple of hours on Friday evening lounging in the Jacuzzi and sampling the steam room and ice bucket; it is a beautiful spa and a real credit to the hotel.  

What was truly outstanding was the service we received from all staff, there are many excellent examples but to name a few: room service answered the phone almost the same second we called to order food, the food was delivered hot, well presented and exactly as we had ordered, housekeeping run a tight ship and despite our messy ways, the room was immaculate and clean every time we returned, there was no hesitation to bring additional milk/tea/coffee to our room immediately on request.  Overall we felt as though we receive service fit for royalty.  Well done Corinthia for making it such a memorable and stress-free weekend…..we will definitely be visiting again!",5,2014,01,02
143,THERE ARE BETTER,"I had to go to London 1 week earlier than expected during the Holidays.  I managed to get a room here, I am usually at the Dorchester and was moving there right after. I am used to the perfect routine of the Dorchester

The Corinthia has many flaws. The architects and designers decided to give an opulent lobby and restaurants then may have said rooms are not important   I had an Executive double the largest of the double rooms.    No view, small, no mirror in bedroom so blow drying hair very difficult.  A new hotel, yet they put a table, no desk, so computer and any electrical hangs on floor.  The decor is beige beige and more beige. Since the lobby is over the top they must have employed a designer who did 3 star hotels. I did not like the room at all. The service was very good.  The food in room ding and Massimo was just ok. No flowers or fruit in room tiny closet space  They sell flowers downstairs 

When I switched after 6 days, to Dorchester, and walked into my room SAME PRICE facing park,fruit and flowers lovely decor, larger space, big desk, 3 closets.  I love it.  

As a new hotel Corinthia could have done so much but did not.    Also ESPA SPA. Was all marble, very pretty again confirmed two different designers rooms and hotel",3,2014,01,02
143,Fresh & Comfortable Hotel,"- Large and very comfortable rooms (including huge walk-in closet)

- Nice spa (though a bit small)

- It is possible to open windows to get some fresh air

- Nice breakfast room with high ceilings

- Location is central; though i personally prefer mayfair area",5,2014,01,01
143,Wonderful hotel,"This hotel is setting the bar high for all others. The rooms, service, food, decor and location are all excellent. The gym is the best hotel gym that I've ever seen and the thermal floor in the spa is incredible. We'll be back.",5,2014,01,01
143,Amazing,"Staff was amazing, room was clean and quite, fabulous breakfast. I would definitely stay again and loved everything about the hotel. I loved it. Great spa and pool for the kids.

143,Wonderful stay,"Above five star rating! Spa was amazing, must go there if staying at the hotel.Staff were out of their way helpful and service was excellent.

143,Lovely Stay,"first visit to the Corinthia and was well impressed with the quality of such a new hotel but with a real authentic feel of oldy worldy 5 star hotels that London do so well. Service was impeccable and had dinner in the hotel and it was lovely. Piano Bar was  top notch too, well done. Also attended a conference in the day and it was quality too.",4,2013,12,31
143,Superb,"Facilities, staff, ambience all excellent and the location is a fantastic base for accessing all of central London especially Covent Garden and Westminster.

Although not cheap, the afternoon tea at the hotel is well worth a try.",5,2013,12,31
143,First class stopover,"The only disappointment of our recent Saturday one-night visit to London (to see a show at the O2) was that we only got to stop one night at the Corinthia, and so did not get the opportunity to try all of the amenities. Check-in was fast, efficient, friendly and courteous - and for an extra £40 we took the offered upgrade on the room. The room itself was spacious and well-equipped, the bed very comfortable and the linens luxurious. The bathroom was delightful - TV at the end of the bath, good toiletries, lovely fluffy towels and a welcome heated floor. The location is central but very quiet - we were not disturbed by any noise either inside or from outside the hotel. If you are travelling to the O2, the Thames Clipper is a leisurely 10 minute stroll over the river and a great way to travel to the venue. Upon returning to the hotel, we went to the bar for a nightcap. There was a pianist and singer playing showtunes and the bar was packed. Luckily, we got a table but others were not so lucky so it's worth booking a table in advance if you want to use the bar later in the evening. Overall, a delightful stay and one that I am sure would have merited 5 stars if only we had the time to try the spa, pool, restaurants etc.",4,2013,12,30
143,Perfect!,"It's rare to visit a hotel, particularly for me in my job where I stay in a lot of hotels, and end up feeling like it was perfect. There's always something that can be a little better, the bed, the shower, one staff member who was a little off, or some food that was below par. Possibly for the first time, I enjoyed a hotel stay which could not have been better. It was perfect. The room, the spa, the general decor and comfort, the food and drink, and probably most of all an exceptional group of staff who were never short of delightful, without ever being overbearing. You do of course pay for all of this, but as a treat it was so very worth it. This is an exceptional hotel in an ideal spot, highest marks and praise indeed for a truly outstanding experience. We will be back!",5,2013,12,29
143,Afternoon tea,"I came here for afternoon tea with a friend around Christmas time. The hotel itself is stunning and the restaurant where the tea was served was beautifully decorated. The tea itself was good but I've tasted better. The finger sandwiches were fairly standard and quite pleasant to eat. The cakes had clearly been made with a lot of attention to detail but this did not always translate into the taste. Unfortunately, as vegetarians, we could not sample some of the cakes because they contained gelatine and this limited our choice. If you do not have specific dietary preferences, I would suggest you try this for a special occasion, however I do not think I would visit again.",3,2013,12,28
143,"Excellent, fabulous, outstanding...undoubtedly the best hotel in London!","We had the best hotel experience in London. The food was great, breakfast .....heaven, the staff very professional, beyond everything we have ever experienced ...our special thanks to mrs. Antigoni , a wonderful lady who, wholeheartedly made us feel valued clients. Congratulations to owners and to the general manager of the hotel for the best staff a hotel can have. The room was very clean, very nice furnished, great bathroom with separate bath tub and shower cabin. The location of the hotel is walking distance to Trafalgar Square, London Eye etc. Undoubtedly Corinthia Hotel is a beautiful oasis in one of the most beautiful towns in the world and we are sure that in short time is going to be the best hotel in London!",5,2013,12,28
143,One of the best in London...,"I have stayed at many five star hotels in London and other major cities.   My wife and I spent a weekend here, and the room and service were excellent.  We also liked the location.   We will be back when we come to London next.",5,2013,12,27
143,disappointed,"We stayed here late summer with my kids ,we had heard good reviews about this hotel so thought we would try it.
Sadly we had terrible problems checking in , we were in London for 1 night only taking the kids for early dinner at 5pm and then a show.
We arrived at the hotel at 3.40pm , we understood that check in was 3pm so we did not foresee a problem , how ever our room was not ready and was actually not ready until 4.40pm in the end, 20 minutes before we needed to be out!  
When we did get in the room it was boiling hot as the air con had been on full heat ,  we ended up  with 10 minutes rushing about in the heat trying to get ready.  The hotel did get one of its cars' to drive us to the restaurant which was a nice gesture but all in all our weekend was really spoilt by rushing around the whole evening seemed ruined for there on in.
When we were waiting for our room we were offered a free drink when I asked for a glass of wine we were told it only tea and coffee that would be complimentary.
I was quite surprise have stayed at other high end hotels in London and never had this before.
The family room its self was lovely , the kids loved the TV in the bath - What a shame we had so little time to enjoy the room!",3,2013,12,27
143,Weekend of Luxury,An outstanding stay at a lavish venue. This is an establishment where customers are made to feel valued which is all too rare these days.  Hotel is handily situated for the tube and close to major attrcations,5,2013,12,27
143,Outstanding Location and Service,"My husband and I stayed here in December for a Christmas getaway, we wanted to experience some cold weather (its warm where we live) and Christmas cheer, which London is full of! We picked the Corinthia based on reviews and what appeared to be a good location, and we are so happy we did. 
The location can't be beat. We could walk practically everywhere, and the embankment tube is a very convenient line, we could go most places we wanted to go without transfer. We really didn't need to cab at all. This hotel is walking distance to Westminster Abbey, Parliament, Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, St. Paul's Cathedral, the Churchill War Rooms, most of the popular Theatres, Trafalgar Square, Sommerset House, tons of parks and museums, it was a bit far but we also had a nice walk to Harrods and the wonderful high end shopping over on Sloane street and Knightsbridge area. 
The service at the hotel was outstanding all around. Breakfast was delivered every morning on time to our room with professionalism and a smile. I had many requests that the concierge happily fulfilled prior to our arrival including obtaining some very hard to get theater tickets, and multiple dinner reservations. Max and other concierge staff, thank you for all your help!  The doormen were attentive, I never had to open the door, they always were there to greet us.  And housekeeping was also very good. I appreciate the washcloth under makeup compacts and other toiletries, extra items of what was clearly being used the most, organization of the countertop, a clean pair of slippers each night, etc. I also want to add that they have excellent hairdryers, BaByliss Pro Hairdryers, so I didn't have to fry my fine hair with a standard hotel hairdryer. 
The room and bathroom were a nice size, I thought they were larger by European hotel standards. 
Lastly, if you stay here you MUST do the champagne tea. It was such a wonderful experience, I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting London, they must go here for tea. I wish we had time to do it more than once.  
Overall we had a wonderful trip and this hotel was a big part of it, so thank you to all the staff.",5,2013,12,26
143,Excellent,"This was a weekend spa break. The hotel was simply outstanding throughout, from the quality of the room, the unfailingly courteous staff, the range and quality of the breakfast. The spa was unbelievable in its scale, ambience and is fully deserving of it's reputation as a must-visit.",5,2013,12,25
143,Our favorite hotel ever!,"The Corinthia is perfect in every way!  Our room was luxurious and large, the on-site restaurant was delicious and service was perfection in all aspects of the hotel.  Two  of our favorite room features were the huge walk-in closet and the fabulous shower.  Location was also wonderful--very close to the Embankment tube stop, we were able to quickly reach our destinations.  We rank Corinthia higher than most of the five-star hotels where we have stayed and look forward to returning whenever we visit London again.",5,2013,12,21
143,Excellent,"Went out to London with the family. Fantastic facilities and staff! Would visit again when next in
London! Excellent night sleep and topped off the weekend...........will visit again. Worth an extra night, we didn't want to leave!!!!!!!!!",5,2013,12,16
143,Excellent Afternoon Tea,"We had afternoon tea here sometime in November and it was a great experience. 

I initially wanted to book the Ritz but it was fully booked. I checked references from The UK Tea Guild and i found that Corinthia ranked consistently amongst the top 10

Booking was easy and online. Confirmation was sent immediately.

For people who appreciate experiences like this, Corinthia is the place to be. 

The quality of the tea, the ambiance and the service was fantastic. We started with hand crafted sandwich and moved on to more intricate luxurious tarts, cakes and cookies while our tea was refreshed continuously

By the time we were done, we knew that we couldn't eat dinner any longer! We were thoroughly satisfied

All this for how much? Just about £50 per person!

I strongly recommend",5,2013,12,16
143,Christmas Afternoon Tea was perfect!,"The girls and I went for Christmas afternoon tea here this weekend and it was beautiful! The service was impeccable with almost a waiter per table and they continued to offer complimentary sandwiches, scones and cakes to us all. It was just right to enjoy the festive spirit as the hotel is decorated beautifully yet understatedly. A 2 minute walk from Embankment station this was also perfect for my elderly grandmother as she could sample the lights and the Thames whilst walking the short distance to the Corinthia hotel. Having sampled many afternoon teas in and around London, I definitely recommend a visit to this hotel and will be going back myself with other friends and family as soon as possible as this is now high up on my afternoon tea experience list. Truly exquisite!",5,2013,12,16
143,Best luxury hotel in London,"Just completing a week stay at the Corinthia.  Was perfect in every way.  It was an important birthday week for my wife and staying at the Corinthia made it such a special trip.  The staff are warm, friendly and unbelievably reliable.  I travel a lot for business and haven't seen customer care like this in many years.  The hotel itself is subtly elegant.  It is modern, classy decor that feel especially inviting.  Our room was spectacular.  It was on the very large side for London and it felt very new and beautifully decorated.  I hesitated in leaving such a perfect review such that credibility might lack some as a result, but this was honestly a perfect stay at a perfect hotel (and, I would rate myself a very picky traveler).",5,2013,12,15
143,Stunning!,"Great location, just off Whitehall/Trafalgar Square. A hotel with very high standards . Excellent staff. The room was superb, everything.  Had been thought of. Recommend using the valet parking if you are driving.",5,2013,12,14
143,This hotel is just amazing. You HAVE to stay here sometime in your life,"Stayed here at the end of November for a long weekend in a King Suite.  The room was to die for, the service nothing but awesome and the breakfast to die for. The Spa was first class, the rooms wonderful and everything seamlessly elegant. I have stayed at some of the best hotels across the world over the past 30 years and The Corinthia is the best.  Understated luxury, elegance and pure class. For one weekend in your life stay here.  You will not be disappointed I promise you.",5,2013,12,13
143,"Current preferred London hotel, equal to Gleneagles in my UK preferences","Brilliant hotel.  Since my first experience which was an upgraded room on late arrival it is no.1 on my preferred list.

They have looked after my wife and I in the early hours checking out of a disappointing hotel, I got double booked during Wimbledon but they had catered for it generously elsewhere.  As a result I go back whenever I am able - and when there is a room available!

Stayed in one of their largest rooms/suites, it was a surreal experience.

Wife and I recently visited again on a Friday night.  Only downside was a vey busy bar - but what to expect in December.",5,2013,12,12
143,Fantastic is too bland a word,"My wife and I had the privilege of spending a night at the Corinthia earlier in December.  It was officially for a birthday, but we had an evening function in London over the same time, which made the stay convenient.
We arrived very early in the day, as we had pre-organised spa treatments.  From the time you enter the hotel, you feel totally welcome.  Every staff member, it seems, simply has the mandate to make guests feel happy and welcome.  Of course, the fact that the decorations in the lobby take one's breath away also helps.
If you stay at this hotel, do not make the mistake of missing the spa.  It's voted the best in Europe, and it's easy to see why when you step into the calm, tranquil surroundings.  We arrived about 90 minutes early to enjoy the amenities, and we were extremely grateful we did.  The spa (even without treatment) is a real delight.  I had probably the best massage I've ever had.   I felt transported.  Well worth it.  Food options at the spa are healthy and complement the lovely surroundings.
Pre-dinner cocktails in the bar are a must.  Sadly, we never enjoyed an evening meal at the hotel, but we did avail ourselves of coffee in the lounge around midnight upon our return.  Once again - everyone is particularly willing to help.
Breakfast in the morning is an opulent affair.
The rooms themselves are sublime.  Nespresso machines, magnificent Loewe TV's, the marble baths, and a bed that transports are just some of the highlights.
I would make only two suggestions to the management.  Firstly, we ordered cappucinos in the lounge on the day of our checkout.  I thought that a nearby Starbucks would provide me with substantially better coffee - the foam was non-existent and it tasted like it had been made by a machine, without a barista.  Secondly, we found that our room was not equipped with champagne glasses which would have been ideal as we wanted to have a little in-room year-end celebration.
This is not a cheap hotel, by any stretch.  But the surrounding, the area, the service, and the opulence are unmatched.  Treat yourself - you'll be talking about the experience long after you've paid off your credit card.",5,2013,12,10
143,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful afternoon tea and faultless service","My mum, sister and I come to London every year to carry out some Christmas shopping, and have some girly time! at the end of the weekend we always end it with afternoon tea and like to sample somewhere different.  I have to say this is up there with the Savoy.  The room, décor, ambience was just beautiful and the nicest, friendliest and most professional staff we have come across in London.  It was simply faultless, nothing was too much trouble and as we had some left over they boxed it up for us so I could take it home on the train.  It was worth every penny and more and you most definitely should try it.  A perfect end to yet another perfect weekend in London.",5,2013,12,09
143,Fantastic hotel near to so many attractions,"We spent a night at The Corinthia in June, and it was fantastic, but having just arrived home after spending two nights I thought I would update my views.
The hotel is well in the swing for Christmas so although it seemed busier, the time and personal approach was still evident. From the time the doors are opened for you when you arrive to the personal touch of putting your case into a cab for you on your return, the staff are there for you.
We ate out one night and in for the other. We had a fantastic breakfast on one of the two mornings, the other was missed as we went early shopping!! Then we indulged in a cream tea in the Crystal Room lobby, what a beautiful room. The service was brilliant especially a mention for Naratip who ensured that we could be seated even though we had not booked, please book in advance as it is very popular. At 5 - 7pm for the next three weekends, the choir sings carols whilst we were served mince pies, mulled wine and roast chestnuts in the Courtyard.
A truly memorable time was had by us celebrating our Wedding Anniversary. Would we go back, YES. Worth the money, YES. I know it is expensive but you only get what you pay for, go for it. The only downside, we were offered a gift for our Wedding Anniversary, which didnt materialise. On the basis it was offered free by the Management I did not feel I could ask for it.",5,2013,12,08
143,you must stay here,"My wife and I stayed here for a special occasion, and it turned out to be an amazing experience at the Corinthia, the hotel is amazing the staff are wonderfull it really is the place to stay, we stayed for three nights and could not fault anything about this hotel, the staff make this hotel an amazing 5 star experiance",5,2013,12,08
143,A hotel to end all hotels,"What a place. Understated, quality, service, food - everything was just right. If I was to choose a hotel for a specail occasion this is it. The food at breakfast was all fresh, and marked with its origin , there was nothing missing. Staff are friendly and on a wet October day just cashually handing me an umrella to keep my wife dry.",5,2013,12,07
143,Absolutely stunning Hotel!!,"I have stayed in many of the top Hotels in a London and must admit, before my stay I had never heard of the Corinthia. Believe me, in time this Hotel will build a reputation and will be the mark for London 5 star Hotels. Everything about the Hotel shouts out class and you can tell there has been no expense spared in delivering an extremely tasteful decor. The other pleasant surprise about this Hotel is it's location. My wife and I have previously stayed at the Marble Arch end of town so to stay at the Corinthia was to be a change for us. Upon arriving in the Taxi we realised we were bang in the middle of London and a short walk away from all the main London attractions such as Downing St, Big Ben, Whitehall, London Eye & Buckingham Palace etc. I for one will definitely be coming back and if you are looking for a bit of 5 star opulence then I would definitely recommend the Corinthia!!   ",5,2013,12,07
143,Young Irish Couple,"My wife and I stayed here back in January, our two night stay was part of a gift to my wife as she works in the hotel industry and we had to visit London to attend a convention at the Hilton Metropole. 

The Corinthia is stunning, classy, modern and just fabulous. The staff are excellent and well trained, as one would expect but nevertheless impressive. Our room was quite large with separate bathroom and toilet. The jacuzzi bath, with complimentary salts etc, was awesome as was the rain-water shower. 

The spa (Espa) is incredible, if you dont experience it you will be missing out on something special, with a stunning stainless steel pool, just incredible, I literally didnt want to leave..

The location is fantastic, I cant imagine a better located London hotel..

Overall, a fantastic hotel, which although expensive will leave you with no regrets, on a side note it has an interesting history, Google it;)",5,2013,12,06
143,The best hotel I have stayed in!,"I travel extensively and frequent the Capital in particular once a week so I have stayed extensively across hotels in London.

The Corinthia is expensive yes BUT for valid reason!  This really is the height of luxury!  The reception and lounge areas are marble with luxurious surroundings, oppulence and grandeur everywhere!  They even have a Harrods boutique shop in there!

The room we had was a standard and it was huge compared to most hotels i have stayed in.  Luxurious amenities as you would expect with top of the range gadgets from coffee makers to tvs to Ipod systems.  The bathrooms are like your own mini spa in your room...deep deep baths with super high powered showers and a TV in the wall to top it off!

The SPA...quite simply the biggest and most luxurious SPA i have ever seen.  Its quite breathtaking and when we were there suprisingly quiet! It has a swimming pool, massive jacuzzi (the size of a pool), sauna (the size of a small house!) and steam room.  Also has a high quality gym and other beauty rooms and hairdressers.

We ate in two of the restaurants and the food was outstanding...great choices in amazing surroundings!  The bars are luxurious and extensive drinks on offer! 

In summary London has so much to offer but you wont want to leave the Hotel. A very very special Hotel and well worth the money! Gents if you are looking to impress or spoil your other half this hotel will not disapoint!",5,2013,12,05
143,very pleased,had an amazing weekend here recommend too everyone would defiantly come back again. my room was lovely very clean and tidy and the food was very nice. The staff was very friendly and i could completely relax here. great location and excellent views.,4,2013,12,05
143,"Sophisticated, Discreet and Always With a Smile!","We recently spent a week at Corinthia, London and could not have been more pleased. We were greeted by the super efficient and friendly front desk staff on our arrival and were whisked up to our rooms quickly. The rooms themselves were spacious, modern and exceptionally well appointed. Each of our rooms had different views and all were quite lovely. My wife and I had the good fortune to have a room on the corner of the building which looked directly over the Thames onto the London Eye! Quite a beautiful sight.

A quick note about the bathrooms in the Corinthia; These are the nicest hotel bathrooms I have ever seen. Huge, luxuriously appointed and, quite frankly, nicer than the one in my own home.

The hotel staff is extremely efficient. On our first night in the property my wife and daughters were in the hotel lounge having a glass of wine and they were addressed by name by the wait staff. I still don't know how they did this but I had the same experience with the concierge desk. Speaking of the concierge staff, I had a few odd requests for items that I had forgotten to bring from home but no matter how odd the request, the concierge quickly found what I needed and delivered them promptly to me.

The location of the hotel is perfect. Close to Trafalgar Square yet far enough off to prevent unwanted noise from the street.

All things considered, the Corinthia is a hotel without any noticeable flaws. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a first rate London home!!",5,2013,12,04
143,excellent hotel,"We got a great room with a view east along the river.The hotel impressed us in every way , from the moment we walked in to the moment we cecked out.The food, the staff, the decor were all amazing.
All in all a very nice and relaxing hotel in a great location, higly raccomended.",5,2013,12,03
143,Excellent,"We were visiting the hotel for a private function, but what a wonderful experience, the staff were attentive, well trained and friendly yet professional, the atmosphere in the hotel was fantastic and although I believe it was recently renovated they have beautifully combined the historic elements with the up to date expectations of a top London Hotel, we look forward to going back to London and staying there!",5,2013,12,03
143,Great addition to the elite hotels in London,"I stayed here in September for a couple of nights. The hotel is of the highest quality, excellent service and arrival experience. The rooms are spacious and beautifully appointed. The Spa is very stylish by ESPA, very professional service and if you like ESPA's modern version of Spa then you will love this one over 4 levels with direct access to the hotel corridors so you don't have to wonder through the lobby with your robe on. We didn't use the restaurants as the night we decided to go to one of the restaurants they were all unfortunately fully booked. Our fault for not booking in advance as it was a Saturday, although the restaurant manager seemed flustered and didn't deal with us as perhaps in hindsight he would have preferred. In room dining was excellent for dinner and breakfast. If you prefer to use the top hotels in London, the Corinthia should certainly be added to your list.",5,2013,12,02
143,The one and only place to stay in London,"Finding a luxurious hotel to stay in London that ticks all the right boxes with regards to rooms , amenities , locations , luxurious finishing touches , space, fine dining etc is usually an almost 
impossible task . So while I was planning a special treat for my partners 35 th birthday I was getting a bit stressed out ...couldn't find a place that was central without having dowdy tired stuffy over priced crowded small poky rooms ( and no facilities usually ) or hoofing way out of town and compromising severely on location ...and the luxury aspect . 
When I saw corinthia ( on trip advisor ) I had an inkling my prayers had been answered . 
And when we turned up on a Friday evening ...I was not wrong one bit . I was blown away in fact . 
This place has it all . The service was impeccable ( we actually got instantly upgraded - without asking to a junior suite ) ....the suite was to die for ...I have never seen rooms this size in a hotel in any place in the whole of the uk or in Europe  let alone London . We even had our own little balcony overlooking the central courtyard. 
The bathroom had a shower large enough to fit a small  rugby team into . The rain shower had water pressure like a firemans hose . The bed was so large and comfortable that rising in time for breakfast was literally impossible ....so we had to drown our sorrows in the spa which may have been possibly the most beautiful chilled
 out , relaxing rejuvenating inviting space I have seen in a hotel full stop...ever .... 
The extra touches make it ...luxury products in the bathroom . Even the apples in the bowl seemed to have fallen off some tree in paradise...the crunchiest juiciest most succulent apple  I ever tasted ....
Yes ...it is expensive ...but the key here is it is so worth it . No fear of shelling out a lot of cash for an average stay which you are usually in store for  anywhere else in London . 
Making corinthia the only place to stay in my opinion . I have only been home a day and can't wait to go back . 
Book it . You will not regret it . 
And to the people at harrods who own this place .."".please keep it as it is and just about affordable so us "" normal "" folk can keep coming ? "" 

",5,2013,12,01
143,Fabulous.,"We stayed here for 3 nights. What a wonderful hotel -perfect in fact. The staff were so helpful and polite and made us feel really welcome. The reception staff,those in the Northall and in Massimo could not have been better. The hotel itself is stunning - luxurious and modern. The location is perfect for sightseeing,no need to use the tube. We hope to return. ",5,2013,11,29
143,First Class London Luxury,"I am pretty sure this is the best hotel I have stayed in all year.  

Everything from the facility to the people and the service was absolutely first class, throw in a great location and the hotel has it made.

Arrival experience was wonderful.  The lobby is elegant and while not the most welcoming place to kick your feet up the variety of the outlets in the hotel make it a perfect fit.

Love the flower shop in the atrium between the lobby and breakfast room, provides amazing ambiance! 

The room was flawless.  It features a wonderful atrium and wardrobe, a nicely sized and well appointed bedroom and a phenomenal bathroom.

Nice tub with a perfectly placed TV, amazing shower, great light- everything you want or need!

The outlets were wonderful with a great breakfast service and a live music lounge that was a lot of fun.  Never made it for a full dinner but had a great time drinking and snacking before heading out on the town.  

It's a prime spot in London so while it wasn't cheap I think the value was quite decent in regard to drink and menu pricing.

Espa is a true amenity to the hotel! Love the way that each floor has a direct elevator to the spa, a truly nice touch. 

Who wants to take the public elevator in their robe in the lucidly amazing mood that this place puts you in?

London has a lot of great hotels and I certainly don't know them all but these guys did an amazing job and I would recommend the hotel to anyone!

Happy Travels!",5,2013,11,27
143,Perfect,"I stayed there for two nights and found it hard to find a defect. Excellent service, beautiful decoration, delicious and lush breakfast, great location, fantastic bathroom in the room, all the amenities you can think of. The SPA apparently is also top class but I did not have time to go. If I have to find something wrong, I found the room and the window slightly too small although I was very comfortable. ",5,2013,11,27
143,Excellent contemporary 5 star,We had a Saturday night stay as a birthday treat. We got a great room with a view east along the river. The furnishings are luxurious but contemporary. The staff are attentive but don't overwhelm you. We had an excellent dinner in the Massimo restaurant which had a buzzy atmosphere. I'd recommend Corinthia if you are looking for a well located London 5 star that offers something a little more modern than the traditional Park Lane & Mayfair hotels.,5,2013,11,26
143,One of the best hotels in London,I spent 4 nights at Corinthia Hotel i do recommend you to stay bedrooms are large beds are very comfortablé deco is amazing you really at home enjoy the very good breakfast actually this hotel is quite expensive but you won t regret it ...currently the place to be ....near Westminster ....,5,2013,11,22
143,Birthday weekend made special,"We chose this hotel as we were celebrating my wife's birthday and wanted something special. The Corinthia impressed us in every way, from the minute we walked in to the minute we checked out. 
The food, the staff, the decor, the room, the venue were all amazing. I completely agree with the awards the spa has won, as it is the best I've been to. 
The hotel's phrase ""The Art of hospitality"" couldn't be more accurate!

I've never scored anything with full marks, but The Corinthia more than deserves it.",5,2013,11,22
143,Unimpressed,"I arrived at the Corinthia after a short and bumpy flight with no sleep from New York. I was quickly escorted up to my room on the seventh floor. Awakening after a short nab I started wondering how both me and my bag fitted into the room. With barely any space to navigate around the bed and way too many chairs and stuff than the cramped rrom should fit, it almost met the standrards set by the Geneva convention, but certainly not the expectation for a place as pristine as this.
When asking the concierge for a shoeshine service I was then told someone would come up immediately. I guess they operate on a different time concept than most mortals since 6 hours aftre the call, my shoes were still untreated. Certainly not the kind of service you would expect. 
Waiting for a friend in the lobby became an arctic experience as staf would continuously open the atrium door to the outdoor smoking section, to make sure everybody participated in the near freezing london november climate. When going there bring a coat, a smile and a courteous attitude, just what the staff was missing.
With expectations thus forcibly lowered, I found the following night myself waking up at 4am. Turns out the neighboring room had started a late party and the incoming crowds could not use the doorbell because of the glaring loud music playing at this advanced hour. For three hours people kept banging on doors, reducing any chance of peaceful rest to tatters.

All in all: luxury hotel, for sure. But if you seek comfort, decent service and a good night's sleep, do not go here.",3,2013,11,22
143,Corinthia is beyond perfect!!!,"From the check in and out to suit, to the staff who will accommodate every need, to the fabulous rooms, to the breakfast , to The Bassoon Bar, to the impeccable service,to the ESPA spa, The Corinthia has to be experienced to believe how good this hotel is, stayed 3 nights here last weekend and did not want to leave, highly recommended, well done Corinthia, you have absolutely nailed it, cannot wait to return.",5,2013,11,21
143,Beautiful as always,"This is my third stay in the corinthia. I'm staying in a Junior Suite which is wonderful. There is fruit, chocolates and champagne in the room on arrival. The room is immaculate, the staff are really helpful and welcoming. In the room the shampoo etc are ESPA which are so nice I love taking them home. In fact last time I bought the ESPA candle they put in the room.

The doormen are always helpful and it doesn't matter if you are not dressed up they treat you like kings and queens no matter who you are.

Previously we have stayed when man utd players were here and also stayed last November when the hotel got taken over by the X factor finalists so I got to meet Jahmene and James Arthur and all the others which was a nice treat .

I'm planning on visiting the spa and hair salon tomorrow which I know will be fabulous. The spa is on 4 floors!!

Without a shadow if doubt I will return here. If you can't afford to stay here and yes it is very expensive, certainly call in for a drink or afternoon tea just to see the inside of the place it truly is beautiful.",5,2013,11,21
143,EXCELLAND HOTEL,"I would not hesitate to recommend Corinthia to anyone. The whole experience is truly 5 star: the staff, the hotel common areas, the restaurants and bar, the modern and tasteful rooms with their enormous beds and marble bathrooms and their heated floors and spa amenities, the turn down service, and of course the spa. I never wanted to leave. What else could I say that has likely already been said? The location in fantastic for touring the London sites. Don't hesitate to book this hotel, it is worth every penny.",5,2013,11,20
143,Tops!,"Stayed in September. Cannot say enough about this hotel. We stayed in a Superior King with exterior window. Fantastic room. Fantastic service. Fantastic location. Not pretentious at all, but this place is top quality all the way.  I read a few earlier comments about air conditioning, but it was perfect. 

Best part is for touring. The Embankment Tube steps away and the Thames Clipper commuting service dock is right across from the Tube. This really is the way to travel across the river to the Tate Modern and down to Greenwich if you don't mind the cost. of course the walk across is right there, too.",5,2013,11,19
143,London chic..,We stayed at the Corinthia for 3 nights at the beginning of September and it was wonderful. We booked the family room – it was spacious and very comfortable.  The public areas of the hotel were luxurious and absolutely gorgeous.  The buffet breakfast was faultless and high tea more than memorable...a must!  Concierge made our trip to London unforgettable. Every suggestion was spot on and we managed to do and see so much in the short time we had. Thankyou Sal. A stunning hotel - look no further.,5,2013,11,18
143,BEAUTIFUL PLACE - NEEDS SOME MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT,"Fabulous building, lovely decor. Such a shame our experience was damaged by levels of management skills. Having sepcifically requested a King bed, we arrived to a suite with twin beds. We were assured that we would be moved and we left for our evening appointment only to arrive back to the same room and the twin beds pushed together. Other small matters made matters worse.

We booked a Spa treatment only to find that my own appointment was cancelled at the very last moment. The reception desk told me that their staff member was taken ill, my wife having already gone to her appointment was told thet I was taken ill during my treatment!! Clearly we were not being told the truth, not good.

Despite all of this, the hotel is a lovely place and we will give it another try as everything else was good. Mr. Moroni was good enough to be very gracious and made his apologies and we will certanly go back.",4,2013,11,18
143,Fantastic!,"The Corinthia Hotel London is really fantastic.   Every aspect of the hotel is of the highest quality.  Nothing was left unnoticed and the staff were all attentive and professional.  The decor is very unique and stunning.  I booked a standard room, which was large, especially by London standards and was really quiet.  The bed was wonderful-one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever slept in.  The bath was extremely large and luxurious with a tub and separate shower.  The heated floor made the bath super comfortable.  This is not an inexpensive hotel, but well worth the cost, as it did not disappoint.  I have stayed in many different London hotels and I highly recommend the Corinthia.",5,2013,11,17
143,anniversary weekend,"My wife and I very much enjoyed our stay at the Corinthia Hotel.  We had the spa treatments on Saturday which were very nice.  The room was comfortable and the bathroom was sumptuous.  Even the IT specialist, Lionel, was extremely helpful in getting us to stream movies from the IPAD to the television.

As it was our wedding anniversary, we returned to  the room after dinner to find a lovely piece of chocolate cake with a deliciously chocolately ""happy anniversary"" wafer sitting on top.  Very nice touch.

There was an issue with dirty sheets and it was handled quickly and very professionally.  This did not distract from our stay at all.

While the rooms are non-smoking, there is a very comfortable outside seating space for smokers.

Our package included breakfast and I would challenge anyone to find something missing from the hot buffet.

All in all, a very nice and relaxing hotel in a great location.  Highly recommended.",5,2013,11,17
143,Best!,"A very nice hotel. Service is great, staff is polite and very helpful.
Spa is very good,
Room was very nice.
Hard to find anything to criticize.
The only thing I would change is the weather, but it is hard to blame the hotel for that.
The prices are as high as the quality!",5,2013,11,15
143,The best hotel,"We have great night out and we lost our last train so we needed to take hotel and we choosy this great hotel a little expensive but when you want luxe you have to pay for it.
If we lost our train again we return back to this hotel again  ",5,2013,11,14
143,Fantastic Hotel,"This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel and it is simply the best place to stay in London.from the movement you walk through the entrance to the moment you check out you are made to feel so welcome,nothing is to much trouble.I would not hesitate to book again.Thank you to everyone at the Corinthia.",5,2013,11,14
143,Nothing short of THE BEST,"I recently stayed in the Corinthia for 2 nights with my partner. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this hotel. I think it is simply the best hotel in London. The room was amazing, so comfortable, luxurious and clean. The bathroom was to die for and i spent an incredible amount of time in the huge bath, relaxing and watching tele. The breakfast was simply spectacular. A huge amount of variety and the standard of the food, well, the best sausages and apple juice i have ever tasted!!!!

The Spa is simply out of this world. 4 floors, making it the biggest spa in London. The jacuzzi, sauna and steam room are simply in a class of their own, being the largest i have ever come across anywhere in the world!!!!

The staff were in a class of their own, so attentive, and friendly.

The whole experience was simply out of this world and i cannot think of a way this could be improved, i really can't. 

Fantastic. STAY THERE!!!!",5,2013,11,12
143,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for several days with friends from oversees.  The rooms were very big, neat and orderly, and the staff was very helpful. We were able to check in early without any hitches. The staff was very helpful and nice to me, my family and friends. Rooms have great views and the place is very accessible.",5,2013,11,11
143,Our favorite hotel in London!,"This hotel has it all:  great location just off Trafalgar Square, great restaurants, great service and luxurious guest rooms.  The hotel is a short walk to museums, plays, restaurants or the Underground.  Breakfasts in the Northall were excellent, with a large selection at the buffet.  Dinner at Massimo was also very good.  We will stay here when we return to London.",5,2013,11,10
143,Cannot fault in any way,"This hotel is amazing.  The staff are excellent, so well trained and helpful.  The rooms are big by London standards.  The attention to detail is amazing.The ambiance and class of the hotel is obvious.  We found it very central and could walk almost anywhere. Thanks for a fantastic stay once again!",5,2013,11,10
143,Best way to see in the new year!,"My boyfriend and I went to the northall for New Year's Eve last year for dinner. The food was outstanding! We had a perfect view of the London eye for the fireworks at midnight. The room was immaculate, very classy and felt very special. I could not fault the service we received. We will be coming back again and again!",5,2013,11,10
143,"Superb, but expensive","A great hotel in every way. Rooms are beautiful, everything is simply perfect, ranging from the furniture to the beds to the french windows on the courtyard. Great breakfast, super service and a superb gym. Apparently the biggest spa in the UK. But it comes at a price (over 400 pounds for one night, special conference rate...). Excellent location opposite Embankment tube station.",5,2013,11,09
143,A great stay,"Everything the other reviews have said is spot on and more.  Excellent location; extremely attentive service without being too intrusive; best spot for afternoon tea, although a bit pricy but worth the elegance and ambience.  Requested a quiet room, and quiet it was.  We travel extensively and among the best stays we've had for a long time.  Highly recommend a stay here and will return.",5,2013,11,09
143,Corinthia Hotel London,We stayed for my wife's 40th Birthday on the weekend 2nd November . I would say we have stayed in many so called 5 star hotels. But this hotel is the real deal . The hotel  and its facilities are outstanding . The room was of the very highest standard. The best thing about the hotel was it's staff who made my wife and I feel very comfortable and relaxed . you pay for perfection and you get it at this hotel. We never had breakfast but had lunch twice in the Northall Restaurant which was lovely .,5,2013,11,08
143,GREAT!,"The best hotel service I ever had! 
Excellent location! The room is amazing, witch includes a LCD TV at the bath tube, A sound system on the room and a nice closet. Quite big for hotels in London.
Also it is walking distance from nice pubs, night clubs, subway station, and the London's Eye.",5,2013,11,08
143,Immaculate ,"I have stayed at different 5* hotels perhaps every fortnight for the last few years and Corinthia London is my favorite. I can't honestly think of anything to complain about and I am well known for a moan.
The spa is out of this world.",5,2013,11,08
143,Did not meet expectations,"This review reflects expectations based on the high cost of staying here; at half the price it would get more stars. Also we booked at a discount through Luxury Link that may have effected our treatment a bit. Our initial welcome was enthusiastic and pleasant, but then we were asked if we wanted an even better room at an additional 100 UK pounds per night. In retrospect this was super tacky as we were already paying >$500 per night for an executive room! Since our room was not ready yet, we were offered tea, coffee or a glass of champagne in the Northhall.  Because we were having afternoon tea that day, we opted for the champagne.  The “wait” was barely 10 minutes so this was a nice touch.

Other rooms received morning papers, yet we were never asked about a newspaper when we checked in. We were in room a room 35 and I assume my comments on this room reflect the other 35 series rooms. There were some odd decisions made when designing the room. The entry hall and walk-in closet were huge which made the actual bedroom space small for such a large room (400 Sq ft). The room felt smaller than suites that are sold as 350 sq ft. The closet would be a great place for a crib though. As in other London hotels the hair dryer does not plug into an outlet in the bathroom. You could dry your hair in the closet if you moved your clothes on hangers to the side so they did not block mirror, or you could crouch or sit in a chair with some difficulty in the bedroom. The TV was flat against the wall across from the bed but it did not swivel so you could not aim towards the sitting area. There was a Nespresso coffee machine and tea bags but NO tea kettle. So you could not boil water to make real tea; unheard of in a London hotel. However, when I requested a tea kettle they promptly brought one. The safe was shallow and located in a drawer in the closet. It was big enough for a laptop but it was too small to hold a camera (even a small one after I put the computer in). On the bright side the bathroom was large and the shower was great and there was no shortage of soap. It is pretty common to not get a bar of soap for the shower at many hotels these days, but I took the one from the bathtub for the shower.

We were promised that our wedding anniversary would be remembered. We got Happy Anniversary written on a plate at afternoon tea. That was sad given the elegance of the hotel. Turn down service was good and you received nice chocolates. The staff was friendly, but at these prices I expected more.",4,2013,11,08
143,Chic and elegant business hotel,"I can't speak highly enough about the Corinthia.  It is truly an outstanding luxury property that is also streamlined for business travel.  High points include a walk-in closet (in the basic room) that exceeded the size of my first NYC apartment, 2 fun and trendy bars offering different vibes (one airy and leaning towards a feminine asthetic, the other with more of a dark hunting lodge feel) and the best hotel gym I've ever seen.  Oh, and the spa was over the top.  Check this place out, you'll be glad you did, even if just for drinks!",5,2013,11,07
143,Absolutely breathtaking,"I have stayed in a number of 5-star hotels over the years but I would say the Corinthia is the most breathtakingly beautiful.  

We stayed in October as our friends were getting married in the ballroom and the Corinthia organised for us to check-in early with the minimum of fuss. The room was smaller than other rooms in hotels in a similar price bracket but excellently appointed - bath AND shower in the bathroom (bath with in-built TV), good mini-bar, sweet little juliet balcony, large bed & separate seating area.  Very luxurious/sexy overall feel and all extra-touches thought of (little box of chocolates, decent toiletries, huge umbrellas in the wardrobes AND a proper hair dryer).

The only downside (and it's a small one) is that the staff were nowhere near as friendly/accommodating as in other 5 star hotels. I would say ""business-like"" as opposed to unfriendly but different to say One Aldwych or The Waldorf where staff look delighted to see you!

Overall, I would highly recommend. The whole place is stunning but maybe the receptionists need to practice smiling!!! 
",5,2013,11,04
143,Simply the best 5* hotel in london,"The hotel offers Good location, very comfortable rooms, excellent food, very good gym and fantastic spa.
after trying some of the best hotels in town, i now know the corinthia is by far my favourite 5* hotel in london, there's absolutely nothing to complain about., i go there once a month.",5,2013,11,03
143,Superb Afternoon Tea experience,"My husband and I booked Tea at The Corinthia for the first (midday) slot on a Saturday to celebrate my 50th birthday, and we weren't disappointed.  We were treated with great attention and courtesy.  The surroundings were beautiful (the gorgeous chandalier and a large round central table bedecked with stunning flowers in an unusual mophead display) and extremely comfortable, and the cakes, sandwiches and scones and accompaniments were to die for!  As a non tea-drinker, I opted for hot chocolate, and have truly never had such wonderful hot chocolate before, with a range of dark, milk or white chocolate shavings to sprinkle on top, plus marshmallows - what self-indulgence!  As the treat for my special celebration, this experience couldn't have been exceeded, and I would recommend this venue to everyone.",5,2013,11,03
143,Lobby lounge - perfect place for afternoon tea,Great place to try out the British afternoon tea tradition.  The Lobby Lounge is a magnificent setting that will make your experience special. The hotel is very centrally located - near Trafalgar Square and the Embankment tube station. Service gets thumbnail up from me as well.,4,2013,11,02
143,Maybe the best in London?!,"Was lucky enough to get a half price deal from lastminute.com's secret hotels. Cant praise this hotel enough! Everything from the room, to the staff, to the location - all amazing. They even kept the bassoon bar open late for us to have one more drink. Cant wait to stay here again.",5,2013,11,01
143,Excellent attention to detail,"Perfect location on the Embankment so you can access West End and shopping easily - be it by cab, tube (it's around the corner from Embankment tube station) or even on foot (eg about 15min walk to Covent Garden). Great architecture and if you like spas, this is a top notch ESPA location I did not have time to immerse myself in the spa, but from what I saw, it looked amazing and huge - you would never guess entering the hotel that it houses 4 floors of spa complex!
Superb design in the rooms, from cleverly integrated electronics (of course you want to relax in the bathtub and watch TV:) and huge comfortable beds, to clever elements designed to make the rooms quieter (sliding doors between rooms, noise dampening panels integrated into walls), walk-in closet (I was upgraded to a Deluxe so maybe not to be found in a std rm) and as a coffee lover the finishing touch for me was the Nespresso machine.
Service was attentive and friendly (just the right balance) and restaurants very good: I tried their Italian restaurant Massimo and found it all round good (my octopus starter was prepared to perfection) and very good wine list. Again, superb design and layout of the restaurant contributed significantly to the ambiance and experience. 
My room service experience was a little disappointing (steak sandwich) as it was literally steak on a bun. It could have been so much more. Other than that, great. Certainly, I will be back.",5,2013,11,01
143,Great stay in London,"What a great hotel.  Service was excellent.  The staff was willing to meet your every need. Room service was terrific and you should not miss the opportunity for afternoon tea in the hotel lobby.  The concierge was able to get us tickets for ""The book of Mormon"". And then sped us over t the theatre in the hotel Jag when an a-hole took our taxi.",5,2013,10,31
143,A Perfect Stay,"A truly fantastic hotel. It is conveniently located close to several tube stops as well as many walking-distance attractions.The rooms are beautiful and the electronics and facilities completely modern, including a state-of-the-art fitness room. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful and the chocolates delivered at turndown are divine. I would return in a heartbeat if fortune brought me back to London.
      ",5,2013,10,30
143,"Wonderful, classy experience","Stayed here for 1 night on October 25th.
I had booked this hotel using British Airways miles which came with full breakfast.  
The hotel is just down the road from Downing St and right across the street from the Royal Horseguards Hotel, short walk to Piccadilly, Houses of Parliament etc  Safe and lovely area.
From the minute our cab pulled up outside, I knew I'd picked a winner.  This place exudes class and sophistication.  I've stayed in Mandarin Oriental properties and the service here rivals that. Understated, friendly, just wonderful.
Check-in was easy, offered an upgrade which I took for 70GBP.  We were escorted to our room and shown around, luggage arrived a short time later.  Small box of 4 handmade chocolates awaited us.
The bathroom, for me, was the highlight; double vanity, HUGE soaking tub with complimentary bath salts and a separate shower cabinet with the biggest drenching shower head I've experienced.  I'm a bath guy and it was outstanding, but this shower was something else.
Had to call and ask for an iron and ironing board but they arrived quickly and were of a good quality.
Cocktails in the Northall bar were handcrafted and truly yummy (lady had the chili and chocolate martini and I had the Brockman's lemon drop).  We also had one in Bassoon after dinner (lady had the bubblegum and I had the signature Bocal...both were fantastic).
For my taste, the bed was a bit hard so I didn't have a great sleep but my lady friend said it was perfect.  Each to their own.
Nespresso machine and pods were also a wonderful touch in the room.
'Full breakfast' was on my rate and when we presented at the restaurant desk, our room was on a list they had so were escorted to the actual restaurant area.  Presumably if you choose to pay for breakfast there, you would have been seated in the Northall bar area which also had breakfast service set up.
It wasn't fully explained and I didn't ask, but I have to assume my rate would have included the buffet at 33GBP (I think) or any item from the a la carte.  We both choose salmon with scrambled eggs on brioche with fresh juice and coffee which was enough and very well done.  I had another juice and we shared another pot of coffee, no additional charge appeared on my folio at check-out.
Buffet looked fresh and had all manner of options as I'm sure you can imagine, with made to order items like eggs etc.
We even had a man who appeared to be the hotel manager, come round us and a few other tables to ask if our stay was going well and f there was anything he could do.  Nice touch.
For such a short stay, I really loved the hotel.  It is truly opulent and what really stood out were the staff.  Everyone from bellman to restaurant and bar staff were always smiling, helpful and seemed truly delighted to be working there; a deeply refreshing change to many hotels I have stayed in.",5,2013,10,29
143,Can I Live Here?!,"This was our second stay at The Corinthian and I bloody loved it all over again. We were in a standard room, last time was a deluxe, which was just as lovely. The bed and bedding are sublime, the bathroom is gorgeous, the Espa toiletries are luscious and we had a great view of the Playhouse Theatre. The turn down service leave a lovely boxed chocolate on your pillow along with water and slippers. Ooh and a current issue of Vanity Fair in the room is a nice touch, good for reading in the massive bath!

Location of the hotel is brilliant, within walking distance of lots of top tourist attractions, a hop skip and jump from Trafalgar Square and just across the road from Embankment Station. Mind you who wants to leave the hotel, sitting in the Lobby Lounge people watching and drinking champagne is good fun. 

Last time we stayed we had dinner in The Northall which was lovely, this Saturday night we had a late night dinner with friends in the Massimo Oyster Bar which is very dark and decadent, we all really liked the food. Breakfast the next morning was great as well. 

All in all, we've had two lovely experiences at this elegant hotel with its very attentive staff and I can't wait to go back.",5,2013,10,29
143,Pure Luxury,"Have stayed at the Corinthia twice and have been meaning to write a review.  I am not sure they need it as this hotel has what I can only describe as perfect service!  Also, the other element that I love is that it does not have a ""stuffy"" fell but rather an ""understated elegance"".  I highly recommend this hotel!",5,2013,10,28
143,Expensive but worth it!,"We have just returned from a 4 night stay with the kids at the Corinthia. The hotel had been recommended to us by family and we were very impressed. We all received a very warm welcome on arrival the children were given welcome packs and had toys waiting for them in their room. Their relaxed check-in and check-out facility meant when we arrived at 12pm our rooms were ready which was great. The rooms and bathrooms were to a very high standard. The whole hotel oozes luxury especially the spa! Breakfast was fantastic regarding the food quality and choice on a couple of mornings the service was a bit slow and we had to ask for toast and menu's a few times before actually getting them. The cocktail bar in my opinion is the best hotel cocktail bar I have been in. We also ate in the Northall restaurant on the last night, it was unfortunately very quiet so lacked atmosphere but the service and food were amazing. Will look forward to returning soon!",5,2013,10,28
143,Everything goes smooth..,"I am here for my meetings. But for city, I am not known. I talk to receptions, they give me some maps to let me know the inner parts of London.  I booked this as a place to stay for my business work and I for that day i have no meetings, and although i had a few staff to do in city. I travel with hotel discounted coupons. Thanks to reception who help.",4,2013,10,27
143,"Excellent Staff, Facilities  ",This is our third stay at the Corinthia and we keep returning because the staff are excellent - attentive but discreet.  The location is convenient and accessible but at the same time quiet and calm since it's located on a quiet street in Whitehall. The decor throughout the public areas is stunning and not trendy. The only complaint I have is that the rooms are a bit small. ,5,2013,10,27
143,Best hotel stay,"Out of all the business trips I take each year, my stay at the Corinthia in London is the best. Even my clients who are London regulars were blown away. The room and bathroom were spacious and high quality.  Great breakfast too.  The location is in the heart of the city, walking distance to Covent Gardens, Chinatown and the London Eye. The price was very suitable. Don't think I could have asked for anything else. ",5,2013,10,26
143,Our new favourite hotel in London,"There are many older hotels that are filled with history however of late they all seem to use that as an excuse for when they drop the ball on maintenance.

The Corinthia is not this at all, we spent a weekend first in The Savoy and the moved over to this hotel and were amazed at the high levels of service, all round cleanliness and facilities.

Most notably The Corinthia seems to have achieved that perfect balance between implementing the latest technology whilst not destroying the splendor and tradition of the old building and it's old fashion aesthetics. 

Having a spa that is 4 levels deep with seperate floors for females and males allows for maximum privacy when you are relaxing, the gym was small but world class - With a mountain bike simulator, I have not seen another one of these in any other hotel ever!

This is a long overdue review as we have stayed here 4 times already but I just had to share my experience so that others will know that The Savoy is not the only option in London if you fancy a change without sacrificing your luxuries.",5,2013,10,26
143,Wow!,"We stayed for 4 nights with 2 of our children. We haven't stayed here before but would with out doubt stay again. Ate in both restaurants. Food good but not fantastic. Service variable. 
Spa was breathtaking. Pool v small but sauna and steam room fantastic and the whole ambiance exceptional. The only criticism is the lack of British staff. Only once or twice did we deal with a person who spoke English as a first language. That was a real shame . Overall a new brash stylish and definatly  a  5 star hotel.  ",5,2013,10,25
143,Wonderful afternoon,"Enjoyed a long lunch in the north hall. Wonderful attentive staff with a smile and can do attitude.nothing was too much bother including one of our guests leaving half way through the meal for a meeting and returning with an unscheduled film crew .This was taken in their stride and we were accommodated beautifully.I very much appreciate the cake that was also presented as a congratulatory surprise. A faultless lunch which almost became dinner! thank you Corinthia hotel .amazing food,staff and decor.",5,2013,10,25
143,They go for that extra miles!,"My family spent 6 nights in Corinthia and found that they have what it takes to be a first class hotel. It offers memorable experiences to its guest both in terms of its hard and software. The hotel has no official check-in and check-out time which made it flexible for us to plan our trip. We arrived around 10:00 am and was ushered to our room shortly. Likewise we left the hotel at 5:00 pm on our last day with no hassle. Our room was clean, spacious and homely with all sorts of modern amenities. We just loved the heated flooring in our bathroom during this chilly month. The choice of food from the Northhall Resturant offering both breakfast and dinner was equally superb. But what make us really impressed is the quality services of this particular hotel. Staffs from the reception, concierge, housekeeping and even the flora shop offered uncompromised services and advices to us. They are more than just helpful. They gave their utmost attention to our queries and tried to satisfy our requests during our stay. This kind of service is certainly beyond our expectation and definitely makes it stand out from other 5-stars hotels. The only regret we had is the time restriction they had for my kid to enjoy the indoor swimming pool. Nevertheless, this is a lovely hotel highly recommended for anyone who want to stay in London with expectation and style.",5,2013,10,24
143,Excellent experience,"We spend there three nights and were absolutely satisfied by everything - unobtrusive and highly efficient service, utmost helpful concierge assistance, large and ambient rooms, great location and excellent sleeping quality. Breakfast was really exceptional with great variety of fresh and tasty suggestions and impeccable service. Perfect housekeeping with special care for the kids.",5,2013,10,23
143,Superb!!!!,"We loved the Corinthia. Room was beautifully decorated and spacious, it included  all the amenities you expect from this kind of hotels.  Afternoon tea in the lobby was great and the breakfast in the restaurant was excellent. The location is great, nearby the subway, Trafalgar Square. ",5,2013,10,23
143,"Awesome Appointments, Ambiance and Servics","This was my first here ...I will be back.  The rooms bigger than most rooms in London and equipment everything you need.  The Bassoon Bar is smoking ...great atmosphere and quality entertainment.  

Location, location, location!  It located just south of Trafalgar Square and close to the Strand.  You can get any where you want to from the 1/2 block walk to the Embankment station that serves the Central and District Lines, which serves the business district and west side of London.
",5,2013,10,22
143,Wonderful,"We recently spent 5 nights at Corinthia after landing an extraordinary offer through hotels.com.  Check in was seamless even though we arrived at 8am. Our room was ready and there was a congratulatory cake waiting.  We had a junior deluxe suite that had 2 balconies over the courtyard, a large walk-in closet and a very impressive bathroom.  The hotel delivered a bottle of fine champagne to the room to help us celebrate and included a rose petal turn down service as well.  The public areas are quite impressive and the basoon bar had entertainers and lovely cocktails. Service is subtle yet precise.  The concierge helped up get great seats to see a show at the Globe Theatre on short notice as well.  Finally the thermal floor of the spa is not to be missed, there can not be many facilities like that in the city.  Overall I was terribly impressed with the property and look forward to staying with the Corinthia brand in the future.",5,2013,10,21
143,Very Lovely,"Stayed here this weekend as a little break.  The hotel is the old Ministry of Defence building and War Office on Whitehall but no sign of it now obviously!!

Arrival in the car was as easy as it could be in London traffic and the doorman quickly took the car to be parked whilst another showed us to the reception desk.  This was all straight forward and a lovely receptionist took us up to our 5th floor room and once in showed us around it

The rooms are great - spacious with good sized bathrooms with separated wc and shower as well as double sinks and massive deep bath with a TV in front of it so you don't get bored!

Bed was massive and comfortable and the mini bar good.  A nespresso machine is always a nice touch with a good selection of teas and coffees.

A couple of wardrobes with the usual safe etc.  I do wish that these hotels would automatically put an iron and board in - I always find it really frustrating that you have to ask and then wait for it - or, have housekeeping iron for you which I am sure is a good money making service but not terribly convenient. 

The room had a small balcony and it made a nice change to be able to keep the balcony doors open to let some air in - it was quite a warm night.

Breakfast is until a very civilised 11am on the weekend and offers a hot and cold buffet as well as Al A Carte and even some Dim Sum!.  Everything was delicious, from the Bacon Sandwich to the Smoked Salmon and Scrambled Eggs with Brioche.  Tea, coffee and juice readily replaced if you want it and service was efficient and friendly.

Thoroughly enjoyable weekend and would happily stay here anytime!",5,2013,10,21
143,A truly outstanding and very different hotel,"London's 5 star hotels are somewhat all the same in terms of great service, attention to detail, small rooms and high prices. The mould has been truly broken here, 

When Corinthia re-opened, they drastically reduced the number of rooms. The result is very large rooms with great ceiling height and lots of light, around 25% bigger than London average, which seems to be their big selling point. What really impressed me though was the very high end finish, beautiful wood panelling and great bathrooms. To me they are more like luxury appartments and I can't wait to go back. Stunning views, lovely flowers, great communal areas and the spa is off the charts. 

Highly recommended",5,2013,10,21
143,Nothing like a flower shop on the way to breakfast,"The beautiful flower shop is on the path to the restaurant and my sister-in- law was thrilled when she was handed a complimentary bouquet. One of Londons' most famous designers did the public spaces and it shows. The bar is a wonder and the business center is sleek and efficient. Although one does not associate Whitehall with hotels, this repurposed building is a perfect base for a tourist, with a tube stop out the back door on the Thames and all of Westminister so close a hand. The bedrooms are bright and tastefully decorated.  The gym and the spa are also lovely. ",5,2013,10,20
143,Felt like a princess,"Took my mum here for a treat weekend in March - and what a treat it was. 

We both felt like royalty not only because the surroundings are so plush but the staff make you feel like you're the only guest there and you're the most important. 

Amazing service, good quality, beautiful surroundings. ",5,2013,10,20
143,Amazing,"Wow - beautiful building, discreet and tasteful. Food quality and quantity was amazing. Our girls (aged 10 & 9) were made most welcome. I recommend the free flowing champagne lunch deal. A real must if you want a treat! ",5,2013,10,20
143,Best hotel in town,Excellent hotel with beautiful rooms. Close to embankment. Few negatives. It is expensive. And when i came in sunday they did not mention that cabs would have a problem to get to the hotel due to cycling event. ,5,2013,10,20
143,“Expectations Met”,"From the moment we arrived we were greeted like we were returning to our home. The staff of this property are both extremely friendly, yet professional. Our junior suite was spacious by London standards and was a nice mix of modern with traditional amenities. The hotel's bar was cozy and fun. We looked forward to returning for drinks at the end of each day. Breakfast and afternoon tea were outstanding. Tourist sights were easy to get to by either the Tube or the hop on/off bus tour, . The Corinthia Hotel was the perfect choice for our time in London and we will be back!",5,2013,10,19
143,Wonderful Experience for the Family,"We stayed in 2 interconnecting rooms - one for the 3 kids (aged 12, 12, and 15) and one for me and my husband.  The rooms were spacious, immaculate and tastefully decorated.  Service was excellent with fresh fruit delivered every day in addition to the bottled water and chocolates at turndown.  Breakfast was included in our family package and our only complaint was that, unlike at other fine hotels, the buffet items here never varied.  We stayed for 10 nights and the breakfast buffet was the same every morning!   Staff was very friendly throughout the hotel.  The lobby, although busy, always had an air of calm and understated elegance -- one never saw any luggage!  Unfortunately we were not able to enjoy the gorgeous swimming pool since the ""family"" hours did not fit into our schedule.  The location was ideal.  Walking distance to many attractions and transportation.  We would stay here again.",5,2013,10,16
143,Best hotel in London,"We have tried a few hotels in London in the past - but this hotel simply has to be The Best. Everything was perfect: Location, Service, Rooms, Spa - I mean The Spa...I never felt so relaxed in a London Hotel. The feeling of splendour and luxury. Wonderful breakfast and bar food alike. I cannot find anything wrong with this hotel and will not go anywhere else in future. Love it!",5,2013,10,11
143,Afternoon tea,"Went here for afternoon tea and had the most amazing time. The location, room, service and food was perfect! The display of the cakes was beautifully presented and our waitress was very helpful in explaining all the treats and even offering to take our photo for us. A wonderful afternoon, we will come again. ",5,2013,10,11
143,Amazing service & bedrooms,"This hotel is exceptional.  The personal service and genuine interest the staff have in ensuring their guests are looked after is amazing. This extends from reception / check in staff, door man, restaurant staff and housekeeping.  The bedrooms are beautiful, and the bathroom is pure luxury with a seperate toilet, shower and bath that has a TV built in. It's the small touches like having your glass and water by your bed with chocolate ready when you get back to your room, with towels / facecloths re folded etc.  We ate in Massimos the food was excellent and not too expensive considering the hotel is a 5 star.  Overall this is definitely the best hotel I have stayed in in London and I can't wait to visit again.",5,2013,10,10
143,Will Return..,My now Fiancé and I stayed at the Corinthia for two nights in an Executive King Suite to celebrate our engagement. We stay in hotels on a regular basis all around Europe and I can honestly say that the weekend break we had at the Corinthia is easily on a par with or better than all others we have stayed in. Sometimes when you stay in these types of hotels and pay reluctantly but I happy to settle the bill and considered it money well spent.. We left rested and happy :-),5,2013,10,10
143,Excellent on every level!,"We recently stayed five days at the Corinthia in London for our honeymoon and we were treated like gold. The staff was warm, welcoming, attentive and professional. This is a hotel I would be thrilled to return to. The room was beautiful and the restaurants, lobby and bar were stylish and relaxing. I loved the chocolates on the pillows and the nice card and bottle of wine they had waiting for us when we arrived. The little touches make this hotel shine. Also, they were able to fulfill our request for almond milk for our morning coffee to our surprise. Last but not least, the location is unsurpassed. Did I mention those chocolates? They were very very good. We'll be back.",5,2013,10,10
143,Special Birthday Celebrated in Style !,"We chose to stay at The Corinthia while in London to celebrate my husband's 60th birthday in October 2013. From the moment we alighted from the taxi at the hotel's main entrance , we were made to feel special. After being  greeted warmly and shown around the hotel ,we were escorted  to an upgraded room for our 2 night stay. We feel  that  the hotel is very worthy of its 5star status - spacious and stylish , friendly and attentive staff , excellent range and quality of amenities ,perfect location for walking to places of interest . Dinner, with friends, on the Saturday evening in the Northall restaurant was a most enjoyable and relaxing experience .The waiter and sommelier offered good support when  we  were making our menu choices. Drinking champagne while listening to live music in the Bassoon Bar ended the birthday evening beautifully. We will certainly stay at The Corinthia again in the future.",5,2013,10,09
143,A/C does not work in the room.,Arrived to the hotel yesterday and have noticed that in-room temperature can not be raised more than 21 C and the ventilation itself is noisy. Called reception and they have promised to send someone to fix it. No one came on the next day and currently the A/C system stopped working completely.,1,2013,10,09
143,Lovely stay!,"We had an absolutely fantastic stay at this wonderful Hotel. Friendly serviceminded staff and extremely comfortable rooms great location. The spa is the largest in London and an extraordinary experience just wonderful. We just did not want to leave, will be back shortly.",5,2013,10,09
143,Six stars,"We stayed at The Corinthia for five nights in October, 2013.  The hotel lobby, restaurants and rooms were absolutely beautiful. The entire staff made us feel welcome and had an attitude of service.  The golden key concierge staff listened to our needs and made appropriate recommendations for restaurants, bars and shopping.   The hotel location was excellent within the city and also across the street from the tube.  
We loved every minute of our stay and will return.",5,2013,10,08
143,Truly worthy of its 5 star rating,"I booked a weekend break at The Corinthia for a girlfriend and I to have a relaxing, spa-filled and luxurious weekend. I work in London so a stay-cation has got to be luxurious and pampering! I wasn’t disappointed! 

The hotel is beautifully appointed, all public areas are filled with fresh flowers and the hotel rooms themselves are vast and full of the latest accoutrements! Underfloor heating in the bathroom, varied lighting and mood lighting options, little switches for not being disturbed or alerting them to service the room, touchscreen telephones and options to blue tooth your Mp3s and Iphones through the in room TV.

Our room was large- with a hallway, walk in closet, enormous bathroom with tub and cavernous walk in shower as well as a large bedroom and even a balcony. Our room faced the inner courtyard and for someone who craves peace and quiet, was beautifully quiet all weekend. The bathroom came replete with a vast number of top quality and deliciously fragrant Espa toiletries and all manner of other useful bathroom items like loofahs and nail files. Bedding was the highest quality linens and the pillows the softest feathers. I literally could live there and never want to get out of the bed!

Room service on the Friday afternoon was speedy- and as other reviewers have noted the tomato soup is excellent. 

Turndown in the evening meant we were welcomed back into our room with mood lighting on, little linen mats by the bed with soft slippers, bottled water and glasses by the bed and sea salt caramel chocolates by William Curley in beautiful bespoke black boxes on our turned down feather quilts. Yes I know we are paying for these wonderful little touches but my goodness The Corinthia does 5 star luxury in style. 

My welcome at reception was friendly and professional- something that was repeated with every staff member we came into contact with…from bar staff in The Bassoon Bar (see my separate review), breakfast wait staff in the Northall, to the concierge who came up to re-set our safe when my friend forgot the code she had entered! Their customer service is really first class- bellmen, room service waiters, to the spa tem on reception in the Espa Spa. Everyone of them was polite and friendly and as you walked past staff in the restaurants they would always greet you and say good morning. Mightily impressive. 

Location wise it is perhaps 2 minutes walk to Embankment tube, two minutes to Charing Cross tube and in a delightful location by the Thames.  Perfect for theatre breaks or just to enjoy that beautiful part of London down by Whitehall and St James’ Park within a few minutes walk.

The Espa Spa covers 4 floors and was perhaps the only slight disappointment and I am being picky when I saw slight. I went on my own on the Friday and had a lovely time in the lap pool, hydrotherapy pool and sauna. Changing facilities are top notch with pristine white robes, towels and slippers available. However, when we returned on the Saturday afternoon- it was much busier and to be honest that part of the spa isn’t that spacious so with a larger number of guests it definitely felt a bit cramped. To make matters worse there were a handful of guests who had clearly never been in a spa and talked at the top of their voices and made the atmosphere less than relaxing for others. Funnily enough I thought the limited hours when children could use the pool would make it noisy but the little chap who was there with his parents on Saturday was as quiet as a mouse bobbing around in the pool happily whilst two women threw ladlefuls of ice at each other near the sauna. I don’t think the hotel can be held accountable for the behaviour of their guests in this respect so I wouldn’t take any marks away from The Corinthia but perhaps a staff member could be assigned to the floor to ensure a spa like atmosphere is kept for all the guests. The sleep pods on a higher level of the spa were exquisite little cocoons with blankets and open foors that soon had me nodding off. My friend had a massage and said it was sublime.

Breakfast- if not included in your room tariff is the usual 5 star hotel prices. However we opted for a la carte options and were impressed. The hot chocolate came in a small silver pot and accompanied by a plate with three china pots containing marshmallows, whipped cream and a large heap of perfectly curled chocolate shavings, to allow my drink to be made to my taste. Toast was hot when it arrived and not overly hard, with Cornish salted and unsalted butter and a huge array of preserves to sample from lemon curd to acacia honey.

Would I return? In a heartbeat. I believe The Corinthia has achieved 5 star perfection in this hotel. It’s my new favourite and I cannot wait for an excuse to go back",5,2013,10,07
143,Afternoon Tea - Divine Cakes but chairs give you Backache!,Had afternoon tea here with a friend yesterday. We were shown to a tiny round table near the cake display - no view of anything really. The chairs were big leather affairs which couldn't be moved near the table. The table had a sort of skirt so and a lower shelf so it was impossible to put ones legs anywhere! - we're both quite small so it would b especially awkward for someone tall. It was impossible to get comfortable - sitting back meant you were too far from the table. We both remarked that the set-up gave us backache. However the food was excellent and more was offered. The service was impeccable and the cakes were divine!! - so intricate and delicate. It was a nice tea but I felt the furnishing and décor let the place down - the lobby lounge as its called its quite colourless and cold especially as it started to go dark - I wouldn't fancy it on a cold winter day - not my idea of a cosy  afternoon tea in plushy surroundings!,4,2013,10,06
143,"Luxury, great location and 5-star service","I stayed at the Corinthia for 5 nights with my wife and my daughter.  We enjoyed every moment while staying at Corinthia.  The design of the hotel is modern and classy , all the restaurants are also well designed.    It has got all you need ie. 24 hours gym, ESPA etc.    We also stayed at the Bulgari hotel and Mandarin Oriental knightsbridge during this trip, but can say Corinthia is far better....the best!",5,2013,10,06
143,Should have been delighted but ultimately left mentally drained,"Stayed at the Corinthia for a 3 night break in London over the children’s summer holidays
Firstly let me say the accommodation, Spa facilities and location of the Hotel are second to none in London, where we have stayed as a family of 4 many times.  The room presentation (fresh flowers/fruit and the gifts/toiletries specifically for the age of each child were a really nice touch.

Staff service worthy of note was the Housekeeping service three times per day including an excellent turndown service, the leisure club staff pleasant and very knowledgeable and the waiting staff efficient and very accommodating.  Not so good service from the sommelier, replacing  bottles of water when empty without being requested and forgetting to serve soft drinks which were ordered until prompted then plonking them down without a word (seemed to be too much trouble in a fairly quiet restaurant). 

Now to the main point of this review.  I am very much a believer in the principal that ‘you get what you pay for’ but also you should ‘only pay for what you get’ unfortunately at nearly every opportunity during our stay the Corinthia’s charging policy seemed to disagree with this.

Firstly we stayed 3 nights for the price of 2, however when I checked the website pricing the proposed 3 for 2 offer worked out more expensive than booking the 3 nights individually. After some negotiation with the bookings department they did agree to charge at the true rate for a 2 night stay.  Maybe just an unfortunate mistake until we dined in the Northall restaurant  on the Wednesday evening. The website offered ‘kids eat free’ but yet  once again we had to point out their own offer to get the children’s meals removed from the bill.

Finally on check out from what was an excellent break there was an item included on the bill which we had not consumed from the mini bar.  Another negotiation ensued with the receptionist resulting in her agreeing to remove the item from the bill.  Once back home in Cheshire a quick check of my credit card bill revealed that the item had been charged.  On the first phone call to the Corinthia I was assured the charge would be credited immediately, however no action was taken as a week later I had to phone again to insist the refund was processed.

In summary this is a sumptuous hotel in a great location with the potential to leave its guests feeling relaxed and delighted with their luxury experience but the Corinthias sharp practice in its charging policy left us feeling ultimately drained.",2,2013,10,06
143,Indulgent luxury with 5-star service in an excellent location.  The highlight of our London stay.  Simply superb!,"My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights whilst attending a conference in London.  We were travelling with friends who are well-seasoned 5 star travellers and they chose to stay here rather than their favourite regular London hotel, The May Fair.  We absolutely loved our stay at the Corinthia, and our travelling companions have named this as their new favourite!

LOCATION
The location is perfect for sightseeing being situated on the corner of Whitehall Place and Northumberland Ave only 200 metres from Trafalgar Square.   Embankment station and pier were situated across the road, National Gallery a 2 minute walk away, the London Eye a 5 minute walk across the river, and Piccadilly Circus, Soho, Downing Street, The Changing of the Guard, Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament with Big Ben were all less than a 10 minute walk away.  Whilst the London Tube easily gets you to all the shopping districts, we often chose to walk the pleasant 20-30 minute walk through parks to get to the shopping areas of Regent, Oxford, Bond & Carnaby Sts.  Then 3 minutes on the Tube later, and we could shop at Covent Garden.  If you plan to get around London on the Tube, then I would recommend purchasing an Oyster Card from the auto dispenser at the station, which comes preloaded with credit.  For those that like the tourist London Bus tours, they actually stop directly outside the hotel on Northumberland Ave. 

ROOMS
The rooms here are simply divine!!  We stayed in an Executive Room for 2 nights, and a Junior Suite for 2 nights.  Both were on the 3rd floor, and whilst one looked onto the street and the other into the hotel’s private central courtyard, both were a quiet oasis in the hustle & bustle of busy London.  Both rooms were plush, luxurious, extremely stylish & spacious.  This hotel simply oozes class – there is an incredible attention to detail throughout the hotel and the rooms – everything is perfect, 5-star amenities maintained to the utmost standard.  And to our delight when we checked into our room, we were greeted by beautiful flowers, scattered rose petals, cakes, chocolates and champagne as I had previously informed them we were celebrating our anniversary.

Executive Room – consisted of a large separate entry area with large BIR, spacious bedroom (king size bed, flat screen TV, minibar, coffee machine, small table & chairs, plush armchairs, plenty of storage & drawer space), and ensuite bathroom with full size separate bath & shower (flat screen TV over bath too).  We had lovely views over the trees of Northumberland Ave from both the bedroom and bathroom, with plenty of natural light flooding into the room through the double-glazed windows (yet the room was whisper quiet).   The room was superbly furnished with plush carpets, drapes, bed linen.  And the attention to detail was realised in the bespoke and tasteful artwork, cushions & furniture.  

Junior Suite – consisted of a large separate entry & sitting area with flat screen TV, huge bedroom with comfy chairs overlooking a Juliette balcony over the hotel’s central courtyard.  The suite had generously proportioned rooms and was twice the size of the executive room – spacious bedroom, large WIR, bathroom with large separate shower & bath.  The only disappointing thing was that usually a suite of this size would have an additional toilet/powder room.

CONCIERGE All the staff at the Corinthia Hotel were excellent, but I must make a special mention and say a huge thanks to the concierge, Suhil, who was amazing and incredibly helpful.  He organized fantastic VIP champagne tickets to a sold-out play for the following night (Book of Mormon – it was fantastic!), and then arranged a chauffeur limousine to take us there.  Everything was efficiently and courteously arranged.  Whilst we were already suitably impressed by the Corinthia, Suhil’s assistance during our stay was the icing on the cake that made us feel like valued guests in this inspiring hotel which frequently hosts the rich and famous!

ESPA – The spa at the Corinthia is absolutely amazing and well worth the visit.  This amazing complex is set over three underground floors, but the piece de resistance is the basement with its surreal stainless steel swimming pool, plunge pool jacuzzis, and glass-enclosed dry heat sauna.  The treatment menu here is pricey, but I don’t think a visit to this hotel is complete without experiencing the luxurious surroundings at the spa.

VERDICT – The attention to every single detail here is evident and nothing is overlooked by the professional Corinthia staff.  We even managed to catch sight of a Rolling Stone who was a fellow guest being discretely ushered to his waiting limousine enroute to perform at Hyde park, and I think a place must be good if rock royalty chooses to stay here!  If the budget allows you to stay at this magnificient hotel, then you must!",5,2013,10,04
143,Outstanding,"2 extended stays in September and October.  Booked a Trafalgar Suite in both instances, but upgraded to a River Suite located in the ""nose"" of the hotel facing the Thames and the London Eye.  This is a new property, so everything is spotless and polished.  Staff was incredibly helpful and efficient.  Unlike many hotels, the concierge desk was manned by skilled professionals who were able to book hot tables and challenging theater performances.  The location is superb - steps from the Embankment tube station, steps from 10 Downing St., and a 10 minute walk to Big Ben and within walking distance of most theaters.  Both hotel restaurants are excellent.  Massimo (the italian restaurant) is in an absolutely lovely room.  The (Espa) spa has the requisite ""swish"" feel.  Treatments are good.   Having stayed in many London hotels, I can unequivocally say that this is the best hotel in London.",5,2013,10,03
143,Fabulous location-luxury in London,"We stayed at the Corinthia for 5 days at the beginning of our vacation.  The staff, accomodations and location were all great.  The bathroom was as big as our sleeping area, and had a huge shower cabin as well as a separate tub that was huge.  The turndown service was great and loved the wonderful dark chocolates each night.
However, the best part of the room was the super-comfortable bed.  I slept late every morning.",5,2013,10,01
143,An elegant hotel in a great location,"From check-in to check-out we were made to feel most welcomed.  This is a great location to sightsee all of London, either by foot, bus or boat.  The rates are a bit pricey (to be expected for a 5 star hotel), especially the breakfast buffet (but there are other options).  The rooms are large and modern.  We will certainly stay there again, if in downtown London, and highly recommend it to others.",5,2013,10,01
143,"Excellent stay, service and location. Central but so quiet.","I really enjoined being pampered by the hotel staff, excellent spa. Too bad not to spend at least a week. Perfect position. You can walk to the House of Parliament, St. James park or the South bank in just a matter of minutes.  ",5,2013,10,01
143,"Outstanding service, beautiful setting- practically perfect.","In the words of Mary Poppins, the Corinthia hotel is practically perfect in every way. In fact, I really cannot think of a negative. We stayed in a family room. The hotel staff bent over backwards to welcome the children with activity packs, special chocolates, kids size bathrobes and slippers. The room was perfectly sized for everyone and beautifully decked out.  We ordered room service one evening, and everything was scrumptious. I highly recommend the roast tomato soup and the hot chocolate if you are partial to ciocolatto calda (Italian style). The concierge made excellent recommendations for both dinner and breakfast nearby. The location is ideal - quiet and away from the crowds but within walking distance of trafalgar Square, Westminster Abbey, and Big Ben as well as near the underground. Corinthia Hotel will be first on our list on our next visit to London.",5,2013,09,30
143,Absolutely breathtaking hotel,"We stayed at the Corinthia while visiting London and it was first class all of the way.  Beautiful, great location and the employees were the best!  We saw several actors while there and had the BEST tour guide ever.  I'll post about him also.",5,2013,09,30
143,Exceptional hotel,"I have stayed at many 5 star hotels in London some of which would barely rate 3 stars. The Corinthia is an exception, the hotel itself is fabulous from its location through to it's rooms and facilities. What makes this hotel stand out though is the staff who are extremely friendly, helpful and well informed - it is a pity that other hotels could not have staff of this standard  - very well done",5,2013,09,30
143,It's the little touches that make it so special,"My husband surprised me with a stay here to celebrate my birthday. From pulling up outside and asking for the car to be valet parked to leaving 24 hours later, everything was flawless. The staff are all happy and although I was in awe from the moment I stepped in and saw the huge lobby and gorgeous chandelier, there is nothing remotely pretentious about anyone or anything in this hotel. And somehow all staff we came across knew it was my birthday. 

We arrived a little early for check in and as our room wasn't ready, we were given a small tour of the public areas and some complimentary hot drinks whilst we waited. In our room there was fresh fruit, a small birthday cake and a bottle of champagne waiting for us. My husband had mentioned when booking that I was pregnant and although at most places this would just be a ""point to note"", the staff at Corinthia went out of their way to make me comfortable by offering fresh juice as an alternative to the champagne (they called the following morning to ask if I would like more) and providing a pregnancy pillow to sleep with (this is an absolute must for any heavily pregnant woman and one of my favourite touches!)

The Espa spa was simply divine - I had an antinatal treatment and made use of the heated marble beds and sleep pods, whilst my husband headed straight to the pool and thermal area. Both of us commented on how, although busy, it didn't seem busy at all. I had the entire sleep pod area to myself and my husband enjoyed the pool to himself for 30 mins.

Yes the Corinthia is slightly pricey, but it was definitely worth it, especially for a special occasion.",5,2013,09,29
143,Relaxing stay in London,"We stayed at the Corinthia Hotel for our last 2 nights of our London/Paris holiday. We enjoyed our stay very much. The location of the hotel is excellent, with views of the London Eye right from our bedroom window. The hotel is next to Embankment and Charing Cross and also walking distance to Covent Garden and Westminster. We enjoyed morning runs by the river. The room was very comfortable and the bathroom is large and luxurious with heated towel racks and floors. The highlight really was the EPSA spa and Thermal Floor and pool area. The sauna, steam room, marble deck chairs and the vitality pool were extremely impressive. Definitely the best indoor pool and spa area I've ever come across. Also loved the lobby and the gorgeous flowers placed throughout. Service was pleasant and professional as well. Definitely enjoyed our stay there and would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.",5,2013,09,26
143,Favorite hotel in London,"This has become my go to hotel in London. It is not a cheap option, but it is worth monitoring for their specials, such as 3 nights for the cost of 2. Fantastic location in Whitehall just south of Trafalgar Square. Easy access to London Eye, Houses of Parliament, and all that Central London has to offer. You can walk everywhere from here. The hotel itself has such a high level of customer focus. The staff are very helpful and seem genuine in their desire for you to have a great experience. The rooms are large for London. Very clean and well maintained. I found the bed to be very comfortable and had a great night's sleep. They have a nice lobby area and separate atrium to sit and relax and enjoy afternoon tea. The food in the hotel is very good. I visit London have a dozen times a year and have yet to have a bad experience on any level at this hotel. Highly recommended. Have not had the time to use the spa, so can't comment on that part.",5,2013,09,24
143,Perfect Stay,"I have to say that this is one hotel that the pictures on their website do NOT do it justice! Every part of our stay was fantastic.  The room was extremely large for London standards and the bed wonderfully comfortable.  The room comes with a Nespresso machine and coffee bar and has tons of room for unpacking all of your luggage.  The bathroom is again extremely large with the newest fixtures and wonderful bath products from the ESPA spa.  Speaking of the spa- this is by far one of the highlights of the hotel.  Guests have access to the Thermal Floor of the spa during their stay which includes a sauna, steam room, sleep pods, and the Vitality Pool- a large warmed pool with various massage stations.  Coming back from a long day of exploring London, soaking in the Vitality Pool was perfect!  I also cannot say enough about the service at the Corinthia.  It is definitely a larger hotel than some of the other more boutique 5 star hotels in London but everything runs like a well-oiled machine from the service in the restaurants, the nightly turn-down service (with water and chocolates) and the concierge (not to mention the in house florist that keeps the common areas full of gorgeous fresh flowers).  I received an excellent rate on our Deluxe King rooms and ended up staying at a different hotel for an extra night in London when that rate was no longer available- but this is truly one of the best hotels I have stayed in and on my next trip to London will stay here no matter what rate is available!  The location is also great- right next to the Embankment and Charing Cross tube stations, one turn out the main entrance and you are in Trafalgar Square, the other you are crossing the bridge with views of the London Eye/Westminster",5,2013,09,24
143,Excellent hotel,"We stayed at the Corinthia as part of my husbands birthday celebrations. The hotel is wonderful, the staff are all so helpful,pleasant and eager to ensure you enjoy your stay. The rooms are thoughtfully planned and very comfortable. We dined in the Northall restaurant and the food and service were impeccable, we really can't praise this hotel enough !! We shall definitely return when we visit London again, this is definitely the place to stay.",5,2013,09,24
143,Impeccable Customer Service,"I attended a wedding reception over the weekend and I must say the hotel looks impressive, but it was the customer service which did it for me. I didn't know where the function was being held and I headed straight to the reception area. The gentleman behind the desk ensured he found where I needed to be and walked me to the ballroom! 

The Hotel is stunning on the inside as well and I must say, the service throughout my visit was faultless. The customer service during dining matched my first customer experience -  very attentive and faultless. The restrooms are spotless and very well attended to!

I'm looking forward to frequent the hotel and enjoy its services very soon!",5,2013,09,22
143,Wow how fast did a night go,"I arrived for an event we having in the hotel.  The bedroom. Was so lovely. Rates as one of the best I stayed in. Bathroom fab.  Dressing room well done.  Service extra good and reception house keeping and front office could not do enough for you. 

Went into the bar. It was lovely and nice area for a drink 

We went out for dinner so did not get to sample the food this time just the bar.  Spa is out of this world. You need time to enjoy

Great hotel love and need to go back and enjoy",5,2013,09,21
143,Very well thought out rooms,"I stayed at the deluxe king room with a very high ceiling and it was beyond my expectation, every detail has been carefully thought out.  The wood panel foyer gives the room a sense of scale and occasion, bathroom is spacious and luxurious.  The round table next to the window is perfect both as a desk as well as a dining table.  There is a sliding door which transform the bookshelf into a working storage with all the Internet and electrical outlets.  Food quality from  room service is exceptionally good as well.   

The spa 'complex' at the basement is huge and stunning.   However, the pool is just too small for any adult to do laps.  It looks spectacular with the dim ambience lighting, but what a pity to have all the space and not a pool you can actually use.  

Overall, the hotel is outstanding in almost every aspect, service is exceptional during the entire week of my stay.",5,2013,09,19
143,It couldn't get better than this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Me and my husband stayed here for our honeymoon and I couldn't think of a better hotel than this to stay!  Outstanding, awesome, wonderful, delightful, I could go on and on.  From the moment you walk in the staff is just amazing!  They had flowers and a cake in our room to welcome us for our honeymoon.  Flowers in the bathroom, fruit, etc.  What a welcome!   The decor of the hotel is wonderful, not over the top, just elegant.  Beautiful flower shop inside the hotel.  The breakfast buffet is to die for!   Restaurants were very good also.   I would stay here again and again and again, I didn't want to leave!   The spa level is unreal! Pools and jacuzzi area are truly fantastic!  Location of the hotel is absolutly perfect too.  This hotel truly is a gem!",5,2013,09,18
143,No compromise on quality,"The welcome book in my room stated that they made no compromise on quality. I could see and feel this everywhere from the staff, to the location, from the silence in my room to the accessories in the bathroom. This hotel is unique in its luxury for a hotel found in such a great location in London.

Then, just when you think you have seen it all, check out their SPA. Truly fantastic, with its massage stations in one of the pools, tphe stainless steel lining on the other pool and the sleeping pods room.

I hope I don't ever get used to this!!",5,2013,09,18
143,Perfect location for a stay!,"We enjoyed our staying at Corinthia Hotel in London. Before choosing hotel, we looked through tripadvisor for comments, and they really suite the reality - 10 minutes walk for the main city attractions, good staff and nice hotel! By all means going back to London and for sure are going to stay here!",5,2013,09,16
143,Truelly outstanding!!!!,"My husband booked this hotel for my birthday.  I have stayed in quite a few 5 star hotels in London and either the hotels aren't 5 star but advertised as such or 5 star stuffy old heavy curtained places with tassled lamp shades, urghh....  The Corinthia has a contemporary feel with a more traditional look in the corridors and bar. This hotel exceeded all of my expectations in all areas. Loved the flat screen tv at the end of the bath, the rain shower, the soft pillows, the soft towels etc etc etc.  The hotel was immaculate.  Yes agree that it is expensive, but you are in one of the best locations in London just a minute walk to the Thames opposite the London Eye, and a 5 minute walk to Whitehall.  You get what you pay for and if you want the best it comes with a price.  Enjoy!",5,2013,09,15
143,The Crown Jewel of Hotels.,"My husband and I booked this hotel after reading (extensively) through the Trip Advisor reviews and then seeing another nod to it in Travel and Leisure magazine's top hotels in Europe - for which it was in the Top Tiering of all hotels in Europe and certainly in London.  We had originally booked the Arch Hotel (which has similarly favorable reviews) but cancelled and booked here - and we were not disappointed.  I had informed the hotel that we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and we were surprised to see a nice little cake with ""Happy Anniversary"" written on it in our room along with a very nice gesture of welcoming us on our flat screen TV (with lovely music playing).  We spent 6 nights at this property and it was by far one of the nicest places we have ever stayed internationally or in the United States (where we are from).  

The rooms are impeccably clean and decorated in fine taste along with all the proper amenities, too.  The bathroom is well manicured and I liked that the bathrooms were separate from the rain shower - which is unbelievable and perhaps one of the best showers I have seen in a hotel - - in terms of water pressure and rain shower quality (which it really does come from the ceiling - unlike other hotels where it is just a rain shower-like nozzle).  The heated floors are truly differentiating and the bathtub is like a spatub, too.  The bed was extremely comfortable (but firm - for those that like less than firm mattresses) and the other furniture was modern and new.  We stayed on the 4th floor in an Executive King and there was virtually no sound at night and the shades make it almost light cancelling.  I did hear that they had noise proofed the building - but this could be just hearsay.  The hallway and common areas are all clean and well appointed.  The lobby is beautiful - but I do agree with the other post - that it's a little odd to host afternoon tea and evening drinks in a space in which folks are passing through back to their rooms - it's a somewhat poor traffic set-up for such a luxurious hotel.  I would not have had tea there for that very reason - as you feel like you are in the middle of something.  The lobby courtyard was immaculate and it was nice to sit out there on nice evenings (they even turn the fireplace on for you - upon request).  The staff in the Courtyard area was all very kind and helpful and service was fast and friendly. 

The Concierge team was helpful - though I was surprised that they are all men ---- and I actually asked the Front Desk about this to confirm and they currently do not have any women on their Concierge staff - which I found extremely odd.  I think that's one area in which they can improve their services - especially to have a different point of view of things from the opposite gender.  Overall they were helpful in recommending certain things to do as well as restaurants (though I got the feeling that they may be just recommending certain restaurants and not themselves having even enjoyed or sampled them on their own).  I would often cross-check their recommendations with YELP or TripAdvisor and was (after awhile) not surprised to find that their suggestions were not even in the top 50% of traveler recommended places to go.  I was a lot happier with our dining selections when I researched those two sites vs. listened to the advice of the Concierge team in this area....so this was the one area in which I think the team could improve.

The Housekeeping service team was perhaps the most friendly that we encountered and they kept our room so clean that I felt bad if we made any mess.  They literally sorted and folded all of our clothes and also straightened and put away any of our stuff!  The turn down service is also amazing - as they provide still waters in glass bottles and world-class chocolates from Wm Curley.  Overall - this was always a nice treat to come back in the evenings to a wonderfully appointed and clean room with chocolate!

The Front Desk was extremely friendly and helpful in checking us in for our stay and also helping us with currency exchange.  They seem to be very welcoming to their guests along with the men that man the doors in top hats and help you find transportation or provide directions.

The location of the hotel is great -- it's walkable to Big Ben, Westminster, The River Thames/and boats/pier, Covent Garden, Picaddily Circus, SOHO, West End / Theater District, Buckingham Palace / St. James Park.  It's a bit much to walk to Kensington, Notting Hill or Harrods from this location.  

Overall - this is a wonderful place to stay and I could not imagine our trip to London being any better anywhere else.",5,2013,09,14
143,"Friendly, lovely hotel","My husband surprised me with a trip to London for the last night of the Proms. We stayed in this wonderful hotel. From the moment we arrived we were greeted in a warm friendly manner, from the doorman to the receptionist. We were given a very quiet room which was spacious, clean and loved the tv in the ensuite. As it was my birthday the hotel sent me a chocolate cake which was delicious. 
The only disappointing thing for me was the afternoon tea. My husband had booked this before we arrive at the hotel and it took him 4 phone calls to finally get it booked. Each time he phoned he was told someone would call him back and no one did. Finally he managed to book it, we went at our appointed time to find out that they had given our table to another couple who they thought was us. We ended up sitting at a tiny table in the middle of the room next to large groups of noisy ladies, hotel guests and waitresses constantly walking past our table. This was not the  nice relaxing celebration my husband had expected. We asked for the mustard and horseradish to be removed from the sandwiches which wasn't a problem but meant we had to wait a while for our food to come as they needed to make the sandwiches up fresh. Surely you should be making the sandwiches fresh each time. Some of the sandwiches were a little stale and you could tell had been sitting out for a while. The scones were fantastic. There was a good variety of cakes but I would have liked there to be two of each seeing as there were two of us eating. We cut each one in half so we both could try them. Some were nice, some were a bit tasteless. On the whole I wouldn't take afternoon tea here again.
After the Proms we returned to the hotel and went to their cocktail bar. This was fantastic, lovely cocktails, live music, great atmosphere and attentive staff. We ordered some food which was very nice. Lovely way to unwind after a busy day.
Breakfast was great, we ordered from the menu so can't say what the food from the buffet was like.
I would stay here again and would recommend this hotel to my friends. It is in a great location for sightseeing, shopping or going to shows. 
Thank you to all the staff for a great experience and making my stay special.",5,2013,09,12
143,Afternoon Tea disappointment,"The location of the hotel is brilliant and easy to find from Waterloo or embankment. Very clean and the chandelier is beautiful. 

However on arrival no one was there to greet us and there is no obvious entrance to the lobby lounge. Also I know the name should have prepared me but you are sat in a lobby so the breeze from the doors opening made the experience cold and you felt very exposed by guests walking past you to go to their rooms. 

The staff are very friendly but take a long time to get their attention if you needed more tea or the bill. 

We had the champagne afternoon tea. And I had a vegetarian option. Which was great however when they brought desert I was asked if I was a 'picky' vegetarian as if not I could have all the deserts. I'm not 'picky' I just don't want to eat animal. That made me quite cross and uncomfortable. 

The tea got cold very quickly and was not very flavourful. And we had to ask for this to be replaced which took a long time. 

The cakes were beautiful but sadly did not taste as good as they appeared. The sandwiches were lovely however and you could have more. The champagne was also of a good standard. 

Upon being served the cakes we were also given what we were told were goody bags. But they were just bags with advertising and pricing for the spa and hotel. Very poor and we left these behind. 

I have had afternoon tea at quite a few places and therefore would not return here again as I feel there are better options for your money. The company I had made the afternoon enjoyable not the hotel. ",3,2013,09,12
143,"Again, a fantastic stay at the Corinthia","It was supposed to be a 5 night stay but it was so comfortable that we ended up staying for 2 weeks!  

Very large rooms for London standard alone is a huge plus, but it comes with great bathroom and modern technology and facilities such as the Spa and a good business centre.

Even when there are hiccups, the management deals with them very graciously.

It is THE place to stay in London.",5,2013,09,11
143,Luxurious Hotel,"We recently stayed in two connecting rooms with our three children.  My husband has stayed  for business travel so I wasn't sure how it would be for the whole family but I'm so glad we stayed here.  The hotel is new and it shows.  The rooms were beautifully decorated, had nespresso machines, and heated floors in the bathrooms.  The kids had their own robes and slippers and treats every night. The rooms were also quite spacious.  We ate at both restaurants and enjoyed them both, good service and really good food.  They were expensive but you expect that.  The kids used the pool once too, they had limited hours for kids which was a shame but I can understand its geared towards their spa guests.  It was also quite nice.  I really liked the location.  Its on a quiet street but within a short walk you are in Trafalgar Square or can cross the river Thames and get to the Eye of London or the Waterloo train station which we took to Windsor Castle.  We walked to Convent Garden too.  I saw a lot of reviews about the staff but everyone we encountered seemed very professional and courteous.  Perhaps not overly friendly but our every request was met.  I definitely recommend staying at the Corinthia and hope to return on our next visit to London.",5,2013,09,10
143,"Beautiful hotel, but very pricey","I booked the Corinthia Hotel as a surprise for my partner due to it's good reviews and great location. The hotel lounge, seating areas, bars and dining rooms are beautiful. The artwork and flowers are stunning.
Our room was amazing - true luxury. Every attention to detail; beautiful bedding, towels, robes, toiletries etc. Subtle lighting, mood music, fresh flowers - it was a very romantic place to stay.
The spa was like something from a film - stunningly beautiful and soooo relaxing.
Each member of staff we came across was courteous, professional and helpful.

The only thing that let the hotel down was the cost. When I paid almost £300 for the room I presumed it would include breakfast. Mistake. Breakfast cost an extra £32 each!! Admittedly it was very good - and so it should have been at that price! Drinks at the bar are also extortionately priced. And don't for one moment think the nuts/chocolates etc in the room are complimentary! We opened a jar of nuts - and found a £9 charge on the bill!!

All in all we enjoyed our stay very much, and would recommend. Just be aware of the hidden costs.",5,2013,09,10
143,Huge disappointment,"It looks five or even six stars but the place and sadly the staff were without spirit. First impression was amazing but what we discovered behind the curtain was a huge disappointment. We decided to stay overnight and also had an afternoon tea which they claim to be one of the best in town. We were ignored all the time by everyone. There were just very few staff who had no idea what was going on. Stressed, rushing and frustrated...I feel bad by writing such a bad review but just wanted to warn the others who plan to spend their hardly earned money for such a ""treat"".
There is something wrong how the place is run. It is not my priviledge to judge these poor guys anyway. However the selection was very good and the only down were sandwiches. It`s a shame because the place is beautifuly designed and has a great potential.",1,2013,09,09
143,staff too busy,slow check in. beautiful hotel .but staff to busy to make it a good experience .excellent room and spotlessly clean .but for the price have stayed in better ..................................................................,4,2013,09,09
143,Exquisite,"I've stayed here before for work but this time was for leisure. What a place! Top class, professional and friendly. Centrally placed for walking, tube, or driving.  Will definitely stay here again. Can't recommend enough.",5,2013,09,09
143,What a wonderful Hotel!,"I stayed at The Corinthia, in August, for some nights with a group, about 85 guests. What a great choice the company made! Great services, front desk fantastic and the concierge too. The rooms are big and comfortable, and the bathroom so great you want to sleep inside.... amazing shower, like a tropical rain forest, and the ammenities are so good, like a spa visit.
The beds are fantastic too, and breakfast is outstanding with a lot of choices. Dinner was great at the Massimo, staff very nice and professional.",5,2013,09,07
143,Luxury in the Heart of London,"This hotel is immaculate and the location is ideal.  Its located right next to Embankment Station on River Thames, right down the road from Parliament.  They paid attention to every detail and even wished us Yankees ""Happy Birthday America"" with notes and chocolates when we were there over the 4th of July.  The spa is absolutely opulent, something I've never seen before with the sleep pods, heated recliners, ice slide and posh locker rooms.  Corinthia is the Crown Jewel in a jewel of a city.  Tea time is a must in the courtyard, so relaxing!",5,2013,09,06
143,London Gem,"I recently stayed at the Corinthia London on a business trip and could not have been more pleased. The rooms were spacious and elegant the staff was professional and friendly and the location is ideal. It was the finest hotel I have stayed at in Europe. Stay here, you will not be disappointed.",5,2013,09,06
143,Excellent,"I and my wife stayed at Corinthia London for four nights and we were very satisfied with every aspect of this hotel. To begin with, the staff was very easy to talk to, friendly and truly professional. All the staff was very helpful, we never had to look for help, the staff was so attentive that they saw when we needed service and immediately came to assist us. The cleanliness was of the highest standards. The room was made up twice a day. First for day, then, in the evening the room was made up for the night. Yet, we never saw the maid during our stay. Generally, the rooms at the Corinthia are larger than at most other 5 start hotels, which is one of the reasons why we booked Corinthia. This is the best hotel that I have ever stayed on. It didn’t hurt that we got a free upgrade because we were first time visitors either!

Having said this I feel that I also want to mention some minor things that could be improved upon. When we arrived we were welcomed by a very nice lady who immediately showed us all the way to our room while a man carried our bags to our room. The lady also showed us all the facilities of the room and asked us if we had any questions or if she could help us in any way. This was very nice and made it easy for us to establish ourselves in the room. For us it felt superfluous that another man soon rang our door to come in and show us around the room once again. We got a strong feeling he came around for tip money. To show guests their room: nice. To do it several times: skip it. Another thing was that we were woken up by a phone call at 3 am one night even though we had pressed the do not disturb button. We had hotel breakfast at our room one morning. I cannot say that it was anything wrong with it, but it cost £78 for two persons. The other mornings we ate sandwiches, juice and other things from prêt a porter, located just around the corner from Corinthia. Not only was the breakfast cheaper, about £12 for two persons, but we liked it a whole lot better. The sandwiches were very tasty.",5,2013,09,05
143,Excellent location & fabulous hotel,"Just got back from a 4 day trip to London and my stay at Corinthia was nothing short of excellent. 

To begin with it's a beautiful hotel with an excellent location. It's right next to the Embankment tube stop so hopping on and off the tube was super easy. Centrally located, Trafalgar sq, Covent Garden, Big Ben etc. etc. pretty much all of it was within a 10 min walk. Cannot beat the superb location. 

The rooms are very spacious and well equipped. I was impressed with the room amenities, very luxurious & comfortable. The bathroom was huge and well stocked. Amongst other things we always had water, tea/coffee, fruits & chocolate from Harrod's on the house. Everything was super clean, in good condition and tastefully done. If anything my only complaint was the lack of plug points in the bathroom to use a hair dryer. Also we did have a tiny balcony but no view so there was not much of a view. 

The hotel itself is gorgeous and I love their flower arrangement each morning. The staff was courteous & helpful. The Concierge was a hit or miss. Some of them had great recommendations, some others not so good. 

At the time of checkout we saw some unusual charges on our bill. We were charged an additional 110 pounds for laundry and drinks. None of these charges were ours, that was a bit strange. But the hotel promptly removed it. That was the only thing I found strange and felt a good hotel should not make such errors. It was a bit upsetting. So do check your bill properly before leaving. 

Overall I would highly recommend the hotel for its excellent location & good service.",4,2013,09,04
143,So fantastic that I didn't want to leave my room!,"Who wants to spend time in his/her hotel room in beautiful, walkable London?  If you stay at the Corinthia, you might want to.  This hotel, perfectly positioned between Trafalgar Square and the Thames, was apparently recently renovated and beautifully so; luxurious without being flashy.  The lobby is gorgeous with plenty of seating, a lovely place to have tea in the afternoon or have drinks in the evening.  Breakfast in the restaurant felt both decadent and comfortable and the food was delicious.  I wish I'd had enough time to take advantage of the incredible spa.  The room itself was a calm and modern but sumptuously comfortable space with a large separate bathroom and a walk-in closet.  I slept like a baby in the comfortable bed and awoke refreshed and eager to take advantage of the in-room Nespresso machine.  I wish I'd been able to enjoy the TV in the bathtub!

As for service, the staff was incredibly attentive, from the reception desk to the concierge to the doormen...all were friendly, polite and eager to help.  They arranged meal reservations, gave me directions and when I commented on the absolutely delicious chocolates on my pillow after turndown service, a larger box was delivered to my room.  My new favorite hotel! I can't wait to visit again with my husband...",5,2013,09,04
143,Excellant with Flaws,"This is a very good hotel with excellent service, wonderful rooms and a great location. Right beside the Strand, the Millenium Bridge, The London Eye, and a whole lot more. The down sides: the afternoon tea was the very worst we have ever had in London and in fact was more like a tea you would get in lower Slobovia. The prices in their buffet breakfast restaurant were too high - and that is something for me to say since I don't usually care about restaurant prices.
However, that said, this is a really, really good hotel and I will stay there again.",4,2013,09,03
143,Like a soft mattress? This isn't the place.,"I'm so disappointed that I'm not able to give the Corinthia a rave review. I've been waiting to stay there since I first toured the property in May, 2011. I was so thrilled to finally be staying at a luxury property in London. Previous stays in the city were at a b&b back when I was in college, the Royal National twice 12/13 yrs ago (scary!) & The Metropolitan (so not impressed) in 2011. I read & reread the reviews every day & the anticipation was palpitating. 

But the reality...it's been a couple of days since I checked out of the Corinthia & luckily my back has started to feel better. Why did my back hurt? Because the mattresses at the Corinthia are much too firm. Do they have any sort of foam egg crates or thicker mattress pads that could be put on the bed? No.

I simply cannot be the only person who has ever asked for a foam egg crate or complained about the mattress. I believe they promote the mattress as some sort of specialty brand. Not a brand I would ever buy. The mattress isn't hard like ones you may find in Thailand (Napasai on Koh Samui comes to mind), it's just very firm. Maybe it's too new? I don't know. Considering the bed is an integral  part of a hotel stay, I will not be able to stay at the Corinthia again unless they begin providing some sort of pad that makes the bed softer.

The other main issue I had with my room was it smelled quite musty. It literally took my breath away when I first walked in. I turned up the air conditioning & let it run, but the underlying odor was still there.

Also, the much lauded floor heating in the bathroom either didn't work or wasn't on. Sure, it's August & warm outside but my feet love a nice warm bathroom floor.

The good. Housekeeping was fantastic. Efficient & always left plenty of towels & toiletries.  I will have to say the turndown chocolates are almost the best I've ever had (the truffles at Fearrington House in NC are the best).

I also appreciated the easy to use lighting system.

Whatever problems they may have had in the past with the Internet service seems to have been resolved. It was fast enough that I could use Skype & download video. 

I also have to say that breakfast at The Northall is really, really expensive. I'm usually of the mind that if you can afford to stay at a hotel like The Corinthia you can afford to eat in their restaurant. However, in this case I really do think they are gouging the guest. The buffet is £32.00 (about $50.00). The a la carte menu is a little more reasonable except coffee beverages & tea are £5.50 - that's about $8.50. Sorry, but that's crazy. If you exit the hotel by the side door near the Harrods & turn left, there is a Garfunkel's restaurant that opens at 7:00 am. There is also a Costa Coffee in the Waterstones across the street from Garfunkel's. It's on the first floor. 

In short, if you need a soft mattress this is not the hotel for you (at this time).

143,Corinthia Hotel - 5* luxury and service from start to finish,"I have just returned from a stay at the Corinthia and one word sums up the whole experience - WOW!  It has the Wow factor in abundance.  As we were celebrating a special birthday we received a room upgrade which was fantastic.  There was a birthday cake, bowl of fruit and chocolates.  Such nice touches made us feel really special.  We were given complementary drinks in the lounge while we waited a short time for the room to be ready.  The receptionist came to collect us when our room was ready and showed us to our room.  We couldn't believe how luxurious and large it was, far exceeding my expectations.  The bathroom was to die for - I loved the TV and the rain shower was so large and the pressure was perfect.  The bed was so soft, the linens so smooth and so big. The most comfortable bed ever. The turn down service was a lovely touch too.  
          I visited the spa which was an experience in itself.  Amazing place.  I loved every aspect of it, but my favourite part was the sleep pods.  So warm, cosy, comfortable and quiet that I dozed off for a little while.  I had a massage which was the best massage I have ever had, a facial (my therapist had the most perfect light touch) and a pedicure - a lovely experience and I can see why it was voted Best UK hotel spa - it is very unique in its design, luxurious and the treatments are divine (I am a qualified beauty therapist and have visited many spas and had many treatments).  My travelling companion was also of that opinion.
We didn't dine in the hotel but had the best lattes we had ever had in the lobby lounge.  We also had a few nightcaps in the Bassoon Bar - the ambience was just so right. 
        The hotels designers have got the mood lighting throughout the hotel (public areas and rooms) and spa spot on.  Dimmed in the spa and bar just enough to be cosy and intimate but not so much that you are unable to see anything.
        The service from all of the staff was  professional, friendly and efficient and nothing is too much trouble, from the waiting staff to Reception to the doormen.  They are attentive without being obtrusive - a perfect balance.  
         My only disappointment (for want of a better word) would be the inclusive breakfast buffet style which was great and plentiful - fresh fruit, pastries, cheeses, breads, cereals, yogurts etc. which were all lovely as you would expect but the hot options I felt were not up the rest of the hotels 5* standard which was a real shame as I was so looking forward to it.  The scrambled eggs didn't look or taste very nice and the bacon was hard and greasy and for this reason alone I rate it as very good rather than excellent.  (I would choose the a la carte option next time as the food I saw delivered to other diners looked delicious).  However, this did not detract from my overall enjoyment of my stay.  
          The Corinthia is a fabulous hotel and I cannot wait to visit again.",5,2013,09,03
143,Very good hotel stay,"Stayed for weekend night - nice comfortable room, amenities etc. Spa is great, though felt rushed to get out as place is like a factory. Food at Massimo's is great, very nice restaurant feels with well aligned brigade.",4,2013,09,03
143,Luxury in London,"I've stayed at most of the 5 star properties in London and the Corinthia is now my favorite. It's the perfect combination of luxury and comfort without any stuffiness or pretense. The Spa is one of the best in Europe. I find the rooms perfectly appointed, spacious and incredibly comfortable. The breakfast in the Northhall is not to be missed. Highly recommend",5,2013,09,03
143,Sublime!,"This hotel is in a different class everything exceeded our expectations, the room, the food, the location and finally the spa (wow).
We went here as a wedding anniversary and were very happy that we did. 
We saw many celebrities here as its not as well know as some of the other big names in London and they can probably have a quiet stay here.
Book it!",5,2013,09,03
143,"Corinthia Hotel- classy London option, old world charm in a thoroughly modern hotel","The Corinthia is a new hotel by London standards, but has been created with a traditional London feel. The staff are super helpful, very professional and you can tell they have been rigorously trained.

The rooms are big, high tech, excellent beds, and the bathrooms are an experience in themselves- huge mutli-sprayer shower, separate (roomy) toilet cubicle, and an enormous bath with a TV and waterproof remote control!

The hotel has a number of eating and drinking venues, all top notch, and is located bang in the middle of Whitehall- you can feel the machinery of government around you.

If you book via Expedia or similar online booking services, you can get very good rates.

Will definitely be back.",5,2013,09,01
143,A true 5 star- wonderful experience in London,"This is a true five star hotel with impeccable service and impeccable facilities in the heart of London. We loved the spacious room, wonderful bed linens, marble bathroom with separate shower, great toiletries, superb water pressure, great bathrobes, excellent technology (including international plug, iphone/ipad doc, central control of all room lighting, excellent turn-down service, great afternoon tea service, extremely quiet room and perfect location for visiting London (2 minutes to Trafalgar square, 5 minutes to the parliament building etc.). I did not visit the spa but I am sure it is superb.",5,2013,08,31
143,Very plush but a bit in-personal,"Had lovely afternoon tea here with my partner. Firstly the hotel is very grand but on entering the lobby lounge we were made to feel a bit out of place whilst waiting to be served. The waitress who did eventually come was lovely and friendly. The afternoon tea sandwiches were tasty as were the cakes. The tea, in my opinion, was nowhere near the quality of Betty's. For £80 I did expect slightly better. ",4,2013,08,31
143,Why would want to stay anywhere else?,"This five star hotel deserves everyone one of its stars! First class service, first class accommodation, first class restaurants, first class venue.

My partner and I recently held our wedding celebrations at the Corinthia, having searched all over for a venue with that wow factor, and that could offer us a modern Italian twist, the Corinthia delivered this and more by the bucket. Claire Bowpitt, our event co-ordinator was just fabulous, handling every detail personally.

We choose to check in a day early for our celebrations,  the idea being that we would spoil ourselves to a little rest prior to our big day, and take advantage of the hotels stunning spa facilities and dinner at the Corinthia's Italian restaurant, Massimo that evening (Massimo's was after all the main reason we had booked the Corinthia for our big day). On arrival we were meet at the front door by Claire, and the doorman busied themselves unloading our luggage, treating us like visiting royalty.  Our first surprise came when Claire took us up to our room, to find out that she had upgraded us to one of the hotels premier penthouse suites!! To say it was stunning was understatement, it was 800sq feet of pure indulgence, we could have held our ceremony in our suite it was so big. Split over two floors, with a living room and guest toilet on the lower floor, and a bedroom, bathroom and dressing room to die for on the upper floor, it was just out of this world. We were then introduced to our personal butler, who would take care of anything we needed!! When we were finally left alone, we just looked at one another and said ""someone's made a mistake, they will be back shortly to move us to our correct room"" but we soon settled in..... 

The afternoon was spent enjoying our surroundings, a fabulous light lunch in the foyer under the amazing chandelier, followed by a few of hours pampering ourselves in the spa facilities, which were better than any ""spa"" hotel I have ever been too, drinks in the courtyard, and finally dinner in Massimo's. 

I should maybe explain, my partner is Sicilian, and loves his food. Massimo's is without doubt one of the best Italian restaurants in London, the food is simply sablime. Claire had booked us a table, and what followed was 3hours of eating some of the best food and drinking some of the best wine that Italy can offer. We were joined for dinner by Vito my partners brother, who after dessert gave the chef the ultimate Italian compliment, ""it was better than home"".

The next day was our big day. The service was scheduled for 4.30pm, so when we came down at 10am, we were expecting the court room and Ballroom to be empty. How wrong we were, the set up was nearly complete! No stress, no errors, no problems. Claire gave us a quick tour and introduced us to the key staff, it was just so perfect. The hotels florist had done a wonderful job, and our own florist and AV company were just finishing, it all looked just perfect. Having meet our best men for lunch, all that was left for us to do was change for dinner.

The day flew by, with one compliment after the next from our guests. The service over dinner was just fantastic, the staff were impeccable, and the food was as good as massimo, with our 100 guests all saying that they were just blown awa. It was truly an evening we will remember for the rest of our lives.

The Corinthia is not cheep, but its worth absolutely every penny, and it is good value. First class service, first class food, first class accommodation, this truly is a first class hotel! 

Go, you will remember the experience long after you have forgotten the price!",5,2013,08,31
143,"Five Stars, and richly deserved!","Location: I was delighted with the location of the Corinthia.  It is a 2 minute walk to two tube stations (Charing Cross and Embankment) so it was really easy to travel to the attractions we wanted to visit.  It is virtually next to the river and the London Eye, Westminster Abbey and Houses of Parliament are a short walk away.  Whitehall Gardens are literally across the road and very pleasant to visit for a quiet sit down after a busy day.  Trafalgar Square is about 5 minutes walk away and it is close to St James Park, Horse Guards Parade and Buckingham Palace.  There was always a taxi outside too so we never had to wait if we wanted to go by cab.
Service: This is what the Corinthia is all about.  The staff are extremely professional, polite and helpful.  We were upgraded to an Executive room and as there was a short wait for it to be ready we were ushered into the Lobby Lounge and served complimentary drinks.  When the room was ready the receptionist returned to collect us and showed us around the restaurants and lobby areas.  All the staff were very attentive and welcoming.
Rooms: The room that we had was absolutely lovely and quite large.  It faced on to Whitehall Place and although it was only on the first floor it was very quiet with no traffic disturbance.  There was slight disturbance one night as there was a ball in the ballroom below our room but it really did not bother us much at all.  There was never any “people” noise from within the hotel at night time.  The room was beautifully appointed and very clean.   The quality of the fittings, furnishings, lighting and bathroom was excellent – even under floor heating in the bathroom.
Food: There is a choice of restaurants and we ate in the Massimo on two evenings.  The food was very good and reasonably priced.  I recommend the beef tenderloin which was exquisite.  Wine is from around £45 per bottle and by the glass from around £10.  The lobby lounge, which serves food all day, offered a great alternative for us to enjoy a light breakfast.
Overall this is an excellent hotel and I can’t wait to return there for another break. The location, ambience, rooms and service are perfect in my opinion.  I will definitely be booking in at the Corinthia next time I visit London.",5,2013,08,30
143,A Perfect Hotel,"We have been to London many times and can confidently say that the Corinthia is the best hotel that we have ever stayed at in London.  The rooms are modern, well appointed and very comfortable.  The lobby and common areas are exquisite.  The staff is first rate.  The concierges are knowledgeable, helpful and attentive.  Housekeeping is thorough, timely and consistent.  The front desk staff is very pleasant and welcoming.  The spa and fitness facility are amongst the finest at that we have encountered at any hotel, possibly the best in the case of the spa.   The restaurant staff in the Northall restaurant are wry pleasant, attentive and work hard to cater to guest needs.  The hotel's location is perfect for touring, shopping, attending the theatre and generally enjoying central London.  The Corinthia is now our hotel of choice in London and we cannot recommend it more highly.",5,2013,08,29
143,"amazing Corinthia , but its 5 stars because of the staff !","Just a super 5* hotel , made even more special due to the staff. They are all just there to make you have an unforgettable time, its genuine too, and I can usually spot it. 
I forgot to organise various things before my stay , and Jean Louis organised everything , leave it to me he said "" it will be perfect""  and it was , better than I could have arranged , from flowers to reservations , to spa treatments , to Wimbledon tickets , to .....,.
Thank you to the whole team !",5,2013,08,29
143,Gorgeous hotel but not ideal location for me,"One of the most beautiful hotels I have stayed in, anywhere. The bathrooms are tremendous!  My only criticisms would be one of the waiters in the bar (really unpleasant in every way) and the location of the hotel.  A hike to shopping, theatre and any sights with the exception of the national gallery, the eye and Westminster abbey.  Gym is very well equipped, spa is overly modern and deluxe, public rooms are visually interesting and luxurious.   We did not have any issues with the room and I anticipate none with check out though I write this as I sit in bed on our last night. 
I would love to stay here again, but likely won't due to location...  If you are okay with being on The Strand or in a very southern location then this is your dream hotel.",5,2013,08,28
143,Simply the Best,"I wouldn't normally write a review about a hotel that I have already reviewed but I have to make an exception about this hotel as I like staying here so much and it is, I think, the best hotel I have ever stayed at.
This stay, which was our third, was only sadly for one night but the things which stood out for me aduring this visit were:
- its location, just a short walk from Trafalgar Square, and yet on a lovely quiet road away from all the crowds
- the people who work at the hotel who are friendly, courteous and helfpul
- the restaurants; although we didn't try the afternoon tea which looked wonderful, we did have a pre-theatre dinner in the Northall restaurant which was perfect and very good value at GBP30 per head for three courses and a glass of champagne
- the facilities which include a great gym and spa and a hairdressing salon which my wife now tells me she intends to visit every time we stay
- the rooms which have lovely furnishings and the most comfortable bed
- the atmosphere; as soon as one walks through the door of the hotel it feels great to be back!

I have recommended this hotel to friends, clients and colleagues and they have all loved it. Luckily I have also managed to have this hotel placed on the list of recommended hotels by my firm so I can return on business next time I am in London.

If you do decide to visit London this would definitely be the hotel to stay at.",5,2013,08,28
143,A Sancuary,"This is hands down one of the best hotel rooms I have ever visited. It wasn't the largest, but it was one of the best designed and perfectly thought out rooms I have ever seen. The bathroom was stunning, and the room was so quiet you would never know you were in a big city - they even had an outlet specifically for American plugs! (Iphone & Ipad etc). There is a lovely florist downstairs which provides beautiful flowers for the room and throughout the hotel, such a nice touch! The staff at the desk, butlers, room service etc were all courteous and helpful (and funny!). The decor throughout is a very sleek hybrid of classic and contemporary, soothing without being boring and makes you feel ""Aaaaaah"" as soon as you walk through the doors after a busy day exploring the town. Bravo!",5,2013,08,27
143,World Class,"I spent three nights at the Corinthia over Bank Holiday weekend and I have to say it was exceptional!. I've stayed in other 5 star hotels in London and worldwide and this compares very well. The common areas and the rooms are luxuriously modern, the quality of the latter being especially appreciated for three nights. It's location is superb and close to sights and theatreland. I had both breakfast and dinner there and both were very good and the pre theatre menus offer an excellent deal. Finally the staff were superb and set the tone really well, attentive when needed but not intrusive or stuffy. A great great hotel",5,2013,08,27
143,One of the best places we have stayed,"We stayed at the Corinthia Hotel last weekend for a 3 night stay. This was easily one of the nicest hotels we have stayed. The service was first class, and they even escort you to your room at check-in.
The room was really nice, but the bathroom was the best feature! Heated floors, heated towel rack, tv by the bathtub and an amazing rain shower......I was in heaven! The bed was also very comfortable and they leave a little box of chocolate and a bottle of water for you at turndown service. Another nice touch was the EU and US outlets in the room. A nice touch if you only bring one power converter with you. Not that we spent a ton of time in the room, but I would have loved to have spent more time just relaxing there. 
The afternoon tea is a MUST and the lobby area is just gorgeous! We also had drinks at the bar a few nights and the service was excellent. The server even remember the wine I had ordered 2 nights prior! Oh, and they have the best green olives I have ever tasted! :-)
We didn't have time to visit the spa, but I can only imagine it's amazing! I would love to stay at this hotel again. Well done!",5,2013,08,26
143,Easily the best hotel I have ever stayed in.,"I spent 5 days at the Corinthia - my first time to London - and all I can say is, ""it's perfect.""

From the moment we checked in, I found the service unparalleled.  Our room wasn't ready, so they invited us to coffee in the lobby.  When our rooms were ready, our bags were already in our room.

The room was plush, luxurious and refined.  I had a nice room with a French balcony looking out onto the courtyard.  The room was absolutely serene.  Perfect after a busy day.  The bed was plush and cosy. The bathroom was the ultimate.  Nicely heated marble floor, and beautiful spa tub.  I was sad to check out!

The location can't be beat.  Steps away from Trafalgar Square and from the Embankment Station.  Minutes from the hustle and bustle, the Corinthia is a little oasis.",5,2013,08,25
143,Don't stay anywhere else!,"We stayed here for 2 nights and absolutely loved it. We had booked a deluxe room but on arrival we were upgraded to an executive room as our allocated room wasn't ready.  The whole hotel just oozes quality and the staff are first rate. We were personally escorted to our room - no finding your own way - a nice touch. Our bathroom was amazing complete with tv to watch while you relax in the bath.  The walk in shower with a choice of rainwater overhead shower or wall mounted shower was the best we'd ever experienced. Quality selection of toiletries are provided as well as slippers and dressing gowns.

The in room coffee machine was simple to use and dispensed excellent coffee. Soundproofing is first rate - we didn't hear any noise whatsoever. Aircon kept the room at a comfortable temperature.  They seem to have thought of everything.

The location is excellent, extremely close to Embankment tube and a comfortable stroll across the bridge to the vibrant South bank. 

We didn't have enough time to use the spa but it looked wonderful and we'll certainly make time for it on our next visit. 

We'll definitely chose this hotel  again.  First rate.",5,2013,08,25
143,2nd stay also outstanding,"I recently had my second stay at the Corinthia in London.  After many different hotels in many different cities, I can say that my experience with the Corinthia in London has been by far the best, but also generally the most expensive on a per night basis.  If you appreciate pampering and attention to detail in accommodations, then you will  likely find the Corinthia worth the investment.  I also appreciate that they do not add fee upon fee, but rather services like internet access are included in the overall price.  Generally speaking the rooms are spacious with foyer and large bathroom.   The bathrooms in particular with heated floors and outstanding appliances lend a feeling of luxury.  Usually after travel I am happy to return home to my own bed, but I must admit the bed in the Corinthia is extremely comfortable and better than my own.  The gym is outstanding and likely exceeds what your fitness club at home has to offer.   The room is essentially made-up twice per day.  Stop in at the hotel bar for a late night glass of wine and dessert - fabulous.  Staff go out of their way to meet your every need.  The hotel is ideally located about a block from Trafalgar Square and within walking distance of Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abby and other sites.",5,2013,08,25
143,Fabulous in every way,"My husband took me to the Corinthia for a birthday and anniversary treat. I loved it. He booked a ‘Stay Sunday, Spa Monday’ package.

The rooms are amazing. My husband asked for an upgrade as it was a special occasion, which they did with no problem. The room was very big for a London hotel (maybe because of the upgrade) and very stylishly decorated. We had a very large bathroom and walk in wardrobe in addition to a big bedroom. There was a chocolate cake (very nice!) in the room with congratulations written on it.  There are also loads of lovely Espa products to use. 

We ate in the restaurant that evening, which was very good. The only downside was that the man next to us was a pretentious idiot who kept sending his food back without being specific about why, but that’s not the hotel’s fault obviously. They dealt with him extremely well. 

The breakfast was fabulous. It’s a buffet but beautifully done. We did a bit of celebrity spotting while there and laughed at the amount of plastic surgery that some of the other guests had had done. 

On the Monday we went to the spa, which is fabulous. As part of our package we both had a massage, which was very good. 

I loved the Corinthia. I’m lucky enough to have stayed in some very good hotels and as a result it is rare for me not to have anything negative to say, but I really don’t. Everything about it was fantastic. I hope to go back soon.",5,2013,08,23
143,Excellent Stay; Enchanting Afternoon Tea,"This is truly an exceptional hotel. It is a beautiful property that is well-located for tourists in London. The staff were especially attentive and courteous -- from the front desk and bell desk to housekeeping, all were welcoming. Rene at the bell desk was a stand-out -- he brought up our bags and took the time to explain the main features of the wonderfully appointed room. We felt very well taken care of during our entire stay. 

We stayed in a deluxe room, which was of an adequate size (small by American standards but it was okay for two people). The bathroom was stunning. The bed was comfortable and the other amenities in the room (Nespresso machine, bottled water, fruit, chocolates in the evening, etc.) were nice. The media area also had outlets for US and EU -- very useful, especially because we only brought one adaptor with us. Housekeeping was also able to provide a hair straightener and curling iron, if needed.

We enjoyed a traditional afternoon tea in the Lobby Lounge. Such a special experience and highly recommended. The Lobby Lounge is a beautiful and elegant setting and we lingered there for quite a while, enjoying the delicious tea and assorted treats (the scones and sweet cakes were especially wonderful). Again, the service here was outstanding, and we felt very pampered.

One reason I chose this hotel was its proximity to some of the main tourist attractions. We were next to the Thames and within easy walking distance to Trafalgar Square, Westminster Abbey/Big Ben and the London Eye. The tube, boat and train stations (Embankment and Charing Cross) were right across the street and a pedestrian bridge made for a nice walk to the other side of the Thames. 

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and plan to return on future trips to London.",5,2013,08,22
143,Fabulous!,"Stayed at this hotel a few months ago and I can honestly say this is one of the most beautiful hotels in London, although location wasn't that spectacular this is most certainly a little gem!
Tip - Also had a lovely courtyard with fireplaces for the smokers out there ;-)",5,2013,08,21
143,Fabulous!,I can not fault this hotel at all. From check in until check out the service was outstanding. The hotel-just wow. So modern and central. Definitely stay here. No doubt the best hotel we have ever stayed at! Thank you Corinthia ,5,2013,08,21
143,Excellent excellent excellent!,"Just back from a Sunday night spa break at this hotel.  This is an absolutely exceptional hotel in London and incredible value for money.  The rooms are as good as any I have experienced in five star locations abroad including the four seasons chain.  

Wonderful spa, breakfast, interiors, location, staff.

Will definitely be first choice for any future London nights away.",5,2013,08,20
143,Top notch in a very central location,"Outstanding room/suite at the Corinthia.
Very close to Trafalgar Sq and the Westminister Canal piers and Victoria Station
Room had a large walk in closet and safe.  Safe got jammed on us after we put a ipad in it.  Security got it open within 15 minutes.
Spacious bathrooms with a wonderful walkin shower with a large rain head.
Loved the lounge and the five star dinning.
Good spot to watch for celebrities.
Also, across the street from Monty Python theatre. lol",4,2013,08,19
143,My Favorite Place to Stay,"My husband once again had to travel to London for business & I tag along to tour & shop. There is NO hesitation on my part when asked if I wouldnt mind staying at the Corinthia. This last trip makes it our 4th time staying & I would never want to stay anywhere else. From the minute you get out of the cab you are greeted with service and smiles unlike anyother. We arrived on Thursday morning and our room was ready for us, our luggage was taken up to our room almost immediately. 
We had a room on the 6th floor facing the atrium window below, I would have liked to have seen the view of Trafalgar, but the peacefulness was something I appreciated after a long day out on the city.The room also had a balcony, albeit small but just enough to wake up to and open the doors to let the early morning air and sunshine come in. 
Our room was clean and immaculate to details. Every morning we received a morning paper and at night our bed was turned down with our slippers, some fresh fruit and a small box of chocolate to end our day. 
The details that this hotel provides makes one feel very special in being a guest. 
We never tried the afternoon tea, or the restaurants since between work & taking in the sites of the city, we were out first thing in the morning and back at night just in time for a dinner. 
The beds are comfortable, with the softest of linens, pillows. The bathrooms have heated floors,  a rain shower, a bidet, a tub with a TV, and toiletries from the ESPA spa. There is a small fridge in the room stocked with the goodies that will set you back some. But there is a complimentary set of teas and nespresso coffees for you to use. 
The staff is very friendly, and accomodating, helpful in any way possible. 
The hotel is located a stones throw from Trafalgar Square, you can walk to Piccadilly, to Leicester Square, there is a Tesco store on the corner. You also have the convenience of using the Charring Cross Station and the Embankment line directly across from the back entrance of the hotel. If you are lucky enough to get a room with a view, you can see Trafalgar Square from the hotel as well.
The is nothing more I can say about this hotel. It is perfectly located and the service is excellent all around. I truly cannot wait to go back to London and stay at my favorite place again.",5,2013,08,19
143,Afternoon tea experience- sublime,"My partner booked for us to go for afternoon tea for my birthday last weekend. The building is impressive and stylish, and the chairs and tables lovely and intimate.
We were greeted in a friendly and efficient manner and given a choice of tables, we opted to overlook the courtyard.
The service was fantastic, we opted for a champagne tea and we had champagne and sandwiches followed by scones, then cakes and tea.
The smoked chicken sandwich was probably the best sandwich I have ever had and the stand outs in the pastries were the pimms slice complete with tiny cucumber balls, and the pink champagne and lychee granite. Every component was explained to us by the staff in detail and they also bought out a mini Victoria sandwich with a chocolate plaque iced with happy birthday. Later on the manager stopped and asked me if I was having a nice birthday and what I was doing with the rest of our day.
We weren't hurried, it was relaxing and indulgent and I would thoroughly recommend the Corinthia for afternoon tea. The staff are superb and the food matches them.",4,2013,08,19
143,"Sublime property, but with some problems","This property is one of the most beautiful anywhere, and it is decorated to perfection. 
Service errors and problems with facilities in our room were problematic and proved a major distraction. Food and amenities, including the spa, are cutting edge and truly world class. Management's responsiveness and attentiveness were excellent. ",3,2013,08,18
143,"I live in London, this is as good as it gets, I know.","I have stayed at The Corinthia twice, indulged in its spa and eat, drink and meet friends and clients there often. Set in the heart of London overlooking the Thames, its great for tourists and 
Londoners alike. 

The service is excellent, you wont get better in Britain. The attention to detail is second to none - be it complimentary sushi with your cocktail or a special bottle of Lauren Perrier and hand 
made chocolates in your room for your birthday, they rise to every request and occasion.

The rooms are slick and indulgent and by London standards, as spacious as you'll find. The spa, is the best in the city - offering multiple mineral pools, relaxation and pamper rooms, endless complimentary healthy snacks, cooled waters, reading material and an indulgent changing facility for after. 

The restaurants too, are fantastic and regularly frequented by stars visiting the city. In particular, I love their afternoon tea. Set under a million pound chandelier, its a 'best of British' high tea, true to traditional flavours and customs but with modern twists, concoctions and culinary delights to set it apart form some of the stuffier and overpriced competition. If you can't afford a room for the night, then I would highly recommend an afternoon visit for the cake alone. 

Really rate The Corinthia and thrilled to have it on my doorstep.",5,2013,08,18
143,Beautiful hotel. Perfect Location.,"This is a great hotel in a perfect location. We were spending a long weekend away without the children and wanted to be ""grown-up"". The Corinthia was the perfect choice. We both travel to london on business and stay at business hotels but wanted something a bit more luxurious for just the two of us. The room decor, bathrooms, bed linens, and bath amenities made us feel as if we were far away on an exotic holiday. My husband especially enjoyed the rain shower which could be better described as a torrential waterfall. I particularly enjoyed watching the tv in the deep tub. The bed was lovely and comfortable which allowed us the luxury of a much needed lie in every morning. Every member of staff we encountered were attentive, knowledgeable and overall just brilliant. 

We only ate one meal in the hotel - breakfast buffet. Not up to the standards we have experienced when abroad but very very good for UK. 
We also did not have time to experience the Spa. but will aim for that during our next visit.

The hotel is located 100yards from the river and embankment tube station and 2 minute walk to trafalgar square. Exceedingly convenient.

Audio and electronic systems were amazing. Remember to bring your connector cable for your ipad/ipod to connect your music - just awesome.

The flowers in the lobby were beautiful.

Overall the hotel and staff were not over pretentious or in your face stuffy. Just brilliant 5star service all the way.",5,2013,08,18
143,Favourite hotel in London,"After staying in many hotels/apartments in London I decided to treat my girlfriend on our one year anniversary. I have to say the service was superb, our upgrade was fantastic and the suite more than blew us away. I could not speak more highly of this hotel and would recommend staying here to anyone looking for a special time! ",5,2013,08,17
143,Truely awesome except for dress down seaweed chocolate,"This is up there with 1898 and fourseasons hong kong - I.e  its brilliant.
Absolutely perfect in every way. 

Superb room. Excellent service and great pool.

The location is awesome. 

I want to live there. ",5,2013,08,14
143,"Great hotel, excellent location","This is a great hotel in a great location. We stayed there during a long weekend trip to London and would not hesitate to recommend it. Staff are very attentive - even during a pre-Bafta awards party when they arranged a taxi for us ahead of a massive group of waiting celebrities! 

If I was to be really picky I would say the room had 20% less light than what it should have had (although we had a balcony with an internal garden view) and one night they gave us seaweed chocolate..... only complaints I have....

Price tag I guess it's something we have to live with for location and quality of the hotel.",5,2013,08,14
143,Our First Encounter....,"First, I have to share that this trip is a combination of my anniversary and my sons engagement party which ends up in South Africa.
 Secondly, I must share I have been like a CSI agent  with respect to researching every 5 star hotel in and about London. 

So I begin with my reservation as the first phase of my review, and will end in August with my actually onsite review.
Calling as the hotel suggest to modify check ins and check outs due to flight schedules etc, was brought to my attention, when I was booking the car service from the hotel. Details were noted, and Alda ( I hope I spell his name correctly) was engaging and personable, and continued to provide the 5 star customer service throughout my inquiries. 

For me the art of creating a ""Raving Fan"" for ones company is to consistently seek to achieve  excellence in the services you provide. Alda did just this.

Final review August 29th! Case closed then!

Looking forward to our arrival.
DYB",5,2013,08,14
143,"Excellent. Takes the scruffy, dark, oppressive out of London","The Corinthia is generous, airy and light with large public spaces, rooms and windows. It exudes a European, almost Mediterranean atmosphere - including the staff - and doesn't make me feel like being in London. The rooms and bathes are large with great contemporary design and details like a TV over the bathtub. Super. It is the first hotel in this city I enter and leave with a really good feeling. The open patio is particularly nice for smoking a cigar. The longterm stay rate is attractive, as are the prices for food and drink.",5,2013,08,14
143,Five Stars *****,"For my 30th I was treated to a weekend at the Corinthia, WOW! What an experience it is, the best hotel I've ever stayed in by far. Quality everything; welcome, service, room, food, drinks & magnificent health spa (especially the steam room). A weekend of bests. Best hotel experience, best black pudding at breakfast, best seabass for dinner, best GnT from the bar. Not even sharing the hotel with the Man Utd squad could put a dampener on things. The Corinthia is a must.",5,2013,08,14
143,BY FAR the best hotel in London.,"Stayed at a lot of 5* hotels in London and this is BY FAR the best hotel in town.  Truly amazing property and superb management.  Wish there was something as good in NYC (been to the Mandarin, the Four Seasons, the Plaza and so on, but the Corinthia in London is in its own league).",5,2013,08,13
143,Amazing one night stay!,"After a very unpleasant stay at the Lanesborough, we decided to try this hotel for 1 night. We were amazed by the service, the room design and cleanliness, the food and location. We will definitely stay there during our next trip.",5,2013,08,12
143,Perfection,"I started off my honeymoon at the Corinthia and can't fault it at all. It was absolutely perfect! The service was amazing, breakfast was amazing, afternoon tea was magical! It is located near main attractions so we didn't have to walk far to get to places and being close to the station was good too. I will definitely come back to the Corinthia. I'd love to thank the staff for making our honeymoon so comfortable and special.",5,2013,08,12
143,Great for Vacation - Not so great for Work,"I travel for work and live out of five star hotels while on the road... So, my standards and critics are usually MUCH higher when I'm on business, than on vacation. All the many, little details really matter to me, and I'm not as care-free about them as I am when I'm relaxed and on vacation.
I've stayed at this hotel on business many times in the last few years, and although it isn't my favorite London hotel, it's definitely a favorite (and for good reason) for many people I know.  The breakfast is gorgeous and well worth having it included in your rate. The restaurants and bars within the hotel are Excellent.  The service can be hit or miss sometimes (depending on which sales rep or butler you are working with), but overall most people would say that the general service (i.e. reception, concierge, restaurant staff, housekeeping, etc.) is excellent. The location is not my personal favorite, but it's located near many restaurant & shopping options, plus easy and fun walking distance to lots of site-seeing.  But, they seem to always have a major event happening every time I stay there, which causes ALL the surrounding streets to be completely closed. This is extremely inconvenient when you need to get to the airport, or just in/out of the hotel for meetings/events. The internet and cell phone service is horrific in many of the rooms, which is extremely inconvenient if you're there on business.  They always say that they've fixed the issues (some reps will even say that they've never even heard of this issue before!), but I've continued to experience these problems in certain rooms. If you're there on business, make sure you INSIST on getting a room that has good cell service!  Early fire alarm drills are extremely inconvenient (ask if they have any scheduled during your stay!), and on a few occasions the real-deal fire alarm has been the final straw for some of my clients deciding never to stay there again.  Another annoying detail is that they haven't thought through the need for power and phone at the desk, for working guests.  And, you're lucky if you find a plug by your bed for charging your phone overnight - for the workaholics that are always on call :)
If you're staying for vacation, you probably wouldn't notice any of my cons... even I would probably have a stellar review if weren't for the work-related annoyances.",4,2013,08,12
143,"Fantastic location - wonderful, wonderful hotel","The Corinthia is immaculately presented and located so centrally that you will not need to buy a travelcard for many London attractions - not that I expect many of its guests use public transport. It is an expensive, luxury hotel but London, like most capital cities, is not embossed with a large value for money stamp so £ for £ it is a great choice. The staff are impeccably trained with an eye for detail and an unostentatious but professional 'nothing-could-be-too-much-trouble' attitude.

Our rooms were spacious, wardrobes were in the hall so the whole room is useable space. It's a sign of a good hotel in my opinion if you can hardly hear the door being knocked and there was certainly no sound from anywhere once the thick oak door was closed. Bathroom perfect and bath almost so big that you struggle to stay in one place (and I'm not short). The floors and mirrors are heated, naturally, and the air-con is in permanent whisper mode it seems. We were in the most basic of rooms and are fairly fussy travellers but there was nothing to complain about at all. 

The breakfast was superb and (rarely do we do this but...) the hotel restaurant in the evening was delightful too, with an atmosphere that most in-house eateries lack. In particular the man in the suit at breakfast runs the most impressive service I've seen in a hotel - for example, the temperature of the berries are frequently checked and although there is a buffet, staff always ask if you would like a refill of juice/fruit/bread. Everything was cooked to perfection and presented beautifully.

The pool is hardly suitable for an intensive exercise regime but who needs that after walking around London all day? I didn't try out the gym but I'm sure it would be impressive.  To help put the hotel ESPA area into context, the changing rooms for the thermal pool/swimming pool have daybeds, the steam room has pods with individual cool showers and there are sleep pods should one feel the bed in their room to uncomfortable (as if). Children are allowed in the spa area and swimming pool but at restricted time - timings not ideal for us but we worked around it. These were 1100-1230 and 1500-1630 which means cutting into too much daytime for us but I'm sure it would suit people with younger children - ours are 4 and 8 with pretty good stamina.

I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone - business, pleasure, families or anyone for that matter would feel welcome here. We will undoubtedly be back - I don't always recommend small hotels but this establishment has enough rooms I'm sure we would always be able to squeeze in somewhere. Even if you decide to stay elsewhere - I'd call in for afternoon tea. We missed out here but it looked impressive. Five stars indeed.",5,2013,08,11
143,Best five-star in London hands-down,"Having stayed in quite a few five star properties in London (and all over the world), our recent stay at the Corinthia puts it at the very top. Beautiful hotel, excellent staff, gorgeous spa, and an almost unbeatable location (quiet, yet in walking distance to numerous tourist attractions.",5,2013,08,11
143,Must eat at The Northall restaurant on site,"If you can afford to stay here, you can definitely afford to eat in the restaurant, and you must not miss this opportunity to sample fine dining at its best with top 5 star service equal to any other in London.........
If you are a mere mortal who cannot afford too much, go to TopTable and get the 3 courses for £28 deal, (or 2 for £25) so that you can enjoy exquisite food and service without paying too much for it.
Our party last week had a thoroughly perfect experience for Saturday lunch. We started in the bar whilst waiting for the rest of the party, which was lovely and quiet, and then went through to the restaurant.
I wouldn't say it is very romantic, but it is clean and welcoming.
Then the food was served and it was out of this world!
Some of us had the salmon starter (half a big plate full and capers sprinkled - divine), some had the tuna carpaccio or mackeral tartar (both good)........there was plenty of choice from the set menu. 
Mains were Minute steak (more like a Sirloin - and cooked to perfection) / burgers that could rival the best joints in the USA - and not for the faint-hearted / roasted lemon sole - mouth watering and delicious.
And then the desserts (which we didn't have to have, but it would have been rude not to!) - the dark chocolate sorbet with white mousse was to die for / the raspberry pavlova was amazing / the rice pudding heavenly.......
The service was discreet and everyone was very helpful and patient.
What a wonderful treat - when we can afford to go again, we will make any excuse to dine there again!!
Thanks all.",5,2013,08,11
143,Best. Hotel. Ever.,"I simply cannot express my admiration for this hotel's staff or my wonderment at the property. It is by far the singular travel experience I have ever had. From the moment we checked in to the time we loaded our bags into the airport transfer, we were treated like personal guests at someone's home. 

Where to start? On check-in, a tour of the property by the registrar. The room was set up with soft music, mood lighting, flowers on the bed, wonderful chocolates on the pillow. Every night, bottles of water and fresh fruit on turn-down. Huge en-suite bath with tub, separate Roman shower with waterfall, 2 sinks, heated floors. Walk-in closet. We were not far from the elevator but I heard nary a peep through any wall or door the entire stay. It literally felt like we were alone in our own private estate. 

Did I mention complimentary wi-fi? Say whaaaat? I paid $12.95 for wi-fi for one lousy night at an airport hotel the night before we left. The managers of this luxury of luxury properties know it's pricey to stay, but they do NOT try to soak every last shilling out of their guests just because they 'can'. The attitude of the staff from the first second you enter is ""what can we do to make this the most pleasant stay you've ever had?"" And they do. 

We had breakfast one day on the property, which was nicely laid out. Afternoon tea was an absolute highlight and my wife can't wait to come back again for tea. Want more sandwiches? More pastry? Another pot of tea? Complimentary. So don't be shy about asking. 

The property itself is in the best possible location - a very safe, lovely area right on the West bank of the Thames, across the bridge from the London Eye. A five minute walk to Big Ben, ten minutes to Westminster Abbey, 15 minutes to Buckingham. Ten minute walk to the theater district and Covent Garden. And the Embankment underground station is literally out your front door, a 2-minute walk. 

I was able to book this property on a 'stay two nights, get the third free' promotion. Don't know how long that will be available, but if I can never get that deal again, I'll just squirrel away a little more in advance of my trip and spend it on the Corinthia. We had five magical days in London and this hotel was the locus from which everything developed. Thank you, Corinthia staff!!!",5,2013,08,10
143,Beautiful hotel & exceptional staff,"I just returned from a 6 day work conference in London, where we stayed at the Corinthia Hotel.  The hotel is absolutely beautiful and at one of the best locations in London.  We were able to walk everywhere.  However, the best thing was not the beautiful rooms, wonderful food or relaxing spa...it was the staff.  They went above and beyond to help us. From helping us to set up a Global Town Hall internet broadcast, to running out late to find us 50 bags of ""crisps"" because our meetings ran late, they had the best customer service I have ever experienced.",5,2013,08,10
143,Coriinthia London - Perfection!,"We stayed at the Corinthia from 8-4 to 8-9. This hotel is sheer perfection. From the second you enter the spectacular lobby to the the time you check out, the service will amaze you. We had a deluxe king room on the top floor. The room was large with a walk in closet and oversized marble bathroom...complete with heated floors and the best shower EVER! The public spaces are elegant but not overdone...just tasteful. The restaurants are wonderful. Have tea in the lobby under the beautiful chandelier. 
The Espa spa is equally as beautiful as the rest of the hotel. Treat yourself to a service...you wont regret it. 
Our room was turned down nightly with boxed chocolates, mood lighting and bottled water left by the bed side table. 
Amenities include robes, slippers, Frette towels and Pratesi bedding. extra special touches include peaches and apples left in the room, ice filled buckets each night, TV in the bathroom, bedside lighting controls for every part of the room/foyer/bathroom. 
The hotel sparkles with cleanliness all around...this is so important for most travelers! Gorgeous artwork and sculptures are everywhere....even the elevator doors are beautiful. 
I could go on about this hotel for days, but you have to experience the Corinthia to really understand why its ranked so highly among London hotels. Everyone there made our trip to London truly unforgettable. I must mention the location as well... walking distance to the London Eye and the Thames, Buckingham Palace, The Strand (Theaters), Trafalgar Square, all the best shopping and museums, Underground, etc!",5,2013,08,09
143,First Class - traveller with children,"I have visited this hotel quite a few times now & feel its about time to write a review as this hotel most certainly deserves one.

The moment I enter this hotel, the beautiful decor never fails to leave me awe-struck. The doormen are friendly and check in is always prompt and professional. 

As I mentioned in the title of this review, on our most recent visit we travelled with our children to bring them to see the sights. We arrived far earlier than check-in but this was not a problem, the lady behind the desk said she would have our room made for us and we were treated to coffee's & cakes whilst we waited for a short while. We were then shown to our executive twin room overlooking the Courtyard which was perfect for our requirements. The children had surprises left for them on the bed & appropriately sized slippers & robes were a cute touch. 

The room was immaculate and perfectly appointed. I have stayed in varying room types and have never been disappointed yet. 

I had need to speak to concierge and they kindly arranged some tickets for us. This service was really helpful and straight-forward.

We have visited the bar & both restaurants on other occasions and the service/food & drinks has been exemplary.

We took our children down to the spa for a swim in their allocated slot. The place was stunning, I will definitely return for a child free treatment.  Staff were friendly and helpful.

All in all, another great stay at the Corinthia.

This hotel is very new in terms of the London luxury hotel scene. It has to compete with hotels that have been around for a several years.  In my opinion this hotel already outshines the likes of Claridges, The Dorchester, The Mandarin Oriental etc.  This is due to the level of service that this hotel offers and in what is in the most stunning building that has been so beautifully and tastefully appointed. This hotel grows on me each time I come.  Definitely not one to be missed.",5,2013,08,07
143,Best hotel in London!,"I have stayed in many luxury hotels in London and Corinthia is by far the best.  The rooms are beautifully designed.  I was staying in a deluxe junior suite and it had a very large bathroom and dressing room, although the room itself was somewhat small.  The sound insulation from the door is not great, and I could at times hear people going in and out of the room next to mine.  However, aside from noises from the entrance, it was quiet.  The service was impeccable at the hotel.  We had a few minor issues at the restaurants, but the staff was courteous and quick to address our concerns.  This is truly a 5-star hotel and I will definitely return.",5,2013,08,06
143,Wonderful Hotel,"My pregnant wife, daughter and I stayed here for several days October 2012. When we first arrived (it's an easy train ride from the airport to a stop just outside the hotel), we were brought to a room that was on the outside of the building and at the time met our needs. Unfortunately, the hotel was quite busy and oddly enough wasn't able to find an extra pillow for my daughters bed in the room. After mentioning the issue to the hotel manager (I apologize but I lost his card), he immediately asked what the hotel could do to make up for the issue. Although we never asked for anything, we were immediately upgraded to a courtyard suite, which obviously was much larger and had more than enough room to meet our needs. The manager also offered dinner at the hotel for my family. Oddly enough, my wife asked if instead of dinner, we could have the hotel clean our clothes (which while on a 2 week Europe trip is almost essential). Management showed no hesitation in having our clothes cleaned (they actually came back to our room in boxes). At one point during our stay, I have no idea how the manager knew whom I was, but he approached me while in the lobby, apologized for the inconvenience incurred when checking into our first room and mentioned to not hesitate in calling him for any additional needs.

Both rooms definitely had more character than any of the hotels I've stayed at before. Wonderful bathrooms and shower/soap products (which were actually larger in size in the suite we were upgraded to). Having an interior room was definitely more quiet than the outside room.

Hotel location is perfect. Over the pedestrian bridge across from the hotel was the London Eye, 1/2 mile in one direction you were at Big Ben and Parliament the other you were at the National Museum. A short tube ride away was probably some of the best shopping areas I've ever seen.

Service at the hotel was of course top notch. I even enjoyed the bellman mocking my short run in the rain after returning only 2 minutes from leaving the hotel. While not being able to visit the bar there, we did have breakfast and tea while at the hotel (the tea area was wonderful with their selections). The spa at the hotel definitely had character also. It's in the ""basement"" several levels below the hotel. One pool with 2 very large jacuzzis, a steam room and a sauna. Children were allowed to use the facility after certain hours (3pm I believe).

Overall, great hotel, wonderful service, and my compliments to hotel management for going out of the way to address a minor issue to begin our stay at their hotel. We'll definitely chose the Corinthia for our next hotel stay in London.",5,2013,08,05
143,"Wonderful Hotel, truly a luxury","My husband and I had just spent 7 days on The Queen Mary II Trans-Atlantic Crossing.  We had been on many wonderful cruises and we excited to go on Cunards flagship.  We had been told how luxurious the ship was, how the food was gourmet and the service was first rate. We were so disappointed in the ship that when we entered the Corinthia Hotel, I said to my husband this is what I imagined what the ship would look like, it is very beautiful and everyone was so welcoming.  The room is beautiful with a bathroom with a large bath tub with a television you can watch on the wall.",4,2013,08,05
143,"The best hotel in london,Luxury, comfort and stylish.","We stayed for 1 night, as we were meeting family who had travelled from abroad.
We have stayed in many other hotels in London, but would i stay in them now that i have found the Corinthia, No...,
From the moment that we arrived a warm welcome, from the doormen, and all the staff were so attentive and nothing was too much trouble.
The amazing decor, high celings and amazing centre lights.
Spotlessy clean everywhere.
We were shown our room and had an explanation of how things worked.The room was so sumptious, lovely furnishings and decorated to a high standard, under floor heating in the bathroom, the walk in dressing room,mood lighting, a tv in the bathroom, and a power shower that was like a monsoon, if ive died and gone to heaven i would be happy,, everything was just perfect..
The food at breakfast was very good, we had payed for ours at time of booking,plenty to choose from and caters for all tastes.
Only 1 minor niggle, and i mean minor, when we returned on the saturday evening after our meal out, we had drinks and i wanted a coffee, but i was surpised to be told that the coffee machine had been turned off, but if i had gone to my room i could order it from room service, but still i didnt let that dismay me at all, cant wait to return.",5,2013,08,05
143,A bit meh!,"I stayed here for business in May 2013. I have stayed in quite a few 5* hotels for business. This was unremarkable. Nothing bad, nothing great. It was central so that was good. Price was ok, not value for money.
I had the room for physically challenged - plus was a lot of room around the bed - downside was the bathroom being kitted out not necessarily as I needed. 
Passages were VERY LONG. Check in took about 20 minutes when in front of the desk clerk which is not good enough. Then got to the room after a LONG WALK along the passages. Room key did not work. Hence long walk back to reception and back again to room. 

Check out was quick. I am sure the hotel is fine, I did not have a memorable experience though.",3,2013,08,05
143,Wonderful afternoon tea,"I had afternoon tea with the girls here and it was a lovely afternoon. No time pressure on the table, plenty of food and great service. I haven't stayed but my discerning friends advise me the rooms are lovely. I'd love to go back. ",5,2013,08,04
143,Ahhhh Corinthia... Is this Heaven?,"From the moment you step in to this hotel you know you are somewhere special... This is not just a hotel, its a destination. This hotel just gets it so right, the overwhelmingly elegant lobby, jaw dropping spa, impeccable service and beautiful rooms all ensure you will never want to leave. 

I visit London to stay at the Corinthia, not the other way round. I have stayed 5 times this year and stayed in both suites and standard rooms each and everyone has blown me away. 

Both restaurants serve excellent food in a beautiful setting, the seafood restaurant being particularly impressive. The piano bar is a fantastically atmospheric venue to enjoy a post dinner cocktail.

I have spent whole weekends in this hotel without leaving... This is possibly the only downside... if you want to explore London, although the hotel is in a perfect location, its MANY temptations may keep you from venturing outside!",5,2013,08,02
143,Another Amazing Stay!  Best of London!!,"2nd stay this year as good as the first.  Amazing decor, exceptional service, great food.  Make sure you at visit the thermal floor, its sooo relaxing.  True 5 Star service and facilities, if your thinking about staying somewhere else....don't.  Looking forward to our next trip.",5,2013,08,02
143,"Very, Very Good and a Few Niggles","We loved the flexible check-in/check-out times - so very civilised.  This starts the luxurious experience straight away without having to worry if you can get into your room early or try to negotiate a late checkout.  

Like so many others have commented, the public spaces and the rooms are beautifully decorated and appointed and are a feast for all the senses.  Lots of lovely little touches in the room that make it feel very homely.  Especially welcome were the heated bathroom floor and real windows that opened.  The staff are great, the food delicious, and the spa is heavenly.    

The niggles: 

1. The tables for two in Northall restaurant are ranged along a banquette that goes round two sides of the room.  Nothing wrong with that, but the tables are set sooooo close together that its more like you're eating at a communal table in a backpackers or a boarding school, not a luxury restaurant with prices to match.  

2.  The Lobby Lounge never got warm enough to enjoy sitting in although its a beautiful space.  Whatever heat there is, immediately gets sucked out every few moments by the two sets of entrance doors (one at either end of the lounge), or by people going out to the courtyard (to have a smoke) via the several doors around the courtyard.  The hotel should crank up the heating in the Lobby, put in some heating air curtains, or have some double-door arrangements so it stays warm enough to enjoy.  We'd have used the lounge more if it had been a comfortable temperature to have had snacks, afternoon tea, etc so this may apply to others and could be costing the hotel lost revenue.

3.  No staff in the Thermal Floor meant having to leave early when other users were behaving badly, splashing water on our dry robes/towels, and talking/laughing very loudly.  We don't blame the hotel for others' behaviour but if a staff member had been there to ask them to tone it down, it would have been much nicer all round.

Apart from those niggles, we had a wonderful experience and would definitely stay there again.",4,2013,08,02
143,Briliant stay at Corinthia,"Everything was brilliant from the moment we walked in the door(and had an early check in) until we checked out.Friendliest staff ever,lovely rooms,great spa.Wednesday wine and our lunch at the Norhthall restaurant was probably the best meal we had in London,try the Ribeye!!We will definately be back",5,2013,07,31
143,Fantastic Hotel,What a beautiful hotel! Can't say enough about the Corinthia. It was our first time staying here and we can't wait to go back. Everything about the hotel is wonderful. The orchids in the lobby are beyond amazing. The room was fantastic....especially loved the heated ceramic tile bathroom floor. Can't wait to return!,5,2013,07,30
143,Amazing hotel - the best in London,"Everything about this hotel is amazing. Entrance lobby, guestrooms, spa and the staff are top notch. Nothing is too much trouble. Great value package Stay Sunday - Spa Monday. Ideal location for seeing the sights. Modern, immaculately clean, food is delicious. 
Have stayed 3 times now with another two visits planned this year.",5,2013,07,28
143,Weekends just don't get any better!,"This was just a quick pop up to London for some shopping and was the first time at the Corinthia.  What a great hotel, staff were so good, professional and welcoming.  We had to change the pillows owing to being allergic to feathers (probably should have informed them in advance and this was our error), but the staff just couldn't help us enough.  The room was spacious, clean and the shower had a rain head which provided an absolute deluge! This is probably the best hotel shower we have ever had!  
Certainly worth staying at this hotel, the standard is much higher then other 5 star hotels and having stayed at other top famous London hotels, we will certainly be returning to the Corinthia and it will be our first port of call.",5,2013,07,28
143,Simply Outstanding,"We cannot praise this hotel enough and it is the best hotel by far out of the many we have stayed in whilst in London.

Where to begin? It was our anniversary and front desk allocated us a fantastic room on arrival. We had complementary tea in the beautiful lobby bar while we waited for the spa treatment we had booked. The private spa suite was simply amazing and the perfect way to start our stay.

We thoroughly enjoyed all of the in-room dining experiences we had as the food always arrived hot and on time and was of excellent quality. No job was too small for the staff and when my wife broke her shoe the concierge happily arranged for these to be fixed and returned to the room on the same day.

The attention to detail in every area of the hotel was second to none.

We had a lovely lunch in the courtyard and a delicious evening meal in Massimo's restaurant.

The whole stay was a very memorable experience, we were made to feel special and we were sorry to leave.",5,2013,07,26
143,Over the top,"The location is awesome - near Trafalgar Square, Covent Garden, walk to Embankment and Charing Cross tube stops.  The space is luxurious and modern and spotless.  The staff goes beyond the call of duty to assist you - as they should as it is rather pricey.  I could not hear anything in my room - no sounds thru the vents or the rooms next door.  The gym is great and so is the thermal floor with the swimming pool, hot tub and steam and sauna rooms.  I only ate breakfast there but it was very extensive and delicious.  When I walked thru during the day, it was always busy and packed for high tea.  A great treat to stay in this fabulous hotel.",5,2013,07,25
143,"Best London hotel, worth every penny!","Having to travel to London constantly, this is the best hotel in the city! It's a great location with a tube stop right next to it, or walking distance to several monuments and shops. It is well decorated, the bathrooms include a tub and fantastic relaxing shower (optional rain shower), and everything is super clean and new. I recommend trying: the afternoon tea in the main lobby, breakfast, the bar pre-dinner, and room service if you want a midnight snack! But mostly recommend the spa--what a treat! The staff are fantastic and will make your stay more enjoyable; any complaint i've ever had has been addressed immediately. I have stayed in this hotel 4 times, once for business (one week), once with friends, and twice for a romantic getaway.I will definitely go back and recommend to everyone. It's worth money.",5,2013,07,25
143,amazing,"Stayed here for a business and well, where shall I start.
This hotel is immaculate and beautiful! Great location, rooms amazing and spotless clean, food delicious ( 10 points to the chef ) and the service outstanding!
Every single staff member was friendly and helpful and could not do better! A big thank you to everyone who made my stay unforgettable! 
I will be back soon!",5,2013,07,22
143,Recommended,"We stayed here in June, reserving two executive rooms. It is difficult to find any any fault with the Corinthia. The rooms were smaller than anticipated, with perhaps too much furniture for the size. We had difficulty finding a cab some nights; fortunately the underground station is across the street.

The quality, finish, newness and detailing of the rooms is impressive.The hallways and public areas are spotless and well decorated. Nothing is scratched, dirty or painted over. The mattresses were very comfortable. The buffet breakfast is excellent, and the setting (especially if you sit in the bright corner room) is great (I think the breakfast area is called the Northall). We did not eat in any of the restaurants for dinner, they looked mostly empty and not family friendly. We had both courtyard and street rooms. They were both quiet, the courtyard room had a small balcony.

In summary, they are doing everything right at this hotel. Lots of service staff everywhere; it is obvious that the expensive rates are going into staffing, upkeep and renovation.",5,2013,07,21
143,Beautiful Hotel-great location,"Stayed here for business in mid June.  The hotel is beautiful, the service is incredible, and the location could not be better.  Arrived from NY early 7AM and was promptly given complimentary tea while the desk made sure there was a room available at that time.  The entire hotel is beautiful, albeit very pricey. THe location is amazing.  5 minute walk to embankment or charing cross tube stations.  5 minute walk to Trafalgar and slightly longer to Big Ben. 
 I was able to stay because it was business, but it would be difficult for leisure.  Breakfast runs at 32 pounds.  However, if you can get away with it, stay here, highly recommended!  the spa is awesome!",5,2013,07,21
143,Amazing hotel,"Fantastic place to stay. Great location near Trafalgar Square. Large rooms. Amazing service. The best and friendliest staff I have ever come across. Especially made nice as Hugh Jackman and Nicholas Cage are also staying here and on the same floor as us.

We have been in Europe for 4 weeks now and this is by far the best place we have stayed. Highly recommended and will be sure to return here when we come back to London.",5,2013,07,19
143,When only the best will do,"I brought my mother to stay in June for her 82nd birthday and we were blown away by this lovely hotel. Specifically: it is very beautiful and stylish in design; the rooms are appointed thoughtfully to take care of guests' needs/wants and hugely comfortable, I wanted to take up residence in the rainshower! The service is sublime throughout - everyone we encountered was courteous, smiling, informed, helpful and seemed genuinely happy and proud of their jobs (very unBritish!) The spa is stunning (Pennyhill Park meets Dolder Grand, Zurich) and the delightful Nichola runs this operation with such charm; the breakfast is the best I've had in the UK - and even includes Char Siu buns for those who can't wait to get to (walkable) Chinatown for a dim sum fix!  Housekeeping is spot on - (ohhhh so under-appreciated and so crucial). Afternoon tea under the incredible Baccarat light sculpture is a joy with a, worth noting, very good gluten free option - just ask when you book. In conclusion, we enjoyed our stay such that we didn't want to leave and only managed to winkle ourselves out by assuring each other that we would come back again soon.  So yesterday we had a festive lobster and chips (yum) at The Northall restaurant and on the weekend I'm back in for afternoon tea and I have my beady eye on a rose and lychee martini at The Northall bar too! Clearly I've become addicted but I've been waiting a long time to find somewhere in London this good.  I cannot praise The Corinthia highly enough, they've got all aspects of a 5* hotel just right and they make it look effortless, which I know takes a huge amount of effort. ",5,2013,07,18
143,Fantastic hotel,"The hotel is in a perfect location, across the road from a tube station, right by the river and close to Horse Guards Parade. It is a lovely building and all the staff were very courteous and attentive. Booking in was easy, we had prepaid and arranged for check out at 14:00 the next day, unfortunately we just had one night. We were upgraded to an executive room which was fitted out to a very high standard with a large bed, dining table and a fantastic bathroom with large separate rainfall shower. It was very hot but the air conditioning worked extremely well keeping a nice cool temperature. There appeared to be a lot of staff on duty at all times who all had a smile. Breakfast was very good, again lots of staff who were very pleasant and efficient but not in your face. Because of the late check out we could freshen up in the room after our morning sight seeing in the heat. When we arrived home we realised we had left something in the room, a phone call to the hotel explaining what we had left was soon followed by a return call from Aneta Jagielo the housekeeping co-ordinator, the item had been found and was posted back to us the following day, many thanks to Aneta for this. In all it was a great experience and although a little expensive this proves you get what you pay for. Very happy customers.",5,2013,07,17
143,Terrific in every way,"This hotel delivers in every way. We arrived at 9AM after a transatlantic flight and the room was ready by 9:30. We were served tea and coffee while we waited.
Our Executive King room was amazing. The bedroom had enough space. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. There was a spacious entry area that held the bar and coffee machine (which was excellent) and a walk in closet with safe. The bathroom was the best I've ever seen - deep soaking tub with TV, separate toilet and separate shower with unreal rain-shower head. Loved the heated floor. We had room 117 but did not find street noise to be a problem (although one previous review pointed this out).
Breakfast at Northall and with room service was excellent. 
Supper at Northall once was terrific.
We especially loved the Bassoon bar. The drinks were pricey but excellent and the ambience and service were something. Different live entertainment every night topped off the whole experience. Definitely worth it.
My first time at a spa and I loved it. My wife compared it to others and felt it was the best she's seen. I loved the fitness centre - lots of equipment and space.
The location was perfect. Close to all the main sights and next to Embankment tube stop so very easy to get around. 
The level of service was excellent - friendly and attentive. The concierge was very helpful.
Overall, we highly recommend this hotel. Probably not for you if you are watching every penny but if you are willing to pay for quality then this is the place for you. We already are trying to plan a trip back.",5,2013,07,17
143,So british,"You made ​​our stay in your hotel in the most beautiful way. Thank you all. Your courtesy and kindness were up to our espérances.Votre professionalism is welcomed. Finally, the hotel itself is a haven of elegance and tranquility, it is rested after a walk in the heart of London is most welcome. I invite you to continue to welcome your guests in excellence.",5,2013,07,17
143,Wonderful stay,"We stayed in a superior king and had a lovely stay. The hotel is beautiful, the staff were excellent and the room was very impressive. Real attention to detail (big bath with tv, marble rainfall shower, walk-in wardrobe...), and the location couldn't really be better. Only slight niggle (very slight!), the air con only goes down to 19 and it was a boiling hot day, the duvet was a little too heavy for me and I woke up too hot. The check-in check-out system wasn't explained well at any stage (booking or check-in), but is an excellent system...you essentially get 24 hours in the room. Not sure how this will work when the hotel is busy, but it definitely eases the pressure. Would have been nice is use of the spa facilities was included, the room is expensive and the spa would have been an extra £25 each. Bit cheeky really.",5,2013,07,16
143,Best Spa in london,"The Spa is the strongest asset of the Corinthia Hotel... It's the best one I've been in London, and anywhere else actually. The 2 restaurant are good without being exceptional for their price, but the afternoon tea is worth it!",4,2013,07,16
143,"Fantastic hotel, lovely spa","This hotel has got it just right.  From the rooms - comfortable with easy to use lighting etc - to the staff - friendly, helpful and welcoming.  Afternoon tea is a must and the breakfast is definitely worth having.  The spa and pool are absolutely gorgeous, do not miss out on trying them.  This is my favourite London hotel, absolutely fabulous!",5,2013,07,16
143,Mixed Reviews,"Cannot fault the hotel itself, beautiful hotel, beautiful rooms and super location.

The only fly in the ointment really - we arrived at 5.30pm and were left waiting until about 6.15 in reception for a room key, until we queried it and were told our room wasn't ready?!

We were then charged for the room twice as we had prepaid for our stay - this wasn't picked up on by the staff who checked us in or out - only until we checked out bank balance did we realise this, they have since then sent us a refund invoice and then to follow another billing invoice for items that weren't picked up on from the mini bar at the time of departure!!!! 

The only saving grave were the concierge who picked up and dropped off our vehicle and the lovely gentleman who took us to collect our vehicle the next day.

All in all, beautiful hotel but alot of miscommunication spoilt it. ",3,2013,07,15
143,you won't want to leave,"Corinthia is elegant and so well located we walked everywhere.  The room is well appointed with all needs and turn down including chocolates and the swimming pool and spa experience is fantastic with childrens times so my daughter was able to enjoy too.  room service breakfast wonderful.  All staff from management, housekeeping, turn down, room service and concierge are attentive and helpful.  I hope to stay again soon.  ",5,2013,07,15
143,Fantastic,"The best hotel in London ! Spacious room, the best bed and linnen. Everything you want and need is there. Fantastic bathroom. Tasty decorated, elegant. Service excellent not pushy, the food dinner and breakfast delicious. This will be THE place to stay everytime we are in London",5,2013,07,14
143,Finally a 5 star hotel in London delivering 5 star service,"Earlier this year I stayed at the Al Qasr, Dubai, part of the Madinat Jumeirah group, a hotel I would recommend to anyone and have reviewed twice now. That is what I think is a 5 star hotel delivering 5 star service and comfort. Until this weekend I had not stayed at a hotel in England delivering the same. But upon recommendation from my brother in law, we picked the Corinthia situated very close to the centre of London and the West End. We could arrive and check in at any time, and also do the same for check out. Nothing seemed to be a problem with any of the staff. We chose a deluxe room, which has a small foyer as you enter, a large dressing and clothes area directly in front of you, a superb bathroom with a tv on the bath wall to your left and a lovely bedroom to the right. The room is complimented with lovely fittings and fixtures, a cracking Nespresso coffee/ tea machine, huge bed and tv. We ate in the Northall restaurant. It was easy to book up and we were taken through to the restaurant which is large, airy, looked beautiful and clean and the service was fantastic, first class. We had a pre theatre menu which was £ 30 inc champagne, I cannot understand how the hotel can make money out of it. It was a choice of three starters, mains and desserts yet all were excellent size and superbly presented. I would also like to thank Fabrizio and his colleague for their wonderful service. We also had breakfast which was included in our weekend package, something I would recommend. The food for breakfast was also of a very high quality, no corners cut, and service excellent again.
If you get a chance, try the Espa Spa out. I do not think you will find a better one and better facilities in the UK. This really is a 5 star hotel offering 5 star comfort and service! will definitely be going again",5,2013,07,14
143,Fabulous,"The Corinthia Hotel in London is so fabulous that now I want to go and try all Corinthia properties!  I loved the attention to detail for comfort, noise control, and sleep quality.  The rooms are very peaceful and calming.  I had an interior courtyard standard  room and it was lovely.  Unfortunately, it had some maintenance problems that I think were unusual for the hotel so after numerous calls & complaints they moved me at 1:00am to a Junior Suite...also courtyard interior room.  While the Junior Suite was even more beautiful and obviously larger both rooms were carefully detailed to provide excellent comfort.  Blue LED lights instead of obnoxious red ones were much more calming. A TV screen that covered the TV when not in use.  Mood lighting & music.  Black out draperies.  An extra door that separated the room from hallway noise was a nice added touch in the Junior Suite. Heated marble floors and towel warmers in the beautiful and well lit bathrooms were also very nice.  The Corinthia Spa is incredible and probably the best and most beautiful  I have ever seen...and I have seen many worldwide.  They have a lovely tea in the lobby in the afternoons.   I would definitely return to this hotel!",5,2013,07,14
143,Why did we have to leave?,Right now this is my favorite hotel in the world! I cannot say enough about this property. The rooms were beyond comfortable and chic. The bathroom was huge and filled with the wonderful ESPA amenities. After a long flight checking into the Corinthia was heaven. Room sheets were luxurious silky and soft. If we would have had the opportunity it would have been a room to sleep late and be lazy in. The common areas such as lobby and restaurants were chic and elegant. The bar was a classic and created  hand mixed drinks with exotic artistry. Bar entertainment was an added bonus. I would recommend this bar even if I wasnt staying at the hotel. Staff paid attention to details and were helpful. If you have a choice and price is not a deterrent stay here because you will fall in love with this wonderful gem. Centrally located and is situated well for walking.,5,2013,07,14
143,Just Fantastic,"I was lucky enough to stay at the Corinthia Hotel earlier this year whilst in London for work, I must say it is one of the best experiences I have had to date in London hotels especially the spa which was bordering on perfect.

The best news is that my girlfriend has booked us in for 3 nights starting this Friday as I have been going on about how good this place is ........ not a bad birthday treat :-)",5,2013,07,13
143,A Wonderful Hotel!,"We will definitely return to the Corinthia Hotel!  To start off with, it's beautiful!  Our room was contemporary as well as luxurious.  The staff was excellent.  Everyone that we dealt with was accommodating and extremely courteous.  We had an interior room with a balcony.  It was quiet and bright.  The executive room has a foyer which is also nice to have.  It's nice to know that you've found a hotel that you feel comfortable in and look forward to coming back.  Everything about the hotel...staff, rooms, food, etc. is excellent.",5,2013,07,11
143,I wish I could have stayed longer.....,"London hotels always seem to be full at this time of year. And, if they are not full then they are certainly overpriced. So, it was with some trepidation that I arrived at the Corinthia yesterday evening.

I need not have worried. 

I could not have been more warmly welcomed - greeted at the taxi door and ushered to reception, upgraded to an executive room, where my luggage arrived, efficiently, shortly after I did.

My room was one of the best I have stayed at in London - spacious, quiet, and decorated to a high standard. The aircon was efficient and silent and the gadgetry was impressive. My only disappointment was that the free wifi connection was painfully slow.

The bathroom was certainly the best I have had in London - spacious, spa-quality toiletries (my room was next door to the Spa - room 521), a walk in shower and a roomy bath with its own TV screen.

I had reason to test both housekeeping and room service - both were prompt and efficient and, unusually, when I dialled, knew me by name and room number. Sometimes it is the simple things.....

The sirloin steak I had from room service was also the best I have ever had in a London hotel. My compliments to the chef.",5,2013,07,10
143,Perfect!,"We were on our way home from 5star hotels in Como and Portofino Italy and still was incredibly impressed with the Corinthia. The hotel  is beautiful! Every staff member went above and beyond, from check in, to check out. We even ran into an employee in the elevator who asked if we had seen the spa, and offered to give us a tour. Our room was the base rate, yet was very big- with every modern amenity- heated bathroom floors, overhead shower, very comfortable bed, coffee maker in the room. We were only able to stay for 24 hours, but we will definitely be back! ",5,2013,07,08
143,The Perfect Hotel in London!,"The perfect location! Off a quiet street yet near Trafalgar Square, the Thames River the tube and London Eye. A short walk to most of all the attractions and restaurants. The rooms were the perfect size with luxury linens and marble heated floors and towels. What we loved most were the extremely nice and always helpful concierges! Everything we wanted to do they were able to accommodate us.
We would stay here again... Fell in love with London because of the Corinthia Hotel!",5,2013,07,08
143,"Wonderful stay, helpful staff, comfortable room, great location","We stayed three nights at the Corinthia in June and had a great time.  We loved the location between Trafalgar Square and the Thames.  Close to the action, yet on a quiet corner. We walked to Westminster Abbey, Churchill War Rooms, the National Gallery, Pall Mall, the Theater district, Horseguards Palace and The Mall.  The Embarkment tube stop is a 2 minute walk. The hotel is lovely with a beautiful lobby where we had delicious tea served in gorgeous china.  Our room was very comfortable and the spa is terrific. I had a good massage there and we used the thermal floor with steam room, sauna and gorgeous hot tub, the nicest we've ever seen.  We were sorry we waited til the end of our stay to use it.

The gym is excellent.  My husband is a gym rat and he was extremely satisfied with the choice of equipment. The concierge staff was extremely helpful and was able to get us two tickets to a very popular performance at a reasonable price.  We will definitely return.  We were thinking that in cold weather that thermal floor would be especially nice.

At night, go up on the nearby bridge over the Thames for a lovely view of the London Eye and Houses of Parliament.",5,2013,07,08
143,Ultimate weekend experience,A perfect hotel with fantastic service that gives a 5 star experience. Situated very near the Thames the hotel exceeded our expectations. If you enjoy luxury & quality this hotel is for you. To get away from the hustle & bustle of the world try the fabulous spa. We can't wait to return.,5,2013,07,08
143,Lovely Hotel,"I rarely do reviews but my stay last month compelled me. I was traveling alone as a single woman. Sometimes this can be problematic. Lesser quality rooms, attempting to seat one at bad tables in restaurants etc. My experience at the Corinthia was stellar! Great room, exactly as presented. Quiet...Fabulous, COMFORTABLE bed! Wonderful  bathroom! The hotel staff was uniformly on top of it. From Justin the concierge helping me plan my days & restaurants, to my lovely waiter at restaurant Massimo my first night, (I so wish I remembered his name!) & on to every encounter with room service, bell service, check in & out, door man etc. 
I would love to thank all for such an outstanding stay!

In addition the location is so close to many wonderful sights, which are easily walkable.

I just wish there was a Hotel Corinthia in Paris! But when I'm next in London I'll be back!",5,2013,07,04
143,"Great hotel, Great location","We just completed a three night stay in two connecting rooms.  The rooms are spacious and they were immaculate.  The location is very convenient for the West End, and sightseeing.  Walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Soho, Covent Garden, The West End, etc....
It is very busy two blocks away from the hotel, but the hotel feels immune to the crowds.
A great choice in central London.",5,2013,07,03
143,Amazing!,"I stayed at the Corinthia Hotel for a week and found my stay amazing as they had everything to offer, not to mention their central location by the river in Embankment and a few minutes walk to the underground station. The Harrods restaurant within the hotel served the most amazing food, with the waiter as well as the manager of the restaurant there to ensure you were enjoying your meal. The room service was quick and the food on the menu to order was a wonderful selection from spaghetti bolagnase to caviar. The en-suite room was a wonderful large size offering chocolates, champagne, a selection of fruit and a variety of magazines to choose from. The bathroom was also lovely due to the bathtub having a TV, large shower and a wide dressing table with a blow dryer. I decided to get a muscle massage at the hotels spa as i heard it had great reviews, the reviews were right! the masseuse talked me through what she was going to do, offered me the choice of music and then got on with the best deep muscle massage I had ever had. Overall the stay was amazing.",5,2013,07,03
143,Fabulous hotel!,"We are actually staying at a hotel across the street, but they did not have our room ready the night we arrived, so they put us up here for the night. Having just left the Corinthia St Petersburg, we knew we would be taken care of, but had no idea how beautiful this hotel would be! Huge room, very slick and modern. And the staff could not have been nicer! Bottled water, beds turned down with yummy boxes of chocolate. They offered to bring an extra bed for our daughter, but she was comfortable sleeping on the day bed with a blanket and pillow. Wonderful bathroom! Huge tub with delicious smelling bath salts and tv. Separate ""room"" for the shower and for the toilet, made it great for the 3 of us to all have our privacy. We were actually a bit sad to move across the street the next day. A great big Thank You to The Corinthian for turning our 1st night in London from a disaster into pure pleasure!",5,2013,07,03
143,Excellent Choice,"My wife and I were recently at the Corinthia with our 7 year old children. We are used to staying at fairly high-end hotels and resorts and the Corinthia did not disappoint. Rooms and food  were both very good (the buffet breakfast was particularly good with young children) and the 1 1/2 hours in the afternoon that kids could use the beautiful indoor pool was a godsend after a day of sightseeing.  The hotel is very conveniently located to many attractions such as: the Churchill Was Rooms, Westminster Abbey, the London Eye, Trafalgar Square and the theater district and Covent Garden. I would very much recommend for families and all others.",5,2013,07,01
143,Top notch,"Really enjoyed my stay. While there were a few minor growing pain issues the staff were able to get things fixed instantly. Very large and comfortable rooms, friendly and efficient staff, great location. 

Excellent room service too.",5,2013,07,01
143,Beautiful hotel. Best in London,"This was our third visit to the Corinthia London and our fifth to a Corinthia Hotel.

As always we received a warm welcome at this truly stunning Hotel.  It's elegance and quality is understated and you are made to feel like the most valued guest they have ever received from the moment your arrive.

We arrived slightly earlier than planned and were offered complimentary drinks in the beautiful lobby lounge whilst we waited.  After about twenty minutes the receptionist returned and showed us to our room. We had the good fortune to be upgraded to a Trafalgar suite on this stay.  The room was beautifully decorated and we had room to spare.  We made full use of the spacious lounge and also enjoyed the tropical rain shower.  

After a walk round the Westminster area we returned to the hotel for a light meal and few drinks.  We decided to eat in the lobby lounge.  The atmosphere was perfect, service friendly and efficient and the food gorgeous.  We also enjoyed several glasses of perfectly chilled white wine.  Needless to say the next few hours slipped by quickly...Also I recommend a night cap next to one of the two fires in the courtyard area next to the lounge.

Breakfast was served the following morning in the room, Bang on time, piping hot and with complimentary newspaper.  The portions and quality of the food were both excellent.  

I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.  It is a beautiful hotel with its own unique style and atmosphere.  Although, it's undoubtedly one of London's best hotels, if not the best, it still retains the charm, friendliness and warmth of a Corinthia Hotel.  3 visits down and many more to come I hope.",5,2013,06,29
143,Everyone should visit this hotel at least once!,"I was lucky enough to stay at this gorgeous hotel recently with work.  The hotel is in a fantastic central location and very easily accessible.

The room was gorgeous, I have been travelling for over 10 years and this was one of the most beautiful rooms I've stayed in. I wish I'd have had more time in there to enjoy it. Because the building is very old the rooms are large, which is rare for London properties.

We dined in the restuarant and the food was fantastic, from starter to desert and the handmade chocolates we were given were a lovely touch.

The bar is nice and has a good atmosphere, quite often hotel bars can be stuffy and formal but this felt warm and appealing. 

The breakfast was either a buffet or you could order specific dishes, we opted for the breakfast buffet which was lovely with all the usual options, (bacon, sausage, beans etc) 

The public areas are stunning and luxurious, there is a lovely courtyard with has outdoor fire places and would be very cosy in the evening. 

We did not visit the spa due to time constraints but the range of treatments are so wide.

I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and I am planning on returning as soon as I can!",5,2013,06,28
143,Wonderful Corinthia,"I stayed at Corinthia for 3 nights from 23 to 26 June. What should i say abouth this hotel ? Firstly is a very good and beautiful room, with a tv in a bath tub while we are mostly away, our kid have fun experienced it 1 time and really happy. We have been given complimentary mineral water, lollypop for 2 nights and chocolate for 1 night. The location is also good near Trafalgar Square, London Eye and Big ben. The nearest convenience store is about 5 minutes walk in the Strand or Embankment. Embankment station is the closest to experience most of London. The level of service is very good as we would expect a 5 star hotel. They arrange a luggage transfer from my previous stay and delivery of 1 of my package to Indonesia. At the last day we have a nice afternoon tea at the lounge, and the food and drink is splendid with a fair price. Will stay here again on the next trip and maybe even try that nice spa.",5,2013,06,28
143,Return visit.,"I could not wait to return to this hotel after having such an amazing time on our first visit. 

Just like before the service we received from every member of staff, especially the reception team was excellent. 

But.... not everything was perfect ....

Our room was dark and at the rear of the hotel, our luggage got lost on route to the room had to wait over 45 mins for it to arrive, evening dinner in the Northall restaurant was a massive disappointed. The spa area which had the wow factor on our first visit, looked so untidy with wet towels left on the chairs and floor areas. Housekeeping needs to improve we walked past the same half eaten cake in the corridor outside a room twice in 5 hours! 

Still a very good hotel but competition is high in London and on this occasion I didn't feel we got value for money.",4,2013,06,28
143,A Hotel in a class of its own.,"This is was our third visit to the Corinthia Hotel in London and fifth stay at a Corinthia Hotel.  The one thing you can always be sure of with Corinthia is a genuine and warm welcome.

The Hotel is located just off the Thames embankment and is a five minute walk along Northumberland Avenue to Trafalgar Square.  Your are cordially welcome by the immaculate and top hatted door man and ushered in to the truly stunning lobby.  Reception Is always manned by at least three staff and if they are occupied you wont wait long before another staff member appears to check you in.  Check is usually efficient and friendly and the receptionist will escort you to your room and offer you a tour of the hotel in the process. On this occasion we were slightly early so the room was not quite ready.  We were shown to the Lobby Lounge and offered a drink.  The lounge is an oasis of calm and you will be well looked after.  We enjoyed a Latte and Americano and watched the world go by.  After about 20 minutes the receptionist return along with the Guest Relations Manager who welcomed us back to the hotel.  We were then told the coffees were complimentary and that our room was ready.

We were shown to our room which was on the fourth floor.  We had been upgraded to a Trafalgar Suite which took us some what by surprise. Now, the executive rooms are stunning and beautifully appointed and I can sure you the Suites are even more so.  The suite comprised a Large Sitting Room, hallway, guest bathroom, numerous closets, a vast bedroom and equally large bathroom.  The room was beautifully decorated and incredibly comfortable. Despite the luxurious appointments of the room you still feel comfortable, relaxed and dare I say it, at home in the room.  I can thoroughly recommend the tropical rain shower as well. The room included two minibars, three televisions (Bedroom, Lounge and Bathroom) and a Nespresso Coffee Machine.  Shortly after our arrival a Porter delivered complementary wine, chocolates, fresh fruit and a hand written note from the General Manager. 

We decided to visit the Northall Bar in the evening for a cocktail and maybe a bite to eat.  The Northall Bar was very quiet and we felt that it lacked atmosphere although I would stress it's difficult to create atmosphere with only three people in the bar.  The Northall Bar was located in a beautifully decorated high ceilinged room and I can imagine that when its busy the atmosphere is probably fantastic.  We were welcomed and served promptly and we enjoyed a cocktail from the extensive menu.  We decided not eat in here or go through to the Northall Restaurant itself.  Instead we returned to the Lobby Lounge were we enjoyed numerous glasses of wine and a bite to eat.  For us the Lobby Lounge has much more atmosphere and we enjoyed a very comfortable few hours here before eventually making our way to our room at about midnight.  Whilst we had been out our room had been serviced and the bed turned down.

The following morning breakfast and newspaper were delivered promptly at the time requested.  The cooked breakfast was hot and tasty and accompanied with a large pot of coffee.  After we finished the trolley was collected almost immediately.

This hotel is a worthy edition to the Corinthia collection and a clear brand leader.  Its elegance and quality is understated and it does not feel the need to ram it's status down your throat.  It has no need to either.  It far exceeds many other 5 star hotels and does so with the same calm. friendly and attentive service that you come to expect from Corinthia.  If you are looking for somewhere special to stay then I would not hesitate to recommend it.  It is worth every penny but I warn you.... you may well find yourself hooked and making many return visits.  For us its three so far and we certainly plan to return.",5,2013,06,25
143,Luxurious and friendly stay,"We chose the Corinthia for our stay because of the excellent reviews and because of its proximity to theatres we were attending and the restaurants we like. For us the location could not have been better; we didn’t take a taxi or ride the tube for the duration of our stay – everything was within walking distance. The hotel is attractive with staff we found to be both pleasant, helpful and very well trained. We did not use the services of the concierge having made our arrangements prior to arrival but everyone else seemed both eager and efficient. Breakfast service was very good and always done with a smile. We were on the third floor in an executive king with plenty of space and a great walk in closet which really gets the clutter out of the bedroom. The bed was most comfortable with good linens and, for once in a hotel, quite good pillows. The bathroom was (almost ) perfect. The rain shower was the best we have come across and provided toiletries were most pleasant. Why almost perfect? The hair dryer situation; this must have been designed by a man. As with many European hotels there is no ability to use a hairdryer in the bathroom. At the Corinthia an excellent hairdryer is stored in the walk in closet – but you can’t use the hairdryer in there because the plugs don’t match. So into the bedroom, where the only mirror is either a small  vanity mirror which you can place on the table (too small for hair drying, gentlemen) or there is, in these rooms, a larger mirror behind shelves which allows you to dry your hair in not very good light while banging your knees on the lower shelf.  The piece of furniture used for the television could be changed out for something that houses a small vanity; there is space. This is a small complaint for all else was most enjoyable and we will certainly use the Corinthia again on our next theatre trip.",5,2013,06,23
143,VIP treatment all the way,"This is would be up there with one of the greatest hotels I have ever stayed in. The doormen are dressed in ever such dapper attire, greeting you warmly. The reception staff are very accommodating. The grandeur of the building. The location is to die for.  But I have to say, the highlight of my stay was the luxury of the room. It appears that no expense has been spared when decorating and fitting the rooms. From the Nespresso machine, to the quality hair dryer, to the fluffiness of the towels. Corinthia, if only I could live here.",5,2013,06,23
143,Great hotel in central London,"""You get what you pay for!""
So, you can get cheaper hotels in London, I have stayed in a few which are fine.
But, this is a class way above the others.
It is beautiful, the rooms are fantastic, one of the comfiest beds I have ever slept in. The en suite was lovely, big shower and separate bath.
No set check out time!! Complementary bottle of wine. The spa is really nice.
Afternoon tea was ""average"" I enjoyed  Claridges afternoon tea better.
But all in all a great place to stay, very comfortable, I felt very special, it was a special occasion for us and we were happy to have paid more for a very memorable stay.",5,2013,06,21
143,Corinthian heaven,"Stayed at this hotel on a working trip 
It's in a great location within walking distance to everything
The room a suite was very comfortable and clean
The restaurants were amazing !
So good in fact we didn't want to leave the hotel to eat
Well worth a visit even if your not saying at the hotel
Will definitely return again ",5,2013,06,20
143,Great Central London Stay,I booked this hotel for a Valentines Day treat this year but have only just gotten around to writing the review. Service is attentive and check-in and check-out were efficient. The location is good for the West End although a tiny bit out of it if you want Mayfair etc. There are 3 bars to choose from and all are good. We ate in the Massimo restaurant which was a nice hotel restaurant but I'd be unlikely to go there as a destination. Spa was unbelievable. Had a personal training session which was one of the best I've experienced with a very trendy gym. The pool and sauna are spectacular. The suite was well equipped and comfortable. There was a very spacious bathroom and a good size walk in dressing room. All round superb although location a slight negative.,5,2013,06,17
143,Lives up to hype,"Stayed 8 nights in June. Property in class of Ritz/Four Seasons. Helpful staff, can't do enough for you. Had an executive King room. Large space, walk in closet with two separate areas to hang clothes/lots of storage drawers & shelves/built in safe. Bedroom itself is large with sitting area, excellent lighting with dedicated spot reading lights in the ceiling. Has refrigerator that can be used by guests. Leave chocolates daily. Bed comfortable with only decent pillows (tended to flatten out quickly). Bathroom great: large deep soaking tub, two headed walk-in shower, private commode, two sinks. Only negative is nowhere to plug in hair dryer-kind of strange. Housekeeping service always excellent.

Were able to make reservations about 6-8 months ahead of time. Took advantage of 1/2 price sale. We couldn't afford and even if we could, don't think we would pay over $1000/night for a hotel room despite how superb this one is. But, were able to reserve for just over $500 which for a splurge, is well worth it. 

Location is excellent, just south of covent garden area. Walking distance to Trafalgar square and theater district. Adjacent to Embankment underground station and bridge over Thames so can walk easily to Waterloo Station. 

Tips, especially for first time visitors;
(1)If flying into Heathrow, get Heathrow Express tickets ahead of time. Takes 15 minutes to get to Pennington Station, then hop on Bakerloo underground line south to Embankment. Made it to and from airport in total about 40 minutes and very easy. Best way to get back and forth to airport by far. 

(2)When exiting Embankment can go straight or turn left. Do the latter, turn left and walk to street. Bridge over Thames directly to left and Hotel Corinthia right across street to right. Couldn't be easier. 

(3)If planning on quick breakfast before heading out, walk across bridge over Thames, go up ramp and turn right. Le Pain Quotidien is a great breakfast place, lots of options, quick service, fresh food. Can then go to Waterloo Underground or rail depending on what days plans are. 

(4)Get Oyster cards ahead of time on-line. Makes using Underground easy and quick. Also easy to add to card if needed. We put on 30 pounds initially and added another 16. Thats all we needed for the 8 days and lots of trips. Also can use Oyster card to Hampton court; no need to wait in line at Waterloo to get tickets. But, do need tickets to Windsor Castle, or at least we got them and weren't told otherwise. 

(5)As to latter two places, worth day trip. Takes about 45 minutes to Windsor and 35 minutes to Hampton Court. Both fun visits and also ticketed ahead of time. Easy to walk to when exiting train at end of line. Can either walk to Waterloo Station from hotel or take underground. 

(6)Easy walking tour is over bridge to London Eye, then walk to House of Parliment & Westminster Abbey. Then to Churchill War Rooms, then Tate Britain. Full, fun day. 

(7)Best map we found for the London area is the one in Frommers guide in back that you can tear out. Easy to use, nice size, fits in back pocket, made on good stock so doesn't tear and shows all underground stations and places to visit. 

Wonderful first trip to London. Even saw the sun for maybe 2 hours out of the entire trip but only had rain on occasion. Mostly overcast and low 60's, certainly acceptable but typical London weather for this time of year according to locals.",5,2013,06,17
143,Excellent hotel,"I stayed two nights at the Corinthia and didn't want to leave. The hotel and rooms and luxurious and very comfortable. The breakfast was delicious!
What makes this hotel stand out was the attention to detail and the great service from the staff. I will gladly return to the Corinthia!",5,2013,06,17
143,Excellent place to have a relaxing friendly with 1st class service afternoon meal,"I had a meal today for fathers day, it was so pleasant, friendly and the personal attention felt like I was the most important person in the world all thanks to the lovely warm personality of a waiter called LEO thank you Soooo much Leo for a rememberable time and good food backed up with outstanding service. xx",5,2013,06,16
143,Great hotel-Greater Staff!,"close enough for this 65yr old to walk to most sites-Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, Trafalgar Square, London Eye, shopping , pubs, restaurants ( try Little Frankie's down the street, for great pancakes & 50's-60's music!) Our room with a balcony faced a lovely courtyard, room was quiet, huge bathroom, lg bedroom, but it was the staff that impressed me the most-each & everyone went out of their way to be of service-always with a smile and never lost patience even with the most trying visitor.Room service quick, ate at Massimo's in hotel - food great, only wished there were more choices in any ot their hotel restaurants for non-fish eaters-but whatever you ordered was fantastic. Can not say enough about this hotel making my visit-special & comfortable-hated to leave! The Corinthia made my first impression of London a memorable one,Highly recommend to anyone.Any hotel can look great but it takes a great staff to mk it great!!!",5,2013,06,16
143,Fantastic hotel with wonderful staff,Been to a lot of hotels all around the world but none compare to this hotels service and staff attitude from the doorman to the recption  breakfast the staff make you stay comfortable and attitude to genuinely like you and help you as per the hotel rooms and lobby is 1st class compare to none in london ,5,2013,06,16
143,The Corinthia has it all!,"Being a frequent business traveler to London, I have stayed at several hotels in the city.  The Corinthia is one of the very few hotels that I would consider bringing my family.  From the moment you step into the reception area, you feel like you have arrived at a special place.  The foyer is bright and airy and there is usually a spectacular centerpiece or display of flowers on exhibit.  The rooms are of decent size (some are bigger than others) and the furnishings are modern and clean and the bed is comfortable! The bathroom is large with beautiful fixtures and a heated floor.   There is a gym which as far as hotel gyms goes is probably one of the best - there is always something new there and the staff is most helpful.  The hotel is located across the way from Trafalgar Square and is a short walk from Piccadilly Circus and Regent Street.  Have recommended this hotel to both colleagues and friends.",5,2013,06,15
143,Excellent hotel w stylish & modern decor with impeccable service,"I travel frequently to all the major cities in the world (London, Frankfurt, Paris, NYC, SFO, Shanghai etc) for business & go to London 2-3 times a year. I normally stay at The Berkeley in London. I've stayed at Corinthia twice and both times are fantastic. Concierge staff very knowledgable & helpful. Front desk very efficient (important for me on biz trip given my hectic schedule). Location excellent (I love the National Gallery which is within walking distance). Very comfy bed (comparable to all the luxury hotels i've stayed in - Four Seasons Ritz Carlton...). Would recommend to both biz & leisure travellers with a discerning taste ",5,2013,06,13
143,Our experience was First Class,"I live in London so rarely stay at London hotels. I normally travel for business in Asia, Latin and North America and my opinion is based on a comparison with hotels in those regions.

I booked a Junior Suite for our 20th Wedding Anniversary. My first mistake was booking the wrong date. The reception desk could not have been more helpful. They whisked us off to have tea whilst they made arrangements to set up a room for us. An hour later we were upgraded to a spectacular Penthouse Suite. The decorative style of the hotel varies betyween quite ""blingy"" in parts to extremely elegant (think of the public areas on a 1930s transatlantic ocean liner). Personally I liked it, and some of the art is actually quite interesting. As you would expect the Penthouse Suite was out of this world, with 2 floors, an elevator, and a beautiful roof terrace with views Big Ben, the London Eye and Nelson's Column. I have no idea what my booked Junior Suite would have been like, more than adequate judging by our room. We slept beautifully, incredibly comfortable beds.

The next moring we had breakfast. We liked the dining room very much. The food was good, well cooked.

We stayed the whole morning in the Spa. We will definitely be coming back here, even if we don't stay in the hotel. I don't really like Spas but this was something else. The staff, the treatments, the products, the environment, the facilities, the design. It was perfection, and way above expectations.

Overall our stay was exceptional. We both felt rested, very well looked after and spoilt. I must thank the reception staff and the Manager for being so flexible with our booking, correcting my mistake and helping to make such a wonderful stay. In my opinion they could not have treated us better than they did. This hotel is not cheap, but we felt it was worth every penny.",5,2013,06,12
143,Shockingly good,"The Corinthia Hotel is stunningly beautiful and has clearly benefitted from a huge amount of investment. It has been money well spent. The public areas are grand in a way that marries the period features of the building with a more contemporary, international feel. 

Our room was a junior suite which was excellent. I liked the small touches, such as the Monocle magazine and free wifi. The gym and spa are particularly stunning and really couldn't be any better. We didn't eat in the restaurants other than to have breakfast in the morning. This was enjoyable with an appropriate Englishness to the food and products.

All in all, this hotel is exceptionally good and I wouldn't hesitate to stay again the next time I am in London.",5,2013,06,12
143,Afternoon tea,"We went to the corinthia hotel for afternoon tea, we are gradually working our way around the top London hotels that serve afternoon tea.
The location for afternoon tea is in the main area of the hotel and it felt a little like paddington station with people walking through, staff having conversations around the area and the general hub of activity in a hotel going on around you.
they catered for me well as I am vegetarian with a dairy allergy, the bread was a little hard but the sandwiches were ok. The cakes were lovely and had been made with alot of care and attention and tasted beautiful. Tea was a little disappointing for me as I like loose tea and they used a tea bag which is the first time I have come across this for afternoon tea. But that is a personal preference.
We had a nice afternoon tea but for me a little more ambience away from the hub of the hotel would have been better. Thank you for catering for my food preferences and for the staff taking the time to ask and to understand what my needs were. The staff were very helpful and clearly cared about giving a good service",3,2013,06,10
143,Disappointing Stay,"The Corinthia's decor is beautiful. Stunning, even. Its location is excellent. Overall the service (when we could reach anyone -- see below) was very good. But unfortunately we had quite a few issues during our 3-night stay, and as a result we would have to think really hard before giving this property another try in the future.

A little background about us: we visit London multiple times each year. We usually stay at The Goring or The Milestone, which are both traditional, small 5-star hotels. We normally book through Amex FHR or a Virtuoso travel agent, and we are repeat guests at both hotels. So we are treated very, very well at those two properties: we always have a nice note from the General Manager and a welcome gift waiting for us when we arrive, and we are always assigned excellent -- usually upgraded -- rooms or suites.

This was our first stay at the Corinthia, so I wasn't expecting that level of attention, but I did expect more than what we experienced. I've read some great reviews of the hotel and although we love the treatment we receive at The Goring and The Milestone, we prefer a more modern decor, which the Corinthia has. I also enjoy lavish spas, which those really small hotels can't offer. Having experienced ESPA at the Peninsula NYC, I was eager to try ESPA at the Corinthia as well.

When I happened across a half-price room rate offer on the Corinthia's website, I decided to give the hotel a try for a short stay we had coming up in London. Perhaps booking that offer was my mistake, because our room assignment (in an Executive King, which is the hotel's top room category below suites) was definitely sub-par. I have to assume that was because we were first-time guests and paying a low rate.

Our room (117) was on the first floor and very noisy. It is apparently located just above the rubbish bins, as we were awakened every morning around 6:30 by the sound of glass bottles being emptied out of the bins. The noise was really loud the first morning, which made me wonder if the double-glazing was faulty. In examining the window next to our bed, I discovered that housekeeping (or the previous guest, undetected by housekeeping) had left the window open about 3"" from the top. After the window was closed properly, the noise of the bins being emptied was more muffled, but still noticeable.

There was also an intermittent, loud banging in the ceiling that sometimes went on for as long as 10 minutes at a time. This happened twice in the middle of the first night. We thought this was something wrong with the air conditioning unit, so in the morning I called Housekeeping and asked if Engineering/Maintenance could look into the noise. To the hotel's credit, someone arrived within minutes. The banging obediently started right up while he was in the room, and we confirmed that this was the noise we were complaining about, then left for breakfast, assuming he'd fix it.

Turns out, no. The noise never let up. We finally realized it must be the pipes, as it was much worse every morning starting around the time when people are taking showers. I am fairly astonished that after the developer put about half a BILLION dollars into the renovations of this building, the pipes are so noisy.

We had a lot of issues when trying to reach staff on the phone: specifically, no one would answer when calling the concierge or the spa. On the first evening after we arrived, I called the spa no less than 5 times in 90 minutes and never got an answer. The line would just ring and ring, and then disconnect. I tried both of the phones in the room. I also tried calling the direct extension of the spa, instead of just pressing the icon for ""spa."" I made sure to try at odd times (not on the hour or half-hour, when they might be busy checking people in and out). Finally I gave up, walked down to the spa and made my appointments. There were two women working at the desk and I was the only person in the spa lobby, so it's not like they were busy.

Same thing with the concierge desk, which I called 3 times on the first night as I wanted to make a reservation for the hotel restaurant. Ten or a dozen rings, then a disconnect. I finally got an answer on the 4th attempt.

Reception and Housekeeping answered the phones consistently, but the concierge was hopeless throughout our stay.

The final, mild irritant in our room was the round table, apparently intended to serve as both a dining table and a desk. It was so tippy and unstable that we had to hold it in place whenever we needed to use it, lest everything slide off onto the floor. My husband twisted it around a bit so that it was slightly more stable, but it always rocked at the slightest touch. I am not sure if this was a design flaw or if it was broken.

I seriously considered complaining to the general manager of the hotel, but our stay was short and I really didn't feel like taking up part of my day with it. Any one of these problems (particularly the table/desk one) could be seen as trivial. When you added them all together, though, it made for a less-than-ideal experience.

The spa is stunning, and once I got my appointments set up, my experiences there were excellent. The relaxation pods are particularly fantastic.

We loved the Bassoon bar, which has a dazzling decor and delicious drinks (as one would expect at £16 each).

We enjoyed our two breakfasts and one dinner in Northall restaurant. The service was excellent and the food very nice.

Ultimately I think we like smaller, more personal hotels that get all the details right.",3,2013,06,09

143,"A place in my heart...Corinthia, London","We stayed at Corinthia Hotel and the experience was amazing. The hotel spells luxury and elegance. Our rooms were crisp and clean. The lobby is beautiful. Ate at the Northall for breakfast, my children just loves  and look forward to it. Had dinner at Massimo, it was impeccable. Service all thru out was excellent. Location was convenient, near the Embankment, Trafalgar, the Tube, London Eye, the Aquarium etc. We arrived early morning and front desk offered us breakfast to settle everyone. They surely make that extra effort to make us feel at home and comfortable.",5,2013,06,08
143,Top class,"Attended a wedding and stayed over. Absolutely stunning hotel with wonderful bedrooms and superb bathroom. Public spaces are impressive and smart bars with good cocktails.  The wedding was wonderful and staff were attentive, professional, helpful and friendly. Great food at the reception and breakfast.  The Spa is stylish with a nice pool. Attention to detail delivers everything you would expect of one of the very best hotels in London.",5,2013,06,07
143,Hospitality has an Address- Northall Restaurant,This is one of the best dinning experience I have had.  The Management of the Restaurant was extremely gracious and the food divine. The surroundings were exquisite and classic. The service was excellent.  I was with a very important  middle eastern delegation they were so impressed with the overall atmosphere that they have requested that we book all our business lunches and dinners at the hotel.  We will definitely be back there very soon and I just wanted to thank the restaurant manager and staff for a superb dinning experience.,5,2013,06,07

Breakfast was nice. Good food, great ambiance.",5,2013,06,07
143,The best in London,"Will make this quick..  This is the best hotel in London, period.  I am not a shill either.  From the moment we entered the hotel, the entire staff could not have been nicer, more welcoming, or professional.  We were upgraded to a nicer room immediately without asking and it was superb. The bed was super comfy, the bathroom large and beautiful, and the shower was out of this world.  Courtyard facing room, very quiet, beautiful lobby, bar (s) and rooms-it is simply an elegant and classy place.  I would now never stay anywhere else in London.  It is located in Whitehall, close to all the government stuff and a superb neighborhood",5,2013,06,06
143,Best hotel ever,"I've been very fortunate to have stayed in some really nice hotels in Asia. This is in my view one of the best hotels I've stayed in ever. The hotel is really beautiful just off the Embankment station, minutes away from Trafalgar Square and many other attractions. I literally walked to almost all of the attractions as the walk by the Thames river is really very pleasant. 

The room I got on the fourth floor in the corner was really nice. I agree with another reviewer who said that the room is very well proportioned. Whilst a large room can be luxurious to some, I don't fancy a large empty room. The room is as Goldilocks would put it ""just nice""; cosy but not cramped.

There is a nespresso machine and the bathroom floors are heated along with the towel rails which is such a treat when the weather outside turns dreary and cold as I'm told London weather can be. The toiletries that they provide is really great. The tv in the bath is such a luxury and the acoustics work. 

The gym was very well equipped. The pool however was tiny, but beautifully done. Even the common shower and changing room at for the spa and gym. Staff were really professional and nice, especially liked the doormen. There's a small Harrods in the hotel if you need to grab some souvenirs before you fly out. 

I've said loads of nice things but I do have a few comments for improvement. Had breakfast there every morning. It was great the first two days but really got quite bored with the food at breakfast by day three. I'm from Asia and I suppose we're spoilt when it comes to food choice. Would have been nice if they made small changes though, having the same sausage every morning  . . . Not too keen. 

The room was warm, even though I turned the temperature down. Suffering from jet lag it took me a day to figure out not to keep the toilet doors open as the floor heating was compensating for the cold/cool air. The hotel may want to look into this as it would, increase their energy bill if unknowing people like me keep toilet doors open. 

Otherwise this is really a great hotel.",5,2013,06,06
143,Pleasant Five Star Experience,"I chose this hotel for its location, and it couldn't have been better.  It's right across the road from the Embankment Station,and walking distance to Trafalgar Square.  The hotel building is beautiful.  There are many different restaurant options within the hotel.  We tried the gym, which is inside the spa area.  Everything is state of the art, and the staff there were very polite and gave us a tour of the gym.  The room was great.  Separate walk in wardrobe, large bathroom & a nespresso machine.  Wonderful experience, will definitely stay there again next time in London.",5,2013,06,02
143,"Have stayed in a lot of London hotels, but this is up there with the best of them!","Wow. Can't believe I've only just come across this place.  I attended a conference in the hotel and stayed over. I know the conference organiser and she informed me that pretty much all the rooms are the same as regards size which is no bad feat considering the hotel is not purpose-built. I don't know how much was paid, therefore cannot comment on the value aspect.

I ate at Massimo's - great food, although the atmosphere lacked a little being as it is vast and has incredibly high ceilings so you get a little bit of an echo, and you completely lose a degree of intimacy you might want.

The rooms are very well proportioned, the beds large and incredibly comfortable as well as immaculately dressed.

The room also had a desk with enough plug sockets (including international ones) which I thought was a great little touch.  

The bathroom was huge - the bath even had its own TV! Very good quality toiletries.

I would not hesitate to go back again. Had a wonderful experience.

The location is fantastic - only a couple of minutes walk to all the attractions London has to offer, and very close to mainline and tube stations. But in the room I stayed in you couldn't hear a thing of outside life.",5,2013,05,30
143,Excellent hotel in London !,"Stayed here and wow !

143,A Five Seasons,"Every Year, for now over 15 years we visit The RHS Chelsea Flower Show. Every year we stayed in another hotel as London has so many top hotels but now we found heaven... We will not hesitate to stay again and again in the Corinthia as we had such a wonderfull experience.
Service, class,design,quality and a toplocation...why should we not return?
We stayed at several Four seasons worldwide, all top but we rate The Corinthia even better.
Congratulations to all, we had a wonderfull stay.",5,2013,05,29
143,First Rate Experience,"We recently stayed 5 nights with our friends. From the 9 am early check-in to our last dinner in the Northall, our stay could not have been better. Our entire London experience was made that much better by having stayed at The Corinthia. Others have noted the overall ambiance, facilities and staff, and there is no need to duplicate the praise, just affirm it.  Tired on the day of our arrival after touring the Portobello Road & Borough Markets, we had an early pre theater menu dinner in Massimo, which was delicious and although a bit light, priced for value and a good choice for that early first night. The breakfast buffet leaves nothing out, the fresh berries were unexpected, and a great start to the day. We so much enjoyed the Nespresso machine in the room that we intend to buy one. I really can't say enough good things about the Corinthia and just wish there were one in each city we visit. For you foodies, The Northall is not yet Zagat rated, but our meal was exceptional.",5,2013,05,28

143,You have to stay here...,"I took my partner here for his birthday. We stayed one night and used the spa facilities and got a couple of treatments. The first thing that hits you when you arrive at this hotel is the stunning decor, the smell of fresh flowers which decorate the lobby and the attentive staff. 

Our room was spacious and clean and even had a birthday cake for my partner, which was a really thoughtful touch. We had dinner at the Northall, and the food was delicious, cocktails amazing, and the service is second to none. Extremely polite, nothing was too much trouble for our waiter and we didnt feel rushed at all, as you often do in restaurants. The breakfast was incredible also, with a buffet style layout, with the option of ordering off of the a la carte.

The spa was equally amazing, and I would 100% recommend this hotel to everyone. I can't wait to go back!",5,2013,05,28
143,Heavenly Stay,"My partner and I recently spent 5 nights here in a deluxe city view room. The experience that we had was truly amazing. 

After a slight blip upon arrival, we got situated into our room at 10 AM as was promised with the early check-in feature. 

The room itself was nice, if a bit oddly laid out. There was a sitting chair in the bedroom, but it was in such a place that made it difficult to access the bar area. This was the only con, however, in a sea of pros.

The first night we got back from being out in the evening at the theatre, they had decorated the bed with pink roses and also left a white rose bouquet on the table. It was such a classy touch!

We ate in both restaurants and also went to the Bassoon Bar twice. Never have I actually done that at a hotel, but both restaurants were excellent in both the food and service. The Bassoon Bar, in short, is one of the most amazing classic bars I have ever been patronized. Pricey but so worth the experience. Even the one night we ordered rooms service was classy and so elegantly presented. 

The one thing that echoed throughout  our stay was the amazing service everywhere.

We look forward to out next stay at this hotel.",5,2013,05,27
143,Great business hotel near Whitehall,"Excellent room, excellent service from staff esp front desk and porters - one of the only hotels I have been to recently that seems to have friendly english staff in smart attire, yet are not snobby to guests or over-bearing .   Did not eat or go to the gym/pool (pity as it looked good).  Room, which I think was a standard one,  was lovely - huge  bedroom with lots of lighting options, and TV options (i.e. add a console etc.) big bathroom with TV at end of bath.  Probably one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in for work.  Good location.  Not particularly cheap but have stayed in dearer/much worse hotels, so a good review for what seems a luxury hotel but without any of the hang-ups.  I noticed (from my room) that they had a relaxing outdoor area with a fire pit.  Very impressive/opulent without being ""too formal"" - seems they have plenty of staff on hand to help, but not over-bearing.",5,2013,05,26
143,Super swanky,Bling without being in your face. Amazing location and yet quiet and refined inside. London needs more hotels like this- a pre credit crunch refurb that stands out for being tasteful yet opulent. Lovely outdoor area with seating and shade for sunny days and open fires for chilly evenings. Lovely ,5,2013,05,25
143,Experience of a lifetime..,"For the men out there who really want to impress and romance their women, then book into the River Suite at the Corinthia with a bottle of Champagne, for me it was the experience of a lifetime. Its a huge suite with two rooms and truly luxurious in every respect, like a luxury apartment with views to die for - the part facing the Thames has circular windows to give a panoramic view of the whole of the Thames with the London Eye right in front of you and to the right an old historic building. At night with the lights of the Thames, its very romantic. It was very hard to leave the room and do other things!

The bathroom is gorgeous, with a tv set into the wall for when you are relaxing in the bath. The bed is gigantic with very comfortable pillows! The best night sleep I've had in ages. I really did not want to leave. I have travelled extensively with my business in many hotels around the world, and this was definitely one of the best experiences by far.

I had booked a Stay Sunday Spa Monday for my husband's 58th birthday. We were both blown away by the hotel and its excellent facilities with efficient and friendly service, almost beyond the call of duty. I could go on about it forever. Everything was perfect, and Vanessa on Guest Relations did a brilliant job to make us feel so welcome and make everything very special.

The spa was amazing, with a very interesting jacuzzi with lots of different features, more like a dip pool in size, and we both had very professional treatments from the spa staff who were friendly, attentative and experienced. I think there were only 3 or 4 people in the spa so we virtually had it to ourselves.

I would highly recommend this hotel to anybody and everybody. You will not be disappointed and its worth every penny to stay here. The memory will live with me forever. Very special indeed.",5,2013,05,24
143,Dinner at Northall Restaurant,"What a fantastic restaurant with brilliant, attentive, funny and informative waiting staff.  Like the previous reviewer we were making the most of a set dinner deal - three courses with champagne, which was utterly delicious.  Am now determined that we NEED to stay (even if for just one night) in this beautifully designed and decorated hotel.  We will be back!",5,2013,05,22
143,"Very high standard hotel, but with subtle stiffness yet to be overcome. Try the Thermal Floor!","Arriving in the late evening hours to the Corinthia hotel with a lot on my mind, all I really wanted was to get to my room and go to sleep. A doorman immediately approaches my cab, and takes my bags; as there is no ramp to enter the lobby from street level, he has to drag them up six or seven steps. Check-in is fast and friendly, and I’m told my room has been upgraded, but in fact receive a smaller room than when I had stayed at the hotel a couple of months ago (both at the same price point). I struggle a bit to find the best place to put my bags, but no matter … a nice rainshower with lovely ESPA amenities, and off to sleep in the comfy bed, and look forward to the rest of the week’s stay. 

The hotel’s location is a bit quirky in my opinion. I’m used to staying in Mayfair/St James/Belgravia, and the Corinthia's Whitehall/Strand/Embankment area is a bit of a wasteland for me. At the same time, Embankment Tube stop is 30 seconds away from the back door, and there are a bunch of 24-hour shops nearby, which is convenient. Though it depends on what your goals are, I would not say the Corinthia’s location is especially central in London. 

The room’s work area is less a formal “workstation desk”, but a round table with fruit, lamp, and padded chairs. I find it a bit more relaxed and inviting. The nearby wall panel has a huge assortment of A/V plugs, as well as electricity outlets in EU, UK, and US formats already in the wall. Internet is free, but WiFi is a bit slow and rickety. The day is saved by the LAN cable, which though took a bit of effort to find, delivered the speed and capacity needed to deal with a high volume of large email files. The all-marble bathroom outshines the bedroom, with better lighting, almost equal space, a great rainshower, and a deep & fast-filling tub. The hotel even provides bath salts, which is not that common in my experience. 

Service is keen, but sometimes channeled in the wrong direction. An example: I asked for my shoes to be returned from shining by 6:00am, and receive a phone call at 6:02am informing me that a member of staff is waiting outside my door, but won’t knock because Do Not Disturb is illuminated. Luckily I was up at the time due to jet lag, but had I been fitfully sleeping with DND on and been woken up with such a phone call, I’d be quite angry. Have they ever heard of just leaving them by the door and honouring the principle of DND? I was also disturbed by someone knocking to check if I was missing a tea cup. I was, but who cares at 10:00pm? Also, the latter member of staff actually entered the room while I was in the bathroom, and I had to run out and see who the “intruder” was.

The investment in the building itself is the hotel’s strong point. While the main chandelier in the Moon Crescent lobby is an eye-catcher at first, the design can become a bit over the top or even too conspicuously grand over time. It would have been better to spend a bit more time developing a better cocktail list, which lacked character and was somewhat overpriced in my opinion. (I speak only for the lobby - I did not try the bar.)

The real star of the show is the spa’s Thermal Floor, a whole level dedicated to water and warmth. A large pool, an incredible relaxation pool (bubble beds and individual bubble silos, as well as a waterfall for back and neck massage), scalding hot steam sauna just the way I like, and a very large and very Scandinavian dry sauna. Spending an hour here wrings out all the tension from my body.

Overall, the hotel is run at a very high standard and deserves a high ranking, but it still seems like a shiny new pair of shoes that need working in. It may be the location, may be the size and décor, or perhaps it’s just my taste, but while I enjoyed staying at the hotel, a subtle sense of stiffness could not be overcome.",5,2013,05,20
143,Very good,All as expected. I have to say the staff are tiptop in every regard. I have fond memories from the trip and would expect many more will follow. This was our first stay at the Corinthia hotel and we would be happy to revisit  again.,5,2013,05,16

143,Absolutely Perfect stay at the Corinthia Hotel London!,"Four night stay at the Corinthia this past week.  Absolutely best hotel In London, and best we've ever stayed in (even better than many Four Seasons stays around the world). First time in a Corinthia flagged hotel.

Everything about this hotel was brilliant - location, room (Room 530), service, gym, spa, dining (Massimo is amazing!), Lobby Bar, Nespresso machine in-room.  

Can't wait to get back to the Corinthia.  No better place to stay in London.  You will not be disappointed....",5,2013,05,15
143,"Superb every step of the way, cut above","Before arriving, I had success in being helped arrange transport as well as tours through the concierge, who was very helpful the entire time.  
I arrived from a 10 hour flight from the states, warm greeting by everyone in the front as well as the reception. Very easy checkin, they showed me to my room personally and showed me how to use all of the electronics (AC, tea maker, etc) as most hotels leave you to figure out on your own.  I am not a fan of English food (fried, heavy creams, lots of butter & salt) so I sort of custom ordered everything the whole time and was very pleased.  If I order a plain chicken breast and steamed veg with nothing on it, its usually burnt, dry, chewy and just fuel for my body, but the Corinthia went the extra mile to cook everything perfectly and it was so tasty! Even down to the splurge of my fresh homemade green apple sorbet. MMM...
The bed was very comfortable, which is hard to say in a lot of places.  The noise level was non-exsistant being that I was overlooking a busy street.  It was nice to open the windows and hear the horses clicking down the road etc though. The cleanliness was AMAZING and I am SUPER picky about that! I won't ever step on the floor of a hotel without my slippers on, but I did in this room because it was that clean. Everything looks new still, most 5* hotels that have been around for a while show aging on the carpet, furniture etc. but not this one. 
The next day I went to the spa, the day I had to adjust to the time zone.  I emailed them prior telling them my specifications to what sort of massage I required, otherwise if it wasn't deep tissue enough, I would pass.  They recommened Angel, a male therapist-which I normally only have women, however they were right, it was literally THE best massage I ever had! Wish he'd come to the states! He was professional so I never felt awkward or tense being that he was male and the massage perfect! Highly recommend him, I added a 25min foot massage at the end which was heaven. Then had a facial, very pleasant girl, not too big on facials but it was so relaxing I almost fell asleep. 
Next day before I had to start working, I visited the gym and every morning thereafter. It was the only gym I have been to travleling that allowed me to get a normal workout in. Sure, the machines were a little different than what I am spoiled with at home but it was more than perfect. I do wish they had normal spin bikes though, they have a spin bike game of some sort where you have to ride through a video course increasing resistance-didn't care for it so did other stuff. 
Every single person I came across was VERY friendly, helpful and professional. I can't say enough of this place.  They exceeded my exectations and for people that know me, that is really a tough challenge. 

What else, hairdryer was great (I have super thick hair)...Tour guide was great that they recommended for my day off. As always be sure to visit Harrods though! Tea room has a taster dish called the Mayfair-do try it! Its very authentic London. Great time! Thanks again Corinthia staff! I wish you had a hotel in Vegas where I live!",5,2013,05,15
143,Perfection in every way,"We stayed at the hotel as a birthday treat from our children for my husband. What a treat it was from the moment we arrived. The staff are all so courteous and friendly . Our room was perfect in every way with views of the London eye and House of Parliament .Spotlessly clean with lovely fluffy towels and beautiful bed linen on the most comfortable bed.
The decor throughout the hotel is just beautiful and full use has been made of all the original features when it was originally built. We ended our first evening with cocktails a must if you stay and worth every penny.Started the day in the spa which was wonderful and then had probably the best afternoon tea  we have ever had and have been to most of the other hotels famous for it.There are cheaper places to stay in London but the Corinthia is a luxurious hotel well worth paying a bit extra so treat yourself and enjoy the great location.",5,2013,05,13
143,FANTASTIC,"What a find. For my recent 3 nights stay, in Room 612, The Corinthia was simply perfect in every way. From the fast check in and warm welcome to the room itself which was beautifully done. Great bed, superb bathroom and amenities and so quiet. Everyone on the staff is just so well trained and professional and always helpful and responding to your most mundane request so rapidly and cheerfully. The room service is exceptional. The food just perfect each time.
Also, quite amazing in a hotel of this class: FREE WIFI. Many others, like Claridge's, Dorchester, Grosvenor house should follow this rare example. BRAVO to the Corinthia.
The location is ultra convenient but you don't feel that just so close you are in the midst of the bustle and crowds of Trafalgar square and touristy Westminster. 
Have already highly recommended the hotel to a lot of friends and just hope to come back.",5,2013,05,12
143,A SPA fit for the romans,"attended for a spa day with friends. luxurious and trendy venue. amazing treatments, best pedicure ever. fantastic massage and great light lunch. thoroughly recommended. best spa in london...mrs onion",5,2013,05,12
143,GREAT DELUXE COMFORT,"We stayed at this hotel for my birthday break in London. It was just the job. Well located for the sightseeing we had planned, The National Portrait Gallery and Greenwich which you can get to on the river from Westminster Pier, a short walk away. The hotel is 2 years old and of a very high standard, at least comparable to the Savoy Claridges  the Connaught etc. However it does not have the heritage of those landmarks but nor does it charge their prices. 
Décor is contemporary in the rooms and of a very high standard and the amenities are what you would expect. The rain shower went down a storm, sorry! Little engineering problem with the bath shower valve was sorted in an instant. Massimos restaurant (mainly fish) was good but meat eaters would not be satisfied and my wife would not return but the hotel has another restaurant which we must try next time. The breakfast buffet is  top notch with something for everyone but it is probably best to get a rate inclusive of breakfast as it is on the expensive side. If you want 5 start deluxe in London you will be please with this hotel.",5,2013,05,12
143,Outstanding in every way,"I love the modern, elegant decor.  Rooms are well-appointed and housekeeping is impeccable.  Staff is helpful and friendly.  The pools and spa are luxurious and brought a welcome feeling of isolation.  I've never been so depressed to leave a hotel and I can't wait to return.",5,2013,05,08
143,Birthday weekend,"My Partner and I have our evening meai in this hotel, all I can say is wow!!!!! Its was the most amazing place, and amstophe. Our young gentlemen waiter who name was Fabrizio was brilliant, very attention but not in your face he was really good. The meal was the best I have experince so far aas the steak just melted. I cannot wait to go again. Thank you for a lovely Birthday meail experince.",5,2013,05,08
143,New Favorite in London,"I have stayed at the Corinthia close to a dozen times and it has become my new favorite in London.  Over the years I have regularly stayed at virtually all of the luxury hotels in London and I still put the Corinthia above the rest.  It may not have the long history and patina of the Savoy or Ritz or Connaught etc, but it has everything that the modern traveler needs.  Staff is excellent, friendly and helpful.  On my last visit the concierge managed a very last minute reservation at Novikov for dinner, confirmed promptly by SMS and followed up the next day to make sure everything had worked out well.  Rooms are unbeatable.  Large, clean, stylishly comfortable with many nice touches.  Baths are well done with heated floors and everything you'd expect in a five star hotel.  Spa and fitness facility are perfect and the location is outstanding.....close to everything including Embankment tube station and Charing Cross rail station.  Restaurants including Massimo and the bar are also up to par.  All in all, an outstanding package and well deserving of the very high Tripadvisor rating.  Highly recommended.",5,2013,05,07
143,Best hotel in London,"The Corinthia is just like a second home. The best feature is that you are able to watch tv while sitting in the bath. Besides that the rooms are beautiful!
I also enjoy breakfast which can be ordered as take away. I just loooove it!,,,",5,2013,05,07
143,One of the world's great hotels,"The artistic decor is unique. The efficient, friendly staff is from dozens of countries so they speak Engish + other languages. Breakfast buffet is great. Afternoon tea is lavish. Equal to Peninsula, Mandarin, Four Seasons. Large rooms. Free Internet & Nespresso machine in room. Free shoeshine. Heated bathroom floor. TV on bathtub wall. Hermes toiletries. Bed reading light is bright. Easy-to-use light switches include ""mood lighting."" Free newspapers from several countries, including Wall St. J. & Intl Herald-Tribune. Many other superb features but this has a 200-word minimum.",5,2013,05,07
143,Afternoon tea,I went today for afternoon tea and there was a delay in our sitting which they apologised for but then they took 30 minutes to serve us!  There were 7 of us and the 4 little tables were separated so it did not feel intimate.  There wasn't a Victoria sponge or Bakewell tart even though it was on the menu.  All the flavours were subtle sometimes too subtle except for the rhubarb jelly which had so much alcohol that it made you balk.   It was a shame because the pictures on their website made the cakes look so amazing but I was disappointed and won't be going back or recommending to anyone.  My friends all agreed that it was not as good as the other places they have been to.  Pity too because this is the first time I have been to afternoon tea and it was not as enjoyable as I had hoped,2,2013,05,05
143,Excellent!,"Everything worked out well on our long weekend escapade.... Breakfast is good and the quality of the food top. At the bar you find almost every drink you ask for. Rooms are spacious (for London) and clean, clean, clean. We really enjoyed our stay here and would seriously consider coming back to Corinthia if in London. Location is also great and the building it self beautiful.",5,2013,05,05
143,Afternoon tea in modern style,"Very well designed modern interior, very light, comfortable seats. Tasty selection of teas, sandwiches, scones and pastries. A good no rush service, offered takeaway box for the desserts we didn't finish. Just a minute away from Embankment. Worth the price.",5,2013,05,05
143,Great 5* London Hotel,"Needing to stay over for business & wanting to be close to my appointments chose this hotel.

As you would expect with a 5* hotel, the service is top notch, from the quick, effortless checking in, where the staff are very personable and welcoming, to the large spacious rooms (good for a London Hotel) and great location, this hotel is worth spending a little extra on, if you can. I found the bed very comfortable.

I found the bar very welcoming, and again service was fantastic, with almost any drink you want being available. 

I did not use the restaurant, but from what i saw, you get the same excellent treatment there as much as the rest of the hotel.

I noticed a lot of 'touristy' guests at the hotel, but nothing to put me off my stay.

Speak with the staff, and tell them how you feel, or what you would like, and they will oblige with no fuss at all, (not all us Brits ask, just moan!), my requests were accommodated quickly and without issue.

Recommend a stay here, if you have the budget and would like something special - I will return.",5,2013,05,04
143,good hotel.,"This truly is a very good hotel. London offers a variety of way too expensive, was to low service hotels in dodgy areas. When I was sent there I thought that I got really lucky this time. The hotel offers very friendly and helpful service.",4,2013,05,04
143,Absolutely Pampered: The Corinthia is the Place to Stay,"We stayed six amazing nights at the Corinthia. Generally,when traveling abroad we choose the Small Luxury Hotels group, but made a change this trip based on Corinthia online reviews. For the past 6 months I have worked with the Corinthia concierge team (including a very helpful Sebastian) to plan our trip to perfection. We arranged for private pick up from the airport and were driven in a spacious Jaguar XJL to the hotel. The ride was comfortable and eased our traveling exhaustion. Upon check in we were given a private tour of the hotel. We had requested a city view room, and were apologized to that the room did not have a clear view of the Thames but had been upgraded as best possible. It was all too incredible to believe! We had a large walk-in closet in our room, the first time ever. The room decor was modern and beautiful. I can truly say the online photos do not do the rooms justice. The staff was quick and attentive. In the entire stay, all attention to even the smallest of details was considered. The concierge continued to help with our itinerary and was very responsive to our needs. Of all the restaurants we dined at over the week, Massimo was our favorite (see separate review). The location of the hotel was ridiculously close to everything we wanted to see and do, just a couple blocks from Covent Garden and Trafalgar Square. 

This was my third trip to London. Our stay at the Corinthia made the trip unparalleled and we will definitely return. We were made to feel like royalty, completely pampered throughout the time we were there. This stay has set a new standard for our future travels. I am forever spoiled and I could not imagine staying anywhere else in London.

143,Dined at the Massimo Oyster restaurant,Me and my sister dined at the Massimo restaurant located within the Corinthia hotel although we never intended to go to the hotel itself I must admit it is a beautiful and luxurious hotel. Although like the menu prices it may well be quite pricey if you're staying there. Having done a bit of research I'm not surprised as the like of Kanye West and other celebs may be drawn to this delightful hotel. It's no wonder we felt a little out of place with nothing but our casual attire on,5,2013,05,03
143,"Several revisits to this excellent, if pricey, bar","The Corinthia has become my go-to bar when in the West End. Ever since my first visit at the beginning of the year, I have been recommending Tamas and his bar team to colleagues and friends alike, as here they really deliver great service and spectacular drinks.

You need a hefty wallet or corporate expense card as it is a pricey hotel bar, but then again it is less expensive than the Long Bar at the Sanderson, and much better in standard.

Superb",5,2013,05,02
143,"Beautiful rooms, great location, attentive service","I spent close to a week in Corinthia on business and loved the hotel. Just a stone's throw away from the Embankment, travelling was an ease on the tube.

Staff are attentive and recognised me without being intrusive. Kudos to the team there. Lobby and dining rooms are well appointment, bright and cheery.

Perhaps they have one of the best beds in town. I was well rested every night and heated flooring in the bathroom was a great welcome after showers. I also loved the room layout as it was really comfortable. 

Internet access was great - strong signals and easily accessible (no password required). My only gripe about the hotel is the breakfast spread which is rather limited - same food every day on the buffet with only 1 item changed daily.",5,2013,04,30
143,Fantastic service,"My husband and I stayed there for his birthday last Saturday and had a truly amazing time. It was my second visit and I emailed the hotel beforehand to tell them that it was my husband's birthday and they arranged a beautiful cake in his favourite flavour and a bottle of champagne.

When we arrived the check in was prompt and flawless, with a very personal welcome.

The room was beautiful and very spacious and the bath with tv was my personal favourite.

We had lunch in the lobby lounge, drinks in the Bassoon Bar, dinner and breakfast in the Northall.

The breakfast buffet was my personal favourite, but the food was good in all of the restaurants.

This hotel is a good 5 star with good facilities, but for me it was the exceptional service that really makes this hotel stand out. Everyone from the doormen to the waitresses and barmen bend over backwards to help you no matter who you are. 

The 24 hour check out is also an excellent unique feature which they have refined since my last stay.

All in all, a class hotel in a fantastic location.

Can't wait to return.",5,2013,04,29
143,Best Birthday Present...Ever !!,"Just back from a fabulous weekend at the Corinthia to kick off my 40th birthday celebrations.  From booking to check out the experience was perfect.  A very special thank you to Louisa and Nuno for making our stay extra special after back and forth emails, each responded to quickly and professionally.We stayed in an Executive Family Room with 2 double beds, a beautiful bathroom with a seperate shower and a lovely balcony overlooking the courtyard.
Upon arrival at the hotel at 4am my car was whisked away with without any fuss and we were directed to reception where check in was friendly, efficient and simple.  Our bags were carried to our room and we were greeted with a  bottle of chilled Champagne, a Happy Birthday chocolate cake, fresh fruit and a personalised note wishing me Many Happy Returns and that we enjoy our stay.  We definitely did !
The 24 hour check in/check out is amazing and unique in London I think - we requested a 3am check in (we were running late) and a 7pm check out all of which was confirmed without any hesitation or fuss and no extra charge....wonderful and condusive to a relaxing weekend, thank you.
Unfortunately we didn't experience any of the hotels bars or restaurants (next time definitely !!) however the hotel is stunning and in a perfect location.  We were seeing a matinee at the National - few steps to the Jubilee Bridge with stunning views of the London Eye and Parliament and within 10 minutes were at the theatre.  We also ran out of time so we didnt use the Spa either...next time.
I'm now on a mission to find another 'excuse' to visit London and stay in this beautiful hotel - definitely won't stay anywhere else, it is exquisite !

If it's understated luxury and impeccable service that you are looking for - look no further, this is it !",5,2013,04,29
143,Amazing Hotel!,"We want to thank the staff at the Corinthia Hotel for making our anniversary trip to London so memorable! Starting with booking our hotel, I immediately sent an email requesting, if possible ,a room with a city view. Within hours I received a reply from the hotel saying they would do their best to accomodate us. And boy, did the! We got an amazing room with a beautiful view of the London Eagle Eye. The hotel itself is beautiful, but the staff makes it even more special with their attentiveness. They remember your name! The rooms are elegant and spacious. We had dinner at Northhall restaurant and the food was excellent. The lobby bar was great and they have a very cute patio with 2 fireplaces, which we used while sitting outside one chilly night. Staying there was one of the highlights of our trip. The only thing that would've made it better was it we had been able to use the spa, but hopefully we'll come back one day. Cannot recommend highly enough!! Do not hesitate to book!!",5,2013,04,26
143,QUALITY LONDON PROPERTY,"My wife and I enjoyed 9 nights at the Corinthia in March. Rooms very well appointed with quality fittings and our deluxe king room had an interesting street view with no noise to disturb sleep. We had a superb meal in Massimo (roast plaice was delicious!). Very impressed with Darren and his concierge team and the doormen were the best we have come across anywhere in the world. If we had a criticism it would be of the Bassoon Bar which we felt was very lacking in atmosphere, certainly compared to the Beaufort and American bars in the Savoy where we had stayed on our last visit to London, perhaps because there was very few people on the couple of occasions we tried it. Drinks were overpriced we felt.
But overall we loved the hotel and it's very convenient location and would stay again.",5,2013,04,24
143,Ideal luxury hotel in perfect location,"I cannot fault this hotel - the location just off Trafalgar Square was perfect, the staff attentive, the ambience elegant.  The bathrooms are huge and the beds comfortable.  I can't wait to return - this will now be my top recommendation for a luxury hotel in London.",5,2013,04,23
143,"Promenade theatre, just the way to view the Corinthia...","I have never stayed here, but previously have enjoyed a wedding dinner in Massimo's, the Italian restaurant, which was excellent. 

Recently I entertained a party of 7 friends to Promenade Theatre at the Corinthia. This is where you are whisked around the hotel as part of the plot in a theatrical experience where you individually are the centre of attention. I had feared cringe inducing audience participation, but this is much more subtle and not to be feared - you and your guests certainly have much to discuss over a lively dinner afterwards. I had booked Massimo's once more and the hotel gave me a theatre menu deal, which was very well received by our party.

Otherwise, the experience of seeing this wonderful hotel via Promenade Theatre confirms the 5 star status. The Corinthia have an exciting Artist in Residence programme, so watch out for other intriguing entertainment that they intend to put on !!",5,2013,04,23
143,Return visit - didn't disappoint,"Returned to the Corinthia for the second time last weekend and had another great stay. The hotel is special in every way. We were looked after extremely well and the staff were, once again, excellent.",5,2013,04,22
143,Worth it,"We stayed for two nights in mid-April.  We had a deluxe junior suite and from the moment we arrived in our hire car our stay was flawless.  We pulled up and 3 doormen helped us gather all of our belongings from a week of driving out of the hire car, then parked it for us and held it free of charge until the hire car company picked it up.  A lovely bottle of champagne awaited us in the suite.

We spent a wonderful afternoon at the spa... we were disappointed we hadn't booked more treatments, it is absolutely worth it!

As international tourists we also loved the small Harrods store in the lobby, wonderful to be able to purchase a few last minute forgotten gifts without going out.",5,2013,04,22
143,Amazing stay at Corinthia,"I have to say I have stayed in many 5* hotels and this is probably the best so far.  My favourite usual haunt when staying in London has been the Landmark however Corinthia has now replaced that.
Unfortunately I only had a one night stay with my daughter, but from the evening meal, breakfast and afternoon tea to the fantastic room and oh so comfortable beds to the most relaxing Espa Thermal floor, I could not find one thing to fault.
The 24 hour check-in and out time was brilliant and added that extra touch - no more rushing after breakfast to pack and get out before 12 noon and what a difference that made.

I hope that I might be able to stay again for my BIG birthday and enjoy all the extra touches that this hotel offers.  Whoever thought of those added 'extra's' WELL DONE because it certainly makes Corinthia stand out head and shoulders above the rest.

I will certainly be using this hotel for business trips to London in future and hope to bring the rest of the family soon, as I am sure once I tell them all about the stay they will be so jealous.
Thank you everyone for an amazing and relaxing stay.",5,2013,04,20
143,Charismatic Corinthia,"A lovely hotel.  Modern features in a historic building.  The staff was wonderful. Couldn't have been more helpful.   The morning breakfast buffet was delightful.  They have a lovely courtyard and the rooms facing the courtyard enjoy a french balcony.  There is a power center that accommodated all power cords.  Fantastic rain shower head.  Even a television set built in to bathtub wall.  The location was so nice.  Near the Thames, underground. Trafalgar Square and Covent Garden an easy walk.  Oh, and did I mention the beautiful lobby and all the fresh flowers?",5,2013,04,19
143,Ace hotel,"My wife booked us a suite at the Corinthia for my birthday. Loved everything about it. The rooms and public areas all speak of no-expense spared luxury without tipping into bling. The whole place has been very stylishly designed. Service by pleasant, friendly, knowledgeable and enthusiastic staff. Two fantastic bars (grand, stunning bar to start the evening off, and cosy jazz cafe bar for the end of the night. Excellent location. I'm not generally a spa person, but the spa here lives up to the hype: a genuinely blissfully calm and relaxing place.
Beats the socks off Claridge's and the Dorchester.
Very highly recommended. I loved it.",5,2013,04,19
143,Fabulous Hotel,"This is one of the best hotels I've stayed in. The rooms are amazing, the staff are very friendly, helpful and dedicated. I cannot recommend this place highly enough.

Check in was slick and fast. I liked the attention to detail in showing us to our rooms.

The room was well appointed, quite large and all you would expect from a five star.

The bathroom is incredible, I loved watching TV in the bath. The shower is fantastic as well

You can stay here with confidence. ",5,2013,04,17
143,Flawless and fabulous,"Myself and my partner stayed at the Corinthia over Xmas to celebrate his retirement from the military.  From the moment we arrived, we were highly impressed by the impeccable service, attention to detail, and fabulous surroundings that truely wowed us.  We were fortunate to stay in an executive king room, which was absolutely stunning, and complete with a plentiful supply of Espa products!

The spa is absolutely amazing, and definitely worth spending time luxuriating in!.

The service in the restaurant and bars was also top notch, with little touches like the barman making recomendations for drinks based on our previous evenings consumption!  

The location was also perfect, for sightseeing, and shopping.

On Xmas eve night we both got a little Harrods sequined stocking filled with goodies, which was so delightful!

Our trip was to mark a special occasion, at a special time of year, and we could not have stayed anywhere more perfect.  Thank you to the manager and staff for making our stay extra-special.
We have been lucky enough to stay in many luxury hotels, and we both agree the Corinthia is the absolute best, and cannot wait to return soon.",5,2013,04,16
143,"New favourite hotel ever! Luxurious, contemporary classics","This is possibly the best hotel I have ever stayed in anywhere...(bar the Conrad in the Maldives but that is a different story). The location is fantastic, literally a 2 minute (if that!) walk south from Trafalgar Square, on Northumberland Avenue. The hotel is absolutely beautiful, its renovations was done in such a way that no detail was overlooked, from the little tables outside each room to place your newspaper or room service trays on, to the towel heating rack and the separate shower cubicle for additional privacy, to the fantastic spa facilities. 

Interior:
The hotel is luxuriously decorated with fushia and pale pink orchids placed everywhere in glass bowls. The can deposits you directly in front of the door where the doormen rush out (even in the pouring rain, with an umbrella for you) to help you up the steps, your luggage, into the warmth interior of its beautiful lobby. The lights were cast in a warm glow (given the fact we came late at night, in the rain.....) and we were directed immediately to the front desk by a lovely Japanese lady.
Check in was efficient and we got an upgrade of our room to the Deluxe/Executive.

The lady took us up to our room and explained the amenities and also the WIFI access point, at which point the concierge had taken our luggage up and kindly deposited it onto the luggage racks and wardrobe.

Room:
Our room had a walk in, separate section for a wardrobe! The lights came on automatically when you walked in.
The bathroom was double sink, with a bathtub and a TV on one end and the heated towel rack on the other. I just want to point out that most 5* high end hotels we've been to has not so nice towels. Big, but not the fluffy, luxurious towels you read about. This place DOES have the big, fluffy, soft towels that just makes you want to sink into them after your wash; same with the bathrobes.
The toilet is in a separate compartment inside the bathroom, as is the shower. The shower has the rain shower and the proper one which you can take out of its bracket. The water pressure in this hotel is just amazing! And not just for London standards, but also for Swiss standards too - it was SO powerful.

The whole room has a selection of lighting, from normal ON, to mood lighting, which sets the place in a softer, warmer glow to the bed panels on each side of the bed which controls the lights. Very well thought out with these lighting panels. 
There was also a panel which catered to all the plugs in the world, a separate USB port above it and its own TV, telephony and all these other weirdly lettered portals - everything is so well thought out and modernised in the room; they even provided an array of different sized boxes for your accessories, scattered tastefully about the room to look like decorations.

The showering/wash amenities in the room is from its ESPA spa productions and they smelt heavenly and lathered up in huge amounts on the skin, upon contact with water.

The breakfast buffet was sumptuously delicious, with a wide selection of hot and cold foods. The lady who sat us each morning was a haughty B* who gave the air that you were nothing more than a piece of dirt on her shoe - to pretty much everyone who came in.
The rest fo the waiting staff was attentative, helpful and really efficient.
We took the afternoon tea at the lobby and it was beautiful. They have this great big round table of mirrors which reflected the glass domed ceiling above, housing the most beautiful contemporary chandelier. Large vases of orchids were placed on the table and hte champagne bucket and sweets table was placed against the wall. Little round tables and leather clubs chairs were arranged in sets of two around this large centre piece, whilst more seating arrangements were organised about the rounded lobby lounge. 
The tea was simply delicious and our waitress took the time explaining each plate of delicacies and even offered if we wanted more scones/sandwiches. I had the Laurent-Perrier Rosé afternoon tea which was incredibly expensive, at £58 a head you can find much cheaper elsewhere in London which would also get you a glass of bubbly. 
However, under such wonderful setting, soft music in the background and that wonderful noise of tinkling delicate china, how can one resist?

Spa:
Is this the most perfect spa ever?! You ride the elevator to the M(ezzanine) floor where you are welcomed by the friendliest staff, in the most beautiful spa lobby all done up in cream mother of pearl and shimmering soft lights. You are taken down to stairs to the nail salon & treatment rooms on one floor, the female spa changing areas on another floor - where the corridors winds somewhat confusingly around so the whole structure looks like a curving, shimering beautiful creature.
The mens spa changing areas and gym are one floor further down and is in the appropriate black. The lowest floor is where the swimming pool, steam room, sauna and thermal pools are. Everything is in black stone here, floors and walls, with trails of white/gold veins shot through the stone. small, white light is placed at varying locations and some glass structured wall is placed by the thermal pool, so with the shimmering water reflections, the whole area has an almost mystical quality about it. You pass the lobby of this area (a resting place of sort with water, magazines and leather couches along the wall) underneath an alien sort of lamp with soft veins hanging low down, each with a tiny tiny globe of light - and into a small area where 3 heated (yes HEATED!) marble bed chairs are placed - perfect for those with back/aching joints.
The thermal pool is just beyond where you have several options of jet massages, a steel pole bed on one side and waterfall massage function in another corner, amongst more.

The swimming pool, like the thermal pool, is steel, for hygenic purposes, and lights inside the pool reflects up onto the ceiling like stars on a clear, night sky. Sofas are also lined up by the pool and it was so relaxing to sit there after the steam and the thermal pool followed by a dip in the swimming pool, and to read or do nothing.
The steam room is incredibly hot! Almost too hot to stay there for long......
The sauna was was glass encased box in front of the thermal pool and it was all lovely wood inside. The nicest, cleanest sauna ever! 

The hotel is very expensive but everything is so well thought out, extremely high quality and you can absolutely expect the best for your money!
We will absolutely return to this hotel once more!",5,2013,04,16

143,Truly outstanding hotel,"There's actually nothing that can be criticised here. The location between Embankment and Trafalgar square is superb, the staff are friendly and helpful, public areas luxurious and the room was extremely well-equipped, comfortable and spacious- the TV above the bath is a nice touch. Free Wi-Fi is available throughout the hotel. The 24 hour period available between check-in and check-out is probably unique in London, and is much appreciated.

The spa is large and luxurious, with state-of-the-art facilities (and it was pretty quiet on a Monday morning.) There are also two brilliant and quite different restaurants on-site, Northall (British) and Massimo (Italian,with great seafood.) The lobby lounge is very pleasant for tea or coffee, and you can order their delicious Damian Allsopp chocolate selection to go nicely with a cappucino.",5,2013,04,15
143,Westminister in August,"Lovely hotel perfectly located and within walking distance of excellent landmarks and city walks, gardens,bridges,train stations and the underground. Contemporary with elegant luxurious touches...perfect weather with sporadic rain showers lovely afternoon sunshine and sporadic rain showers..
The showers here are brilliantly designed and the guest services par excellent! The mattress and pillows leave you totally refreshed and invigorated after a long day touring the city. Room service was wonderful.",4,2013,04,15
143,Luxury with character:),"Corinthia might as well be one of the best hotels I stayed in. Everything about it is superb. Location is hard to beat; it's the perfect starting point to wherever you want to go.  And the hotel is just so beautiful, you can tell that every single detail was thought through and that a lot of money has been invested in it. Which doesn't always mean that it will turn out right, but in this case it did 
Last, but not least, as it's proven that hotels are much more about the service than the infrastructure, I have to say that the staff is impeccable. Discreet, and yet fully at disposal. And with a smile too!
As Corinthia is a bit on the expensive side, I believe that it will be reassuring if I say that every penny is well worth it!",5,2013,04,12
143,Stylish & sumptuous,"It is hard to fault this hotel. I rarely stay in a top category hotel and was ready to find it luxurious but bland. In fact, this hotel not only offers excellent facilities but has a strong sense of character. Staff are outstandingly good: warm, attentive, helpful. Room, food and drink are all excellent. Loved watching TV in the bath. Central location could not be better. Great experience. ",5,2013,04,10
143,A Wonderful Experience!,"We were in London for 2 nights to celebrate our silver wedding anniversary and opted for this hotel due to its location and fantastic reviews.
On arrival we were greeted by a very friendly and efficient receptionist who congratulated us on our anniversary and informed us that we had been upgraded to a suite. We were then escorted on a short tour of the hotel before being shown to our bedroom. Champagne was on ice along with a beautiful cake!
The bedroom was huge and furnished in a very modern but elegant fashion - this has to be the nicest hotel room that we have ever stayed in. 
We had booked the lobby lounge for lunch which is excellent - a relaxing area situated under the spectacular Baccarat Chandelier.
In the evening we had booked a meal at the Northall restaurant within the hotel. The ambience, service and quality of food was superb.
Breakfast was served in the Northall restaurant and although busy there was plenty of space between tables and the atmosphere was very relaxed. Again, service and quality of food was 1st class.
Thank you to all the staff at the Corinthia Hotel London for making our stay so enjoyable and i would recommend anyone to stay at this truly 5 star hotel.",5,2013,04,10
143,Bliss - That didn't break the bank!,"We stayed Sunday night and experienced a day at the Spa on Monday! From check in to check out we were spoilt, the service is first class. We've both reflected that every element was wonderful.

The Sunday/ Monday Spa deal was amazing value given the quality as both are fitted out in style.

Will return we hope!",5,2013,04,09
143,So beautiful,"Art deco restaurant, amazing atrium, - for those of us who smoke a wonderful indoor/outdoor garden with roaring fires, the most attentive staff and a wonderful experience. As most hotels in London give good service but nothing more, come for that bit extra and feel so special",5,2013,04,09
143,Family Favourite,"My sister and I had the immense pleasure of staying at the Corinthia last June for 10 days during the Jubilee celebration. We loved it so much we are returning this August and this time bringing 8 more family members! Even my 90-year-old father will be joining us.

This hotel is absolutely beautiful - and the location cannot get any better. Imagine during the festivities last year we were steps from Horseguards and around the corner from all sorts of top sites, theatres, and transportation links. We actually found during this trip that we enjoyed the city buses more than the subway. We were not in an hurry ,you get to see a lot more, and there was less walking...

We stayed in a Deluxe suite and we found it a perfect home away from home. Very comfortable.

We had tea at the hotel but missed an opportunity to try Massimos because they were closed on our last evening. Loved breakfast at Northall and we sampled a variety of drinks at my favourite bar ever.

My sister and I were fascinated with the lovely flower arrangements in the lobby and the surrounding areas. What a talented florist they have! We have just as many photos of the flowers from the hotel as the Flotilla:)

We love this hotel and the city of London.",5,2013,04,08
143,Almost there,"I stayed at the hotel three nights with family of wife and two teenagers. Corinthia hotel is probably one of the best hotels in London. Starting with the welcome from doorkeepers and the magnificent interior to the standard of rooms and food. It is a really beautiful hotel with tasteful decoration and art. The location is also perfect for most purposes with walking distance to the theaters in West End. Since almost everything is perfect I just want to mention areas that could be improved. Reception services are a bit messy and they had difficulties in getting billing in order. The service at breakfast has also some improvement ahead to compete. Since the operation is quite new and every hotel has some starting-up to do, I have no doubt that these details will get in order in time. Overall over a superb stay and I will definately stay at Corinthia again.",5,2013,04,08
143,Perfect,"This hotel was stunning and perfect from the second we entered. We were visiting for our anniversary. Every single member of staff were friendly, helpful and professional. We had let them know it was an important anniversary and everyone we encountered knew. We had a room upgrade, extended time on our massage and a welcome cake. Even with that aside, this hotel is absolutely stunning. The decor is fantastic, with thought having gone into every part of it. Rooms were luxurious and large. I cannot praise it enough, it is the most beautiful, best service, wonderful spa and brilliant food. we took afternoon tea which was gorgeous. We had massages which were bliss and we ate in massimo which was delicious. I am going to be heading here on a regular basis.",5,2013,04,07
143,Simply sensational,"This was my third weekend stay and was absolutely fantastic. We stayed from Easter Sunday to Easter Monday this time on a ""Stay Sunday, Spa Monday"" rate which was great value. Check in was a breeze, and we were quickly taken to our beautiful room on the 4th floor. The room was spotlessly clean with everything in working order. I don't know what it is about this hotel but you kind of feel like you're the only guests there! During all my visits I have very rarely met any other guests either in the lobby or hallways, and once you are in your room you never hear nearby doors slamming or other noise, it really is a haven of tranquility. I think some of this may be because of the 24 hour check in/out policy. It prevents there being hordes of people waiting in the lobby at set times. 

We went out to explore London and on our return there was a bottle of wine and Lindt easter bunny waiting for us along with a handwritten welcome back note which is always a nice touch. I used the thermal floor which is very relaxing and then we had dinner at The Northall which was delicious as always with superior service. 

We had emailed in advance asking for a DVD player in the room and this was present on check in, and requests for extra pillows etc from housekeeping were handled speedily. 

On Easter Monday we had a late breakfast and service was vastly improved from our previous two experiences. The ladies working the breakfast shift were all very polite, attentive and willing to help and this was great to see. We later checked in at the spa for our treatments. Unfortunately overnight it seemed that the swimming pool was not in service which was disappointing, but these things happen, not the fault of the staff who seemed to be getting a bit of a hard time from some guests. The personalised massage I received was excellent as were the other spa facilities. 

When it came time to check out (and thus return to reality and work the next day) I was devastated! Despite this hotel being in central London and within arms length of most touring/shopping sites you truly do feel as though you are cocooned from the hustle and bustle and can truly relax.

I've stayed at a lot of five star hotels in London, including The Langham, The Atheneaeum and The Savoy, but this hotel is top of the list in my opinion. Everything comes together, including beautiful rooms, top notch service and amenities, excellent location and a lovely lobby and spa area, If you can afford it, there is genuinely no better hotel in London at the moment. If you book, you will not be disappointed. I have already booked another stay in August and am counting down the days!",5,2013,04,06
143,Finally a Modern 5 Star Hotel in London like the ones you'll find in Hong Kong,"Doormen greetings: Fantastic.  Could not ask for more.

Receptionist: Poor command of English, took at least 20 minutes to check in.  Huge let down.

Amenities: aplenty.

Room: Spacious for London.  Quite comfortable. Nice bed linen. Nespresso. 

Bathroom: Heated floor, super water pressure, filtered clean water.  Simply the best.

Room service food: Fast delivery, good quality.  Very impressive.

Right now my favourite is Savoy just because I prefer classic interior design.  However, 
Corinthia is equally my favourite in London for all points stated above.  Still, there is a 
theething problems but minor issues.",5,2013,04,04
143,Fabulous,"This is a fabulous hotel in a great location minutes from Big Ben, Trafalger Square, South Bank, Buckingham Palace, Leicester Square, Covent garden..........
The hotel itself is plush and elegant and fortunately lacks the 'chintzy' and some what 'stuffy' feel that some of Londons 5 star properties exude.

We were allocated a junior suite, which was modern, opulent and of good size, with a huge walk in wardrobe. 
Bedroom and bathroom amenties were excellent and attention to detail fantastic, with all the nice little touches that you expect to find in a hotel of this standard and more.
The room itself overlooked the triangular inner courtyard of the building which may not have been to everyone's taste due to the limited view, but this has the added benefit on no road noise, in fact it was so quiet you forgot you were in the heart of the City.
I found the bed/ pillows extremely comfortable although the feather duvet was too warm even with the A/C on low.

The pool/spa area although small is amazing, it's a dark almost subterranean world and unusually is probably just as inviting for both men and women due to its interesting features.
The area itself is kept extremely clean and well tended and has set hours for children which is a real plus if you just want to relax. 

Dinner in the Northall bar was good. 

The drinks service in the Bassoon bar was a little slow but it had a good range of bar snacks, however it lacked atmosphere and had several young children present when we entered at 10pm.

We opted for the buffet breakfast which has a good range and some hot dishes, although a la carte is available if you prefer. Unfortunately we were not offered any toast, but only a minor point.

The hotel shop and florist is a nice touch with reasonably priced Harrods gifts. 

Service in the hotel was efficient and friendly and we would definately recommend this hotel, and hope to return in the not too distant future.",5,2013,04,03
143,I can't believe this hasn't made it to number one yet!,"OK, it's not cheap and the rooms aren't huge. But this is the centre of London and a five star hotel! They are the only negatives, everything else about this place is just simply off the clock.
The service is excellent, nothing is too much trouble for any of the staff and the location is unbeatable. The tube is over the road, so is the river and so is trafalgar Square.
And as for the spa, I think that's probably the best I've ever seen.
Push the boat out and stay at the Corinthia, you won't regret it.",5,2013,04,03
143,Absolutely the best in London,"We stayed at the hotel for four nights on a family vacation and we loved the hotel. The rooms were large by london standards. The health club and spa were unbelieavably nice. The spa includes a steam room, sauna, large whirl pool and a small pool. Each day after sighteeing we would go to the spa and then go out for dinner. Our teenagers loved the spa. The staffs is very friendly, helpful and accommodating. This is a wonderful hotel and deserve top marks. Is in a great location - close to all the sites you will want to visit and close to the Embarkment tube station. We highly recommend staying at this hotel. You will be treated vey well and will enjoy your time there. My children did not want to leave.",5,2013,04,02
143,Nice hotel with a little bit of let down,"Our London trip was very intense as we have many family and friends visits in London.  We chose Corinthia Hotel to have a short stay in town.  It is a very beautiful hotel indeed.  I was impressed with the bathroom especially, the warm marble floor is a very nice touch for the cold winter days in London.  Overall, our stay there was pleasant and the little box of chocolate in the room is sweet thought.  However, the room service placed a note in our room addressing to another couple. It is a bit of let down when you think the hotel has place a sweet note for our staying there, but turn out to be another couple. To be honest, it appeared as the hotel didn't really ""welcome"" our stay.  Also, the room service did not apologize to us when he came to pick up the ""wrong note"".",4,2013,04,02
143,B E S T IN  L O N D O N,"Stayed form2 nights 29/3 Rm 515

Just had a lovely 2 night  stay at this well located hotel in London. The hotel is a stones throw from Trafalgar Square and within easy walking distance of so many of the sites. For tube lovers it is 1 min stroke from Embankment Station. During the day the taxi fare from Paddington is about £20-25.

ARRIVAL:

On arrival we were met from our cab and our luggage taken which was later delivered to our room by NIck from Concierge. Friendly and engaging - excellent.

RECEPTION:

The check in process was excellent with Guest Relations warmly welcoming us as if we were long lost friends. She also made sure to personally introduce us to our 2 children (14 and 12) who were most impressed as were we . We were offered a tour but instead decided to have a round later and head on to our room 515. Well done.

 This is the key area within a review of a hotel that gives the first impression / the elevator pitch etc and we were most impressed - well done.

GUEST ROOM:

Gorgeous room as one might imagine, large and spacious, 2 double beds, Nespresso machine, groovy safe, impressive mood lighting system, amazing bathroom even with a TV for the bath and ESPA toiletries. 

The most powerful free wifi I have ever experienced...great for me, kids, business.

Being Easter weekend there was even a Lint Easter Bunny for the kids to share...nice touch. Well done. All very happy

Day 2 after returning from dinner, more easter bunnies and hot cross buns awaited us - wow!

THE SPA:

We went to have a look at the spa. The receptionist was surprisingly a bit frosty and uninterested offering us an ipad tour which we politely declined. They have an understandable policy for specific times for children. No Matter. 

As we walked off am male colleague quickly caught up with us to professionally explained the children policy and apologise. For me he recovered the first discussion really well. 

We decided to visit the spa the following day at the right time. This visit was good but it seems apparent that it is independently managed as the ""we value you"" approach you get in the hotel isn't there. The spa itself is wonderful but I think there is a training requirement here I suspect it is managed by ESPA. More could be made of this if they were to get then service right as per the rest of the building, an easy fix for someone to grab on to.

THE BAR:

A warm welcome but the chap behind the bar who recognised me from when I was last here. We loved it and were made to feel very special. Had a glass of sav blanc each and the kids had Devine lemonade. Served with extras such as amazing olives etc. well done. This chap is excellent and a mind of information - really impressed

We were so impressed that we went the following evening and unsurprisingly it was excellent with great service and respect throughout.

SERVICING OF ROOMS:

The turndown service when we arrived back from dinner was impressive. Beds read with 4 dressing gowns beautifully laid out. Everything was neat and tidy added to which the lady who I am guessing had done it was friendly and chatty in the corridor. 

Well done - could not have been better.

BREAKFAST:

Unbeatable and attentive. Every meat, fruit, cereal, bread, tea,coffee,you could ever ask for. But.....so attentive. Offers to go and top up juice. Plates cleared as soon as cutlery crossed. 

They have got this just right.

LOBBY:

Decor is stunning - lots of places to sit whether as a group, an intimate one to one or a private business meeting. This focuses on a central area which is gorgeous and the sound proofing works so you ate not homing in unintentionally on other discussions.

There is an outside courtyard with cool sofa seating and an open fire at each end which makes it ideal for smokers, meetings etc.

t the rear entrance it feels like the reception as there is a further open area which leads on to a florist (amazing orchids) and a mini Harrods which is quite something.

FRONT DOOR:

After dinner on the second night we arrived home with the kids and the guys on the door were smiling and welcoming us ""home"" - so polite and so interested to check that we had a great night 

SUMMARY: 

The best hotel in London in which I have stayed.

This hotel has pride, a heart beat and a personality. They strive to excel. You feel that they all really bond as a team with everyone knowing what is required of them. They are in it for the long term.

The staff are like a family and they all seem to really gel. Everyone greets you with a cost free but valuable smile. It is a happy place - a real home from home that we all dream of.

I have tweeted, Face Bkd and LinkedIn my thoughts and the hotel came back within minutes to say thanks for the tweet! That is impressive. Someone obviously embraces social media and acknowledges that this is how folk ( like me) communicate and more importantly research ahead of meetings, meals and stays...all of which spread the word and generate initial and ongoing income.  

Would I return and would I recommend - most definitely.",5,2013,03,31
143,"Tiny, cramped suite with appalling restaurant service!","When we entered the newly opened Corinthia hotel it looked quite appealing.  Checked in by a very pleasant receptionist who showed us around the hotel and then to our room.  The restaurants and lounge areas looked good but the lounge area seemed very ""choked"" with people.  It took a long time to reach our room and, to be honest, if I had been staying there alone I would have got lost through the mazes we had to encounter before reaching one of the smallest bedrooms I have every stayed in......this room was a suite!!  The problem was they had divided the space so that a large area was taken up by an entrance hallway and a walk in closet, so not much left in the footage for the bedroom - nothing like the spacious room I had viewed on line when booking!!  I was given a pretty hard sell on the spa but we were shopping that afternoon, planned an early dinner (the concierge booked our table for &pm in the hotel's Italian restaurant) and as we were up at 4am for a flight - time did not allow for spas.  When we arrived at the restaurant there was a huge fuss between the staff (2 young girls who were flustered and didn't know what to do!) nobody could find our booking although we were actually present in the restaurant earlier that afternoon when the table was being booked!!  It took about 5 minutes to seat us despite the restaurant only being about 20% full!!  We were not offered drinks but left seated for another 15 minutes until eventually a young girl came and asked if we would all like a glass of Prosecco, she seemed very bemused when I replied ""no thank you"", so she just turned and walked away - VERY ODD!! We felt left and forgotten by a group of very inexperienced and incompetent staff!!  I had to physically go and get somebody to ask us for drinks and to take our order as we had booked an early table for a reason - an early flight the next day!  The waiter was totally ""in our faces"", kept interrupting our family conversation with nothing in particualr and he was there inappropriately throughout the whole of the meal - one extreme to another.  We were brought the wrong meals and when the right food eventually turned up my daughter needed the bathroom, this was such a long distance away from the restaurant that I had to ask them to remove her meal and keep it warm until she returned!!  It prevented me from going to the bathroom too!!  The bed was like a rock so I had NO sleep but a stiff neck!  Also, the bathroom window was totally clear glass and overlooked by the buildings opposite - really bad design to not have opaque glass. As we showered as soon as we arrived at the hotel in the afternoon it was only luck that I noticed this faulty design and drew down the blind! The hotel was very lacking in lots of areas I would expect to be perfect for a 5 star.  The location of the bedrooms seemed like a rabbit warren and I felt immediately this was a fire hazard!  The hotel is too big and impersonal for our liking.  The staff in the Italian restaurant require an awful lot of training and attention to detail.  We know to avoid the Corinthia in London and would not recommend this hotel!!",2,2013,03,30
143,Must Return to the Corinthia Hotel,"We stayed at the Corinthia hotel during Christmas, and it was the first time we've been to London. The entire city virtually shutdown during Christmas holiday with few taxi available to commute around, so we decided to stay in the hotel to enjoy the restaurant, bar and spa all of which was fantastic. 

The quality and selection of the breakfast is very good--definitely much better than most five stars hotel I've been to. The staffs are  friendly, helpful and accommodating. The two staffs who stood out for us in term of providing outstanding service were Julian the night time manger and Mario the bartender.  Normally, I do not use the hotel spa but the Corinthia, by far, was one of the best spa. For me, the highlight of the hotel is the spa. 

I really appreciate the decor of the hotel and was impressed by how the Corinthia is a well thought-out hotel in terms of the infrastructure and technology. This is a detail oriented and well managed hotel. This is a wonderful hotel and deserve top marks. However, a minor downside of the Corinthia is that it lacks the ""soul and charm"" that most older well-established hotels has, but this comes in time.

 I am eager to return to the Corinthia the next time I'm in London.",5,2013,03,29
143,THE BEST!!!,"There are not enough superlatives for this hotel! This was a 5 night business trip and we chose this hotel based on other reviews and were not disappointed in any way. The reception desk was very friendly and welcoming with an escort to the room. The sparkling clean room was fabulous with a wonderfully comfortable bed, linens and pillows....a great night's sleep. The marble tiled bathroom was separate and magnificent...a HUGE tub with a tv to enjoy while soaking the cold out of the bones. There was a huge walk-in shower with a regular and rain shower head and also a double vanity. There was also a large wardrobe to store clothes. Lovely robes and slippers are provided, too. The rooms were very quiet, and even though we faced a busy street there was no noise to bother a good sleep. All the services were fantastic. 
      The hotel is very well located at Embankment station so it is close to all the central London sights, shopping and West End theaters. Within a 5-10 minute walk are Trafalgar Square, Covent Garden, London Eye, Leister Square, the Strand and National Portrait Gallery. Other sights are a quick tube ride away.
      I can't imagine staying in a more luxurious hotel in London and would never hesitate to recommend the Corinthia most highly.",5,2013,03,28
143,A wonderful experience,"We didn't stay here but we had the most wonderful meal at lunchtime.  We all had a three course meal and a glass of champagne for £35 and it was well worth the money.  The staff make you feel so comfortable from beginning to end and nothing is too much trouble for them.  The dinning room is lovely with orchids on the centre table.
The food was very enjoyable.  We had smoked salmon for starters followed by Cumbrian beef which was the best beef I've ever tasted.  Pudding was also delicious.  The only thing we would have liked would have been to have extra gravy in a jug for those of us who like a lot on our meat.  We will certainly be returning when we next visit London. Many thank to all the staff who made this a very enjoyable lunch.",5,2013,03,27
143,"Amazing hotel, true relaxation","Service was outstanding from the moment we checked in.  Beautifully appointed room, loved the ambient music.  Very much enjoyed the spa and had a fab massage.  Ate in the restaurant and both food and wine were delicious.  B/fast was totally amazing, best I've ever had.  Also really liked being able to check in/out when we wanted,",5,2013,03,27
143,WOW! Awesome!,"I stayed here for my girlfriends birthday on a Sunday night, we were literally blown away by every aspect of the room, hotel, service and food. I'm worried about going to another hotel because the bar has been set so high by this experience! Can't highly recommend enough! A must visit!",5,2013,03,26
143,Superb Hotel,"My first visit to this exquisite hotel.   Beautiful lounge and tea room, sharp high ceiling atmospheric restaurants and bars, luxurious spa.    The rooms are splendid and very quiet.   Service was courteous and professional.    Superb luxury hotel.",5,2013,03,25
143,Pure bliss with attention to detail second to none,"I have had the good fortune to stay on two occasions at this superb hotel. On both occasions, I have been lucky enough to receive an upgrade. My last stay I was upgraded to a executive room. Not only was the room spacious, own hallway with coffee machine, mini bar, seperate walk in wardrobe, large bathroom - with a bath sooo deep it took 10 mintues to fill and a raindrop shower! The beds are extremely comfortable, the laid back attitude of the staff is refreshing and unobtrusive. I actually had to call to find out when we had to check out as no body bothered me to hassle me out or try to charge a ridiculous rate for an additional hours stay.

The attention to detail is phenominal. From the mood lighting at a touch of button, to the food recommendations at breakfast, invigorating spa products in the bathroom, personalised note from the head of sales with a business card welcoming me back, chocolate on the pillow, dressing gown laid out ready to jump into at bedtime.

There is NOTHING I can fault about this hotel. I just can't wait to stay again :)",5,2013,03,25
143,close to perfect,"a truly 5 star experience, worth every penny. outstanding location, first rate facilities, spacious rooms, attentive service. beautiful marble, furnishings, and flower arrangements throughout hotel. tea time was fantastic as well.",5,2013,03,24
143,True 5 Star Hotel,"I would not hesitate to recommend Corinthia to anyone, including the experienced world traveler who expects the best. The whole experience is truly 5 star: the staff, the hotel common areas, the restaurants and bar, the modern and tasteful rooms with their enormous beds and marble bathrooms and their heated floors and spa amenities, the turn down service, and of course the spa. I never wanted to leave.

The spa, I cannot say enough good things about the spa. It is likely my favorite hotel spa to date. Dark, warm and restorative with not a lot of the 'feminine' trappings of your general hotel spa, meaning, white, floral, new age music etc. The Spa is like a secret underground multi floor grotto. The Vitality bath was extraordinary. I am sure it could cure the worst case of jet-lag or a particularly bad hangover. The same would be said of the in room rain showers. I know, I know...you've probably taken a shower in a rain shower before, perhaps you even have one at home..but, not like this rain shower. The rain shower just pours water out unashamedly on you. I can't imagine the hotel's water bills. Just wonderful.

What else could I say that has likely already been said? The location in fantastic for touring the London sites. Don't hesitate to book this hotel, it is worth every penny.",5,2013,03,22
143,a nice stay just a few little issues.,we had a nice little break at corinthia the last 2 days..there are lots of staff all very friendly and helpful the spa is super and worth a vist but are room had a few issues. the first one is the wifi its super slow and we could not use it at all. also i found a broken glass under the cabinet where the coffee machine was i don't usually look under cabinets but i droped a teabag and when i went to pick it up i found the glass not really to good for a 5 star also for the price you pay here for a room i thought they could at least supply some biscuits to go with the coffee but no £3.50 for a little packet of crisps is a little steep. we was in room 631 and the slider with covers the tv was broken and didn't slide up or down a guy came to have a look it it and said he would fix it later when we went out but it was not fixed the whole time we was there.but overall its a nice hotel a great place to stay in london close to everything .,4,2013,03,22
143,Elegant understated opulence,"stayed at Corinthia for the weekend.  From check-in to check-out the hotel and its staff were fantastic. Polite understated service. Beautifully appointed public areas and bedrooms and one of the most comfortable beds I have slept in for a long time.  
THe bathrooms are particularly comfortable with separate rainshower and bath with built in TV which meant my partner could enjoy a bath and watch some tv relax along with a lovely glass of champagne which was waiting for us in the room when we arrived.  
I requested a quiet room upon checkin which they obliged with an internal courtyard room which was ideal - (i am so used to ending up with a view (?) of the air con units or the bins when staying at Sofitel St JAmes that its put me off that hotel for now) but this was nice - there are 2 french doors which could be opened and the courtyard a view of other room. 
We had coffees whilst we waited for our room to be pre-checked - they were very good.  Breakfast was included in the rate. THe first morning taken in the Northall. We opted forthe buffett which had a large choice of continental items and cooked english breakfast although i would personally i prefer scrambled eggs to be more solid than creamy - but they were fine and breakfast items where good quality.  The 2nd morning i opted for room service - and were served on time with the most perfect eggs benedict with bacon, toast, juices and tea - eggs cooked to perfection and it really was very nice.

all in all a great stay - nice and quiet.  Im sad we didnt get to try cocktails in any of the bars but we had theatre tickets both nights and had to eat earlier elsehwere but would definitely love to come back and explore more of the hotels restaurants and amazing looking ESPA.",5,2013,03,22
143,Stay in the lap of luxury,"I have stayed in some gorgeous hotels, but the Corinthia has that extra bit of something that tells you that every facet of your stay was considered. From the great amenities to the great layout of the room, my partner and I felt very pampered for the ten days that we stayed here. The gym is large with plenty of machines and weights, but the spa thermal pools are not to be missed. The location is also great - just across the street from the Embankment underground station, across the bridge from the London Eye, and a short walk to Trafalgar Square, Westminster Abbey, the Strand, and the Charing Cross Bookstores. Don't have time to go to Harrod's? They have a small store right in the lobby. There were only two faults I found during the entire time we were there. First, it seemed that the maid service thought there was only one person in the room. So turn down was for only one person (only one bottle of water was left, and slippers and robe were put out for just one person. Of course, my partner assumed it was for him ;-) Secondly, we were in London during St.Patrick's Day. I think there was a pub or bar in the building across from us, and some of the noise from the street carried up to our first floor room. But these are trivial and do not subtract from a wonderful stay.",5,2013,03,18
143,one word - AMAZING,"I enjoyed a particularly memorable weekend at the wonderful Corinthia Hotel in London recently. From check-in to check-out I felt pampered and special by the amazing staff. The attention to detail is evident in all aspects of the hotel. 
Firstly, the decor is both luxurious and modern - normally a contradiction - not here!, the stunning floral arrangements are breathtaking and I adored the stunning pieces of art throughout the hotel. 
Secondly, without doubt this hotels primary asset - apart from its location - is its staff, words cannot do enough justice to their attention to all guests, it is as though they cannot do enough for you and I witnessed them going the extra mile throughout my entire stay and not just to me, you can see it in their attitudes it is as though it is their raison d'etre, its quiet astonishing as so many hotels strive to acheive this and fail miserably- the hotel should be extraordinarly proud of each & every one of them.
Our room was stunning, spacious enough without being huge and empty, the decor was calm, yet warm and inviting. We had a charming little balcony overlooking the internal courtyard which my smoker BF was thrilled with. The bathroom was stunning and the beds so comfortable.
The Espa Spa is wonderful, and definitely worth a visit for either relaxing or pampering.
 All in all, I just can't say enough about this hotel - I cannot wait to go back & wish I was there right now .......",5,2013,03,15
143,Immaculate Again,"This hotel is not cheap, but it really is incredibly good - a perfect example of getting what you pay for. Its virtually impossible to find fault with in our experience of staying twice now. Stunning building, placed right in the heart of where you want to be in London to see the sights; the rooms and spaces mix classic elegance and style with ultra modern touches. The staff and general standards of service are absolutely exceptional, as is the food. Spa is amazing. If you want to splash out a bit to stay in true style and total luxury in London, then this is the place for you.",5,2013,03,15
143,Beautiful hotel,"I stayed in the Corinthia for three nights in early January 2013.  I was looking for an upmarket, classy hotel but with a modern feel and the Corinthia did not disappoint (I find many of the other London five stars such as Claridges and the Dorchester to be too traditional in decor for my taste).

I emailed the hotel before arriving to let them know that my partner and I were celebrating an anniversary.  At check in we were told that we had been upgraded to a larger room and in the room we found a delicious surprise cake and a lovely card from the hotel management welcoming us to the hotel.

The room itself was fabulous.  Through the main door there is a small entrance hall.  Straight ahead is a walk-in wardrobe with automatic lighting and plentiful wardrobe and drawer space.  

To the right of the entrance hall was the bathroom which contained a walk-in shower with a huge rainfall showerhead (probably the best shower I've ever used!), a toilet with separate door, his and hers sinks with an enormous mirror and the biggest bath I've ever had the pleasure of using (more like a small pool with my 5'3 stature!), complete with a TV at the foot of it!  Complimentary ESPA products were provided which made a lovely change to the run-of-the-mill products that other hotels provide.  Slippers and bathrobes were also provided but I found the robes to be very hard, rough and uncomfortable.

To the left of the entrance hall was the bedroom.  The bed was fantastic; enormous and firm but incredibly comfortable.  The bed linen was blatently high quality.  To the right of the bed were full length windows which opened onto a juliet balcony overlooking the courtyard incredible Baccarat chandelier in the lobby.  I imagine the rooms with city views were much more interesting but probably not quite as peaceful.  A table with two chairs stood by the foot of the bed, near the windows and at the back of the room was the minibar with complimentary Nespresso machine.  The chocolates left as part of the turndown service were a lovely touch.

I only have two complaints about the room.  The first being that it got rather warm and the aircon did little to cool it down.  We actually took to opening the doors on the balcony (in January) in order to achieve a comfortable temperature.  The second complaint is that the juliet balcony was littered with cigarette butts - I assume from the guest who stayed in the room before us (whose name remained on the touchscreen phone throughout our stay).  It's a basic hygiene matter and it also makes you wonder what else has been missed by housekeeping.  I would urge management to ensure that housekeeping pay particular attention to this as details like this can let down a hotel's reputation and I did find it rather disappointing after being so impressed by everything else.

On a more positive note, the location of the hotel was perfect.  It sits just across the road from Charring Cross station and Embankment underground and tourist hotspots such as Trafalgar Square, the theatres of the West End, Parliament and Buckingham Palace were within walking distance.

The service at the hotel was excellent.  We called reception a couple of times to ask for extra coat hangers and for a re-stock of teabags and both times this was dealt with swiftly.  I phoned the concierge on Wednesday evening and asked if they could arrange tickets for us to see Les Miserable at Queens Theatre on the Friday evening.  I knew this was a big ask as the show is always a sell-out, and the chances of getting tickets to it on a Friday night with two days' notice was slim.  However, the concierge managed to find tickets through a broker.  These obviously came at a premium but they were eight rows from the front, central and worth every penny.  I was very pleasantly surprised by the Corinthia's ""can do"" attitude,  I often find with upmarket hotels that you are made to feel as though you are inconveniencing the staff if you make any special requests but this certainly wasn't the case at the Corinthia.

We didn't get the opportunity to check out the spa and, judging by the photos in the brochure in the room, massively missed out.  We also didn't get the chance to eat in the hotel (as we were so busy but the restaurants looked very impressive and I've heard raving reviews from friends.

I would also like to mention that the doormen were delightful.  Always friendly, welcoming and ready with umbrellas!

Despite a couple of major niggles (the cigarette issue being a major niggle to me), I will definitely return to the Corinthia.  I am yet to find another hotel to my taste with such high levels of service.",5,2013,03,11
143,London's Best,"I stayed for one hectic business week during the Olympics, and enjoyed my stay, despite not having the time to soak up the experience.
 I promised my wife a short spring vacation  in London and decided to get the best of the Corinthia experience over a long relaxed weekend.
This is a wonderful building, in a great location, that has been converted magnificently into a stunning 5* plus hotel.
From arrival to departure all of the staff were exceptional, with nothing being too much trouble.
The room and bathroom were beyond beautiful and so well-equipped, with a very comfortable king size bed and lots of goose down pillows, and a great rain-forest shower.
We only dined in for breakfast, but that too was excellent and set us up for the day ahead.
This is our new favourite London hotel and it would be difficult to improve upon this experience.",5,2013,03,11
143,Northall at Corinthia,Great place to eat with very attentive staff and wonderful food. We booked via Bookatable - so had the equivalent of the pre-theatre menu. Don't let the limited choice put you off. It was delicious. We didn't stay so cannot comment on the rooms,5,2013,03,11
143,Staff stole from me!!,"Well I am no strange to London's 5star hotels and when a new one comes along I am eager to try. So I heard about the corinthia via some friends who work in the industry and said their bar was really something. Until the incident I had stay there a total of 3 times but on the 4th time in June I was on my second of 4 nights and was about get some cash from my room as I was going to exchange money for some dollars as I was flying to the US pretty soon. When I came to my money it felt light. When I counted it, it was almost £1000 down. Obviously shocked I contacted reception. They started an investigation!
Well a couple of days later I had to checkout and the matter was not resolved. I was made to pay my bill in full. 
Upon my return to London I met up with a manager at the hotel Jean Louis. He said the matter was still under investigation and he gave me his card to get in touch. Nothing was ever resolved. 
This hotel does not only boast to be one of the best hotels in London but one of the best in the world. You pay premium for this reason and you expect a premium service. This hotel epically failed me and dented my confidence in the hotel industry. I didn't even get a formal apology.
It's a lovely hotel but I would have to say stay at your own risk but for over £500 a night should there be any risk?",1,2013,03,01
143,Best Hotel in London!,"Stayed over NYE and a great vantage point for fireworks. The pool and spa were mindblowing. The rooms were pretty big with a walk-in closet. Bathroom was really nice with rain showerhead. Staff, exemplary in every way. Anytime check-in, check-out, perfect for those who have early/late flight arrival/departure. Location is ideal, very near to Trafalqar Sq, London Eye, Big Ben, Covent Garden and not as far a walk to shopping streets.

Tip: nearby Jamie Oliver's restaurant in Covent Garden if you want good food with a very decent price tag.

Absolutely love this hotel and the best in London.",5,2013,02,26
143,Amazing spa and beautiful interiors,"My husband and I stayed here in March 2012. The hotel itself is beautiful. The interiors are wonderful. The Spa is out of this world...you have to see it to believe it! I am so please we ventured down to the spa as I would never have imagined it to be quite so dramatic. Make sure you take or purchase a swim suit and head in down there for an hour!
We ate in Massimos and the food, service and accommodation were all fantastic. We have found our favorite London hotel and will be returning in our next visit. If you are making a decision between a few hotels, take my advice and stay here, it's wonderful! Enjoy!",5,2013,02,26
143,Return to Corinthia,"Decided to stay at the Corinthia again , as we liked it last year when we stayed , although we had a couple of minor problems . So glad we did because this time it was perfect !  
The hotel is so beautiful , the staff professional , helpful & friendly , the Spa the most beautiful in London . Definitely  our favourite hotel in London  now ....  so see you next month !",5,2013,02,26
143,Best Place for NYE Fireworks,"This is a beautiful London Hotel—lots of competition in London and the Corinthia is near the top. It has a lovely restaurant, classy bar, and large modern well-appointed rooms. What made this trip for us to London perfect was the location of the hotel for watching the fireworks on New Year's Eve. We literally walked out of the hotel and had a great view. We did not have to wait for hours out in the cold to get one of the best views in the city. If you aren't from London, I highly recommend spending New Year's at the Corinthia. Additionally, the hotel provided us front row grand stand seats for the parade the next day--this was complimentary! Other guests in the stands said, ""How did you get these seats?"" As they seemed a bit surprised that two American tourists sat down with those that had been part of parade preparations. Again, no waiting along the parade route for a good view we just walked down at start time and took our seats. Yes, the hotel is close to the Tube and inexpensive eateries—two musts when travelling. We were really treated first class it was money well spent for a great New Years in London. Highly recommend the Corinthia for any time of year and all types of travelers.",5,2013,02,25
143,Comfortable hotel,"I spent very nice time in staying at Corinthian Hotel London , lovely and friendly people make you very happy. The hotel lived up its 5 star rating . It's has very SPA , restaurants specially Massimo restaurant . I really recommend any one who has plan to travel to London to experience Corinthian .",5,2013,02,25
143,Easily the best hotel we have ever stayed in,"Could not fault this hotel, the staff, rooms, location were all perfect, top notch stay and will definately be returning, have recommended this hotel to others on numerous occasions. No expense has been spared with the luxurious fittings and fixtures.  It truly is a magnificent building, with a sumptuous interior in an historically interesting location.",5,2013,02,25
143,Excellent Service & Excellent Location,"I stayed here early January this year for a week and were very happy with the hotel. My sister in law felt ill when she visited, so the concierge offered her a complimentary bed in my suite. We also requested wake-up calls in the morning, which they did (along with complimentary tea and water). The location was perfect, right next to tragalgar square and other tourist attractions. I would highly recommend this hotel over any other in London. Breakfast however was not my favorite, there weren't many options unfortunately.",5,2013,02,25
143,Lovely hotel but not wow,"Firstly I need to say the service in this hotel is excellent, staff can not do enough for their guests. Maybe we expected too much at £400 a night compared to other 5 star hotels we've stayed at. On reflection the price was probably justified by the location which was superb.Our room was lovely with nice touches including the double basins, drench shower, in bath tv and coffee machine  although a few complimentary biscuits to go with our morning tea would have been welcomed.Also our huge bed which seemed to be 2 queen sized beds pushed together with no mattress topper meant there was an uncomfortable ridge where the 2 mattresses met  Breakfast was plentiful with a wide choice to suit all tastes, staff at breakfast were friendly and extremely efficient.On the whole we enjoyed our stay at the Corinthia but for us it just lacked that extra little something ",3,2013,02,25
143,Unbelievable kindness,"My family and I have been to London for my wife's birthday during the first week end of february 2013. The hotel is in central London,right behind Trafalgar square, with two underground stations nead by. As soon as You enter the hotel You can feel the warmth of fireplaces and of all the personnel. Everybody is very kind and You feel pampered all the time. The first night we had a superior room on the first floor but there was a party at the lower floor. At midnight I went downstairs to make a walk and the concierge asked me what happened, I explained that there was a little noise and he was really sorry, for this reason he promised to change my room the day after. Next day we had a executive room that was gorgeous. Linen is chaged every day and the bath floor is heated. Breakfast is really complete but expensive, the breakfast room has a magnificent view of the Golden Eye. The Spa is magnificent all with black and white marble and a spectacular glass sauna in the middle of the Spa. If You have a good budget, in my opinion this can be considered the best hotel in London.",5,2013,02,24
143,Wonderful 16th Birthday Weekend,"My daughter and I stayed here to celebrate her 16th birthday weekend - quite a splurge with the spa package and amenities.  I travel extensively for business and have stayed in many 5-star hotels all over the world.  The Corinthia lived up to it's 5 star rating; the staff was extremely helpful and its exceptional spa beautiful and uncrowded.  We both had 90 minute massages that were perfect, and my daughter had a facial as well while I dozed in an ""individual sleep pod.""  I wouldn't want to spend an entire day at the spa (although I don't like sitting on a beach, either, so may be my nature) as it doesn't offer a huge amount of variety without paying extra for treatments, but it is quite an experience.  
The hotel went the extra mile to make my daughter's birthday special.  There was an excellent Opera chocolate cake waiting at tea time in our room with a bottle of champagne. I know my Opera cake living near France, and this was top-notch and beautifully decorated with a gold leaf. 
Special mention must be made of Justin, one of the concierges, who helped us change dinner reservations at the last minute on a Saturday night (the actual birthday night), suffered through several changes-of-mind on our part, and then had the hotel Jaguar waiting to take us when we came down.  A lovely stay, we would defintately recommend the Corinthia.",5,2013,02,24
143,Blissful experience for a treat in London,I spent my birthday at the hotel. As soon as I arrived I was made to feel very welcome. I got a free upgrade to executive room which was bliss. Had spa all afternoon and then dinner in massimo restaurant. King size bed espa amenities. Proper coffee and tea no cheap stuff. Birthday cake... And then wicked brekkie next day. I didn't want to leave. Wish I had stayed entire weekend. If you live in capital and want to spoil yourself look no further than the corinthia...outstanding!!!,5,2013,02,24
143,Lap of Luxury,"We stayed at the Corinthia for 3 nights. Spoilt ourselves with the limo transfer to and from the airport. Expensive but adds that special touch. Spoil yourself . This hotel is first class and looks the part. Rooms are slick, using warm tones. Service is excellent. We tried both restaurants and found them both very good. Breakfast is impressive but expensive. The cocktail lounge is fantastic, very atmospheric with live music. The Spa is also amazing.I will definitely be back to the Corinthia!",5,2013,02,23
143,Fabulous,What a great hotel the Corinthia is.  Upgraded on check in.  Lovely spacious room with a fabulous bathroom.  Super charming staff with a terrifically helpful concierge .  We will definitely return when we next go for a London break.  Also we enjoyed a fabulously decadent afternoon tea. ,5,2013,02,22
143,My only complaint? Having to leave.,"We've stayed in many luxury hotels in London but this is by far the best! Every little detail just works.

The lobby area is stunning with a huge domed roof housing an amazing light installation. Vases of beautiful pink flowers add a splash of colour to the shiny marble surfaces. Everything oozes class. However this is not one of those hotels where the impressive decor fails to last beyond the lifts. The corridors themselves are luxurious- I never thought I'd find myself excited by a corridor but they just feel sumptuous. The class continues in the bedrooms- our room had three huge windows and a glimpse of the river, a large bathroom with a rain shower, endless supplies of fluffy towels, a TV over a huge bath, the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in, a Nespresso machine, a media hub which allows you to connect PCs and iPods to the TV, quality ESPA toiletries, atmospheric lighting, all within tasteful, comfortable decor. When we returned to the room in the evening, rather than finding the standard cheap chocolate on the pillow we found a little box of retro sweets instead. The maid had even put water and glasses by the bed, as if they knew we would be waking up a little hungover.The most impressive thing however was the silence. I didn't hear a single noise from another room for the duration of our stay.

The service was also fantastic, there is none of the snootiness you get in some 5* hotels, everyone was friendly and we were made to feel relaxed. The atmosphere in the hotel is unlike anything I've come across- they don't try too hard to be trendy, it doesn't feel stuffy-it's just perfect. This hotel, unlike so many others, is able to deliver an experience which justifies its high room rates.",5,2013,02,21
143,Afternoon Tea at the Corinthia Hotel,"I love afternoon tea and have visited many venues across London to sample their offer. I had never heard of this hotel prior to being invited to meet a friend their for afternoon tea. It was a wonderful experience. The staff was very accommodating and discreet, they moved our table so I could get a better view of the courtyard and that amazing chandelier. The food was lovely and replenished to meet our needs. We decided to treat ourselves to a cocktail (as it was late afternoon by the time we finished catching up!) and I must say I had one of the best mojitos I have ever tasted.  It was a wonderful afternoon and wonderful experience.",5,2013,02,20
143,Perfection!!!!,"This hotel is perfect in every way. The levels of service from all staff from the front desk, porters, spa, restaurant are impeccable. The rooms and facilities are incredible. We were upgraded on arrival. The spa is unique! The breakfast was superb!! There is very little to add to all of the other great reviews. This is a truly remarkable place to stay.",5,2013,02,18
143,Truly beautiful with a few teething problems,"This hotel really is stunning - the quality of the furnishings, flowers, bedding, etc are amazing.  It feels very refined and calm.  I like the innovative 24 hour check in system - I was able to go to my room at 10am and work, which was brilliant.  When I checked in I was upgraded to a king room from the queen I had booked, which was certainly appreciated.  However, I worked in my room all day and decided to put the TV on for background noise, which didn't work.  An engineer arrived very promptly (2 in fact), but after being there for an hour they couldn't fix the issue.  As it was so distracting for my work, the hotel moved me to a new room with really very little disruption and fuss - and they upgraded me again; the new room was beautiful.  And all the bathrooms are fantastic.  However even in the new room there were a couple of minor problems - part of the shower handle fell off and the bath tap didn't work so you could only fill the bath through the shower head which took forever....
So all in all, the rooms are fantastic, but there are a few things that need attention to make them perfect.  I would also expect the fruit to be replaced at evening turn downm which it wasn't.  And to have free mineral water as soon as you check in, not have to wait until turn down time.
We ate in the restaurant (Northall) and that was quite good; we had the theatre menu - perfectly nice food.  The Northall bar is lovely with good quality cocktails, although expensive as you would probably expect.
Overall - a beatuful hotel that could really excel with a bit of attention to detail",4,2013,02,18
143,Great hotel,"Such a great hotel. Staff was so friendly and helpful during my stay. Rooms were really nice and clean, bed was comfortable and spacious.  The location was perfect for my business purpose and will definitely stay here again. Food at the restaurant was fantastic.",5,2013,02,17
143,Fantastic Hotel,"My wife and I decided to spend a couple of nights staying at the Corinthia. It was our first visit, but we will definitely be back. The staff were very helpful and friendly, the food was excellent, the bedroom was spacious and very well appointed and the spa was WOW. Beautiful pool, enormous jacuzzi, fabulous steam and sauna facilities, large well stocked gym and an endless range of treatments. In summary a great hotel, in a great location and a wonderful break. Thank you.",5,2013,02,15
143,Awesome stay,"From the room, service to the food everything was awesome!

Some Highlights:

We stayed in a junior suite so this is based off that
1.  Thermal floors ( awesome)
2. Marble - looks amazing
3. shower - The rain type shower was awesome and the shower was large.
4. Huge walk in closet
5. Spacious
6. Everything was perfectly clean and service was top notch

The bars and restaurants were also great, Basoon bar takes the cake. Great cocktails and very knowledgeable bar tenders.",5,2013,02,12
143,Great hotel,"If i came back for business or with the wife i would stay here.  Very quiet.  Very nice.  Great thermal spas on bottom floors. Very close to tube stop, if needed.  If i was with the family i would still go back to the Athenuem because we could get that full apt and its closer to some of the sights for walking.",5,2013,02,11
143,Good all round hotel,"I've stayed here many times now and its a very good hotel.

Rooms are large and very comfortable with excellent service from all the staff.

It has a great bar with super service,

The main public areas are smart and welcoming. 

The breakfast area is ok, its more like a smart French bistro and the food is generally very good.

Location wise again its ok but its not in Mayfair but if your a tourist then its not that bad close to trafalger square.

It really depends on your room rate, personally if your paying full rates and you had the choice of Claridges, the Savoy or the Connaught then I'd rather stay in these because of the location or the ambiance. However the Corinthia is a very good hotel overall and you will enjoy staying here.",4,2013,02,10
143,great london hotel,"stayed in december - best london hotel we have stayed in very good quality rooms and a great location for Houses of Parliament. Nice florist within the hotel - my wife and kids loved it.

Horse guards is just across the road and its easy to get to the thames from here",5,2013,02,09
143,Wow - and I never knew it was here,I only had a meeting here but what a place - breathtaking and I hope to stay there soon. Great location and staff totally amazing. Lovely bar area. The perfect location for quiet business meetings that impress. ,5,2013,02,09
143,All round excellence,"My wife and I stayed one night this week, check in was slick and friendly, we were given a brief and informative tour of the facilities by Jaime and then shown to our room which was beautiful, comfortable and elegant.Breakfast was first class and in room prices very competitive for this standard of hotel. A very enjoyable stay.",5,2013,02,06
143,Very nearly perfect,"What a stunning hotel amazing design tastefully styled polite professional staff comfortable room superb bathroom amazing spa only niggle breakfast nice selection fresh fruit etc but  tepid hot food freshly cooked eggs etc properly toasted bread should be the rule at these prices
And a man designed the bedroom ? Silly little table with coffee machine etc looked like an afterthought  ..put the tv on the wall and make a little space ...the rooms are a little snug...but the pillows are the finest in the universe ..amazing we will return",5,2013,02,05
143,Luxury in the heart of London,"This has got to be the best few days I have spent anywhere. My daughter and I had 3 nights here just before Christmas and we really cant fault this hotel. You definitely get what you pay for, from wonderful surroundings to impeccable service. We had breakfast in our room as we like to relax and take our time in the mornings. The food was delicious. Our room with its marble bathroom with mood lighting was so relaxing but not overwhelming so you didn't feel uncomfortable, just pampered. We visited the spa and also treated ourselves to an Espa massage. Again, pure luxury. Roll on our next trip to London to stay in this beautiful hotel. Thank you to everybody for making our stay so memorable.",5,2013,02,05
143,Excellent in every way,"The service at the hotel was the best part. I had fallen ill and they kindly arranged for a doctor and took great care of me... The rooms are great and love that heated floor. The only iffy thing was the dodgy internet, and breakfast could include some more hot dishes - not worth what it was.",5,2013,02,04
143,Great Hotel,"Great hotel , friendly and accomodating staff , everyone speaks to guests .
Rooms are well decorated and equipped with super beds, plus the TV in the bath as mentioned by others . It is an expensive option for a London stay but there should be deals around and if so take them .",5,2013,02,03
143,Excellent,"My wife and I stayed here as a treat for her birthday, and how glad I am that we did, as the hotel and it's staff are first class. A special mention to the doormen and porters and the very kind lady on reception who provided the birthday cake!",5,2013,02,02
143,Fabulous hotel in a great location,"We stayed here for, unfortunately, only a single night.  The staff was friendly and helpful, the rooms were gorgeous, quiet, and comfortable, and the location was convenient - right off Trafalgar Square and a block from the Tube station.  What more can you ask for?  Very much enjoyed it.",5,2013,02,02
143,Threatened and not so welcome...,"Me and my business partner stayed in this hotel, has we had a few meeting. The check in was easy and people were friendly, the rooms where well presented and pretty clean. During our meeting in the coffee area we weren't so welcome in their by the staff who usually took long time to serve us plus having the security looking at us with a threatening looking.",3,2013,01,31
143,Fantastic Hotel,"Stayed here for 2 nights as part of an event we arranged for work. The staff were excellent, very attentive and willing to help when we needed to change arrangements and with their discreet service made the dinner work really smoothly. 

The rooms are beautifully appointed and luxurious, huge bathrooms with all amendities and the beds very comfortable, and the dressing rooms a lovely touch.

Restaurants were high quality in terms of food and service and the northall bar had an amazing selection of gins and a very knowledgeable waitress

All in all, a fantastic hotel...and I will definitely come back for a romantic trip with hubby and try out the spa",5,2013,01,31
143,Pure Luxury! Best of London!!,"Wife and I stayed here for the long weekend from Jan 18th-22nd.  Took an overnight flight and arrived at 7:00am local time, checked right in with ease.  Check in and Check out at your leisure is a great feature of the hotel!  We booked the Suite Treats package which was great.  Butler unpacking service was much appreciated after a long flight.  Deluxe Jr. Suite was amazing.  Very, very spacious, well appointed, super comfortable bed. Small balcony overlooking the courtyard and Baccarat chandelier was nice as well. Bathroom was also huge with separate a shower and giant tub.  Every detail was given the utmost consideration.  ESPA Spa was brilliant, an absolute must during your stay..  Food in all of the restaurants was well portioned and delicious.  Service was thoughtful and attentive without being intrusive throughout our stay.  

Try the Bassoon Bar for some excellent hand crafted cocktails.  Oysters in Massimo are huge and delicious.  We only had in-room dining for breakfast but it was served each day on time, hot, plentiful and delicious.  The Northall was also great for dinner.  Despite having such a large facility, it never seemed crowded at all, which gave a nice sense of exclusivity and privacy.

Location of the hotel cant be beat either.  Just across the river from the London Eye and a block from the nearest tube station.  

I could go on and on, you need to stay here yourself and experience true 5 Star amenities and service.  Couldn't imagine staying anywhere else in London and this will be our new home when traveling there in the future.  One of the best hotels we have stayed at yet!  Our only regret was not staying longer!!",5,2013,01,30
143,Just drinks at the bar,"Came to the Corinthia for drinks at the main bar.  What a beautfiul looking hotel first of all, and it does scream luxury!  A bit annoying to have all the X Factor wannabees screeching their demands left right and centre, but this pseudo-celebrity fantasy is to be expected at such an upmarket and centrally located hotel.

The drinks were superb, with huge care taken and meticulous attention to detail.  Tamas our bartender was exceptional - possibly the best service we have ever had.  Quite a stiff bill though it has to be said - drinks for four people topped £200 on cocktails alone over one hour, but sometimes the splurge is definitely justified!",5,2013,01,30
143,Nice stay,I travelled to London for business and stayed for 1 week in the start of December in Corinthia Hotel. Everything was really great! The room i had been given was excellent in all. The service was amazing and also the internet they have is free and quite fast and this kept me in touch with my work which helped a lot! Keep up the good work!!!!,5,2013,01,29
143,Wedding Anniversary ,"An absolutely fantastic hotel! All the details are covered, right up to heated bathroom floors. Staff is courteous and attentive. The building formerly served as the British war headquarters for WWI. No complaints, highly recommend the Corinthia Hotel. ",5,2013,01,26
143,LOVED Corinthia,"My family stayed at the Corinthia hotel for the New Year's Eve.

We chose this hotel due to the location, and must say it was perfect...we just walked a few steps and had an excellent view of the fireworks...it was an unforgettable moment.

Corithia hotel is probably one of the best hotels we've ever stayed.

Service was impecable, the decor is breathtaking and the best location!

Normally we used to stay at Savoy, but now we have serious doubts!!

There was just one flaw...on the last day, housekeeping  forgot to clean up one of our rooms. It is a problem for a 5 star hotel, but wasn't enough to jeopardize our stay and impression about it.

We can't wait to check in there again!",5,2013,01,23
143,Great hotel and location - shame of the food,"I stayed for two nights at the Corinthia for a business event. The hotel has character in all the areas: lobby, bar, restaurant and ballroom. The check in and check out were effortless and had no problem in leaving late in the day. The room and bathroom well very nice, well equipped and spacious. 
The big minus would be the food. First, we had a dinner for ten people and all the steaks were cold and not cooked as requested. Then, for lunch, there was a buffet and the counters were not enough to accommodate the 100+ people attending and there were only a few tables so most of us had to eat standing or on a chair with the plate on our knees. The gala dinner was just alright, not what you would expect from a hotel like the Corinthian.",4,2013,01,23
143,Great Business stay - Executive Room excellent,"I have recently returned from a two night business trip at the Excellent Corinthia hotel, staying in an Executive King room.

From my perspective and as a business traveller, the hotel was excellent, from the check-in process, through to evening drinks in the bar and room service - all was of the highest standard of service and professionalism.

Check-in; Quick, courteous and professional>  I was personally shown to my room by the very attentive check-in person, with a brief tour of room facilities and services.

The room itself was of a good size, with a very pleasant bathroom layout (separate shower/bath) with double sink.  There was a walk in wardrobe with ample hanging and storage space (no trouser press).  The decor and quality of the room furnishing was of a high standard, the bed was firm and pillows comfortable. There was a small table for working at and also for taking in room dining.  I slept well, with no road, corridor or other room noise at all...  All in all, I was very happy with the room and its features.

I did not take breakfast (early to work each morning) and only had room service in the evening (more work) which has a wide selection of good quality food.  All staff were friendly, helpful, but not intrusive and attentive.

I secured a very reasonable rate for the room and with the very pleasant communal areas and excellent rooms; I will return on my next business trip to London.",5,2013,01,23
143,What a treat!!,"We stayed at the corinthia on New Year's Eve. Fabulous hotel and great location. We stayed in a large exec room, plenty space and huge bathroom, fantastic shower. 
The spa is lovely and very relaxing.
We had a New Year's Day brunch meal at the Northal, lovely food, good service. My husband said the calamari was the best he had ever eaten.
You will not be disappointed!!!!

We are going back in April, looking forward to it very much",5,2013,01,22
143,Pure luxury!,"From the moment you are greeted by the extremely welcoming and helpful door staff you enter a world of luxury where the attention to detail is second to none. 
Staff are attentive, helpful and professional without being overbearing. You feel that nothing is too much trouble and they all appear to genuinely proud of the the hotel and service.
The public areas are luxurious with beautiful furnishings which ooze quality. The lounge is a glamourous yet relaxing area with open fire and comfortable seating. Just the place to relax with a glass of champagne, a coffee or afternoon tea. The restaurant serves beautiful food in quality surroundings and again the service is amazing. 
The spa and pool are another stylish area where one can relax in luxury.

The bedroom we stayed in - a standard room was one of the best hotel rooms I have ever stayed in and the attention to detail and quality of furnishing definatly the best. Every detail had been thought of from large comfortable bed with excellent bedding to an oak shelved and mirrored walk in wardrobe containing everything that even the most fashion conscious person could wish for. 
The large marbled bathroom has under floor heating, double sinks and a built in bath TV with water proof remote control.
The room also had a balcony overlooking the lounge. An amazing view especially at night when the chandelier shines through. 

I could go on forever about this hotel and I am already planning our next stay there.",5,2013,01,21
143,Outstanding room; outstanding service,"We stayed at the Corinthia last year as part of our ten year wedding anniversary trip to Europe.  The hotel was superb in every way.  From checking-in, to the rooms, to tea service in the lobby, to cocktails in the bar, we never once had anything but a positive experience.  A bit more on the room:  they were laid out very well. While not overly large, the design was functional but contemporary and warm.  The bathroom was large and with heated floors.  For me, a great room is a soft bed and quiet.  Not once during our stay did I hear any noise from the hallway or the other rooms. We slept late and still, no noise from the hallway. Even though the service was great, it is because of the lack of noise in the rooms that I give this hotel a top rating.  You will enjoy your stay – and you will sleep well.",5,2013,01,20
143,Splendid,"I have no doubt that my love of this hotel was enhanced by the fact that we got upgraded to a massive suite. It had a guest bathroom; large lounge and dining room ; a vast bedroom with a very large bed, and extra seating; plus a walk in wardrobe and a bathroom that was the ultimate in luxury . It was beautifully decorated and a quite room. The hotel on the whole is magnificent but it's a massive space and tends to seem cold and empty. But if you are not spending time in reception it's worth a stay.",4,2013,01,19
143,EXCELLENT HOTEL,"We stayed at this hotel from the 26th Dec 2012-1st Jan 2013
We chose the hotel based on the reviews of TripAdvisor and definately were not disappointed.  It is as great as all the reviews say it is!
This is such a beautiful hotel.  The building is lovely and the interior is modern and luxurious.  It has been able to maintain this standard without being too stuffy or formal which I really liked.
The locations is EXCELLENT - only a few minutes walk to Embankment station and another 5 minutes walk around the corner and you are in Trafalgar square.  I cannot speak highly of the location.  Also it is right in front of the london eye, so for new years eve (and in fact any other night) the views are amazing.
The room itself was extremely large (we had a double/double room) - plenty enough for 4 adults and the bathroom was large, clean and luxurious (with a tv near the tub!).  We did have some issues with the shower, however the hotel were extremely professional and able to sort it out for us in the end which I really appreciated as other hotels we stayed in have not been this professional.  They staff and hotel manager's attitude clearly reflect that they have the best interest of the guest at heart and go out of their way to make sure you feel welcome.  We have stayed in multiple 5-star hotels and resorts around the world, and it is the staff and management at this hotel that makes the Corinthia London reach above and beyond the expectations of a 5-star property.
One incident to note to display how excellent the staff are, was one night I asked the lady that did the turn down service for more toiletries.  She went out and brought me a huge pile (pretty much a bucket) of every concievable bath and shower product I might need or want!  It's just these extra little things, amongst many others, they do that is unexpected and shows how above and beyond ALL the staff are willing to go to make your stay as comfortable and enjoyable as possible.
The location and the building itself also makes this pretty much number 1 choice in London.
I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone, in fact I don't understand why anyone would want to stay anywhere else, and I can't wait to go back to London and back to the Corinthia.",5,2013,01,18
143,Second to none,"This is a beautiful and luxurious hotel at the best spot in London.

The service is amazing and if your rate includes breakfast at the Northall, you will enjoy a great meal with lots of choices.

I travel extensively in the US and this Corinthia property puts any ""luxury"" American hotel to shame. This is truly an incomparable hotel experience!",5,2013,01,15
143,Absolute Luxury,"This hotel is ace, every single inch of the place is stunning.  The ceiling in one of the hotel bars has a fantastic amount of gold leaf, each small square roughly 100mm x 100mm will have been carefully put in place by hand using a smallish brush, take a long look when you visit it is truly amazing. Definitely take the time to admire the sheer amount of quality workmanship and fabulous design in the hotel public areas it a real treat to anyone who appreciates style and craftsmanship. 

We ate in the restaurant on New Years Day and the food, service and wine were nothing short of excellent, the friendly staff made our stay even better if it could be better. The breakfast is again the best money can buy with just about anything you could ever want to get you going on a morning and much much more.  

 I used the gym and that is a real cool place to be with loads of great equipment, note to the hotel better water facilities would definitely be appreciated but still I am not complaining because every other part is unbeatable.  

This is our second stay at new year as the hotel is ideally placed to watch the fireworks on the embankment then wander back in to the excellent cocktail area and listen to the pianist who again is a great guy and very talented. Thank you for playing our choice of songs on new years day night but next year it has to be wham and last christmas ha ha. 

The hotel is not cheap but if like us you work hard or just have bags of cash this is without doubt the place to be at any time of the year.

Thank you to all the staff including the concierge who minded our car while we checked in the porter who delivered our bags to the room, the reception staff to who nothing was too much trouble for and the pianist who made our last night one to remember and every other member of staff because the room was always spotless and everyone was friendly. Great way to start the new year. Now I just have to save up to come back",5,2013,01,15
143,Amazing in every way!,"I stayed here with my mother as a girl's trip we took at the end of September 2012 for 4 days and it was absolutely amazing! The hotel staff, to the rooms, to the Concierge... they never failed to make sure we were happy with out stay! We once were waiting a while for a taxi to come around the hotel, and after some time the man at the door ran down the street to hail one for us and brought the taxi to the hotel. Such service was unexpected and definitely exceeded our expectations. I highly highly recommend this hotel! I cannot think of one bad thing! 
I tried out their spa, had a massage and used their spa facilities - all great! The room we were in was the Executive Room which was very large and clean! I loved the walk in closet! The bed was very very comfortable. The bathrooms were also a nice size. The nespresso machine in the room was an added plus! I loved the location and felt it was nice to be a bit outside all the commotion, yet so close to so many things!
I cannot wait to stay here again! I'll be back in 2 weeks :)",5,2013,01,12
143,Almost perfect,"We stayed here for 3 nights and found the hotel very comfortable. The beds are super, the little hall and night lights at the floor are great. The space in the walk-in wardrobe was o.k. but the possibility of hanging coats, trousers, etc. was limited. We wonder where people stash their wardrobe when on a longer stay. The room itself was nicely furnished though a little plain. Checking in was fast and efficient with a personal guide explaining all details of the hotel cum room. Unfortunately, we never received a newspaper which was part of the offer in our booking. Also I would recommend great care when booking through the internet on the hotel's website. Certain rates mean an immediate charge of the total costs and are not changeable nor can they be cancelled. Breakfast was good but not extraordinary at a price of 30 Pound Sterling p.p. And extra eggs when ordered separately are added to the bill! The perfectly working shower is something extraordinary for London hotels. We usually encountered great problems in most hotels in England.",4,2013,01,11
143,Absolute luxury,"The Corinthia is easily one of the finest hotels I have stayed at. 

We booked onto a rate via the hotel's own website which included breakfast, champagne on arrival and massages in the day spa as a weekend treat. It wasn't the cheapest rate but was great value for money overall.

The rooms are modern yet have a classic elegance, the staff are curteous and helpful without being overbearing and the day spa is already renown for being one of the best/most exclusive in London. 

The breakfast is also first-rate and, being centrally located by Whitehall, is popular with business people as well.

I have no reservations about recommending Corinthia - we had an amazing stay. ",5,2013,01,08
143,"""very nice hotel""","Perfect location, lovely lobby, surroundings, comfy room, very good service. Afternoon tea was lovely 
Gym well equipped, nice restaurants. Complementary water and snacks in room every night. Stopped out of the hotel on NYE night to a magnificent view of the fireworks at the London eye!! Magical!!
Certainly worth every dime
Looking forward to staying there again",5,2013,01,07
143,"Has the potential, but doesn't deliver due to ""human"" factor","We have been staying at the Corinthia a few times, probably 4 or 5 in the past year. Our impressions are mixed. Large rooms and comfortable beds plus 24 hours check-in policy are the main reason why we return. However, we don’t feel welcome at this hotel. I won’t go into details of our prior stays, which on some occasions involved complains and, to be honest, in most cases adequate mitigating measures by the hotel’s management. I would like to share some impressions about our most recent (and current) stay: 1. We arrived at around 6.30am. Although our luggage (quite a few suitcases) was handled flawlessly, reception was confused about our reservations (we have another one for next week) and we were not offered to be escorted to the room; we saw in the afternoon the hotel’s staff escorting other guests, which made us feel like second-class. 2. Our main phones were not working when we arrived and despite numerous efforts and pointless visits from “specialists” (who basically unplugged the phones and plugged them in again – the same thing I did myself in the first place) are still not functioning, some 14 hours since we arrived, so we have to go to the toilet (the only place where the phone works) to order room service and make/receive other calls – not a normal thing. 3. AC unit was not working properly – at a minimum +18C (64.5F) blowing warm air; after we complained about it another “specialist” came to basically identify that it was blowing air at +25C (77F) and adjust the settings to allow the unit to be set at +15C the lowest instead, which helped somewhat, but hasn’t turned things around (if a bit cooler, the air is still stuffy) – we go to bed opening the window a bit to let some fresh air in. 4. Not a critical mass, but we had robes, towels and slippers for two people, while the reservation clearly states “4 adults” and they knew our estimated arrival time. This happened to us before, and in other hotels also, but I think on at least few occasions the Corinthia did it right, so it’s definitely a deviation from past good practice. 
These are all trivial details of our current experience. The main thing is that I went to the reception in person to talk about our main problems with the manager on duty Julian, who as I understood was planning to come to our room to discuss the situation – instead he opted to call making me to go to the toilet (as that is the only place where the phone works) to tell me that the phone is an “external” problem and would be fixed eventually and that they “blow all available cold air into our room”. It was quite surreal to stare at the toilet bowl and hear some meaningless explanations of why things don’t work. To that I could only say “thank you” and write this review.",1,2013,01,06
143,Best hotel stay ever,"Lucky enough to experience the luxury, service and opulence of this wonderful very new hotel. The rooms are extremely comfortable with every amenity and the bathrooms are absolute luxury with Espa products as standard. The thermal pools are not to be missed and are an absolute treat. Made to feel extremely welcome and like nothing was too much trouble. The late check out was an absolute godsend after a late night out in London. Will definitely be back at some point in the hopefully not too distant future.",5,2013,01,06
143,Afternoon tea,"The service was lovely. The surroundings are lovely; very striking. The sandwiches and cakes were lovely and the waitress kindly offered to refresh them for us.  I was interested to see that they used teabags instead of loose tea which was a bit of a surprise. Not as classy as The Langham for afternoon tea. The doormen were very nice when we left, it was pouring with rain and they were insistent that we borrowed an umbrella.",4,2013,01,05
143,Outstanding Stay... 5 stars!!,"Just returned from staying 11 days at this amazing hotel. From the minute
we checked in we were spoiled and pampered! Upon arriving at our 
room we had a bottle of chilled champagne and 
a birthday cake waiting for us. On the day of our anniversary
we had another complimentary bottle of champagne and cake delivered.
The room was amazing, the bed was very plush, the
bathroom with dual sinks, rain shower, hot tub and TV, along with warmed
floors and towel warmer was perfect. The complimentary toiletries were Espa
brand and very nice. Room had a walk in closet which was perfect
for our long stay. The pool and thermal floors were the best! Gym was perfect for our morning
work outs. Service was incredible. Our room was cleaned
everyday and turn down service done nightly. At turn down
they always left us a little gift on our pillows! 
We had dinner at the Northall one night and were amazed.
The dinner was superb and the service very good.
We also had cocktails at the bar and I can say their
pisco was one of the best cocktails I've ever had.
My only complaint would be breakfast at the Northall,
the did have a variety of items on the buffet but
I really didn't like any of the items. The eggs were horrible,
Very runny and almost raw. The breads were not too good either.
I'm glad the breakfast was complimentary because it would
not have been worth the high price since all I enjoyed
was coffee and bowl of cereal. Conclusion do reserve this excellent
hotel, it's walking distance to many of the attractions, London eye, Buckingham 
Palace and the embankment.",5,2013,01,05
143,"Great Hotel, great location.","We booked Corinthia on Trip Advisor's comments and it didn't fail. The location was fantastic, staff were great and we couldn't have been happier. We booked a rollaway for our 12 yr old and it wasn't set up when we got there. It did take 4 phone calls to get it organized that evening but that's a minor thing. Definitely stay there. It's fantastic! ",5,2013,01,04
143,NYE at the Corinthia,"We had a 'River Suite' on New Years Eve. What a fantastic location!! - We had a perfect view of the fireworks, London Eye ect. The rooms were great with everything you could possibly want. I especially liked the Nespresso coffee machine! The rooms were immaculate when we arrived, then, while we were out for dinner they came along and tidied all the mess I had made getting ready to go out. The bathroom comes with separate shower & toilet, a TV in the bath & underfloor heating as well as complimentary toiletries from ESPA downstairs (which was also lovely). We also ordered room service in the evening & morning which was excellent and arrived exactly on time. 

There were just a couple of small negatives - the fire alarm went off so we were evacuated and not told when we could go back inside - not helpful! (for the rest of the stay all of the staff were super helpful though).
Secondly, this may just be me, but, on the bottom of the bar bill, room service bill ect there is a space for a tip. This would be fine if they hadnt already added on a discretionary 12.5% - just seems a bit cheeky to me!",5,2013,01,04
143,"After 2 stays, hope to go back again","I stayed at the Corinthia London twice in 2012: once in March and again during the week between Christmas and New Year.  Really appreciate their flexible check in/check out policy.  How nice when you arrive early in the day from an overnight US flight to find the room ready and waiting!  Similarly, if you're flying out late, an afternoon check out is available.  This is just one of the ways in which the hotel excels at customer care.  All of the staff, on both occasions, were warm and welcoming, willing to assist in any way.  Room service was quick and delicious, efficiently set up and removed promptly.  Breakfasts in the Northall were excellent.  The room during my first stay was enormous!  But even on the second stay, it was very comfortable and well appointed (well set up for working or charging multiple electronic gadgets).  The laptop sized safe, conveniently located in a drawer, was a big plus.  The bathroom was also very well appointed (appreciated the underfloor heating).  I didn't use the spa but did use the hair salon (a branch of Daniel Galvin, one of the city's top salons) on both occasions, once for a blow out and once for wedding ""do"" and appreciated both the skill of the stylists and the flexibility about scheduling.  Only downside was room temp on my last visit--it was too hot and the temp couldn't be lowered.

Location is great for theatre; easy walk to most theatres on the Strand or near St. Martin's Lane and very convenient for the National Gallery and Portrait Gallery.  

I look forward to my next stay.",5,2013,01,03
143,Great 7 Day Stay,"More often than not I am unbelievably disappointed in hotels in the UK. The Corinthia hotel has changed that for me!

We checked out of the Corinthia today after a 7 day stay. Here are my thoughts:

The Good - 

*Gorgeous, well-appointed rooms. Beautiful lobby. Loved the Harrods ""store.""
*Staff is unbelievably nice and bends over backwards to accommodate requests. 
*We didn't eat in either hotel restaurant but breakfast (via room service, which was included in our rate) was top-notch. Not sure what the Corinthia cook does with his scrambled eggs but they are divine! 
*Location is a bit off the beaten path but the hotel is quiet which is nice. The hotel is just a 3 minute walk from the Embankment tube station which is very convenient.

The Not So Good - 

*Room Service is delicious but every day something was inadvertently left off our delivery (butter and/or milk for tea and/or water, etc.). Not a big deal bit just something to note.
*Shower water temperature changes randomly which can be a bit dangerous.
*Check out was the only real issue...the clerk tried to charge us for breakfast (which was included in our rate) and also refuted the spa credit that was allotted to us. Not sure why this was such a problem since I booked our stay directly on the Corinthia's website and thus everything should have been clearly indicated in their system? Everything was sorted out in the end but I hated leaving on a slightly negative note. 

The Bottom Line - I will definitely stay at the Corinthia on my next visit to London. This was definitely an overall fantastic experience and I highly recommend this hotel.",4,2013,01,01
143,"SPA is great, but afternoon tea is unfortunately not a 5-star experience","I went for a massage during the weekend. The whole design and facilities are very impressive and clean. it even has a quite room for you to have a short nap! Had a great massage from a skilled masseuse. Service is great.  The only suggestion I would like to give is to provide herbal/infusion tea instead of iced water right after the massage so that the body could be kept warm.   Overall, I will want to come back again for a SPA! 
After a very relaxing SPA, I went to the Lobby to have afternoon tea with my husband.  We started around 5.40pm, however, we only managed to finish at 8.30pm due to the slowness of the service. We didn't eat a lot, as the sandwiches are quite dry and desserts are too sweet.  It wasn't a great experience because we had to wait for a long time for each food service (apart from the normal set, we only ordered one extra round of sandwiches and 3 extra desserts).  The back door was opened by guests coming into the hotel from time to time, and there was no doorman looking after it so where we sit was sometimes very cold (my husband had to go and close it at least twice).  I would really hope the hotel could have enough staff to look after the guests at the lobby and make sure that the service is smooth and attentive, to meet its 5-star standard.",3,2012,12,31
143,Outstanding Boxing Day lunch,"We had a Boxing Day lunch for 16 people, including young children. Unfortunately, the reservation process to make the booking was less than satisfactory - we had to leave messages that were not responded to and we very nearly gave up after three days of trying to get a confirmation or response. However, the lunch in a private alcove off the main dining room was well worth it. The menu was ideal to cater for a range of tastes and ages and was not too fussy, just what we needed after Christmas. The service was friendly, quick and efficient with no long waits between courses despite the size of the group. ",4,2012,12,31
143,Best in London,"My mum and I stayed here between Christmas Eve and Boxing day and it did not disappoint. The staff were SO welcoming and warm (despite having to work over Christmas!) and the room was very plush- my favourite touch was the television in the bath! Turn down service included a box of treats on our pillow, which I thought was going to be chocolates, but I was pleasantly surprised to find contained old-school penny sweets!

The location is great. I live in London myself and I like the fact that the hotel is very central, but the street itself isn't too busy or noisy. It's a 15 minute walk to Regent Street, which meant on Boxing Day we could hit the shops for the sales and be back in the hotel quickly without having to worry about transport.

Breakfast was wonderful; something I would come back for even if I wasn't staying at the hotel overnight. Again, the staff were on point; not overbearing, but we didn't need to ask for anything at all. A great selection of choices and the room that it's served in was stunning.

And finally the spa, probably the best I've been to in London (and I've been to few!). Plush dressing gowns, a lovely pool, sauna and hammam and really clean, well kept facilities. 

I really can't find anything that I could really fault the hotel on; my only (minor) gripe was that there isn't a ramp at the Whitehall Place entrance for suitcases, so luggage had to be carried up a few stairs. I hope that the Corinthia manages to keep up such high standards in the long-run, as they are becoming very rare in the hospitality industry. The stay wasn't cheap at all, but it was money well spent. Highly recommended.",5,2012,12,27
143,Fantastic relaxing stay just not long enough,"My daughter and i returned to the Corinthia for a short stay while enjoying some last minute christmas shopping. Fantastic hotel with great staff. In room dining as always fantastic and the breakfast before leaving was 1st class.

Beds are very comfortable and suite spacious and luxurious.

Hotels in a great location and would recommend it for a short break or longer such a gorgeous hotel",5,2012,12,24
143,"Great hotel, terrible nights sleep!!","Having booked a one night stay for myself and my partner to have our first night away from our daughter to catch up on sleep, it sadly didn't work out quite that way. The air con didn't seem to function in our room so it was stifullingly hot all night. We didn't raise it with reception as the last thing you want to do in the middle of the night is have someone fiddling in your room and or to be relocated. It seems like a minor gripe but very frustrating as we kept dropping the temperature but to no avail. Other than that my partner loved the spa treatments and the decor and location is excellent, but unlikely to return. ",4,2012,12,23
143,home away from home,"I travel to London every month on business and have made the Corinthia my home away from home. I've stayed at several hotels prior to discovering the Corinthia and while some are perhaps cozier and more intimate, the Corinthia has surpassed them all in outstanding service, attention to detail, luxury and convenience. The staff is without peer, and the rooms are truly beautiful, comfortable and sumptuous. I would strongly recommend booking an executive room (or better) as the bathroom is apart from the main chamber and there's a wonderful walk-in closet (with a window!) The spa and the gym are superb,although I did have an issue with a very rude staff member at the gym (apparently an ESPA spa employee, not of the hotel) but even that was not a reflection on how the hotel is truly the best kept secret in London. I'm going back to the hotel this weekend for two days of business, then to Amsterdam (more business) then returning to the hotel purely for pleasure for three days with my partner. The best!",5,2012,12,21
143,Good newcomer,"Corinthia is a recent new comer in the london's scene.
The decor is a little bit a mix between Russia and Arabia with a tucky celing lamp in the middle of the hall, a mix of styles and decors, but the rooms are comfortable, new, efficent and silent.
Maybe the hotel is Lacking of charm and cosy but the good SPA and nice discret location make this hotel a good solution in the middle of the infinite 5 stars hotels of London",4,2012,12,21
143,Wonderful Hotel,"This hotel is in a different class. Firstly the rooms are superb, a really comfortable, light and airy fixtures with a new wooden floor, the bed was really comfortable, the bathroom was great a separate Italian shower with great pressure (which is not always the case in the UK) and really nice products. Plus the bath even had a TV in the facing wall which meant you could relax in the bath with the supplied bath salts and watch TV. Real luxury! One the things I liked best about the hotel was the public areas for example the corridors often neglected even in the best hotels were well appointed and light with oak panelling and it had an excellent lobby. The staff couldn't be more helpful, courteous and interested in you and your well being. Breakfast was excellent and it's nice to have a menu instead of the obligatory buffet. I had room service one night and again the food was excellent and the service couldn't be faulted. Overall a wonderful stay and it was a shame it was there on business I am looking forward to return with my wife and spend a few days being pampered without the stress of work.",5,2012,12,21
143,Excellent in every way,"Having spent multiple journeys in five star-hotels throughout Europe, I migth say that this one is the best we've had so far. Their 24 hours check-in/check-out policy is very comfortable, room and bathroom are superb, nice breakfast, very friendly people (from doorman to housekeeper), relaxing beds, ...

Certainly will visit this hotel again!",5,2012,12,21
143,The most expensive tea bag in London!,"On 20th December 2012 had lunch at the Massimo restaurant. To summarise our waitress had extremely greasy hair and was not very welcoming. The set menu worked out more expensive for two courses which the waitress failed to give us an adequate explanation other than it was to do with portion size???

We ordered Earl Grey tea for two served by a different waitress who completely dismissed my request to allow my tea to brew a little while longer and continued to pour a weak tea. The tea pot did not contain any tea leaves and the tea was a very pale yellow.  After having our tea changed by a waiter , it reappeared exactly the same. Third time lucky we hoped! This time we requested a tea bag. Only one tea bag was given. After all the fuss the identity of the tea was finally discovered after several minutes to be Jasmine tea.  Hence 5 star or not!!! One tea bag charged at £11 and to top it all off the wrong one!

We felt disrespected to a point that we were so upset I would have lost my cool if I had complained to a manager. In all honesty I just wanted to leave and felt saddened by how bad service was. We paid and left.

On the same evening I experienced a complete 5 star experience at a different restaurant in a different hotel which made me realise that Corinthia Hotel really needs feedback. Not surprised Massimo seemed quiet in comparison.",2,2012,12,20
143,Superb city hotel,Two nights spent at the Corinthia London were flawless from the gorgeous decor to lovely staff. This I had expected. The greatest surprise was the quietness of the bedrooms. On the first night in my courtyard facing Superior King I heard zero noise and on the second night only a little amount from the room above. A room service burger came immaculately cooked with some of the best chips I have eaten anywhere. I cannot imagine that there is currently a better a luxury hotel in London.,5,2012,12,20
143,Corinthia Hotel - consider it,"Just met clients for a drink and a business meeting. Great atmosphere and wonderful ambience/lighting. Elegant furnishing and decoration. Room rates are expensive (minimum £400 or via package £309 per night). So very expensive but lots of gyms/swimming pools. 
Had not heard of the chain of hotel. Massimo’s the restaurant is expensive. Close to Whitehall, Trafalgar Saqqara, Houses of Parliament, Westminster Abbey, Downing Street, and the Embankment. Parking difficult close to hotel. Parked in Trafalgar Square car park.",4,2012,12,20
143,Saved from Z Hotels,"I checked into the Corinthia at 3 am following a disastrous night at the Z hotel Soho.

The Corinthia staff were incredible across the board, reception, doormen, restaurant staff, housekeeping. Rate was very competitive. Got an upgraded room which was plush and oozed contemporary glamour, like a modern take on Claridges.

Would absolutely stay again and recommend.",5,2012,12,19
143,Wow amazing,"Delightful in every way..we had a lovely one night stay including spa break,Hotel is mind blowing staff amazing,Breakfast amazing.We will be back.Thank you very much for the upgrade on are room.Everything is beautiful you are all doing a truly amazing Job.",5,2012,12,18
143,Amazing Experience,"We stayed at the Corinthia for 1 night on Sunday 9th December. 
From our initial arrival we received a welcoming greeting from the very charming gentleman on reception who showed us around the hotel and then to our room 415. 
Our room was very spacious and immaculate, we had a balcony overlooking the inner courtyard. I have never slept as well and in such a comfortable bed. A quick mention needs to made to the excellent standards delivered by the housekeeping team. 
We had dinner and breakfast in the Northall restaurant, delicious food and excellent service.
On Monday we made use of the amazing spa and also had a facial. 
Every member of staff should be praised. Faultless service, attention to detail and pure opulence. I believe this is now the best hotel in London, We really didn't want to leave and I cannot wait to return !",5,2012,12,12
143,Delightful Northall Restaurant,"Four of us had lunch at the Northall Restaurant in the Corinthia Hotel just off Trafalgar Square, and it was a treat from start to finish.  Excellent smoked salmon (and an extremely generous portion), superb sea bream and a delicious syllabub - these basic descriptions do not do the meal justice, as it was all beautifully presented, and served by excellent waiting staff. This meal is a bargain at £29 a head. The high-quality crackers were a lovely Christmas surprise - all in all a great experience and one which I shall be repeating in the near future.",5,2012,12,11
143,My new favorite hotel in London,"I had an absolutely mindblowing experience at the Corinthia and hope to never stay anywhere else.  The hotel is an architectural marvel.  Its four floor spa was beautiful and its darkened sleep nook had me feel like an Indian princess.  They generously upgraded me to a suite room and it was one of the nicest rooms I've stayed in in a long time.  Marco, the wonderful florist decorated my rooms with orchids, purple and lush and was a joy to work with.  And the breakfast buffet was fit for a king.  i enjoyed dinner in their in hotel restaurant and although the food was only good the atmosphere was memorable.  The front desk staff and concierge team were also lovely to work with as was the spa front desk team.  My only complaint is that my spa practitioner was not professional or pleasant and I did not enjoy my service.  Just a fluke i suspect and I will request someone else next time.  Otherwise, superb.",5,2012,12,10
143,"Lovely setting, good food , excellent service","Given that we were using a Telegraph voucher, our meal was excellent value and this is a great place to sit and have lunch. The service was wonderful, welcoming , friendly and efficient and the Northall restaurant is a very comfortable space. ",5,2012,12,09
143,Disappointing tea,"It wasn't bad, just disappointing and very ordinary for what is supposed to be one of the best afternoon teas in London.

The sandwiches were fine, but you could make much nicer ones yourself or buy one from any half decent sandwich shop.

The actual tea arrived about half an hour after we had ordered.

The scones were fine and good clotted cream.

The little cakes and other sweet things were ok, only one was indelible. But they all tasted the same, very sweet and a bit sickly and a little bit stale.

It was my girlfriend's birthday and I wanted to do something special. I felt wonderfully let down by this experience. 

If £40 a head for an ordinary tea, sandwich and cake is normal, then fine. If you want and expect something extraordinary and special for this amount, look elsewhere.",2,2012,12,07
143,Faultless,"We travel mostly to Dubai and had come to accept that the level of service and standards in the UK doesn't meet the exceptional levels you find over there even in 5 star properties.

However the Corinthia did - the service was outstanding, the staff were friendly and accomodating and the hotel itself it beautiful with a classic traditional style that is at the same time very modern and new. The hotel has a lavish, no expense spared feel to it in a good way.

The high ceilings give a feeling of grandeur and the showers are super powerful.

The food was exceptional - full breakfast both days and an evening meal of fish and chips with peas and tartar sauce were all faultless. Couldn't find anything to criticise the Corinthia on except that it is fairly expensive, but for this standard in this location that is to be expected.

For anyone looking for a high standard in a premier location in London it would be hard to top.",5,2012,12,07
143,Poor value,"I understand that the hotel has been refurbished and so, you will expect the nicest hardware.  The problem is the people. I have a couple of unpleasant situations and whilst the hotel has apologised for such tardy behaviour, in my mind, a hotel remotely near this price range is committing a cardinal sin.  On top of that, if you stay in the Superior Room, its so small that there is no space for a 29inch bag. I would choose Langham London for a welcoming feel to a spacious room and at a fraction of the price.  So you be the judge.",2,2012,12,04
143,Best hotel experience I have had!,"Nothing is too much trouble for the corinthia hotel, the staff are wonderful and go beyond the call to make your stay amazing. The hotel itself is beautiful and feels like a modern ritz! They took my dietary requirements on board and delivered a wonderful dinner and breakfast. For the first time in my wide experience of 5 star hotels I felt every star was well earned and felt sad to leave there. Cannot wait to return and try the spa!!!!",5,2012,12,03
143,Northhall Restaurant,"We had our 3rd Anniversary Dinner at Northhall Restaurant. Very nice atmosphere, delicious food and great value. Special Thank You for all staff and especially to Aleksei, who made our evening special.Also there is beautiful terrace where you can enjoy cigar and cocktails after dinner.Will definitely recommend.",5,2012,12,03
143,Maybe its because I'm a Londoner ?,"It fell on me this year to organise an evenings entertainment and hotel accommodation for just the one night for 7 couples here in my native London where I have lived and worked for hhhmph years now.

Having eaten in their restaraunt ""Massimo"" once before and used thier bar to quaff a few ales as a watering hole on my way home, Idecided to give the Corinthia a crack - as its a spankingly brand new luxurious hotel, very centrally located here in London, and mightilly well appointed.

Admittedly, 2 of our party had some hiccups getting checked in to thier rooms - which we later found out was due to previous guests making it unusable (deep thought - were they rock stars and did they trash it ? Or was it that civilised that they forgot to use the loo ? - who knows ? - better still who cares ?) I digress - anyway this didnt really detract from the overall experience and they worked hard to patch it up quick with some drinks from the bar and I believe a comp nights stay for both - so nil desperandum on this front.

Our rooms was simply blinding. All luxuriously decked out to an extremely high standard - and fresh as a daisy.

We all convened early evening in the bassoon bar - a swanky laid back place with cool people and cool music and a bar menu to keep all 14 of us occupied for a week. The manager had called me that afternoon to confirm he had fixed a nice corner for us to dwell and re-assured me he would be looking after us - true to his word he and another 4 or 5 of his staff did - down to ordering cars to take us on to Dover St Wine Bar - a dinner dance club a mile or so away (reminder to self - do a write up on this venue for the children of the 50s / 60s that want a good knees up to some 70's floor fillers).

We rounded up he evening around 1.30am back at the bassoon where getting some late night tucker proved to be a challenge which was a tad disappointing and if we were that determined could have dug our heels in but chose not to - hey ho - no one died.

Check out was a very unregimented and relaxed affair as normally storm trooping chamber maids want to invade by 11am desperate to make the room ready whereas on calling reception to ask what time should we be checking out the reply was ""what time do you want to leave?"" (was this person half way through a spliff I thought ?).Nice.

This gave us time to venture into the bowels of this landmark structure and find the spa and water park (not really) - its a pool, hydro pool, steam and sauna - but boy is it slick and once again just incredibly well done to a high standard.

We woke to the sound of thumping helicopters above and I thought ""this is it !"" (this is what - I dunno) - we later found this was Tom Cruise filming a new film just up the road in Trafalgar Square ""Oi Tom ! Give it a rest - its Sunday morning for Petes sake!""  

Breakfast was truly superb - a feast of almost everything one could wish to gorge on to set you up for a fabulous new day. 

Checking out was painless and the concierge team were helpful and friendly getting us to our waiting taxi to take us back to home to sunny Surrey.

Judging from the folks around us it was mainly touristas and business suits - all very lucky ones at that - as it goes without saying if you come and visit London anytime, you could not have a finer base camp than the Corinthia and given the opportunity, I would gladly tootle back - maybe its because I'm a Londoner ?",5,2012,12,01
143,It must be said---the Perfect Hotel,"My family stayed at this wonderful hotel from November 19 to 24.  From the moment you are greeted by the professional staff you know you are entering a world-class establishment.  It all starts with the staff---not only is there a lot of staff to service your every need, each staff member we encountered exhibited true professionalism and truly seemed to be striving to achieve the moniker of ""Best Hotel in London"".  The rooms are spacious and tastefully decorated and all the public rooms (the Library Lounge, Northall and the bars) were simoply perfect.  My family includes two girls ages 15 and 11---they too loved our stay---from enjoying tea in the Lobbly Lounge--to the central location for easy access to london atttractions.  We have already rebooked for a 7 day stay in March 1013.  You must pick this hotel for your stay!!!",5,2012,11,29
143,They pamper you and treat you like a particularly welcomed guest,"Don't think I'll ever stay anywhere else when I'm in London. The staff is extremely competent and offer impeccable service. They remember your name, they're so polite and helpful. It was amazing. Let's be honest, in five star hotels one is often met by snobs in different positions. It's like they expect you to be grateful they accepted you as their guest. The Corinthia is totally different - and I sincerely hope they continue to be.
The room - spacious - with a gigantic bed and a nice sitting area and office space. Bathroom: one room with two basins and a huge tub. A separate shower room. A separate toilet. Luxurious skin care and hair products. Lovely marble floors. I could have stayed forever.
Magnificent breakfast buffet, including lots of fresh fruit and berries. And all the English breakfast stuff. Grilled mushrooms & tomatoes, bangers, crispy bacon, scrambled eggs, toast, jam - you name it. And even at a busy time in the morning the staff was very present and took away used plates, glasses etc. 
What an excellent, warm and welcoming hotel. And even better - it's contageous. When guests are treated like this, they offer the same great behaviour. I'll be cack - and sooner than they know!",5,2012,11,27
143,One of the world's very best hotels,"We stayed here and mad it our home base for my 60th birthday celebrations in London.  From the very first time we stepped out of our transportation to the hotel and the warm welcome by the ever present doormen who always had a warm word of welcome, until the time we left and the door was closed for our trip back home, the place was magical.  The hotel's general manager managed to find out the reason for our stay and sent a note - as well as a wonderful cake.  Thomas at the door actually remembered to wish me a Happy Birthday and remembered my name!  The superbly knowledgeable bar manager and staff remembered us over several visits.  Each and every one of the staff was a pleasure to talk with - making us feel ultimately welcome as if we were honored guests in their own home.  I am easily able to compare this hotel (and I am so distraught to use that word - since it is so cold now) to the extremely warm memories I have of the once famous Oriental Hotel Bangkok.  I can only dream of returning.",5,2012,11,26
143,There is non like it!!  It is the best!,"We recently stayed there for 3 nights.  My husband and I usually stay at a similarly high end hotel nearby but it was strongly recommended by our agent to try the Corinthia. It Is everything we expect in a top-level hotel in London.   The service was wonderful;  from housekeeping, technical support with WIFI, food, gym and spa, check-in, porters and very importantly, concierge.  The room was spacious (we had a jr suite) and the amenities and features were perfect.  My needed to work fro the room and he was very comfortable and the strong and consistently strong wifi made it possible for him to work without any breaks..We are fussy travelers with high needs and expectations and are prepared to pay for it.  Our expectations were realized and more.   We will return and look forward to it.",5,2012,11,24
143,The service...,"The service at the hotel was amazing. The entire staff bent over backwards to ensure that we (2 adults and 2 children) had a fabulous stay. Talk about going the extra mile - they sent the kids robes, slippers, lollipops, juice, cookies and bags of candy. Not to mention arranged a wonderful day at the aquarium for us! Each night after a day of touring, we were thrilled to come back and enjoy our fabulous hotel. One other important note, the rooms almost seemed sound proof as we couldn't hear anything from our neighbors - very rare indeed!

Another huge bonus for the adults - there was no nickel and diming as you often find with hotels. We got charged the nightly rate and not a cent more for any extras - including breakfast (included in our rate), wifi, etc.

This will be my go to place in London for the fabulous service, dining, location and atmosphere. Thank you Corinthia for a fantastic weekend. Can't wait to see you again next week!!!",5,2012,11,23
143,Hard days night,"I really struggled with the Corinthia. My girlfriend and I had a great meal downstairs in a fairly empty restaurant but nevertheless, the food was delicious. Staff were nice and friendly, very courteous if a little bit aloof but they seemed to mean well. However, when we got to our room and got into bed, I was astounded. The cheap spring mattress they had was super uncomfortable, I barely slept a wink all night. I didnt exactly expect a memory foam mattress but was a cheap mattress topper too much to ask???? If they could sort this out, Id come back but until then, no way",3,2012,11,22
143,Not up to 5 star standards and FREEZING cold room,"My recent 4 night stay at Corinthia London was very disappointing and in relation to the prices they charge I expected a LOT more ...I stayed in Room 214 which had nice bathroom but however the bedroom was very standard what you would find in any hotel with 2 tiny closets for luggage and clothes...My biggest complaint is that my room was FREEZING cold and I spoke to Housekeeping on 3 different occasions to try and have AC controls repaired. They brought an Engineer but it was still freezing afterwards . When sitting at table near balcony window there were terrible draughts around the window which is not double glazing . In the end I had to request a heater which was finally rolled in (on 3 wheels 1 broken) after 40 mins and 2 further calls to Housekeeping ...Staff were indifferent and from older reviews I see that this problem of temperature control had occured previously so its not a new issue...also on check out when I checked over my bill an extra £74 had been added to my bill for Mini-bar items which I hadn't consumed and which was removed without question when I pointed it out...One wonders do they add on amounts randomly which people sometimes end up paying for if in a rush checking out...Final word to Management : sort out the glitches they ruin the experience ! Beware anybody visiting if you're allocated Room 214 !!!  I would NOT return EVER
The courtyard area below the balcony of my room had lairy drunks screaming till early hours of the morning so POOR sleep quality also",2,2012,11,21
143,Very luxorious,"Booked as a very special treat...and it was.  Charming staff, quiet comfortable rooms. Fab location. Check out as flexible as you want.  Breakfast was lovely - choices of everything you could possibly want.  Wish we could have stayed longer. 

Phoned to make the reservation and the chap on the line couldn't have been more charming - chocolate cake in room to celebrate special occasion.",5,2012,11,20
143,True Luxe,"We have stayed at the Corinthia Hotel in London three times and it is the most luxurious hotel we have stayed at in London. 

This was originally built as a grand hotel before being consigned to being a government office block for many years. Its re-emergence from its multi year refurbishment has set a new bar for the other so called luxury hotels in London.

Our rooms could have made the most wonderful studio residences with each having a separate hallway (that can be closed off from the room with sliding doors) and a large walk in wardrobe off that.

Bathrooms are of varying size from the large to the cavernous with separated wc and wet room showers.

The finish on these rooms is to a ridiculously high standard with even the smallest having a two seater round table which is better than any hotel desk I have seen.

The staff are all extremely attentive and helpful - and always cheerful.

The spa area is in itself amazing.

I almost don't want you to go here because it will make it harder for me to get a room if everyone finds out about it.",5,2012,11,20
143,Absolutely outstanding!,"My family and I have just enjoyed two of the most luxurious, indulgent nights at this superb hotel. Attention to detail is a given but the staff manage to attend to your every whim (before you even realise you have one!!), without being intrusive or pompous. Every guest is looked after individually; my 14 year old son was given a Playstation 3 and the latest games in his room and my youngest daughter was given a cute robe with teddy bears which delighted her.
The hotel is perfectly placed and the London Eye is just a short stroll away, perfect for a late night walk. The cocktails in the Bassoon Bar are the most delicious drinks that I have ever tasted.
It was our wedding anniversary and the staff arranged for a bottle of champagne and chocolates to be in our room which was a wonderful touch. The handwritten notes from the hotel manager are also a lovely touch.
I am actually astounded by this hotel and I am determined to return here again soon.",5,2012,11,18
143,Opulence at its best!,"This hotel is fabulous. First, the rooms are beautifully appointed and every detail is thoughtfully worked out to please each guest. Our room is exceptional. The walk-in closet is a dream and the bathroom has a shower with our choice of hand-held or rain-shower. Of course I haven't mentioned the jacuzzi tub with a flat screened tv for ultimate bathing enjoyment. 

I found that the hotel is close to multiple modes of transportation. The first night we walked to the London Eye which was just down the street. Lovely walk and felt very safe. Next day we caught a tour bus across the street and visited Windsor, Stonehenge and Bath with Evans Tours. Highly recommended. Concierge took care of the details. 

Then on third day we walked two minutes to bus stop and took double decker 15 to Tower of London. This was a 20 minute ride. After climbing all over this historic attraction we walked next door and bought tickets back to West London via ferry on the Thames which was a pleasant 20 minute ride. We exited at he Enbankment which is literally across the street from Corinthia Hotel. 

Of course we walked over to Sherlock Holmes Pub, which is located out the back entrance of hotel and across the street, for a London laugher. Then back to Corinthia bar where Michael made us wonderful drinks with just the right amount of zest. Off to dinner at Massimo located in the hotel. 

Great find on my part. Not to mention great history behind the building which is now known as Corinthia. Don't forget to ask the knowledgeable staff about this buildings history. Highly recommended. Worth every penny.",5,2012,11,17
143,One of the best.....,"We stayed in the Hotel Corinthia during the Olympics and arrived early afternoon and before our check in. Seeing my pregnant wife they upgraded us to a suite, to what I can only say is the most spectacular room I've ever stayed in. For a London hotel we had an enourmous room with walk in wardrobe and stunning views over the centre of London. Now that's service.....
The hotel itself is very central, but in a quiet part of the city.
It's a bit pricey, but this is London......
I'd fully recommend the hotel to anyone.",5,2012,11,15
143,Spot on,"Perfect location, very comfortable room with decent coffee facilties, large bed and tastefully furnished. Bathroom is spacious with fluffy towels and lots of ""Smellies"". Staff were very cheerful and polite. Breakfast service wasn't so good on our first morning, second time 'round very good. We mentioned it to the receptionist, who didn't just nod the head and made noises, but seemed like they were going to follow it up. Just a briiliant place to stay.",5,2012,11,15
143,Wonderful hotel,"I stayed at the Corinthia last Friday as I attended a function there.  We were upgraded from a Superior to a Deluxe room which was so big with separate dressing room and even had a balcony you could walk out onto.  The fixture and fittings were of a superior quality and also the decor.  Excellent location opposite Embankment tube.  The breakfast was lovely, gorgeous fresh fruit with organic yogurt.  My husband had a cooked breakfast and had to wait quite a while for it but it was worth it.

We had bowl food at the function, and again this was excellent.  Would definitely recommend this hotel, and will be returning.",5,2012,11,15
143,Lives up to its excellent reputation,"Best hotel I have stayed in, in London, lives up to its excellent reputation. Rooms are a good size, very nicely laid out and great design. Could not fault the room at all only wish my bedroom was like it. Service and staff also very good and attentive, again could not fault the great service. Very relaxed public areas, bars and lounge and not at all stuffy. Only one small gripe and that was the breakfast was average, service very good but the food, we had full English, was a little disappointing. For the price of it I would of expected better presentation. However would definately go back...make sure you ask for a room looking out and not looking into the central atrium.",5,2012,11,14
143,Enjoy the sitting :),"The hotel is very well located, near Embankment tube station, 5-10 minutes walk: London Eye, Trafalgar Square, Big Ben, but in different directions.
 About the room I can tell you it was large, about 50 square meters, there are different types of rooms depending on the number of people and equipment.

 Room was overlooking the hotel's courtyard, very quiet, free from outside noise.

 Mention that the hotel is located in an intersection and has 2 sides to the main road, both noisy.",5,2012,11,14
143,Incredible in every way,"I stayed at the Corinthia last week on a business trip, but absolutely plan on returning for pleasure next time I vacation in Europe.  The hotel is beautiful, the service exemplary, the location is excellent (20 minute walk from most spots of note in the city) and the rooms are both plush and comfortable.  The other reviews speak to the heated marble floors, the beautiful artwork, etc., so I won't reiterate all of those details but will instead confirm their accuracy.  One aspect not written about in great detail is the spa/pool, which is absurdly nice (4 floors, whirlpools, Grade A sauna and steamroom).  The breakfast was tasty, albeit rather expensive.

The only ""negative"" I can raise is the bed.  While it was billed as a king-size bed, it proved to actually be two mattresses pulled together (with king bedding over the top).  I experienced this same set-up in a number of very nice hotels in Italy, so perhaps it is the standard in parts of the EU, but coming from the US, the crack in the middle was not all that enjoyable...",5,2012,11,13
143,Wonderful Stay,"This hotel is perfect in everyway. The service from the time you arrive is second to none. The staff know how to make you feel very welcome and tend to your every need.. We had booked a delux courtroom  room which was large and spacious. The bathroom was superb as it had a large bath and a separate large shower. Our walk-in closet was perfect for storing luggage. We only had breakfast in the hotel once which was delicious. A wide variety of food to choose from.
I would highly recommend this hotel for 5 star service. accommodation and location.",5,2012,11,13
143,Simply the Best,"The Corinthia is sublime.  Every aspect of my stay was excellent; service, accommodations, spa...everything!  This was my second stay at the Corinthia and I will be back.  The room was spacious, well appointed and the bathroom was amazing.  For both stays my room was large, with a walk-in closet and a foyer.  Even the art on the walls feels personal not the typical anonymous hotel room decor.  The service was outstanding from beginning to end.  The spa is not to be missed.  I was pampered and left feeling like a new person. The Corinthia pays attention to the details of its accommodations, spa offerings and ultimately its customers.  I will summarize  my review of the Corinthia with two words - quality and service.",5,2012,11,09
143,Impeccable hotel and service,"Everything about this place was impeccable.  The service was second to none and the rooms were amazing.  Certainly worth the money you pay for.  

Both the room and its ensuite bathroom (with both bathtub and shower room, two sinks) were large.  Very clean, modern and comfortable.  The beds and bedding were hugely comfortable and you could tell that they were of the highest quality.   

The breakfast is pricey (£30 per person) but the buffet selection of both hot and cold foods were extensive - there was a lot on offer.  From fresh fruits to cereals to sausages, mushrooms, potatoes, eggs to a large selection of pastries.  The juices were freshly squeezed, large variety including carrot, apple, orange etc.  The fruits available were really fresh and appeared to be carefully handpicked and served (e.g., large and red strawberries, raspberries, blackberries).  Food was also beautifully displayed.

Due to our travelling circumstances, we were allowed a very late check-out of 2:30pm which we were grateful for.  

Only gripe was that we wanted to have a quick tour of the spa facility to see whether it was worth going in to use them.  We were turned away as we weren't dressed in our robes - they said they didn't allow tours so as to not disturb their guests.  Fair enough, but we're guests all the same having paid a lot to stay there so we should be allowed to all the same.  We felt it was a an inconvenience to ask for us to return dressed in our robes to then allow us to view the facilities - so we missed out on this.",5,2012,11,06
143,Perfect hotel in London,"Everything is already said in other reviews. The hotel lies 200 m from Horseguards in a side street. Also not far from the Riverside.
Checkin was very welcoming. Hotel and rooms were shown by reception staff.
Room was very clean and modern. It had a  huge bathroom  with rain shower and bath with TV.
Dressing was small and had just enough space to stall luggage. Airco was electronic and perfect. On the door you could light to not disturb or make my room signs. Beds were very large. The room was very soundproof, view was streetview. Eveningturnover was ok.
Breakfast in the Northall is a little bit confusing in the beginning. Once seated you recieve a menu card to order, but you have also the buffet with a wide choice of everything although in small portions. The emphasis is on healthy food i think, which i liked  very much.
Be sure breakfast is included in room price otherwise it can be surprising when you order different things!
Public spaces are very nice flowered and very well maintained. Staff is always very present and concerned in you.
Outside the hotel there were often  queues of people waiting around central entrance waiting for celebs residing in the hotel.
Checkout was on the hour we wanted late afternoon. 
To conclude: top 5 star in central London, lying quietly but close to major attractions and shopping areas.",5,2012,11,05
143,Corinthia,"We stayed at the Corinthia in September of 2012. It was wonderful. Our room was large and elegant. The most important quality for me in any hotel is cleanliness. The Corinthia was sparkling clean in all aspects. Service was terrific, and the staff was friendly and helpful. I can say nothing negative. We would definitely stay there again.",5,2012,11,05
143,Lovely time - but could have been an Outstanding time !,"We stayed at the Corinthia hotel on the weekend of the 26th October .My Partner and daughter booked an Executive Delux suite which was lovely ,a real wow factor .As we arrived in our room I confirmed with the young lady who showed us to our room that we would be checking out around 8pm the next day as agreed when I booked the room . ( the hotel advertises this flexible check out terms which was a big reason I booked the hotel ) Well ,sadly the yorng lady responded by saying the check out was 12pm and that policy was no longer valid. I was ,and so were my family really disappointed ,which dampened the mood considerably .

After complaining I was offered another room for the next day after 12pm  , when we came back from shopping the room was so small all three of us couldnt relax there so we were keen to check out and get home.. not the weekend I had planned at all . I had paid for a meal for two in the Northall restaurant as part of the deal ,My partner did not want to stay for that .

It is a stunning hotel ,so without that hic cup it would have been a perfect weekend .The staff are  really friendly in the restaurants , reception area the lounge staff were a little frosty .

The mood picked up when my 14 year old daughter met some of the X factor finalists in the loby and said hello .

I must recommend Graham the hairdresser that works in the salon at the hotel .Lovely man and great hairdresser.My partner sent me up a glass of wine to chill me out from my frustration that my booking was not being honoured.

So why had the policy changed ? On leaving the hotel on Saturday a huge coach arrived with all the Manchester United team on it   -Hmm that could be why our room was no longer available the next day .My daughter did get a photo with the lovely Robin Van Persie ,so she was very pleased and I had my answer.

On checking out we had a lovely receptionist who listened to my concerns ,who then  made a gesture of good will ,which I was thankfull for.

It you get what you paid for the hotel is stunning ,sadly it did not live up to my expectations.",4,2012,11,05
143,Just like a great hotel in the US...,We had a standard rm with king size bed and the entire decor and ambiance exceeded our expectation for what you get in London! The room was spacious and newly renovated.  The bathroom had a built in TV at the end of the tub and a rain shower head in the marble tiled shower stall.  Every detail was top notch! We had a great stay there for 4 nights.,5,2012,11,05
143,Excellent Hotel,"A perfect stay in a perfect Hotel! 
Maybe the best property in London, the SPA-Area is definitively by far the best in the city. Location absolutely superb. The staff were amazing  and very helpful at any time. We will definitively return!",5,2012,11,04
143,Perfect experience,"Our stay at the Corinthia was a competition prize and we felt we had won the Lottery! Everything was superb, even the beds were really comfortable and the rooms very spacious. The staff were amazing - nothing was too much trouble. The restaurant even supplied delicious gluten free bread for me. We were disappointed that the Spa had no free appointments but the swimming pool and sauna area in the basement were astonishingly luxurious. I would not hesitate to stay there again and would certainly recommend it very highly.",5,2012,11,01
143,Outstanding Service and Beautiful Accomodation,"We recently spent 8 nights at the hotel to celebrate my birthday on the first leg of a 7 week European vacation. The experience was so positive we have decided to extend our holiday in order to return to London and stay at the Corinthia. Of course as many have noted the property is physically exceptional featuring very large rooms decorated with understated and impeccable taste. However what truly separates this property from the other luxe London hotels we have stayed in is a culture of genuine hospitality we experienced from arrival to departure from all  staff no matter their role or responsibility. The staff were accommodating and approachable and above all they were 'correct' in their comportment without that stiffness which is almost an affectation at certain high-end London hotels.  As an example, the concierge team secured us tickets for a sold-out Richard III and made it their mission (we later learned) to do so by working their venue contacts rather than simply pay a mark-up to a tout. 

We had a few routine glitches during our stay but they were handled deftly and efficiently as were any 'special requests'.  And to a few earlier posts --- yes, the lighting system is a bit unusual but after a few days it actually became quite intuitive. 

The spa facilities are excellent. 

The 24-hour check-in/out is not only brilliant for one's individual convenience, it also mitigates the late morning frenzy one always finds in hotel lobbies. The policy helps maintain a sense of calm.

Clearly, the hotel's management + ownership have placed great importance on ensuring a sense of well-being for their guests and in our case they succeeded.",5,2012,10,30
143,Excellent Hotel,"The Corinthia is an excellent choice and lives up to the reviews. We stayed in an executive king street view room. The bathroom and walk in rain shower are amazing. Street noise dies down at night and was not a problem. Location is superb with tube access right across the street. The Hungerford pedestrian bridge is right there as well for great views of the Eye and Big Ben/Parliament. If you haven't done so, walk out there at dawn or dusk on a day with at least a little sunshine for amazing views and photographs (take a tripod or rest your camera on something). The staff are very professional and accomodating, as one would expect with this kind of hotel. All lobby areas are very nice. The Corinthia will be our first choice of hotel for future trips to London, and we'll definitely stay there again. Expensive, but you get what you pay for. 

The soft bed linens and fluffy pillows are perfect, although the bed itself was not as cushy as we hoped.",5,2012,10,28
143,Just read the reviews,"What more can a person say about this hotel. Location is about the only thing not given to much mention in the reviews and this is just so well placed, we walked to all the sights we wanted to see. The reviews tell the rest of the hotels best points.   6 star rating from our family.",5,2012,10,28
143,Great Expectations,"Stayed here last week for 2 nights on the Autumn Retreat deal which included english breakfast and dinner in the Northall restaurant.
We picked the hotel because of location and the improving Tripadvisor ratings. It is clear that the hotel follows all its feedback and acts on it. I have already given my feedback to the hotel via the after visit e-mail survey.
I had booked the  hotel using their own website and at the time of booking I chose a non courtyard deluxe king but my print out only said deluxe king. I thought that it might be difficult to guarantee where the room would be as the hotel allows 24 hour check in. As it turned out the room was a courtyard view.
The room was large, clean, with a small wardrobe/dressing area. There was a small balcony area opening into the courtyard but there is a sign on the window advising that you may be locked out of your room as the door does not open from the outside. Probably good for security but I felt you could easily miss the sign or not understand it if english is not known. The internal doors in the room did not shut properly.. building snags that should be sorted by now.
Went to dinner in the Northall, meal and service were very good, although menu restricted to 1 of 3 for each course.
Visited the cocktail bar, and again all fine there.
Next morning went for breakfast. Taken to a table, given menu, and coffee was brought. However  no-one came to take our order, even though it was very well staffed. My husband told one of the managers that our order had not been taken. Still no-one came. We just helped ourselves to the buffet instead. We thought this was quite rude and the service was not up to the standard you would expect. It really did affect what I thought of the hotel. I wrote a letter to say what had happened and handed it to reception.
We went out for a full day and returned at 7pm and went to reception to book a time for dinner. No response to letter. Went to the room. It was being turned down for the evening! By the way did not get chocolates as others have written... it was boiled sweets.
Dinner fine.
Opened the curtains in the morning to see fag ends lying over the balcony and courtyard area.
Went to breakfast , and we were given an apology for what happened previously. We were offered dinner in Massimo as recompense but that was changed to lunch when we said we were leaving that day.
At check out, I was to be charged for dinner in the Northall for one night. The receptionist went to query this and came back and said that it was indeed included in the room rate. I told her that I probably would not book  a ""deal"" again as I did not rate the breakfast.(poached egg tasteless and overcooked).
Massimo lunch and service excellent.
Overall the hotel is fabulous in all the public areas.It seems to be the hotel to be seen at and seems really ""bling"". There seems to be a lot of business and media people. I did see the rent a mob and photographers but none of the drama reported in the press. I think we were expecting too much.",3,2012,10,24
143,Corinthia Wins Gold Medal,"The Corinthia Hotel has the softest linens and fluffiest pillows ever!!  Since my husband was on business, I appreciated the double doors separating the sleeping area from the hallway into the bathroom.  But the powerful rain shower is motivation to get up.  The lovely bathroom has heated floors, towel bars and includes a TV  but had no outlets for a hairdryer.  Inconvenient.

The gorgeous hotel is in a fantastic location for sightseeing.  But you may be tempted to stay in and enjoy the attentive staff serving Afternoon Tea, the stunning spa and pool or relax on courtyard patio with fireplaces at each end.  You're going to love this place!",5,2012,10,23
143,Stunning hotel!,"Just spent my birthday weekend at this beautiful hotel!! The staff could'nt do enough for us and the hotel its self is simply gorgeous! The massive bed has to be the most comfortable I have ever slept in, and that includes  my own at home!! The decor of the room was wonderful right down to the smallest detail, they even put an umberella in the wardrobe. The marble bathroom with double sinks and a fantastic shower was very luxurious. including a TV set in the wall to watch whilst relaxing in the bath. The bar had a nice ambiance with a piano player. All in all this is a lovely hotel and well worth the price.One minor detail was we bought a bottle of wine in the restaurant and wanted to take the remainder into the bar to finish there but apparently it was not allowed which seemed somewhat petty, not the staff's fault as they were willing to ask the manager but we declined and left the bottle of wine as did not want to make a big deal out of it.
Great location for the West End and Covent Garden and all the best London sights are in easy reach.",5,2012,10,22
143,"Beautiful accommodations, Exceptional service!","We recently spent one of the most wonderful weeks at the Corinthia Hotel.

First let me start with a couple of small nuances that we encountered.  Get them out of the way, before I rave about the hotel.  I must emphasize that our opinion of the hotel was not impacted negatively by any of these.  

If you are a fan of the X Factor UK you will be delighted to know that the contestants stay at the hotel.  If not, you would want to know that the front street entrance is often crowded with fans and paparazzi.  The contestants do love the attention.  We learned to use the back entrance to avoid overcrowding.   Unfortunately, there is not taxi service there.  

The morning after our arrival we dined in the bar area of Northall for breakfast.  Shortly after we were seated we were told that they would be removing the buffet and beginning to set up for lunch.  They also swept the floor around us as we rushed to finish our breakfast.  There are other options within the hotel for a late breakfast and I wish they had informed us before we were seated.  Specifically, the Lobby Lounge and Northall.   

When we checked in we were initially given a room that was not overlooking the courtyard as reserved.  Upon notifying the front desk of this, after some time they moved us to a courtyard room which smelled of smoke.  The bellhop agreed and we waited for a third room.  3rd time was a charm.

Once we were settled into our new room, much earlier in the day than any other hotel would have your room ready, our special stay began.  The Corinthia thought of everything when they designed this hotel.  The room was spacious, overlooking the courtyard with a small balcony.  The wardrobe space (yes I said wardrobe), is bigger than most people I know space in their home.  There are plenty of drawers, shelves, and rods for organizing your belongings.  The safe is large enough to store any of your valuables.  It was also nice to be able to leave our luggage in this space and out of the actually living area.  The white marble bathroom is huge and includes separate areas for the shower and toilet.   I have never slept so good in a hotel before.  The hotel was completely booked during our stay and we never heard the smallest sound while in our room.  
The king size bed was, well ...fit for a King!  Amazingly comfortable.  You have the ability to control all of the room lighting from your bedside table.  First time I've seen this in a hotel.  After I ruined my blow dryer, I was dreading the thought of the typical in room blow dryer provided by hotels.  I should have known better.  Even the blow dryer is amazing professional quality.

We had wonderful service throughout our stay.  Concierge was helpful with last minute theatre tickets, tour reservations, and restaurant reservations.  We were thrilled with all of their recommendations.  We dined at all of the hotel restaurants and were not disappointed by the food selection and quality or the service.    We enjoyed the beautiful Lobby Lounge on many evenings for a pre-dinner drink.   I did go to the Daniel Galvin salon once for a blow dry.  Ricky is a master.  The best blow out I ever had!

The staff goes out of their way to make sure your stay is comfortable and exceptional.  They are 100% sincere when they ask you if there is anything they can do for you.  I was asked while walking in the corridor, in the elevator, and all the more obvious places if there was anything I needed.  The Corinthia Hotel takes service very seriously and they deliver on this. 

We can not wait for our next stay!",5,2012,10,21
143,Perfection,"My family and I stayed in a Deluxe Junior Suite this weekend as part of the ""Suite Treats"" package, and I cannot fault the experience. The hotel stands alone in London, helped by it's warm, knowledgable staff, contemporary, elegant ambience and modern, stylish spaces. The 24 hour check in/out policy is a revelation and allowed us to truly enjoy our stay in accordance with our travel schedule. Even before arrival we were contacted to ensure any requests could be catered for and upon check in, we were escorted on a tour of the hotel's facilities by the very helpful reception staff. The room, 316 was stunning with a separate vestibule, walk in wardrobe, sitting room and a spacious bedroom with balcony. The Corinthia understands that sometimes the little details change a hotel room to a home from home - fresh cut flowers, chocolates, art books, a decent coffee machine etc all made the space feel ours very quickly. Our butler was discreetly attentive and friendly, and talked us through the nuances of the room before leaving us his card to call for anything we needed. The bed was extremely comfortable, the furniture is understated but beautiful and the shower is the best I've encountered in all my travels. The room was also far quieter than expected, which may have been helped by our facing the courtyard but which nonethess was a welcome surprise. We had in room dining for dinner which was prompt, delicious and reasonably priced for London. Breakfast in The Northall restaurant was included and having dined there for dinner before, I was pleased to see that the quality of the food and the professionalism of the staff was the same. More than anything, I was impressed by the friendliness and flexibility of the hotel staff, all of whom went out of their way to make us feel welcome and accommodate our needs in a sincere and positive manner. In my opinion, the Corinthia sets a new standard for five star service, ambience and luxury in London and we will certainly be returning.",5,2012,10,21
143,FANTASTIC - New Favorite Hotel in London,"The Corinthia Hotel London was new for us. It is located centrally in Whitehall, a block from the Underground.

It was wonderful experience all around.

The bed was so very comfortable and the rooms were great. Probably the best shower we have ever been in. The staff, from the doorman and maids, servers in the restaurants to the desk and concierges to the front desk was to a person helpful, warm and very competent. SPECTACULAR is the best way to describe them. 

It is a bit pricey (but it was London) and we had a package that had every 3rd night free and breakfast included so that helped.

If you are looking to a high end hotel, do not pass this one up!",5,2012,10,20
143,A very special hotel,"The Corinthia Hotel magic starts at the door, the professional but not stuffy employees are welcoming and warm. Check in is efficient and easy.
My hotel suite was stunning, big bathroom and very well designed.
We had champagne in the bar which was stunning.
Highly recommend for a special stay in London 5🌟",5,2012,10,18
143,Worth every penny!,"Maybe a tad more expensive then some hotels but this truly is the best hotel we have ever stayed in. It was my wife's birthday and we were upgraded to an executive suite. There was a yummy chocolate cake in the room. The art of a true class hotel is to be 5 star but also very welcoming. We felt like honoured guests from the minute we set foot in the hotel. Very impressed. Loved the spar. Fabulous breakfast, all food top quality. Room perfect, bed incredible. Excellent soundproofing. Love the ESPA bathroom and the bath TV! We will definitely make this our  London hotel.",5,2012,10,17
143,Top quality service,"Very impressed by all aspects of this hotel. On the doorstep of Trafalgar Square, stones throw from The London Eye, short walk to Regent/Oxford Street you couldn't be better placed for sightseeing/shopping. The hotel itself is cool and contemporary yet equally welcoming. Professional and warm service, echoed throughout our stay with all staff. Massimo restaurant excellent food, service and ambience. Outstanding room with best ever shower-super turbo charged water pressure! Compelled to write this review by our outstanding stay in this top hotel.",5,2012,10,17
143,5 star,"This is a true 5 star hotel.  My stay was for 5 nights so I had a good chance to really check this place out.  The architecture is fantastic. The ballrooms and common areas make you feel like you are in a real palace and not the fake glitz you sometimes see. The staff go out of their way to accommodate and the service level is high.  Rooms get a thorough cleanup every day and the rooms were indeed spotless.  The very large bathroom had super facilities from the tub to the shower to the heated tile floor.   Hardwood floors, separate dressing room, tasteful artwork, comfy beds and upscale lighting made my stay very, very easy and....nice.  The exercise facility in the spa is probably way better than your everyday facility.  There were a couple downsides.    Wireless internet tended to be slow.   The breakfast staff in the hotel restaurant tended to be harried and service was consistently slow.  Since breakfast was included in the room charge, I simply gave my room number at entrance and did not wait for the staff to do anything.   When I was ready to go, I left and all worked out fine.  The breakfast buffet had a super selection of high quality options but at a premium price.",5,2012,10,17
143,"Classy, Inviting Hotel","Despite the fact that we have family in London that recommended Browns or Dean Street Townhouse, we took the advice or our American Express Travel Agent and stayed at the Corinthia from October 3  through the 6.  SO very glad we did!  This is a beautiful, classy, but very warm and inviting hotel property.  It has an amazing, comfortable lobby where you can have high tea, a coffee, evening drink or just sit and relax.  The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable helping us with everything from dinner recommendations/reservations, touring info and even giving us a ride to dinner one night (gratis) in the hotel's Jaguar!  My husband and I went with our 22 year old son as a graduation/lets do something fun before you start your career trip.  We booked standard rooms - both were wonderful.  The rooms were generous in size and wonderfully furnished.  Our son's room was more ""standard"" in that he had a regular closet and just one sink in the wonderful marble bathroom.  Our room, however, had a very large (dressing room size) closet and a small ""juliet"" balcony that overlooked an interior courtyard.  Our bathroom had two sinks (which we find very handy).  The shower is AMAZING.  The location is great - very near to the river, Parliament, etc.  Hands down on our next trip to London we will stay at the Corinthia (for that matter if we are in any of the cities where there are other Corinthia Hotels we will give them very serious consideration).  AWESOME!",5,2012,10,16
143,True grand hotel spirit,"Even though it was a short stay during 2011 WTM. I had a chance to really explore the hotel.  Location was superb, only few steps away from the metro station, rooms were absolutely huge compared to what London hotels usually offer and service was exceptional. Every inch of the hotel, from the grand entrance filled with flowers to the great restaurants and the bar was a joy to be in after a long, exhausting day of meetings. Most important of all, bed was so comfortable, it was the best night's sleep I've had in ages. Even though it may seem more of a man's hotel with dark wood and leather furniture, just one glimpse of that cute Harrods store inside the hotel will make it every woman's fave hotel even if you're not a huge fan of shopping.",5,2012,10,15
143,One of the best,"This hotel would be one of the very best hotels we have stayed in. I could happily have stayed a week or more! The rooms were very well appointed and fabulous bathroom. The room was also large by London standards. The turndown service was also great with robes and slippers laid out and chocolates on the pillow. Service was good, we had a small problem with our room not being available when we arrived but the hotel dealt with this by offering us a complimentary dinner at Massimo. The spa was also well worth a visit. The location could not have been better, walking distance from Buckingham Palace and Trafalgar Square. Overall, I felt very pampered staying at this hotel which is as it should be at a 5 star and expensive hotel. I would definitely stay here again.
",5,2012,10,15
143,Excellent stay,"Had a fantastic trip to celebrate my wifes birthday.  Staff were excellent and the hotel was fantastic.  The room was very comfortable and had a great nights sleep.  dinner and breakfast were of superb quality and delicious. Spa facilities are very good and the extent unexpected.  This hotel is one of the best in London, and the little touches were appreciated, after all they make a stay what it is.",5,2012,10,14
143,A little gem!,"Superb location for a gem of a top notch hotel. Trafalgar Square, the Mall, the Strand all within two minutes walk. The service, attention to detail and the rooms were all outstanding. Faultless accomodation that you are unlikely to improve on in London. The small touches set this hotel apart from the main stream of the hum drum city centre hotels!",5,2012,10,14
143,Truly Amazing Hotel,"Beautiful, elegant and simply wonderful hotel. Highly recommend checking out the Espa Life spa and fitness centre. Each and every little detail at the Corinthia is perfect. The rooms are spacious, yet very homely. So many extra touches like the Nespresso machines, huge showers, TV wall mounted above the bath, double sinks, in room AV systems make this truly contemporary hotel set within a traditional London building, worth every penny.",5,2012,10,13
143,Stunning!,"Absolutely stunning hotel and a real welcome addition to the luxury inventory of london!  Wonderful rooms, and breakfast from room service was exceptional.  This hotel is expensive but for the one night we were there it was fine as a treat.  The lobby is grand and service throughout was perfect.",5,2012,10,12
143,Best of the Best - With bonus of 24-Hour Check-In!!!,"The Corinthia hotel is simply the best of the best hotels in London, albeit at a price!

The hotel was recently refurbished and offers pure quality throughout all the rooms.  The finishings are all high quality with the bathrooms big enough to swing a cat in with hand and rain shower options and a separate bath (with a tv - or at least in ours).  Nespresso Coffee machines are also included to get you that morning hit before you venture out. With the rest of the room well appointed.

The service from the international staff was also top quality and very attentive.

The location can only be matched by a few hotels in the area, the London Eye, House of Parliament, Whitehall and more just at your door step.  With the Embankment Tube stop about 100m away, the rest of London is just a short trip away.

The hotel offers free wi-fi (which was a good bandwidth) to all guests.

The best part of the hotel, we don't know any like it in London, is the 24-hour check-in.  Your room is ready regardless of when you arrive.  This is an added bonus if you arrive early from an intercontinental flight and want to freshen up before meetings.  This is one aspect that clearly ups the price, but at the end of the day, it is well worth it.",5,2012,10,11
143,A perfect getaway with my wife!,"The location of the hotel is superb, around the corner at the House of Parliament and facing the london Eye. 
The rooms are modern and very spacious. The bathroom is also very large and luxurious equiped. There is a rain-shower that will blow you away. There is even a television in the bath!
The staff is very friendly and the concierge is great! He did a fantastic job trying to get reservations for an outstanding dinner in the city. 
The bar in the hotel is a true gem with fantastic cocktails on the list.
Not to mention the spa and the swimming-pool in the mezzanine. Just one word: WOW! 
One thing: I thought breakfast was not sensational (according the price), but what the heck, your'e in London baby!! Enough possibilities to have a nice breakfast at a nice local pub! So there is also a great escape to do that anyway!
All this of course comes with a certain price-tag, it was worth it! We will be here very soon!! It was perfect!",5,2012,10,10
143,Best Hotel in London - shame it's so expensive,"I had previously found it hard to find a great hotel to stay at in London but was fortunate enough to stumble upon this hotel for business and loved it. On this occasion I needed to stay somewhere in London to recuperate following an operation and I could think of nowhere else that I would rather stay.
The rooms are great, very nice decor and a wonderfully comfortable bed. The service is very good, everything provided promptly and with much courtesy, although the in-room dining menu is a bit limited.
The hotel has great ambiance and atmosphere, feeling like a special place to be. I think they were filming X-Factor whilst we were there!
I haven't tried out the impressive looking spa and pool but have used the gym which is spacious and very well equipped (of a very good standard for a hotel gym).
The hotel also benefits from being in a great location in Whitehall, handy for shopping, walking to the sites and for business to the City.
I have now recommended the hotel to a number of friends and colleague and they are never disappointed.
The only real problem is that because it is so popular, the room rates appear to have risen dramatically. Notwithstanding the cost, however, we would still do all we could to stay here rather than anywhere else in London.
Looking forward to our next visit!",5,2012,10,10
143,Wonderful hotel,"Stayed here for one night to attend a seminar that was being held at the hotel. Simply from start to finish the whole experience was superb. We had lunch, dinner and breakfast at the hotel and they were excellent. My room was spacious and beautifully appointed, and the bathroom a drea. Best part is it was all free as a fear the cost of staying here is prohibitive for most.",5,2012,10,08
143,A Gem-Off the Radar. Best Hotel,"First I want to apologize to the hotel in my delay and slack in writing this review. Got Home and Life just happens..No excuses just WOW OH WOW..I wanted to give the Hotel and the review the time it deserves-They are more then 7 stars.They sure were not slack in there service,hospitality and open arms welcoming.(you will see I am kinda a dramatic gurl-LOL

This is a wonderful Hotel,the pictures do not ---I repeat ---do not do it even come  close to doing the hotel justice! I am hoping my pictures will help with that-you be the judge!

The Hotels sheer designer opulence and attention to detail is remarkable. I also want to say I read all reviews before booking here.
 Some were umm emmm well ---a little less complimentary-I dont know why. I hope you will all think twice and stay here over some where else!
The staff, I swear must have to answer a secret question only they know. For what I mean by this,is that they all are there to help you have AN UNBELIEVABLE STAY!!!! And I do mean unbelievable stay. 

The whole staff and I do mean all the staff from Concierge,Front Desk greeters to the Door Man to the Porters(who I might say if you are from the states 1 of them  looks just like a young version of  Christian Slater was soo sweet ran down the street got taxis when it took to long or was raining,he took pics for us) The one Door man who is from Ireland gave us suggestions where to go as this was our 2nd leg of the trip. We were going to the Notre Dame Game there.To the cleaning staff,as I smoke(oh there is no smoking in the rooms or in hotel)however there is a lovely courtyard that is built between the hotel walls that you may smoke a cig or cigar. Lovely fireplaces at each end and you may also order sandwiches or tea. To the  restaurant servers at Massimos the Head Receiptionist Oonagha,to Maxime the Asst Manager who waited on us. 
Everyone and I do mean everyone from the Concierges with Darren, Justin and Sebastian, to the Front Desk Ben Milsom Reservations Supervisor.  He helped with the car  service(we chose a JaguarXJ cost of £140  from the service of"" Quintessentially""(please ask for Mark07738971555) and the  initial reservation.

Our room was unbelievable a  deluxe room,a lovely chocolate confection cake to celebrate our 1st trip to london and more. He made it all so special with champagne,which was waiting for us in the room. To Jean Louis Fresta -Front of House Manager to Julius Asst front desk supervisor. We had a slight problem with the first room heated floors(which seem to be standard in all rooms) not working.(Oh yes the hotel has free yes free wifi and it worked in our room along with the one we switched to! )They tried to fix the problem but were unable to with out major work in house.They were very courteous as they wont enter your room if you have DND light on or are not there and have not spoken to you to enter. If you read the review you will see I am trying to point out what others seem to find fault with where we DID NOT.
 Also the closet was huge in this standard room. Not be able to fix this  they offered to move us from room #726 deluxe to  room #321 which was a beautiful suite.
The room was excellently appointed in decoration. There are 2 rooms a small hallway and 1 full bathroom along with a entry hallway with a guest bath as we did entertain while there we did biz and pleasure. I loved the room with its accessories books to read Chanel and more all for the guests enjoyment. I must mention I loved the makeup table with mirror drawers so chic!
I also want to say we didnt even need to leave the hotel if we chose not to.
 The brkfst was lawesome, so many choices to choose from.Breads eggs sausage bacon ceral fresh fruit yogart I think you get it. You could also see a menu if you didnt want the continental Breakfast. This served breakfast and lunch tea can be had in the wonderful hotel lobby which really isnt a hotel lobby like we think of in the states. Dinner can be had at Massimos yumme yumme italian and a French Restaruant which we did not eat there. The spa which was phenomenal along with a  work out room,lots of water and use of certain spa amenities.

 WOW OH WOW Thank You to Renaud Gregoire who I also had the pleasure to meet. He enables his staff to take care of the situation-get it handled make the customer happy! 

I am sure if  you are reading this you can see how much we loved this hotel. I hope you read this in its entirety,Yes I do go on and on...When a hotel deserves this recognition it should be lengthy.
 We have stayed all over in mostly 6+ star/Diamond etc Hotels from California to Hawaii to Rome Cavalieri Hotel. This is the Jewel of all!
Once you read this review please contact me if you have any questions.

We loved it so much we are going back in November --yes just 2 short months later..
I just didnt want to leave ever. 

When we first arrived our stay was originally for 3 days, we extended our stay from 3 days to 4 more for a total of 7days---still not long enough!
Please realize you are in Europe and if you are from the states things/matters do run a little differently here.There is a hierarchy so know they do want to help you but must get the all ok from higher....Please treat the hotel and staff with courtesy (No I don't work here or for any hotel affiliation with them or any Hotel for that matter) .If there is a blip with your reservation or room just be patient. 

There are so many people from the Hotel to say ""Thank You"" to. I hope you will show this to your staff Mr Dixion.

Thank You to you and all your staff for making our trip to LONDON so unbelievable we already have reservations for November 18th to 24th-confirmed!
Sincerely 
With Warm Regards

143,Pretty spectacular in London,"Had the great good fortune to stay at the Corinthia for two nights last week and wow!  This brings a whole new level to the London hotel scene.  Stayed in an executive room which was enormous and incredibly well appointed with details and modcons.  Everything about the hotel is done well.  It is indeed, a large hotel with an equally large and magnificent lobby where, I confess, lI got lost on more than one occasion while trying to find the correct elevator bank for my room.   

My room - 217 - had a little foyer/dressing area and separate bedroom.  Impressive size and attention to detail.  Open closet, light comes on.  Close closet, light goes off.  Little things like that. Bathroom was pretty phenomenal, too.  Great big bathtub and even bigger shower.  Even a TV sunk into the wall so one can watch while one bathes.  Everything thought through.  

Ate in both restaurants and food so so so good.  And the restaurants are so heavenly beautiful, all working off a similar thematic as the amazing Baccarat chandelier in the lobby - and great big glass orb hanging in the Italian restaurant.  Had a proper English Sunday Lunch with roast beef and yorkshire pudding that was the best meal of the entire trip.  Great fun bar, as well, with a bar that is not only designed to look like a piano, but it plays, too!  Too good!  And great cocktails - just a great place to hang out after dinner.  

The Corinthia's location is pretty fabulous, as well.  There is so much to do around the area - Trafalgar Square is a 5-min walk, as is the London Eye. 

If you are looking for event space, Corinthia has some stunning ballrooms along with small dining and private areas that will spoil anyone.  The business center and extremely efficient floor of small conference rooms makes for a really nice meeting and/or conference experience.  And the penthouses!!!  All with lofts and private terraces.  We saw the music-themed penthouse with its beautiful fireplace, grand piano and cool record player (records!) and didn't want to leave.  

I never got the opportunity to use the spa, but I had a quick tour and it is truly astonishingly well done and beautiful.  It is worth spending a day, minimum.  The pool is pretty impressive.  The gym is huge and has all the newest equipment.  

It is easy to see why there is such a buzz about the Corinthia.  It is really pretty spectacular.",5,2012,10,07
143,The Place To Stay,"This hotel is the BEST place to stay in all of London!!! The staff is friendly, accommodating and amazing! Our room was spotless and just gorgeous, and the turn service with chocolates was an added plus for sure! The location is spectacular and centrally located. 

While on vacation with my husband and another couple, the husband of the other couple had a heart attack. The manager and all of concierge bent over backwards to assist with our other travel plans and helped extend our stay at new home away from home. The Corinthia staff sent them flowers and a fruit basket. What other hotel does that?  

Although I did not get a massage, I did go to the spa and used the hot tub. As a hotel guest was free to use the amenities.  There are three hot stone chaises which were wonderful.  The steam room was unbelievable and the set up for the sauna was very nice!!!

I am back home now in the States, but I will never forget my magical time here at the Corinthia.  Hopefully one day I can return to London and I will only stay here!!",5,2012,10,06
143,phenomenal,"Had the fortune to stay at the Corinthia for a recent conference. Was joined by my better half and it is safe to say we were both blown away by the sheer opulence, pretty impressive since the night before I had stayed at The Savoy.

The best way to describe the hotel is too imagine the very best of Las Vegas just on a slight smaller scale.

Our room was fantastic - mood lighting, walk in closet, three chairs, footstool, big TV, media centre. TV at the end of the bath. Walk in shower with rainfall type shower head built in to the ceiling. The best ESPA smellys.

All the staff were friendly and courteous (slight language problem asking a chambermaid for an iron but easily overlooked given the high standards throughout).

The only niggles would be the toilets being called 'restrooms' - we are in London not the USA - and struggling to find a toilet on the ground floor and having to catch a lift to the lower ground floor (might just not have found them on the ground floor).

Excellent location, just 5 minutes walk from Trafalgar Square.",5,2012,10,06
143,Excellent,"We went to the Corinthia last night for dinner in the Massimo restaurant as we'd found a deal with Travelzoo a couple of months ago and finally got round to going last night. I wish we'd gone sooner! Our waiter (Daniel from Corsica) was absolutely wonderful, friendly, attentive and knowledgeable about the menu, his recommendations were spot on. The food was very good, particularly my husband's tuna starter, and they also do my favourite thing ever - courgette flowers. The courgette flowers are part of a couple of dishes but I asked if I could have some as a side dish and the chef was happy to oblige so I got to scoff a whole bowl of them, lush. The only downside to Massimo is the walk to the toilet! It's miles away on the other side of the hotel lobby as there's only one on the whole of the ground floor.  

Fortunately my hike to the loo meant I got to have a good look around the lobby area and we continued the exploring after dinner with a drink in the Northall bar. The setting for this grand bar couldn't be better with lots of gold, marble and shiny mirrors. Our cocktails were very well made but the service was slow and half of the bar seemed to be given over to storing the dirty glasses from the adjacent restaurant so, after one drink, we moved through to the Bassoon bar.

I agree with a previous reviewer as the Bassoon bar may well be one of the best cocktail bars in London, with the best staff. The Czech barman there was absolutely brilliant, we had seats facing the bar and were transfixed by the creations he was coming up with. This meant that each time a new, exciting looking drink was made for someone else we had to accost a waiter and ask 'what's that??' then one thing led to another and I just had to order it...... The bar is lovely, the music is perfect cocktail bar style and the piano player was happy to oblige my requests.

We had another good nose round the very grand lobby before we left, the lobby lounge is a great idea with another simple bar area and an incredible, huge chandelier. It was fairly late when we left and chucking it down with rain so we waited in some comfy chairs whilst the lovely doormen hailed us a cab. In the cab on the way home our cabbie said he always liked picking up from the Corinthia as the doormen were always really friendly and polite (not like at some other fancy hotels apparently!) and I think that's the real difference at the Corinthia. It's obviously a grand, 5* hotel with great restaurants and lovely bars, but what sets it above other hotels is its consistently excellent staff. Can't wait to go back!!",5,2012,10,06
143,True 5 star,Stayed here about 6 times now.  I love it. The bassoon bar is the best cocktail bar in London   Breakfast excellent.  It is expensive but worth it.  The bathrooms are beautiful   The only thing I don't like are the chocolates in the room.  Great quality but just too rich.  I think I may be a hethan   I just love cadbury ,5,2012,10,05
143,"That was excellent, especially for London","I spent 2 nights for a conference at the Corinthia and found it excellent. Let's start with the only negative: service at the bar was lousy. For the rest, everything was really great. Reception was efficient and friendly (and english speaking...), staff in the hotel asked if they could help when i was looking for the bathrooms (in other hotels they simply ignore you), restaurant food at Massimo was good, service ok, the rooms are actually rather large for London and I liked the design (not too much bling-bling, practical, quite air conditioning, super large bathroom with super large bathtub). Spa and fitness are simply fabulous with really cool design. There is also a pool (so if I want to be a pain i could say that it could be a bit longer...). Conclusion: a really great place in London...if you are ready to pay the expensive price",5,2012,10,03
143,Fantastic,"We got a really good deal and stayed at this hotel last January.Everything at the Corinthia js new and this is what we really liked since it is unusual for London.Rooms are specious,bathrooms are huge (there is even a TV in the bathroom) and service is great.We would go back to this hotel.",5,2012,10,02
143,Best in Europa?,"Fantastic hotel, probably my best stay ever. Ask for the butler named Martin and your requests are solved. Super bar's and restaurants. For the first time I have to mention soap, shampoo, wonderful,...please visit the spa and relax. I have to mention the art, if you do not have the time to visit Tate modern or Tate Britan, wich is very close just take a walk inside the hotel, Damian Hirst, Bothero, you will find the hotel is a treasure chest.",5,2012,09,29
143,Afternoon Tea Mixed Feelings,"Tea yesterday at the Lobby Lounge.  Staff gets a 10 on 1-10.  Seriously.  And the actual tea pot a 10 on a rare 10 because it never dripped ONE drop of dark tea onto the perfect white linen tablecloth.  This is REMARKABLY hard to find, and the teapot says ""Corinthia"" on the bottom, apparently custom made.  Walking into the hotel seeing HARRODS everywhere surprised me, because I expected  a better choice for tea service. And walking into what was told to me as ""the most beautiful hotel in London"" was a disappointment.  Because it's what a staff associate said to me at tea ""low season,"" the tables were not set w/tea service, which always looks welcoming and prepared when you check in.  Instead, I was seated and THEN the white tablecloth put over my table, etc.  Businessmen were on cellphones conducting business.  Music was absent.  There are NO miniature pastries or anything of the sort.  One walks to the bar and sees the cakes on display, points, and orders.  Disappointing.  The menu explains the special ECCE cakes and other items like special year-round mince pies, but none was available today because of ""low season.""  A different staff associate told me that there were more bookings for weekends, so more offerings.  I think a VERY successful tea has a VERY successful booking schedule, such as Ritz or Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park.  When I checked in, I seriously debated about staying because it wasn't going to be a traditional tea based on how limited the selections were.",4,2012,09,28
143,Absolutely AMAZING,"From arrival to departure the Corinthia delivered 100%.  Special birthday  weekend away-complimentary champagne, fruit & chocolates. Extremely clean, very good room service & staff! Excellent Spa, excellent choice for breakfast! Lovely complimentary choice of coffee & tea in rooms. Turndown service fab-chocolates on pillow every night & complimentary water! Brilliant hotel will be returning for sure! Ask for Garden Courtyard view very peaceful & pretty! Perfect location! ",5,2012,09,27
143,"New, nice but a few buts...","We had chosen this newly opened Corinthia because of the raving reviews on Tripadvisor as our favourite London Hotel was fully booked. The Corinthia appeared to be a wonderfully designed hotel with nice rooms and an amazing Spa, but the service at the breakfast restaurant was a hit & miss, the coffee not as expected and the staff from amazing to disengaged. Perhaps one should wait until the dust has settled and try the hotel in a while again. The part which bothered us most was the location; it is very central in Whitehall, yet far away from a huzzle and buzzle of Covent Garden and theatreland. We decided to walk one evening back to the hotel and the area faround the tube station felt unsafe.",3,2012,09,26
143,Olympic visit,"I stayed here during the Olympics, first the bad bits. I was supposed to have interconnecting or at a minimum adjoining rooms. Didnt happen! To be fair paid a lot of money to stay at a new Spanish hotel nearby which wasn't open in time. Was moved beforehand to Corintia.
Overall great hotel if a bit stiff and pricey. Typical London at this time.
Would go back if rates were more realistic.",5,2012,09,24
143,"Fantastic, Elegant Accomodation","The Corinthia Hotel in London was terrific. The restaurants, especially for dinner, were delicious. The rooms were terrific - large with a huge, fantastic bathroom. The hotel had a small but high tech gym facility. The location was quiet and convenient. The management was accommodating and service-minded. The concierge was on-the-ball and efficient. We stayed for 6 nights and we will go back! Yes, it was that good.",5,2012,09,24
143,Amazing hotel - close to both the financial center and tourist sites,"A phenomenal hotel, big rooms, excellent service.  I was extremely happy with my week stay here for business.  No complaints.  Easy access to the financial center and the embankment, which is right across from the London Eye and not far from Parliament, Trafalgar Square, theater district, etc.",5,2012,09,24
143,The perfect place,"One experience at the Corinthia's hotel was everything we expected and more.  Location was very centric and within walking distance to most of the major attractions in London. The service was spectacular, our room very spacious, walking closets, big bathroom with tub and shower and lovely warm towels!  Their gym, sauna and spa were superb as well as the pool. We had drinks in one of the bars, lovely music, you are able to speak and enjoy your drinks. We also ate at one of their restaurants and the food was very good. Will highly recommend you consider staying here. ",5,2012,09,23
143,Truly Amazing!!!!,"Just stayed for 2 nights with my husband on a Relax and Rejuvenate package.  This hotel is Truly Amazing.  We visit London quite a lot and have stayed in many of the top 5 star hotels.  This one is in another league.  From the second you arrive the staff are so friendly and accommodating, the quality and design of the hotel is just beautiful and the spa is the best thing I have ever seen.  Breakfast was excellent, the staff are so efficient, but not intrusive in any way.  The rooms are furnished to the very highest standards, with Espa products and lovely chocolates at night. The piano bar was great and also the main bar, we had champagne cocktails both nights before we went out, and the czech barman was just great!! This hotel is quite big, but not huge, but it has a real personal feel,  I won't ever stay anywhere else!!!  Thank you for a truly fabulous memorable stay!!!!  we will be back!!!!",5,2012,09,23
143,I hate to be an echo...,"IWe stayed here for four nights in September. While I have occasionally found some TripAdvisor reviews to be hyperbolic, that is not the case here.
  All of the usual benchmarks get uniformly high marks for excellence. The rooms are largish --itself  distinguishing  among London hotels--with bathrooms with double sinks, a profusion of fluffy towels , a separate shower and enormous tub . (Searching for something to quibble about, the shower is a tad  smallish, but the rain shower is wonderful.)The policy that promises your room will be ready whenever you arrive is precisely that. And a marvelous boon to the jet-lagged arriving at Heathrow overnight from the U.S.If you have ever sat around a hotel lobby waiting while  your room is readied you will appreciate this initial courtesy. And things do not go down hill from there.
Service was attentive and friendly, but never pretentious. The business center provides free access to computers so you can keep in touch, if you feel you must. Food at the Northall restaurant was very good. We ate at the bar at some point on our first day and discovered Meantime lager, brewed in Greenwich. (The reference took a while to dawn.)
  The Corinthia is on the edge of Covent Garden which means you can walk to any number of interesting restaurants. It is also just a block away from the tube, which offers both swift transportation and immersion in non-tourist London.
Oh, and here's a quibble. The concierge staff recommends all the  dining places you've heard of but none that you haven't. If they have a list of recommended restos and wine bars we never saw it. Perhaps such a list, updated quarterly, could be available to guests who request it? (This is quite a popular feature at the Four Season Buenos Aires.)
In sum, a splendid experience. Will it be as good next time?
We are certainly going to find out.",5,2012,09,23
143,Perfect in every way,"I cannot say enough wonderful things about this hotel.  Every detail that matters to me was 100% perfect.  Check in was a breeze, the room was ready when we checked in.  The location is fantastic.  You can walk to Parliament and Westminster Abbey.  It is right by Trafalgar Square - so the public transit system is minutes outside the hotel.  There is staff all over the hotel so you never have to wait for help if you have a question or need help getting somewhere.  There were always two concierge behind the desk and they were very helpful with dinner reservations and directed us to some hidden that were off the tourest trail, if you will.  Great recommendations.  

The hotel is expensive, and we splurged.  But it was worth it.  We got upgraded to a deluxe king thanks to our travel agent.  The room had a walk in closet and a huge bathroom.  The bedroom was a nice size - the bed comfortable with linens that were exceptional.  The tiles in the bathroom floor are heated.  There is a tv at the wall at the base of the soaking tub and the shower, which is separate from the tub was unbelievable.  I almost didn't want to leave the hotel to tour London.    And after traveling Europe for two weeks, it was the perfect way to end the trip.  

Breakfast was included in the price.  The buffet is good, we had that each morning.  We had drinks at the Bassoon bar, which has a great vibe to it.  I cannot say enough great things about the Corinthia.   It was fun to live like a 1%er even if just for a short while.  I look forward to going back someday.  ",5,2012,09,22
143,"BRILLIANT FOOD, FABULOUS SERVICE, WORTH EVERY PENNY","This review is offered under false pretences in a sense because it purports to be a review of the Corinthia Hotel when in fact it only concerns their Northall Restaurant, where my wife and I had lunch yesterday - courtesy of TravelZoo.
However, the experience was exemplary, from the moment we arrived until our departure three hours later.      We received a lovely, personal welcome, were given a semi-private table with nobody seated nearby (just what we wanted) and a couple of cocktails plus beautifully-presented canapes to get us in the mood (as if we weren't already).       The wine was a Sauvignon Blanc from Argentina, £35 of superb sunshine, and everything about the food was terrific.   My wife had an opener of beef carpaccio and I chose the tuna equivalent:  both were memorably succulent;  then we each had a fillet of sea bass, with a delightfully crusty coating, followed (with a suitable pause) by some magnificent desserts.    What was especially noticeable was that a plateau of artisan cheeses was included in the price, when for many restaurants the cheese option costs something extra (and for what?).       
The atmosphere in the restaurant, and indeed the hotel, was lovely;  the service we received was superb - unobtrusive, helpful when we needed it (e.g., by pouring more wine and giving us more water), but never cloying or subservient.
This is a place which, though quite new, has hit the ground running.     We'll definitely be going back, and would be more than willing to pay their normal prices - that's how good it was.
TED JOHNS",5,2012,09,21
143,Not one of the; THE BEST hotel I have ever stayed in,"Where to begin.... imagine perfection: every detail, every encounter, every everything being exactly, nay better, than you could ever expect.

This is Corinthia.  

From check-in (which is any time during the day you arrive) to check-out (anytime you decide to leave) you will be taken care of by a team of super friendly-helpful people.  Your room will be an immaculate haven and the 24 hour room service will be as incredibly delicious at 7pm as 3 am.

I can't end this without discussing location.  For us, being in a central location for our very short trip was essential.  And it doesn't get more central than this.  Almost every where we wanted to be was outside our doorstep.  It was nice to be able to easily walk back to the hotel, drop things off or rest for a bit before heading out again.

You will regret not staying here.",5,2012,09,20
143,Great hotel for a frequent visitor,"I travel frequently to London and have generally stayed in the hotels near Hyde Park along Park Lane.  A friend suggested this hotel and it was a very good decision to try it out.  The hotel is very upmarket with high end finishings throughout the lobby and the rooms.  Service was pleasant and prompt, and I would rate it well above average for London hotels.  I loved the room which was very spacious, including a separate dressing room with ample storage for clothes as well as luggage.  The bathroom was also luxurious and I must admit I enjoyed the bath with the LED TV.  My room was silent at night allowing for an uninterupted nights sleep.  The location is very good but I would caution that it is in close proximity to a high trafficed tourist area (Trafalgar Square/Leicester Square) which can be very crowded on weekends and evenings.  Also, I did find I had to walk closer to Covenant Garden to get access to good restaurants/bars.  But, for business meetings, Embankment Tube station is right out the door and offers easy access to the City.  
I did try the Northall restaurant in the hotel, although I ordered from the adjacent bar.  Food was good, expensive as expected.  I didn't try the Italian restaurant.",5,2012,09,19
143,Excellent choice over-all,"stayed one night on business.
great location; lots of attractions in walking distance
brand new building; big but not overwhelming
large room with oversized bath rooms
ESPA amenities, in large sizes
quiet; comfortable beds
good break-fast buffet
free Wifi
impressive Spa/gym
service is top notch",5,2012,09,18
143,Loved it!,"Thank you Corninthia for your warm welcome, personal attention and ourstanding service!  I have been to many a nice place, but this topped them all.  We went for our 30th anniversary and were treated like royalty.  Every single worker is a top notch professional, the extra special treatment they provided was amazing, from deserts, to champagne on our anniversary night, chocolates, flowers, fresh delicious fruits, nightly turn downs and utter romance.  My only issue is we didn't have more time there.  10 days of true bliss.  I can't wait to return.  Thank you Corinthia for making our anniversary a true joy!",5,2012,09,17
143,Luxury and the best location ever!,"My wife booked a weekend here for me for my 40th birthday, the hotel is great, staff very professional and friendly, the thermal floor area was great just what I needed and the rooms beautiful. Breakfast in the room was excellent and a great way to start the day, id love to go back, maybe I´ll remortgage the house next time as it was very expensive, but worth every penny. 

The only criticism i had is the room always felt a bit warm, the air conditioning was a bit asthmatic and it would turn itself off when you were not in the room. We always had to turn it back on when we returned as the room was too warm. but other than that I couldn´t fault it!

We ate at the Massimo restaurant which was very good too, and had a cocktail in the Bassoon bar too which was superb. Go there for a weekend you will not be disappointed!",5,2012,09,17
143,Absolutely Spectacular!,"This is one of my favorite hotels in London. It is NOT in-expensive, but worth the price. This hotel is absolutely beautiful. Stylish in every way. The Spa is an oasis that is so unexpected in London.  

The location is fantastic! Walk to everything! The service is impeccable. The food is even pretty good (way to go Brits!).

I love the entire place!!",5,2012,09,17
143,A true luxury,"My husband gave me a surprise and booked this hotel for 1 night. This hotel screams luxury starting when you enter the hotel. The room is huge and bed is lush. Nespresso machine in the room. The have Espa products for toiletries.

The food in Massimo restaurant was average, but for us it was included in the package. Breakfast was great with good selection of buffet.

I recommend the spa, one of the best I ever been.",5,2012,09,15
143,Birthday meal,"Booked a meal for four at The Northall restaurant at The Corinthia with Travel zoo for a special 70th birthday meal for my mum.  The Decor, service and food were fantastic!

We did not stay at this hotel so cannot comment on the hotel facilities.",5,2012,09,15
143,Anniversary dinner,"We spent a very pleasant evening here. The Hotel oozes luxury as soon as you walk through the door. Stunning floral arrangements and a lovely ambience. Staff were really helpful and friendly.
Great food and cocktails. Will certainly go again.",5,2012,09,14
143,Superb hotel you will love,"We stayed a week late June and I have to say the best part of London was this hotel. From the moment you walk in, the understated elegance of the French Deco and thousands fresh flowers that parfume the lobby transfers you into a the world of modern opulence. The room is large for even 5 star hotels in Europe and is beautifully decorated. Comfort and style make you feel relaxed the moment you walk in. Crispy Italian Pratesi bed linnens, Frette fluffy white bath towels and robes, fresh fruits in the room, espresso maker, dark chocolates on the bed and mineral water on your nightstand at turn down service, white marble bath with huge tub ant TV, gorgeous shower with rain shower head, the bidet.....I can go on and on. But then you try the Spa and you are convinced you want to stay another week.  One word of advise about the spa - go after 6 or 7 pm there is none there and have late supper around 9 pm (european style)
The service was so superb that I can not think of anything negative. You are treated like you are staying in the Penthouse when you're not.  We stayed on 6th floor in a bright and sunny room facing the street and had the view of the Eye.
I also found prices to be reasonable - in high season we only paid $500 or $600 a night. And one more thing - Bassoon bar downstairs not to be missed.  You feel like you are in 1930's Deco Saloon sipping champagne cocktails and Fred Astaire is going to walk in any minute.  Mixed drinks are memorable...
Location is central - we walked as far as Tate modern and Hyde park. National gallery 5 minutes walk just around the corner.
We ate at Norhall at the hotel the first night as it was raining hard outside. The food was good not great, but to be fair, we are from San Francisco with most discriminating taste palate, as Thomas Keller and Alice Waters spoil us to death here.",5,2012,09,13
143,Best hotel in london for this price,"Big, new, modern rooms with a very friendly service. Took me a long time to find a good hotel in london but corinthia has a recurring customer more. I hope they keep this level and its my second home in london.

143,Out of this World - AMAZING!,"We stayed in The Corinthia Hotel (London) for a long weekend (Friday to Monday). The hotel staff treated us with the utter most respect, they were all so friendly and really helpful. We arrived quite late on Friday night and were greeted well and checked into our room fine. There was door staff on all day and night that greeted you by opening the door on your arrival. There was fresh orchids placed in the hotel daily. We had daily papers too. The room was immaculate and so stylish. We had a view of the courtyard; it was stunning. The bathroom was massive, there was a gorgeous bath with a TV in it & a shower with a rain shower too - Heaven. The products in the bathroom (ESPA) were devine & topped up every day. I'm sure the floor in the toilet area was heated too which was lovely. Everyday the room was cleaned and tidied, and everyday we had a chocolate in a box on our beds :) so amazing. Over the weekend we were out all day but on Sunday we came in to find that the beds were made differently, we put it down to it being a different house maid. We went out and came back in to find that the beds had been made in the normal way with the chocolate in the box on the bed!! Robes and slippers were supplied. A coffee machine was also available to you, along with items in the mini bar (at a cost), there was fresh fruit on the table also. Its so close to everything - the Embankment tube station is just down the road. The hotel is minutes away from the Thames; just across a bridge is the London Eye. Up the road is Trafalgar Square, it is in the centre of everything. Excellent location. The hotel is stunning with amazing views inside and out!! I would definitely recommend and would hope to visit again one day!!!! Thank you for an amazing trip",5,2012,09,11
143,Service standard at the next level,"This is what every other hotel should judge itself by!  AMAZING. I was bowled over by the quality of service I received from every member of staff I interacted with. There is even a lovely little park really close, Whitehall Gardens, if you want to pull yourself away and enjoy the weather.  Would recommend the champagne cocktails!",5,2012,09,10
143,First class all round...,"There are so many glowing reviews of this hotel it's difficult to find anything else to say. Yes it is very expensive but from the moment you walk in the door you are treated as if you're the most important guest they have staying with them! I checked in for one night at 5.30pm and was upgraded as it was my birthday, was immediately asked if I would like a late check out the next evening. Have no idea how they manage the no set time check-in/check-out policy but we made full use of the hotel facilities and didn't check out until 7pm the following day. Was personally escorted to our room and was shown how everything works. Five minutes later was pleasantly surprised with a complimentary bottle of wine and chocolates. Most comfortable bed ever and the toiletries and robes were the best I've ever had in a hotel. There's even a TV at the end of the bath. The Spa suite including stainless steel pool, vitality pool, steam room and very unique sauna was so peaceful and relaxing. Location is fantastic if you are travelling from Charring Cross or Embankment stations, only 1 1/2 minutes walk and only 10 minutes across the river to the London eye.",5,2012,09,09
143,One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in!!,"on my first visit to London I was lucky enough to see the olympics and stay in a great hotel. I can not fault it, everything was prefect. the staff were friendly, the food was great (try the club sandwich on the room service menu). can't say enough about it, you should not go wrong here.",5,2012,09,08
143,Best hotel experience - ever!!,"I am currently staying at the Corinthia and this is the first time I have ever posted a review on trip advisor but had to do it. This is hands down, the best hotel experience I have ever had. It is a very understated...... WOW. The location is in the historic district, so not in the South Kensington or Knightsbridge area that most people look for, but worth going out of the comfort zone to experience. It is outstanding in every way.They have used the best products, the best design - there is not one thing that has been overlooked.",5,2012,09,07
143,Best in London...Best in Europe....Amazing,"I have stayed here 3 times now and having tried some of the best hotels around the world....I would say this is my favourite. Everything is done extremely well, particularly just the sheer quality of what they have done inside this old building. Rooms and bathrooms are beautifully designed and a real treat to stay in. I haven't stayed in a hotel that even comes close on the attention they have put in and the quality. I just had a few days at a new Mandarin Oriental hotel in Barcelona and it was terrible in comparison to this!.

Spa is amazing, Service great...could recommend enough and it a great location just between Trafalgar square and embankment. Although not cheap I think its great value for what you get compared to some of the other top hotels in London.",5,2012,09,06
143,Great Hotel!,"Very well designed hotel with well trained staff. It's Spa facility is unique, have a look at the large glass Sauna and the seats in the whirlpool......
The flowers are impressive.
Technology needs improvement and is not what you may expect in such hotel. Had issues with my internet. Compliments to the ones bringing daily service in this hotel.",5,2012,09,06
143,THIS PLACE PUTS THE REST TO SHAME,"We have traveled all over the world and love staying at the best hotels.....THIS ONE BEAT THEM ALL! Make no mistake, this is one of the finest hotels in the world. There is no area the designers and owners skimped on, they must have set out to create one of the finest experiences for any traveler and hit the mark on every detail. The lobby blows you away using all of you senses of smell from the magnificent flowers, sight from all of the top of the line furniture, flooring, lighting from chandeliers that are works of art in their own right. The hallways, carpeting, woods, wall treatments all are first rate. Then there are the rooms. We had a jr suite that only had one disappointment.....we had to leave! It is a hotel that all others should judge themselves from.....",5,2012,09,05
143,"Fantastic hotel, fantastic spa, warm and welcoming staff","We stayed for one night at the Corinthia, arriving early on Saturday morning for a weekend in London.  Normally when you arrive at your hotel room you drop off your bags and cant wait to explore, this time we struggled to motivate ourselves to leave the room, it was so comfortable and well appointed.  The welcome from the doorstaff, reception and everyone we met was superb and the spa was the height of sophistication.  I think the hotel have thought of everything for the rooms and anything else you need is just a phone call away via housekeeping.

The last thing that sets this hotel above the rest for us was the check in check out policy, we had access to the room from nine thirty am on Saturday and didnt leave until 6pm on Sunday, enabling us to use the spa and shower afterwards in the afternoon.  For us this hotel was the ultimate in comfort and luxury, and offered excellent value for money.",5,2012,09,05
143,Great Stay!,"This hotel is beautiful, and has a wonderful location as well. Short walks can take you to many cool spots around the city, or there is close access to the Tube. We were visiting during the Olympics - and even though the hotel was busy, it never felt crowded and the staff managed to be on top of things. The rooms were recently updated and are very nice, and the bathrooms are large and spacious, which can be tough to find in many cities in Europe and the UK. For dining within the hotel -Massimo is a fantastic restaurant, and the hotel bars have great cocktail options too. Sadly we didn't get to spend time in the Spa, which other guests said was amazing!",4,2012,09,04
143,BEST London Hotel Experience Ever,"I took my wife to the Corinthia for our anniversary in July and from the moment we arrived until we checked out I was utterly blown away. I have stayed in many London hotels over the years and my best reaction has always been 'ho-hum' so I had no reason to believe that this would be any different. The reviews on Trip Advisor were very complimentary so I had an idea that my wife would at least be happy with a weekend away from home.
When I booked I did mention that it was our anniversary and as I checked in I was told that we had been upgraded 'for our special occasion' which was lovely and totally unexpected.
It should be mentioned that the foyer and main floor of the hotel is outstanding with huge, modern chandeliers and beautiful flower arrangements everywhere you look.
Our room was HUGE and very un-London-like. Also, there was a blueberry-chocolate gateau with 'Happy Anniversary' written in chocolate and a hand-written card from the manager. Touch of class!
The bathroom was incredible and included a massive rainforest shower head in the shower room and e-Spa products and a flat-screen TV. I actually took a bubble bath and watched golf.
We had giant martinis at the Northall Bar which is a fantastic room with comfy seating and floor to ceiling mirrors. Very cool.
I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a diamond in the rough.

To the staff and management- THANKS FOR A GREAT WEEKEND!",5,2012,09,03
143,Beautiful hotel but not helpful for business travelers,"It's unfortunate to be writing a negative review for the Corinthia.  After all, the property was beautiful, the furnishings were comfortable and the staff was exceedingly polite.  But the hotel tragically falls short in meeting the needs of a business traveler to London.  

Wi-fi coverage was spotty, which staff members were unapologetic about since the service is free.  But I would have gladly paid for reliable coverage ... just imagine being a business traveler without access to email.  It was also impossible to reach the reception desk by phone, which became an issue because the room was unbearably hot.  It was surreal returning to a flawlessly-designed hotel room in which I could not relax or work after a full day of meetings.  What's the point of staying in a luxury hotel that can't get the basics right?  Does it really matter that they have a spa when I'm struggling to meet a client deadline?  Next time I'm in London, I'll stay at a lesser chain like the Westin or Hyatt that actually understands what I need when I'm on the road for business.",1,2012,09,02
143,Perfect Stay Exceeded Expectations,"We stayed at the Corinthia in March for Spring Break for 10 nights and it absolutely exceeded our expectations. Our first time to London and we can't wait to go back. The location could not be better - it is situated just a bit off the Thames and just down the lane from the Horse Guards Palace and very close to the Ministry of War. Very little traffic yet just two blocks from Trafalgar Square. The rooms are amazing - contemporary decor and beautiful. Every detail has been well thought out, including the heated floors which my children loved. We had connecting rooms and the front desk staff made sure we had the best location for our rooms. The front door staff were extremely helpful and very polite. Our most favorite thing to do there however was afternoon tea. The wait staff were amazing and the tea service is indescribable. The clotted cream was the best I have ever had. I am sad just thinking of how long it will be until we go back.....",5,2012,08,31
143,More than a five star,"The Corinthia in the heart of London is superb. You cannot fault the service, rooms, restaurant or spa. The staff are a credit to the establishment, they are both attentive and polite without intruding on ones privacy. The attention to detail from the waterfall showers, heated bathroom floors and a small table in the corridor outside the rooms to leave unwanted items or collect newspapers from are simple examples of the thought and consideration which makes this hotel a pleasure to stay in. I am a frequent guest at five star hotels and would say the Corinthia just has the edge over 45. When asked by the Executive Assistant Manager if there was anything the hotel could have done to make my stay more enjoyable the answer was a simple no.",5,2012,08,31
143,A real 5 star hotel,"Some hotels call themselves 5 star and are not, this hotel is. It is the same level as the four seasons, lovely rooms, great furnishings, really nice spa and gym and wonderful bathroom with underfloor heating. If you get a chance to stay here, do.",5,2012,08,31
143,theexpatwife reviews corinthia london,"In August we had three lovely nights at the Corinthia Hotel in Whitehall Place, London. One of London's best kept secrets, many people don't seem to know about it. The hotel, fully renovated just a few years ago sits in a building dating back to 1885 and the Empire days of Queen Victoria. White Stucco fronted and very imposing, just minutes from Trafalgar Square and the River Thames, it offers a state of the art spa, three restaurants, and four bars. This is my third stay in the hotel and I really love it.

It is classically contemporary, a timeless and extremely elegant design. Marble floors and columns, silver and gold gilted ceilings, extravagant crystal chandeliers, and lavishly adorned with luxurious furnishings and fabrics. All the times I have stayed here, there has been someone famous, the last time I was here, Rhianna and Denzel Washington were staying too. This time someone not so famous, the lady that narrates for the US television show 'Desperate Housewives'.  

In the lobby they serve afternoon tea, I had it last time I visited and it was a very elegant and refined affair. This time we actually did not eat at the hotel, except for room service, as we had restaurant bookings elsewhere, but I have eaten at some of the hotel restaurants, and they were very sophisticated, and beautifully decorated. 

There is a courtyard atrium in the middle of the building which they have made full use of with open fires and deep cushioned teak sofas and chairs. It was a lovely to spot to have a drink, and is where we meet some of our London friends. Most of them did not know about the hotels existence, and they were really impressed.

The Northall bar is very glitzy. The hotel has an art deco feel going on everywhere. They also serve breakfast in here. Last time I stayed we ate at The Northall restaurant. It was British cuisine, simple and elegant food, and absolutely stunning in terms of decor. Double height ceilings, curved walls, tan leather chairs, silk curtains, and muted tones. 

The other restaurant, Massimo, I have yet to try. We did sample the Basoon bar though. There was a three piece jazz band playing, and had a real jazz den feel with very low lighting, and dark leather seating. It was a really nice bar. I highly recommend the Corinthia hotel, it is in my opinion one of the best hotels in London at the moment. Third visit and I still left feeling impressed, glamorous, and wowed! I will definitely be staying again on my next visit to London.

We stayed in a deluxe junior suite and it was beautiful. Silk wallpapers and throws, ultra comfy beds, 3 TVs. The spa is amazing, definitely one of the best in London. On my visit last year they had the fires lit in the spa even though it was summer, however, this time they were never lit. I really missed that aspect, it gave the whole spa experience a drama and surrealism. I'm not sure why they aren't lighting them anymore. 

This review is taken from my blog theexpatwife.com. Please visit to see more photos of the hotel, spa, and room.",5,2012,08,31
143,Great place to stay in London,"We stayed here for two days....our first visit in London. Great location with the Trafalgar Square close by. Very close to the embankment station as well as Charing Cross. We also enjoy the short stroll to Covent Garden and Liecester Square for eating out. 

We had the afternoon high tea after we checked-in. Took a awhile to get a waiter to serve us though. The room was excellent and very clean. Although the housekeeping forgot to replenish the coffee pods but was able to get more when asked. 

The toiletries contain nutmeg, don't know about other people but we both had allergic reactions to the shampoo and body wash. My husband woke up late one night covered in rashes, when he contacted reception for assistance they could not understand the term 'anti histamine' and directed him to a pharmacy that was closed!! My husband had to spend £40 on a taxi looking around for a late pharmacy. 

Another downfall, we had breakfast in the hotel on our last day. The food wasn't that great for the price that they are asking. The bacon was quite chewy and dry. The eggs were dry as well. Much more variety of food is needed.",4,2012,08,30
143,perfect...,"We stayed here for our anniversary weekend, what can we say..totally blown away by the decor, hospitality, location, food and comfort of this hotel. The spa is a must, set over 4 floors, totally the most elegant spa that we have come across..its amazing. The little touches (esp. the flowers) were spot on,the staff and management professional and friendly-oh and the oysters and seabass in the northall restaurant left us speechless! Would definitely recommend to couples, families (the children have time slots where they can enjoy the spa too) or anyone looking for a piece of heaven in London.",5,2012,08,28
143,SIMPLY STUNNING,"We have stayed a few times recently and every time has been great.

The Corinthia is simply the best place to stay in London. Check in was efficient and all the staff are friendly and nothing is too much trouble.

The room was luxurious. The bed was one of the most comfortable ive ever slept in and what sets The Corinthia apart from other London hotels is that it is very quiet. You dont get people shouting on the corridors at 3am here! The bathroom is incredible, with the best rain shower and of course you get bathrobes and slippers as standard. Another great touch is the nespresso coffee machine in every room. This just adds to its class. The hotel is in a great location in the centre of London, with Embankment tube stop a minutes walk away.

There is everything you could possibly want at breakfast and breakfast is served in a stunning room.

I can not fault this place and i am hard to please!",5,2012,08,28
143,Stunning hotel in a great location....,"The hotel is indeed stunning... the lobbies, spa and other common areas in particular. The rooms are nice too, tasteful decoration, relatively spacious, with luxurious bathrooms. We loved the location on a quiet street just minutes away from Trafulgar Square and Embankment station, and a short walk from Covent Garden, the London Eye, etc. 

We used the spa frequently. They have restricted hours for children but I’m guessing only enforce it when they either have paying spa guests or when the children are little and rambunctious. In any case, they didn’t make a big deal about my 13 year old being there outside the limited specified hours (policy restricted under 14s).

The service at check in was very welcoming. Otherwise the staff were courteous, but not particularly warm. 

My few complaints would be that the AC in my room wasn’t great (whereas it was fine in the adjacent room), and that there weren’t adequate drawers for clothes.",4,2012,08,24
143,I Didn't Want to Leave.  Ever,"I just got back from five nights spent at the Corinthia Hotel.  I cannot express how much I enjoyed myself.  I nearly teared up when it was time to leave.  I stayed in a Deluxe King Room, overlooking Whitehall Place (which was at my request--I don't really like inward facing hotel rooms).  I'm not a super light sleeper, but I did leave the window open for the entire visit and I didn't find it all that noisy.  Your mileage may vary.

I entered the room into a kind of vestibule.  To the right, was the bedroom itself, with the bed, TV console, a round table with two chairs, two bedside tables and some built-ins.  To the left was a generously sized bath with a separate (huge) rainforest shower, deep soaking tub (with a wall-mounted TV at one end) and double sink.  Straight ahead was a large walk-in closet.

Everything was decorated to the highest standard--marble, wood and chrome in the bath; sophisticated, muted colors in the bedroom (with jewel tone accents).  The room had a Nespresso machine and the necessary fixings for multiple varieties of tea and coffee.  The electrical design was really smart.  They had a wall of outlets all intended for electrical plugs of different shapes and sizes (and voltages, I'm guessing, though I didn't need to test that).  The room's lights were controlled by panels either on the wall or bedside, and you could choose various schemes (full light, mood lighting, reading lights, etc.), depending upon your needs.  Room availability (Do Not Disturb, Please Make Up Room) was also managed by electrical means.  The wireless internet was free and speedy.

The minibar included several different hard liquors, a couple different kinds of wine, soft drinks, designer chocolates and various nuts from Harrods (among other goodies).  Each night, as part of the turn-down service, chocolate was left on the pillows.  The television selection was good, but skewed towards European programming.  Americans looking for familiar channels will be disappointed.  The only U.S. station was the Discovery Channel (why would you fly all the way to London to watch TV anyway, though--go out and soak in the culture!).

The hotel has everything you need--a hair salon (which I didn't frequent), a spa (which I certainly did--more on that in a minute), three restaurants (Lobby Lounge, Northall, Massimos), and a bar.  There is also a small flower shop/Harrods boutique. 

I didn't plan on it, but I ate every meal at the hotel.  Breakfast was delicious.  There was an extensive buffet set up with hot and cold entrees, as well as an a la carte menu.  Northall was elegant and featured a modern, mixed menu.  I highly, =highly= recommend the duck.  Though the filet was excellent was well.  I didn't eat at Massimos (though I have no doubt it upholds the high standard of the other restaurants), but you're really missing out if you don't have high tea in the Lobby Lounge.  They offered a superb selection of finger sandwiches and pastries, and if you're a bit of a tea novice (like me!), the servers were only too happy to offer suggestions.

The ESPA spa is outstanding.  I had a massage, facial, mani-pedi and visited their osteopath twice.  He's a genius.  I got off the plane after my eight hour flight, virtually unable to move my lower back.  He used acupuncture, massage and stretches to get me back in shape.  I don't know what I would have done without him.  The facility itself is nearly all underground, which I'll confess made it feel a bit cave-like at times.  But it, like everything else, is beautifully appointed and the thermal floor with its pool, sauna, steam room, vitality pool (super powered Jacuzzi stations all in a single large pool) and heated chaises was the height of luxury.

The location is unbelievably convenient.  The Embankment tube stop is virtually across the street, Trafalgar Square is perhaps a couple of blocks away.  Parliament, 10 Downing Street and Westminister Abbey are all less than a 10 minute walk and the Covent Garden theatre district is perhaps five minutes more than that (though there is a theatre directly across the street).

What truly sets the Corinthia apart, however, is the standard of the service.  The woman who checked me in walked me to my room to show me around.  After one visit to the Northall, the staff knew me by name and were always highly solicitous of my needs.  All the therapists at the spa were friendly and helpful, and truly seemed as if they cared about my well-being.

I can't recommend the Corinthia highly enough.  The next time I return to London, that's where I'll be staying.  They showed me an awesome time.",5,2012,08,24
143,Gorgeous property,"This hotel is just gorgeous. I was travelling for work and always stay in a 5 star property. This one was truly over the top. From the beautiful lobby and restaurants to the bright, clean, modern rooms. Really this property exceeded my expectations.",5,2012,08,23
143,"Elegant, comfortable and convenient","I chose The Corinthia as they were offering a particularly inviting deal on room rates this weekend. Have stayed at The Savoy quite recently so was nice to be able to give another 5 star London hotel a try. 

From the moment we arrived the service was understated yet polite and helpful and we were shown to a lovely third floor executive room with a balcony overlooking the courtyard. It's always nice when a hotel room actually looks like the hotel's own pictures, and the rooms really are as nice as they advertise!

There are sophisticated lighting systems in the rooms, which are spotlessly clean and equipped with absolutely everything you could need, and if it wasn't immediately available (for example extra pillows and an iron and ironing board) after a quick call to housekeeping it came almost immediately by pleasant and helpful staff. 

The bed was really comfortable with silky soft sheets, and lovely big fluffy towels available when you'd got out of the rainfall shower. My only minor criticism of the room was the fact that there was only a small closet near the door. As we were only staying for the one night, this wasn't an issue for us, however if I was staying three nights or more it may have been a bit more difficult to find enough storage in the room. Having said this, it made perfect sense to put us in this room, leaving rooms with bigger closets for those staying longer!

The rolling check in/out policy worked fantastically for us, and sets this hotel apart in the 5 star market in my view. The spa was also very elegant and relaxing. 

Had dinner at the Northall which was delicious with friendly and efficient service. We then went for some drinks in the Bassoon Bar where there was a pianist playing. The atmosphere was relaxed, and although the drinks were expensive you wouldn't really expect to pay less in a hotel of this quality. 

Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London, the location is also ideal for sightseeing, being within walking distance of many landmarks and a three minute walk to Embankment tube if you are looking to go further afield. 

One other comment was that this weekend temperatures hit 30 degrees plus in London. I thought it was a bit of a shame that the doormen appeared to have to continue to wear top and tails. They did this with as much of a smile and friendly welcome as ever, but it did make me feel a little bit uncomfortable, and I would have thought it would not affect the hotel's image to let them wear waistcoats or something more comfortable on the very rare occasions when the UK gets that hot!

Thank you for a lovely stay to all at The Corinthia.",5,2012,08,22
143,Extremely Pleased,"My husband and I just returned from a fabulous four night stay at the Corinthia Hotel London.  We chose this hotel based on TripAdvisor reviews and are so glad we did. First the location is perfect. You are around the corner from the Embankment Tube and down the road from Charing Cross Tube and train station. You are close to Trafalgar Square, and the Strand - with Covent Garden only a short walk away.  Inside, the lobby and the open air atrium were very impressive. Check-in (and you can check-in anytime) was quick and friendly with the gentleman who checked us in accompanying us to our room to show us all of the features. We had a room on the 6th floor and upon entering our room had a entryway, with the bathroom to the left, the bedroom to the right and a walk in closet directly in front of us. The room was immaculate and well-appointed with comfortable furnishings. The bathroom was super functional with a separate tub and shower with both a rainfall and regular showerhead. Double sinks, an enclosed toilet and bidet area and towel warmer. Oh, and there was a TV in the tub!! That was a great touch. The bedroom had a table area, a flat screen TV that swiveled and floor to ceiling windows. There were double nightstands by the bed with buttons to control all the lights in the room on both sides.  We received complimentary bottled water each evening on turn down with our slippers and robes laid out. There was also an espresso maker in the room for coffee in the mornings. The only thing I found strange was the absence of a visible clock in the room - although the phone was very high tech with an alarm, the time wasn't visible unless you activated the screen (from what I could tell). This was only a problem because it was so incredibly quiet in our room that we kept sleeping in too late! All in all, we were extremely pleased with this hotel stay and will most certainly return as we are in London fairly regularly.",5,2012,08,19
143,5 stars,"The Corinthia is a perfect hotel!  Good location, nice rooms, great staff!  I've stayed at the Four Seasons Park Lane, Dorchester, and Lanesbrough and the Corinthia is better than each of these other hotels and its priced better. ",5,2012,08,19
143,Excellent Location in the Middle of Everything,"The location is suburb right across from the eye of London and close to the tube.  We walked to almost everything and when we didn't the tube station was right there so we were able to explore the city.  The hotel itself is outstanding, clean, rooms are spacious, bathrooms are fabulous, including a flat screen above the large bathtub.  We stayed during the Olympics and each night for turndown service we received chocolate gold metals on our bed- nice touch.  The afternoon tea, although expensive, was worth doing and added to the overall experience of traveling to the UK.  I would highly recommend going to Stonehenge, it is about an hour away however quite amazing to see.  Windsor Castle was worth seeing as well, although quite a drive, we hired a private car to drive us to both places in one day which was approximately $900.00 US Dollars.  I would stay again at this hotel, rooms were quite as well.",4,2012,08,16
143,Stellar Property but Awkward Rooms,"The Corinthia oozes history and style. It is undoubtedly in one of the most convenient locations for business or pleasure in London, as well as being a landmark in its own right. The entire property is stunning - as you would expect for the price - and the staff, owners and management take obvious pride in their work. While the rooms are delightfully decorated they have gone just a little bit too far. There are only so many vases, glass bowls and other ornaments that can be tastefully placed in a room and this over-stuffing of every visible space means less storage and living space for the guest. Add to this a round desk on which to work makes for simply awkward rooms. Agreed, many hotels rooms in London and in particular in this area provide small rooms but the layout and design at the Corinthia mean you are getting less room than you otherwise could. If they halved the number of knick-knacks and changed the desk for a square or rectangular one the rooms might make more sense and wouldn't mean squeezing between an overloaded shelf and the bed, or having to try and balance as you wedge yourself in behind the desk to work. The heated flooring and towel racks in the bathroom are lovely touches but in the middle of summer the heat from the floor emanates through the room battling the air-conditioning. The unfortunate thing is that because the room was so impractical we took every opportunity to leave the property and therefore did not eat at any of the hotel's restaurants. Having said that the Corinthia is in a fantastic location that is easily accessible on foot to Buckingham Palace, Piccadilly, SoHo and much more.",3,2012,08,16
143,"Seems great, not stuffy","Spent the day here with a group who were guests. Fabulous old building converted some 2 years ago into height of luxury. Flowers and Marble everywhere. Everything flows, entrances, reception, lounge, courtyard, restaurant and so on. Yes indeed there is an indoor outside courtyard, sort of Cuban idea.
This is a luxurious place but not cheap from the prices my friends quoted me. Our tea and cakes were served with good  service and high quality crockery and so on, again not cheap but highest quality and worth it not have to wear a jacket or sit formally. with old waiters hovering.
.Our friends standard room looked wonderful , spacious, very well designed and furnished indeed and the bathroom seemed terrific. I know millionaires whose bedrooms are not as nice as this one. The weekend before we had all had mini suites at another hotel and Corinthia was like Mulsanne to Lexus.
Location is good. Easy walking to Covent Garden. By pedestrian bridge over River Thames.by Embankment.
The spa is on mezzanine and the pool (which we could not see) is lower down and only can be seen by guests. Check limited kids pool times if this is important.
Service was very good, efficient and trained, not stuffy.  Dorchester, Claridges staff can seem stuffy and formal at times. We could text but not get a mobile signal here.",5,2012,08,12
143,"I really wanted to love the Corinthia, BUT.....","First, the good!  

The hotel is very centrally located, just across the street from the Embankment tube station and within easy walking distance to the London Eye, Westminster Abbey, Houses of Parliament, Covent Garden, Theater District, Piccadilly Circus, Trafalgar Square, etc., etc.

The interior of the hotel is stunningly beautiful, from the moment you step into the lobby to the second you get to your room.  Simply beautiful everywhere you look.

The doormen always open the door for you and greet you with a warm smile 

The concierge was most helpful and friendly

Where the hotel fails is the service.  And it fails miserably.  I have given this review long and hard thought because I really, really wanted to love the Corinthia.  But I strongly feel that part of an exceptional vacation is a fantastic hotel stay.  Sadly we didn't have a great hotel stay.  We were there for 6 nights, so I believe we got a good feel for the hotel.

Where the service failed us follows (I am going to highlight just a few things as the list would be too long to publish if I listed every failing we experienced):

Upon arrival at the hotel (we were guaranteed in writing an 8:00am check-in by the Reservation Supervisor), we were told our room was not ready and wouldn't be until after 3:00pm.  I consider myself a reasonable person, but I was paying $1,300.00 a night and part of the reason I agreed to such a high price was so that I could rest after a cross Atlantic flight.  Thank goodness I had the confirmation with me, otherwise we would have been out of luck as were told that the hotel was full and they had no room to give us.  Funny enough they managed to find us an Executive Room (category we had booked) to ""rest"" in.  I stated I wanted to keep the room as I loathe unpacking (toiletries, change of clothes, etc) and packing up again after a brief rest and shower, but was told other, more important clients had booked the room and we would have to vacate by noon.  Too exhausted to argue, we went to the room, could not locate a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign to hang on the door and laid down.  We were disturbed not once, not twice, but THREE times by incessant ringing of the door bell.  Finally the mini bar gentleman informed us that he would press a ""DND"" button for us.  How annoying when you are trying to sleep.

We had to pack the bags back up and vacate the room.  We were told that we had been ""upgraded"" to a Junior Suite.  Even though I didn't want it.  It was very disappointing.  The primary reason is that the closet was so tiny (the smallest we have ever experienced at any hotel in the world) that I could not even unpack one carry on, whereas the closet in the Executive Room had a full walk-in closet with many drawers, shelves, mirrors, racks to hang clothes on, etc.  We had two tiny drawers (excl. the one the safe was in) and 8 or 10 hangars in our ""Suite"".  More hangars would not have helped as there was no room for more than that.  There was no room for so much as a pair of shoes in the closet either.  I can't say enough how frustrating that closet was.  We were there for SIX nights and I had to store the majority of our clothes in a suitcase (I will also mention that there was only room for 1 suitcase in the closet).  I begged and begged for our ""Executive"" room back but was told they had nothing else for us.  I would have taken the smallest room at the hotel as long as it had a closet, but nothing was offered.  Nada.

The bathroom was lovely.  The shower was beyond nice.  It was exceptional.  But ours only had 1 sink (unusual for a suite).  That sink backed up during our entire stay.  I had to ask 4 times to have it fixed.  I'm not sure if they were unable to fix it the first 3 times or it just took 4 calls for them to come to the room.  I never got a straight answer.  But I found it disgusting to have a sink that would fill to the top when you washed your hands and then take 10 minutes to drain.  Enough said.

The thermostat in our room was not working.  It was set at 23.5c, but it was FREEZING.  We were shivering in the room.  I had to call 5 times to have it fixed.  I was told repeatedly that there was nothing wrong with it.  After the 5th call, we had it set at 21c for the remainder of the stay and we were comfortable.  But it took 3 days to have it fixed.  Three days of extreme discomfort.

Perhaps the most egregarious failing of the hotel was with regards to the locks on our balcony doors.  We were on the 1st floor and had 2 doors that exited to the courtyard.  There were approximately 10 or 12 other rooms with the same configuration that were reachable via the courtyard that we were facing.  Meaning we could easily walk from our patio to the one next door.  On the second day, I went outside.  I noticed (I had left the door open) that I was able to open the patio door from the outside as it didn't seem to lock.  Alarmed, I immediately called reception.  I was assured that the doors were self locking when closed and there was no problem.  I asked if someone could come and check to be sure and was told they would.  On the fourth day I was again on the patio and decided to try the other (second) door from the outside.  It was UNLOCKED.  So I shut the first one and it too was UNLOCKED from the outside.  Meaning anyone from the other 10 or 12 rooms could have, at any point, day or night, walked right into our room via the patio doors.  When I called the front desk again, I was assured that I was wrong and the doors are self locking and that they had checked them.  I told them this was not the case and to please fix the doors immediately.  When we returned to the room, one of the doors was permanently locked (from the inside and outside) and the other now had a key in the lock.  I was never offered an apology for putting my safety at risk.  Shame on the hotel for such an alarming oversight on guest safety.  A backed up sink and broken thermostat, liveable (though not acceptable), but unlocked doors.  Not okay.  Ever.

For those traveling with families.  Beware that the pool does not allow children (yes, you are reading correctly).  Children are ""allowed"" to swim between 10am and 11:30am and 3:00pm to 4:30pm.  Hours that do not work when you are in London to tour the city.

There were many, many other failings in customer service, but I believe I have highlighted the significant ones.  I really did want to love this hotel.  It is so modern and gorgeous.  But the customer service (or lack thereof) just took that feeling away from us.

Would I recommend this hotel?  Hard to say (I hesitate here as the hotel did try, although too late, to remedy the situation for us).  I am sure many, many people have amazing experiences here.  It just didn't happen for us.",3,2012,08,10

Definitely coming here again next time!",5,2012,08,07
143,Luxury in the heart of London,"Stayed in the Hotel for a business trip for 2 weeks with my wife and daughter. Since this was my first stay in the hotel, Corina (customer relations manager) provided us with a free of charge breakfast for the whole stay. The room size was excellent ,we were able to fit an extra bed with plenty of room to move around. The bathroom was quite nice and modern.

The hotel is quite new ( around one year old) so the furniture/bathroom/facilities are in excellent conditions.

Internet is free of charge.

The hotel is 2 minutes walk to embankment tube station which was very convenient.

The hotel breakfast is good but it could be better in my opinion.

There was a small issue at first when before checking in but it was sorted out very quickly by the staff which was appreciated.

Overall, the hotel is worth the price even though it is a bit expensive.",5,2012,08,05
143,Internet Service Horrible,"Internet service in rooms and throughout the hotel is very, very bad.  Only a few times each day was there enough bandwidth to even use it.  The connection is fine, but it does not support the traffic.  Honestly, when riding the London underground I could connect to Virgin mobile when the train stopped and pull down a page faster than at the Corinthia.  I complained, and the manager seemed to care, although he mostly implied it was working fine for everyone else?? Forget about skype or facetime calls to friends back home and you could never upload a photo in a e-mail, difficult just sending an e-mail.  All the other fantastic reviews people have offered are true and that needs no more comment on my part.  But since many people that use TripAdvisor to find this hotel initially will continue to use TripAdvisor for restaurants or activities it may be worth mentioning you will be sitting in the Starbucks near the hotel to surf the internet.  I think for $600 per night the internet service should be better.  Be careful with the excuse the manager will offer in response to my comments - we tried PC, IPad, Iphones... nothing worked well at the Corinthia but everything worked fine at Starbucks, you can do the math.",4,2012,08,04
143,Won't stay anywhere else in London,"My husband and I traveled to London in April to visit our daughter who was studying there spring semester 2012. We reserved 2 rooms with a courtyard view and asked that they were near each other. The rooms are gorgeous with fabulous amenities. After living in a tiny dorm room, our daughter was blown away by the opulence! She especially enjoyed the large sunken bath where she soaked away the damp London weather with the aromatic Epsa bath salts - all while enjoying something on the television. We all loved the coffee/cappaccino maker in the room and I loved the Babybliss hair dryer - so much that I ordered one when I returned to the states! Breakfast was included in our rate and we highly recommend - such variety and all scrumptious. My daughter and I loved the pool/spa area. You must see it to believe. We also had a marvelous tea in the main lobby and my daughter still talks about the lovely china. The flowers that adorn the lobby and rooms are beautifully coordinated - works of art. We travelled to Spain after our long weekend stay but then returned to the Corinthia before departing to the states. While we had a wonderful stay in Spain, we could not wait to get back to the Corinthia! Our daughter took advantage of the 24-hour check-in/check-out policy and used the spa and pool late into the day after we said our good-byes. The staff and service everywhere in the hotel were top-notch. And we loved the location of the hotel. Close enough to many of the sights but also very quiet. We can't wait to return!",5,2012,08,04
143,Unparalleled Luxury,"From the spectacular architecture, sumptuous interiors, fabulous restaurants and the sexy Bassoon bar: the Corinthia is the best new London Hotel! The hotel is located in the heart of Whitehall within easy access to the Strand and Covent Garden and is also a stones throw from the 
London Eye",5,2012,08,02
143,Wedding Night,"For one of my son's wedding gifts we decided to put him up in a nice London hotel.  He chose Corinthia.  We asked them for an upgrade but I was totally taken aback by how accommodating they were.  He and his new bride were thrilled with the lovely room.  There were delicious chocolates and a lovely fruit basket, not to mention beautiful flowers throughout.  The reception and staff were exceptionally nice to us considering we weren't regular patrons of the hotel. They made my son's wedding night an extra special and a very memorable occasion!  Thank You Corinthia!

143,Wonderful relaxation and a gift of white roses!,"My husband and I were so very pleased by our stay at The Corinthia Hotel this past March, especially after having been very impressed by the service of High Tea when we were there last summer. In spite of our high expectations before we arrived, the beauty of the elegant decor and the other luxurious amenities included in our room and bath actually took us by surprise. It was unusually peaceful and quiet in our room throughout our visit, in spite of the fact that there are busy streets on either side of the hotel. There was plenty of light and a lovely view of the courtyard through our window. The bed was large and comfortable, which is unusual in London. As others have mentioned, there was an espresso bar on one side of the room and a bookcase with books and art pieces on the other side. There was also a table with chairs on both sides of the room. Oh, and there was a modern television mounted on the wall across from the bed, as well. The luxurious bath area included separate glassed-in rooms for the toilet and bidet, as well as for the large shower. The largest area included the double sinks and the tub. There were soft lights under the edge of the tub for those late night visits, and a flat-screen television was installed in the wall at the perfect viewing height.  What more could anyone want while staying in the most vibrant city in the world? I just can't wait to return!",5,2012,07,26
143,It can't be any better than this,"We are a little family who recently have stayed two knights in a King Executive Room at CorinTthia Hotel, London. The hotel is absolutely perfect - and such a pleasure that it is an experience even to stay at the hotel. The only thing we missed in these modern times was a dockingstation with loudspeaker for our iPhone favourite music - a lot of other hotels have that.

All in all, we can't recommend the hotel highly enough. It can't be better than this. It is the best hotel we've ever stayed in - the rooms are fantastic, the service is fantastic, and the food in the restaurants is fantastic. Add to this that it has only two minutes walk to Embankment and only three minutes to Trafalgar Square. 

We would recommend visitors in London to try it - fast! In a few years time it is only rich Arabs and Americans who can afford it (already now many of the hotels TV Channels are from the Arabic countries) as this hotel likely will be so popular that its' prices will rise dramaticly.",5,2012,07,23
143,Excellent Hotel with first class service in a great location,"Stayed here last week and this is now my favorite hotel in London. Totally renovated and elegantly done. The room itself was large and spacious. Bathroom has its own shower and tub (with a TV!) and the bed was quite comfortable. The gym and spa/pool are quite nice especially the pool area. My package included breakfast which was quite good too. The location is perfect - right below Trafalgar Square, just up from the Thames, close to shopping, restaurants and the Theatre District and also just a short ride to the City for work. Would definitely recommend and stay there again.",5,2012,07,21
143,Absolutely the best place in London,"This was everything as advertised...if there were a 6 star rating, the Corinthia would be 6 1/2.  Very pricey...but you get what you pay for.  Wonderful location in between Westminster Abbey & Buckingham Palace.  Across the street from the tube, and around the corner from Trafalger Square.  Service on par with the very best...and the bathroom was to die for!!  Double sinks, sepoerate water closet area & glassed in shower.  And the closet was a walk in.",5,2012,07,19
143,"Back again, and still loving the Corinthia","We enjoyed our November visit to the Corinthia so much that we returned the end of May. I'm still in love with this place, and do plan to visit again, although we did have one nuisance of a problem. The internet service in our room was very spotty, and mostly did not work. I twice reported that we were not getting service, but nothing happened. I did mention it again at checkout, as I was surprised/disappointed by the lack of response. A few days later, I received a very concerned email from the hotel manager, who offered to personally book our next visit, so.... my point is not to complain or extoll here, but just to let readers know what happened. I, personally, am satisfied, and would definitely go back.

Our room was an upgrade, and the bathroom was gorgeous, with an oversize, freestanding, Roman tile tub. The bed and furnishings were lovely and comfortable, and we had a nice view to the Eye.

I do love the location, and we were lucky, as we were there for 9 of the only sunny days I think the city has had this summer !  (It started to rain the day we left, the day before the Queen's Jubilee. )  The fine weather made walking so easy and pleasant. Went to the Chelsea Flower Show, which is definitely worth the visit. 

One disappointment was Massimo's. In November, we ate there once, and it was excellent. This time, it really was mediocre, I'm afraid. I hope they step it up and make it good again, because the space the restaurant occupies is beautiful.

Room service breakfast was excellent and punctual.

Bar service at North Hall was excellent.

Wait service in the lobby, where I spent a lot of time, was really spotty. You had to really flag the staff down, except for one man, who seemed to be the manager. He was always on the ball. I was chatting with a pretty major celebrity one day, and he mentioned the same thing about having to flag them down, so at least they don't treat a celeb differently than any other! 

The spa and workout area was wonderful, once again. So clean and perfect and professional. I had the excellent Sinead for a facial, and later, for a massage.

I highly recommend these restaurants:  Ottolengthi's new Nopi; Veeraswamy (elegant, delicious Indian), Wild Honey (so good!!), Mele E Pere, & The Wolseley (worth it just to experience the space).

All in all, I hope to visit again next fall or winter.",5,2012,07,17
143,Just one of the best in the world!,"Stayed 2 nights in the Corinthia London with my family. We had 2 very nice rooms
We have seen a lot of the very best hotels in the world and the Corinthia belongs certainly in our private top 5 !!!

Small comment: the service with the breakfast wasn,t that good, but overall the service was excellent.
Keep this level !

143,a dream!,"Experience this place is equal to live a day as if you are in a dream!
The whole time spent in there made me feel as if I was a Queen, feeling spoiled thanks to the attention of the staff and the beauty of the entire building.
If you ever happen to be there, you must go to the hotel spa, called Espa. This is a real urban spa, with enough space to make sure you are not squeezed together with the rest of the guests.
Lovely the bar and restaurant areas, not sure if this is opened for non residents as well, anyway even on a Sunday evening it was almost full.
Thanks to all members of staff that were so kind to look after my stay!",5,2012,07,16
143,Tip top,"Absolutely perfect service, fantastic rooms, and the restaurants are superb. The breakfast was excellent. This hotel takes 5 stars to another level.",5,2012,07,15
143,"London, without peer","I've just stayed for 10 days at the Corinthia Hotel and it's without doubt my favorite hotel in London. I've usually stayed at Covent Garden Hotel, the Knightsbridge or Browns, and the Corinthia matches and sometimes exceeds these (wonderful) hotels in every way. 
The hotel itself and the public rooms are gorgeous and welcoming; the decor/design is understated but luxurious. 
The rooms are beautiful, with attention to every detail; brilliant bed + bedding, fluffy pillows, espresso machine, large walk in closet, bathrooms with awesome shower and gigantic tub (with TV;) heated floors/towel racks, multiple lighting options, nighttime delivery of water and chocolate, complimentary wireless throughout and the restaurants are first rate, with room service prepared to accommodate any request at any hour of the day.
The only issue I had on my stay was rectified by the top notch staff; I had issues with connecting to the wireless when I checked in which persisted for the first 24 hours. The amazing Katarina, the evening duty manager, moved me into a room which connected immediately, and as a bonus, the room (fourth floor) was sunny and bright (my first room on the first floor, was gorgeous but without much natural light.) In fact, Katarina stayed very attentive throughout my stay; between her; Sahil the magnificent concierge; and Alan my favorite doorman, I had a wonderful time. 
I was on a very punishing work schedule so everything running smoothly at the hotel was paramount to my productivity.
In addition the restaurants are wonderful, delicious food and perfect for meetings. The hotel is a short walk from the theatre district and the Embankment is next store, with a tube station just across the street - lastly if you are interested in being pampered a car/driver will drop you, per gratis, to local spots on a first come/first serve basis.
I'm planning to be in London on business, more frequently, and this where I intend to stay from henceforth.",5,2012,07,15
143,One of few true 5 star London hotels,"This hotel has become my favourite in london for many reasons, excellent service, staff etc and on top of this I had left some items in my room , called them , housekeeping had them all and sent them all to the  UAE. It is in great location , spa one of best in the world, staff best I have come across in London and always look forward to returning.",5,2012,07,14
143,Wow,This is a first class hotel located in a great position in central London. The rooms are large and extremely well appointed.  The staff are fantastic. One of the best hotels in the world in my view. I  loved it.,5,2012,07,12
143,"Beautiful, quiet, plush hotel with excellent customer service in a great location!","The Corinthia is an immaculate hotel in a fantastic location. A bit of a celebrity hotel, Rihanna stays there when she visits Boston, and while I was there Prince Charles himself was in the hotel. The lobby is spotless, with staff waiting to assist you at any turn. There is a lovely large lobby where afternoon tea is served (I suggest you indulge, it's a great experience, and for those of you who can eat and drink quite a bit, both the tea and sandwiches are unlimited). 

My room was wonderful, even though it over looked the lobby (no view other than other hotel windows), it still let in a ton of light and was dead quiet. Room service was great, with the people delivering the food very friendly and open, always asking me if there was anything else they could do for me before they left. 

Just a note - if you have clothing dry cleaned or pressed, be sure you clarify when you want your item of clothing back to your room. In one instance I thought I'd asked for Same Day, but it turned out I hadn't noted that clearly and it came back the next day.

The location of this hotel is fantastic. You're walking distance from Trafalgar Square, Parliment Square (Westminster Abbey, Palace of Westminster, etc.), Big Ben, The Eye of London, Buckingham Palace, Royal Festival Hall and more.

Last but not least, this hotel has the best bathrooms/restrooms I've experienced in quite some time. Very spacious, with all new hardware and lovely amenities like a TV over the bathtub and heated floors! An excellent way to relax after a day of exploring London!",5,2012,07,10
143,My new London favorite,"A true 5 star experience from check in to check out (which is variable based on your own arrival and departure time). Beautiful decor, modern but not minimal, very comfortable rooms with well thought out amenities (love the heated floor in the bathrooms). Have stayed 3 times now, and always have been accommodated in the rooms with the big walk in closet which is big enough to be a dressing room. Last visit was the weekend of the Jubilee festivities and the flotilla. Perfect in every regard. Oh - and the Spa is fantastic.",5,2012,07,09
143,Everything a hotel should be.  Can't wait to go back,"A few colleagues had sung the Corinthia's praises so I gave it a shot on my last business trip to London.  I'm glad I did.  It's a great property with everything you could possibly want in an urban hotel. The location near Embankment tube stop and south of Trafalgar Square is fantastic, the decor throughout the property is beautiful and the service is very good.  Flexible check-in was a plus, reception was extremely professional.  Lobby cafe attendant wasn't as friendly as I might have hoped - make sure you talk to them before touching any of the pastries!

Room was beautifully appointed and relaxing, as you'll see in my pics.  Great walk-in closet.  Especially loved the rain shower head in the large bathroom.  Didn't make use of the double sinks or the jacuzzi tub but both are the sort of details that you come to expect from a nice hotel.

I have recommened Corinthia to a number of friends and colleagues and will continue to do so.  Can't wait until my return visit.  My wife will love it.",5,2012,07,09
143,The BEST place to stay in London.,"Classy and elegant. Great location near all the sites yet peaceful and quiet at the hotel. Very attentive, helpful and friendly staff.",5,2012,07,06
143,Finally the real deal,"So many hotels present themselves as 5 star or luxury and so it is a relief to finally come across one that cuts through the hype and delivers on, and even exceeds, the promise.

It is a spectacular property in an excellent location, the rooms are extremely well furnished and the attention to detail is impressive (for example the quality and comfort of the carpets made one almost want to sit on the floor).

As ever, the most significant factor is the quality of the service, helpful and not aloof, the final touch came when I asked what was the time for check out and the response was ""what time would you like to check out?"" 

Why can't other hotels that charge the same tariff be like this?",5,2012,07,05
143,Great value meal in central London,"We had booked dinner on the Friday night before Trooping the Colour, so sadly couldn't park right outside the hotel. England were playing their first game of the European Championship, so the Northallerton Bar was very quiet. 

The excellent barman was cheerful and friendly and mixed a delicious non alcoholic cocktail which included among other things, cranberry juice and coconut purée. It was divine and had we not been staying for dinner in the restaurant I would definitely have had another (I should have got the barman's name, sorry. He had a great sense of humour and was blond)! He even said I could name the cocktail - red lipstick since you ask!
Our waiter couldn't have been more attentive, observant without being obtrusive (I didn't get his name either, but I think he was Polish and a huge tennis fan. We discussed the Queens club matches and upcoming wimbledon).
Didn't have a starter but enjoyed the tasty and substantial salmon fishcake. 
The others had steak and chips - delicious. Had the Mango/passion fruit pavlova which was overly sweet (even for meringue) and the others had a nice selection of cheese.
Overall great service in a not too busy restaurant. Will return, if only for my cocktail!
",5,2012,07,03
143,Highest standard of room I've seen in London,"Stayed one night on a team building event.  I had begun to convince myself that UK hotels could not really achieve the standard of the top establishments elsewhere in the world because they were just a bit quaint and the noise and idiosyncracies were part of the English charm.  Well, I've recalibrated that view.  The spec of the Corinthia is very high.  Lots of marble, genuine wood floors and panels, impeccable sound-proofing, comfortable bed, perfect lighting, all the gadgets you need but not in an intrusive way.  And that rare find... a hotel hairdryer that actually dries hair in less than 3 hours.  Hard to fault, but I do tend to agree with the ""Something's amiss"" reviewer as far as the public spaces go.  The ground floor is large with lots of interlinking spaces that are all a bit samey.   In fact, this is where it needs some quirky English charm!  Restuarant (I think it was called Northhall) was nice but a bit boring and the food service was terribly slow.  We were a group of 11 but there were several empty tables so the kitchen should not have been stretched.  Sadly no time to make it to the spa.",5,2012,06,29
143,Top Notch,"Just returned home from a short visit to London and stayed at the Cotinthia.Thoroughly
enjoyed our stay and ate in the hotel nights for dinner on two nights.Ate in Italian restaurant
first night with friends and it was top notch both in food quality and service.Also enjoy the jazz trio!
Second night we had dinner in Northall and again really enjoyable and our food and beverage server was excellent.
Unfortunately the hotel had a emergency situation early the next morning with a full hotel evacuation and I must compliment all concerned for the professional manner in which they handled this event. No panic and all under control and after a period of time we all returned to the Lobby and restaurant for complimentary breakfast and many of us in bathrobes! Like to thank the staff under trying circumstances and lovely to see breakfast chefs helping to take breakfast orders and serving guests directly at their table.Well done to all !",5,2012,06,28
143,Something's amiss,"It's hard to fault the Corinthia, so perhaps this comes down to personal taste.  Whilst the building is impressive, I found it a bit cold (in atmosphere).  I found the food and service at the restaurant (Massimo) lacking, especially considering this is a five star hotel.  The location however is excellent.  My husband and I woke early to wander down to the Thames to watch the sunrise--it's only a stone's throw from the hotel.  The room itself was wonderful--airy and light yet cosy and welcoming. Room service was excellent.  Nothing like climbing into your fluffy robe and settling in for some hot tea and mushy peas.  I wouldn't however, be compelled to return.  The search continues for my favorite London hotel.",4,2012,06,23
143,"Great hotel, but at its price it should be Magnificent","The hotel has all the amenities one would expect from a very good hotel, but with the price they are asking, you should be able to get excellent and non-intrusive 24/hour service and attentiveness. I was expecting the British equivalent of the Park Hyatt in Tokyo... unfortunately, not even close.
That said, the hotel is awesome. The rooms, especially for London, are awesome. The place is centrally located. The staff is attentive. However, at peak moments there seems to not be enough staff. So while somebody is getting a LOT of attention, someone else is getting none.",3,2012,06,23
143,Very nice property,"Once you get past the sticker shock, which isn't limited to this hotel but London in general, you can enjoy your stay.  I traveled with a group and although our rates were the same we found our rooms to be quite varied in size.  Closets were almost non exsistent in some rooms while others had enourmous space.  Telephones in the rooms were frustrating.  They frequently went into the do not disturb mode and needed the hotel operator to turn it off.  Another annoyance was the lack of an outlet in the bathroom.  It made it very difficult to use a hair dryer.

The atrium is beautiful with its Baccarat chandelier and lovely tea service.  Bed was comfortable and the room very clean.  The Spa is very nice with some services priced as expected while others seemed out of sync.  A deluxe manicure and pedicure was just average (no cuticle triming and a very short massage) but very expensive (155 GBP).  
Just 2 blocks from Trafalger Square and within walking distance to Westminister Abbey, the Corinitha is a luxury property that is still working out some new hotel issues. 

If I found myself back in London and could negotiate a good rate, I'd go back.",4,2012,06,21
143,This is my new favourite London hotel,"I have been looking for a great 5 star hotel near my office for years and today I found it.

This really is great

Rooms exceptional, great service and top restaurants and bars. You can't go wrong if you stay here",5,2012,06,19
143,Luxury hotel which just misses the finer details,"At 500GPB per night I just expected more.  Yes the hotel oozes luxury and charm.  Yes the staff are (generally) attentive to your every whim.  Yes the spa is spectacular if you have the time to indulge.

But why am I marking it down?  2 reasons, which would not have bothered me in a hotel that was not claiming the Corinthia's level of excellence.
1: Air conditioning performance in room
I stay in many hotel rooms and this is the first where the controls have defeated me and the staff, and which was unable to be rectified.  During the first night we set the temp to 22 deg, on auto.  It just continued to blow and blow and blow cold air, directly onto the bed - making the room unpleasantly cold but unfortunately not cold enough to overcome the heat being generated by a doona that was better suited to extreme Arctic conditions.  Turning the a/c off allowed the room to quickly overheat.  And it had a mind of its own about coming on and off, regardless of whether turned on or off.
I spoke to the staff the next day about this, who advised me that evening that the engineers had checked it out and confirmed all was ok.  Alas this was not to be the case, as we faced a second night with the same problem (although we had the doona replaced with a cotton blanket).  The hotel sent up a member of staff to check on the problem, and after going through it with us he agreed the 'auto' control was not working, most likely because the thermostat was located away from the vent of the bed, in a part of the room that was warmer, and which would never cool.  Hence the thermostat or would never reach our desired temperature, while we slowly froze.  Another hot night without a/c.  By this time we gave up and resigned ourselves to our fate on subsequent nights.

2: Breakfast quality, seating, attention and availability
The quality of breakfast is not as good as that enjoyed at most 4 star hotels, let alone 5 star or luxury.  One type of eggs (scrambled), very very limited range of cold meats/fish and breads, and all in tiny serves. (And in case management read this and suggest we could have ordered from the menu, my response would be that we found that too confusing - could we order from the menu while choosing from the buffet as a supplement, or was it one or the other.  The menu, which is the size of a broadsheet, is too complex)
The staff had perfected the art of looking but not seeing, hence once seated it became very difficulty, for example, to order a coffee.  Staff walked by us repeatedly without us being able to attract their attention.  And when we were able to place a coffee order it took an interminable amount of time, and on two different meal occasions having to ask at least twice.
If you do have breakfast there, avoid sitting on the lounge/bench seats.  For some reason in recent years a feature of design has been seating which is too low for, and too far from, the tables.  Select the individual seats if you prefer comfort.
ANd finally, having an early check out on Sunday morning I thought I would get down to breakfast early, and was quite surprised to find they did not start serving breakfast till 7, later than other days.  Granted some people may sleep in, but I was disappointed to find a luxury hotel who could not cater to people who left early no matter what day.  Yes I could have ordered room service, but it never entered my mind that they might open later. Mea culpa.

As I said at the start, I could put up with these things in a hotel of a lesser standard at a cheaper price, but the Corinthia should not miss the mark on these levels of comfort",2,2012,06,18
143,The Spa here deserves a large 'Wow',"Had an overnight hotel & theatre break at the Corinthia.
It's brilliantly located a short distance from Trafalgar Square, Westminster & the bridge across to the London eye.
When you first get there, it is very stylish but not overly stuffy. Our room was an executive room with a small balcony overlooking the central courtyard. It had a large bathroom & dressing room. The hotel gave us a complimentary bottle of wine for our anniversary which was a lovely touch. Breakfast was either choose 'a la carte' English or buffet.
The real 'wow' factor came from the spa. We used it twice & it is the most sumptuous we have seen. The real highlight being the 'VITALITY POOL' basically a small swimming pool sized jacuzzi. The best we've encountered anywhere.
If there are negatives (& I'm being picky), hotel prices are very expensive & they claim there are no check-in & check-out times. But 2 people came to our door on our day of leaving to see if we'd left & both before 11.15.
The staff were actually lovely & if you want a classy hotel brilliantly located & don't mind paying a few pounds extra (it's better than the Royal Horseguards across the road), then this is for you.",5,2012,06,17
143,Not anymore what it used to be,"I have chosen the hotel last year for my regular stays, as the 24hrs check-in/-out policy is very convenient for me. Due to my job I am travelling a lot. I am depending on the flight timings and it was a very pleasant and refreshing surprise to find finally a hotel which offers every guests’ dream: check-in whenever you arrive at the hotel. I was impressed and happy to finally found “my” hotel.
I was always wondering why there weren’t more hotels with this brilliant idea. 
But since a couple of months the policy is not quite working anymore. More and more often it is not quite possible to check-in at the requested check-in time although mentioned during making the reservation.
For these occasions I was offered breakfast, coffee in the lounge, using the spa or a room to rest for some time. Alternatives are offered, but that is not what I am expecting at all. It is not what is advertised as a unique selling point on the website. Well, I guess there I have my answer, why not every hotel is using that policy. Thinking about it, it does not work in general. If all rooms are booked and late check-outs are guaranteed, how can guests check-in early?
Another unpleasant situation is the waiting time before being able to get to the desk on some occasions. 
The receptionists are in general very friendly and helpful, but you can see their desperation handling the non-stop ringing telephone and the waiting people.
It is a pity as it is a beautiful property, very friendly staff and a great location. 
I actually don’t want to search for another hotel, but I sincerely hope that changes are going to be made.",2,2012,06,16
143,Service as it should be.,"Impecable service as you would expect from an establishment of this standing. I highly recommend that you stay here, if that is not possible then go in and try the afternoon tea. I say everything.",5,2012,06,16
143,Couples Retreat,"This was truly a 5 star hotel experience. Before we even traveled I corresponded with the concierge, Justin, several times making inquiries. He answered all of my questions and took care of my requests perfectly. When we arrived everyone treated us as if we were honored guests. We were celebrating our 14th wedding anniversary and upon entering the room we were greeted with a chocolate cake and a bottle of champagne with a card from the manager. The room itself was huge as well as the bathroom and wardrobe. The cleaning staff made the beds daily and provided turn down service each evening which was a nice touch.  We had breakfast in the room one morning and also made several requests during our stay that were always attended to quickly. The hotel has an onsite spa called ESPA. My wife and I both had a massage and highly recommend this to anyone staying at the Corinthia. They have a pool/sauna/steam room/whirlpool area that I used a couple of times and it was very well taken care of and a nice advantage to a hotel if you have an extended stay. The concierge Justin, helped us with reservations several times including on the night of our anniversary as well as two sets of theater tickets. Each of the restaurants and the theater seating were very nice. He even arranged for the hotel car to drive us to dinner. In summary, the manager and entire staff of the Cornithia Hotel have built a wonderful 5 star hotel that everyone should experience. We will be going back.",5,2012,06,14
143,the best from the best,"It is a privately owned hotel and you can see that. Its just stunning, all the detail. Bars, restaurants, spa, room - just amazing. you can be the pickiest person on earth and you will still love it. In my opinion this is a no1 hotel in London now. JUST FANTASTIC! Top location!",5,2012,06,14
143,Champagne Afternoon Tea,"We love Afternoon Tea and whenever we go on holiday, we try to seek out somewhere special to try. The Corinthia did not let us down. The Lobby Lounge was a beautiful setting in which to have Afternoon Tea. We were sorrounded by beautiful white orchids and the spectacular light in the Lobby was quite a talking point.
We had a tasty selection of finger sandwiches, lovely warm scones (fruit and plain) and then moved onto the 'fancies'. We had lots of tasty pastries, cakes and tarts but the star of the show was without doubt the mini violet eclair. I can still taste it :)
We have had many Afternoon Teas but this was the first time we had been offered complimentary top ups of sandwiches and scones. Lots of tea and of course the glass of champagne all went down a treat. All in all, a lovely experience.",5,2012,06,14
143,Sublime,"The Corinthia is truly one of the most amazing hotels we've stayed in. We were lucky enough to stay in a Trafalgar Suite and the rooms were beautiful and very big.  The hotel is so central that all the sights are within walking distance. 

We had breakfast 2 mornings in the Northall Restaurant and I think it was the best breakfast we've ever had. The choice was incredible and so tasty and fresh. 

We had personalised massages in the Spa and loved every minute of it. The facilities in the Spa are second to none. 

We had dinner in the Massimo  Restaurant and the food was gorgeous, service wonderful and atmosphere buzzing. 

We also had cocktails in the Bassoon Bar which were delicious. 

We were lucky enough to experience every aspect of the hotel and couldn't praise it enough. I was gutted to be leaving and hope to return soon.  I would highly recommend this hotel!!!",5,2012,06,12
143,The lovely Bassoon Bar!,"If you're looking for somewhere special to enjoy cocktails to die for or a bottle of delicious champagne then look no further thatn the Bassoon Bar at The Corinthia London. The decor is really clever, the atmosphere, especially when the music starts is fantastic and the service is trulty exceptional. The finishing touches to everything presented to us were just fantastic. We are a group of friends who always look for a speical venue and we certainly found one on Friday, Go along its well worth it!",5,2012,06,12
143,Wonderful hotel,"Stayed here for a week and it is an amazing hotel. From the moment you walk in the front door the service is impeccable. We were shown to our room on the 6th floor by the person who checked us in, and the room faced an inner courtyard. The room was a good size with a lovely bathroom. Fluffy bathrobes, slippers and plenty of towels plus spa goodies. There was a decent sized wardrobe with drawer space, and the room had an umbrella ( which was used constantly). Each room has a nespresso coffee maker and we had fresh fruit in our room twice throughout the week.

The turn down service is lovely, good chocolates and bottles of water nightly. 

The breakfast was included in our stay ( continental) , whilst there is plenty on offer and it is very good I think charging £28 per person for this is very high. We ate in the Northalls restauarant one evening from their set menu which is £28 for 3 courses with a glass of champagne. The food was very good and the portion sizes for the main were a decent size and we probably didn't need the sides we ordered. 

The location is ideal, few minutes from Trafalgar Square, Houses of Parliament, the London eye and 2 minutes from the tube.

This hotel is just lovely but one thing I would say is that the prices they charge for drinks and food are very high and apart from breakfast we found ourselves eating and drinking elsewhere but this aside I would return to this hotel tomorrow.",5,2012,06,11
143,Corinthia's Bassoon Bar is music to every sense,"The Corinthia is a Victorian hotel used as offices for decades but brought wonderfully up to date. It features some of the most beautiful dining rooms in London - high-ceilinged, mirrored and spacious. But I want to tell you about the bar, the Bassoon Bar.

The Bassoon Bar is a proper cocktail bar. It feels both 21st Century and as though you are in a smart black and white movie. Slickly decorated and moodily lit, the bar has plenty of tables for two and space all about. The Head Barman, Mario, was recruited from Italy where he was considered  one of the best. The cocktail menu is stunning; amongst the Martinis I discovered the Hoffman. This is what you expect plus a few dashes of Orange Bitters. One sip and I was a devotee. For life I expect. Oh yes, and more than the usual run of glasses, too.

There were good snacks, excellent non-intrusive service all overseen by a proper Maitre d'. All in all, absolutely everything that the Savoy's American Bar was not (see review). After 9pm there is usually a wondrous jazz band with a terrific singer.  

If you want to get away from it all, flirt, romance, gossip or people watch the Bassoon Bar will reward you - even if you only drink Coke Light.

I've also had afternoon tea served in the Corinthia's pastel-mood, domed central atrium. It was outstanding.",5,2012,06,11
143,Perfect location,"We stayed at the Corinthia for three nights in May. We chose it because of its location and its room size. Our bathroom was huge and well-appointed. The bedroom was also amply proportioned and comfortable. We didn't have any view - our room faced an adjacent section of the hotel which seemed to be under construction - but we didn't expect a view. There was some slight construction noise during the day, but nothing at night.

The hotel's policy of having a room ready whenever you arrive is great because it means you don't have to wait until 3 or 4pm to get into your room. We arrived around 1 or 2 pm and were shown to our room immediately.

The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Shortly after arrival, I was trying to get online on my cellphone (free wireless!) and I couldn't figure out why it wasn't working. Just then there was a knock at the door. A hotel employee was standing there with his laptop asking, ""are you having any trouble getting online?"" Wow! After I answered in the affirmative he went away for a few minutes and then came back to make sure that he had fixed the system. He had. I was impressed.  

The only negative we experienced was in the restaurants. We ate at Massimo for dinner and at The Northall for breakfast and we found that the food at Massimo was good but not great (some dishes were excellent and some were just ok), and the portions were sometimes disproportionately small (to the price). The service was laughably bad. Breakfast at The Northall was nothing special and it was expensive for what it was. The next day we went to Starbucks and spent much less, and got much more.

Even though our dining experience at Massimo wasn't stellar, the musical group was! Although the musicians were all very young they were playing ""vintage"" type songs (maybe from the 20's or 30's?) and it was most enjoyable. 

I would go back to the Corinthia but I'm not sure I'd eat in the restaurants (unless the group was playing at Massimo). On other nights we ate at Nopi and at the Savoy Grill and in both cases the service was incredible, so I don't think it is a case of me having outlandish expectations of service.",5,2012,06,10
143,Amazing long weekend,"Spent in Corinthia 4 days in May 2012. Hotel is very nice located - no matter if you want to walk, go by taxi or take a tube... Embankment tube station is just 3-5 minutes by walk. In my case it was  useful considering Diamond Jubilee celebrations starting so many streets were closed.
Service is excellent. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Had some issues with taxi to go airport and concierge just did his best to help me. Thanks a lot!
Interior is just impressive. Really loved it. If you go to a round hall where afternoon tea is being served please attention to the impressive Baccarat Chandelier! It looks like a piece of art.
Room nice and cosy, very comfortable ( I had a Superior Queen Room). And big of course which is important especially in UK where sometimes even in expensive hotels rooms are just have a size of a shoebox:) And one more thing - no noise. Rooms have good sound isolation, so you don't hear anything which could irritate.
 Bathroom with lots of light and with a TV. Which I found very nice. Bed was just excellent - so rested well.Every evening I got chocolate candies in my room from Harrods...after that I felt like my stay there was even more sweet...
Breakfast - good choice for healthy breakfast or some more classy continental one... Everything is fresh and tasty. Lots of fresh fruit.
Really recommend to visit a hotel SPA as it's just fantastic... They have everything to relax mixed in great interior where every detail is making you even more happy.",5,2012,06,08
143,Great,"Great place, great location, great service.  No problems.  Everyone very courteous and helpful. 
After you check in the reservation person then comes around the desk and physically escorts you to your room; now that is the way to start the visit.  Normally in most hotels the desk person points you in some direction towards the elevators and hollars NEXT. 
Do you think the newspaper business is dying in the USA?  Not so in England.  As you check in the reservationist asks you what paper you would like delivery to your room each morning:  London Times?  USA Today? Financial Times? 30 other local newsapers and tabloids (you know those juicy little papers you wouldn't want most people seeing you read).  And it is no problem changing your paper request at any time.",5,2012,06,05
143,a perfect treat,"hard to choose a London 5 star hotel? well look no further!
Awesome hotel, with genuinely excellent service. You really cant fault it, on anything. Stayed in hundreds of ""these type"" of hotels and this was right up there on every level. From the exceptional check-in service from Jamie, who brilliantly made us feel welcome and relaxed, to the incredible spa (really is something to behold!) the wonderful rooms with luxury throughout. You hear it a lot, but if this is the type of hotel you are considering, dont worry, you will not be dissapointed on any level.
Enjoy, we did!",5,2012,06,04
143,Wonderful Hotel,"Beautifully designed, comfortable rooms, great service, terrific location. There's really very little not to gush about the Corinthia. Even though it was obvious by the crowd outside the doors that there were celebrities staying there, we were treated with the best care and attention anyone could ask for. Will definitely stay there again.",5,2012,06,03
143,"Dinner for two, :)","Hi, yesterday been invited by hubi for surprise dinner to Corinthia London:).. Wow unexpected and must say very good choice!! Absoulety fabulous room design! Comfortable chairs, well organised all, and the flowers!! Very Posh and lovely atmosphere:).. all seems perfect:) the staff, the hotel, the food  (ehh  yammiee .. very very good).. we went for set menue.. absolutely great choice and worth the price absoultely..comparing to last unfortun at OXO we had at last that what we expected:) I really could go there again:)",5,2012,06,02
143,Georgious rooms & spa but the breakfast is not matching the standard expected,"Having had a meeting not at the City (as usual) I choose the Corinthia this time (because of the great reviews) and I must say: a georgious place. The rooms are very spacious and superbly outfitted. It is an old building with the touch of grandeur one may look for a nice stay in London. 
What is really mind-blowing is the Spa. Guests can use the general spa facilities for free and - whow - it is one of the best hotel spas around. I had the pleasure of using the spa early in the morning - skipping breakfast -  being the only guest at 7:30am and it was a great start of the day. Absolutely clean, wonderful pool, glass walled sauna, glass fire lodges, giant steam bath.
Having said this, the breakfast however is really disappointing for a 5-star hotel (so better go to the spa, slim yourself). Small choice, mediocre quality and overpriced. Guys, you may better take a look at the Chancery Court to check how a good breakfast should be looking like. 
For tourists location is absolutely perfect, close to Trafalgar Sq. If you have meetings in the City than it is too far away.",5,2012,06,01
143,Best Birthday ever. Thanks so much!,"The Corinthia in Budapest (see my previous review) was the best hotel I had ever stayed at. The Corinthia in London is just as good - if not better...

I called them up and told them I am a returning customer and wish to spend my brthday at the Hotel and Spa. 

They went the extra mile. Aside from the freebies (upgrade, fruit, chocs, etc), it was the small details that made the difference. We went for diner and upon our return to our room it had been made up and a bday cake, card (personally from receptionist) and bottle of champage was left for us.

Most people my age spend their birthdays on tables i nightclubs - or would opt for somewhere like The W. This was the best possible use of my money by a country mile. Relatively it was not expensive at all. I checked in at 11am and checked out at 8.30pm but was only charged for one night...

There's no point in me trying to describe how the ESpa (the diamond of the entire visit) was beyond anything I could have imagined - you have to see it for yourself.

I am completely sold on the Corinthia brand and plan to visit more of their hotels around the world. 

Big thank you to all the Corinthia staff, I will deifnitely be returning.",5,2012,05,31
143,Beautiful Hotel - great service,This is a beautiful hotel with great service.  I was in London for work and stayed at the Corinthia for a few weeks.  The employees at this hotel are wonderful and make every guest feel welcome.  Rooms are spacious with great amenities (beautiful bathrooms and nespresso machines).  Hotel also has an extensive spa with a very functional gym.  I would not hesitate to stay at the Corinthia hotel again.,5,2012,05,29
143,Best ever we stayed in,"Wow, this place ticks all the boxs, great staff, food, atmosphere, rooms, infact I cant find fault with this Hotel,.They treated us like a president, (the presidential suite is the nicest we've ever seen). Stay here if your in London, worth the price.",5,2012,05,25
143,Checking In/Out at Your Leisure,"I didn’t really see much point in putting a review on since they have so many great reviews already but one thing everyone has forgot to mention about this hotel is the check in/check out at your leisure, this is amazing how many other hotels in London could offer such a service – definitely beats the usual & inconvenient check in 2pm check out 11 or 12.  This hotel is truly wonderfully and well deserved of its 5 star status.  I have had the pleasure of staying at the hotel 3 times now and upon my third arrival not only did the Check-In staff remember me & welcome me back but also the Manager introduced himself and welcomed us.  One of the best welcomes I have ever received in a City hotel.  If your budget doesn’t stretch to an overnight stay you could also visit for a truly delightful afternoon tea or a visit to the fabulous Spa.  Either way you will not be disappointed and I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to business and leisure travellers alike.  Well done Corinthia.",5,2012,05,24
143,In a word: superb,"I would normally wait until we've checked out of a hotel to write a review, but this hotel just makes you want to rave about it. We checked in a day late due to a significantly delayed flight, and arrived exhausted mid-morning on Monday. We were greeted warmly (by the nicest and most helpful gentleman - Nuna - I am sure I didn't spell that right) despite that I'm sure we looked a little like something the cat dragged in. Nuna wished me a happy birthday (we checked in on the actual day of my birthday), and we were shown to our room. 

The room they took us to was lovely, but it was located on the exterior of the building and we'd booked an executive courtyard room. We're both light sleepers and like the quiet of a courtyard. I hated to leave the room (which had a birthday card, fresh fruit, a box of chocolates, and flowers!), but we asked to be moved to an interior room. They kindly agreed, but said one wasn't available at the moment. They treated us to breakfast while we waited, and then upgraded us to a junior suite so that we didn't have to wait any longer! (I think Nuna could tell how badly we needed a shower!)

And the kindness has continued...when we mentioned our luggage had been lost, they insisted on calling to check the status both with the airline and then the courier company who was delivering it. And, during the day while we were sightseeing, they provided status updates through memos left under our door. 

The doormen, bellhops, and concierge staff have been amazing - giving us directions, tips, booking tickets. They are all so friendly and professional (especially Matthew) Oh, and I can't forget to mention the food - room service last night and now two breakfasts in - it is fabulous, fresh, and downright scrumptious. Were we to travel to London again, we would stay here absolutely. And we definitely recommend it to all our friends.

Julie & Peter Hans",5,2012,05,22
143,fast becoming my fav for coffee and a chat in the west end,"Have only had coffee and tea here, not stayed or eaten -  and did so again yesterday - in the central lobby  - great selection of teas and fab cappuchino  - all in beautiful bone china. The Earl Grey and Darjeeling were just what they should be and the little biscuit was delicious. The full eating type teas looked great as did the nibbles they were serving with drinks.
Hesitated to review as it would be a shame to have to book !",4,2012,05,18
143,Wedding Anniversary in a different Central London Hotel,"As we often like to spend our anniversary in London . , we thought we'd try a new hotel - a 5* luxury category one , last year we stayed at The Savoy & previously have used The Dorchester, 4 Seasons, Intercontinental, The Berkley & Jumerai  Knightsbridge.   The Corinthia was a delightful find. Tucked away , near Whitehalll & Horseguards parade , the building is classically beautiful & renovated to perfection.  The spa is fantastic , best one we've found in the Capital .2 nice restaurants , good bar - (cocktail bar disappointing ) A real classy place that needs a little time to get Service 100% right but  one to watch out for , my 2nd favourite now after The Savoy !",4,2012,05,13
143,My new first choice in London,"I was intrigued by the ""minimalist"" and confident ads in Vanity Fair so we decided to stay there on our recent Board visit. We took 7 rooms in the hotel so this review takes into account my Partners views as well. The hotel is outstanding from every aspect. Great position just off Trafalgar Square. Exceptional decor and finishes. Wonderful service (could smile a bit more - quite stiff). Superb bar with amazing advice, cocktails etc. Breakfast a bit pricey. Excellent coffee and a good afternoon tea offering. Rooms are superb - bed very comfy. Bathrooms are outstanding. All in all, a great stay !!",5,2012,05,07
143,Probably the Best Hotel in London,"We stayed at the hotel twice in April and all we can really say is that this is truly a luxury hotel with no detail left wanting.  From the lobby and reception to the public areas and rooms the hotel oozes charm, luxury and style.
We also ate at Massimos the Italian restaurant within the hotel, this is primarily a fish restaurant with an excellent choice of sea food and oysters.  The wine list is extensive and the restaurant staff were passionate about the menu and within reason they were happy to accommodate requests for food not on the menu too.
Breakfast was served buffet style or you could select from a menu at the table.
An enjoyable stay and we could not recommend this hotel more highly",5,2012,05,06
143,My Absolute Favorite,"My husband and I have recently returned once again from the UK, and once again we have chosen to stay at the Corinthia. We stay here because the location is absolutely perfect. It is down the road from Trafalgar Square and across the road from the Embankment Underground. It is in walking distance to the London Eye, to Leceister Square, to the Charring Cross Station, as well as Covent Garden. You can even walk to the West End from the hotel, and should you take the train to the theater district, you are there in 10 minutes. The hotel may seem to be in the middle of it all, but it is located on a quiet stretch in an area that is so close yet far enough. The service that you receive is extremely personal. As soon as you arrive, your luggage is whisked away and brought directly up to your room. Whomever takes your reservation takes the time to personally escort you to your room and show you all that the room has to offer. The staff is very polite and helpful in all ways that a visitor needs, from directions to reservations, to offering you an umbrella in case you have forgotten one at home. We stayed in a beautiful room on the 5th floor, with a view of the bridge that leads to the London Eye. Our room had a walk in closet, a flat screen televsion, a coffee/tea machine, a safe, and a chaise lounge, a table to work on and a small one as well to place your things on. The bathroom is marble, a large tub, separate shower area with a large overhead shower head, in addition to a handheld one. The toilet/bidet is adjacent to the shower, yet private. The bathroom also has a flat screen TV so that you can indulge in having a bath while watching tv/listening to the radio. The toiletries are from their world renowned spa, and they are wonderful. There is even a towle warmer, and lightup mirror in the bathroom. At night, housekeeping comes to your room and turns your bed down, and leaves you bottled water, and a chocolate on your pillow. There is also a fancy bowl for some apples that you are given each day. It is all these little amenities that make this hotel so special. We are also delivered a morning paper of our chosing by 6am. I love this hotel, there is nothing that I have experienced that would not want to make me return. I have been to this hotel a few times already and I will continue returning for as long as I travel to London. Believe me you will not be disappointed with the rooms, the service, the location. This is truly a wonderful plave to stay. If you have some extra time, the Spa is
unbelievable. I treated myself to a facial and was treated like royalty. I cannot say enough about this hotel, it is absolutely my favorite London hotel.",5,2012,05,04
143,Beautiful stay!,"I had a 4 nights stay in this hotel and I can say this is my new favourite hotel in London.
Location is perfect, you can go on foot everywhere!
Service was outstanding. The rooms was huge and very clean (this is rare in London).
Breakfast was very good but a bit expensive. Afternoon tea was the best I have never tried.
I also tried Massimo's restaurant and Northall and both have been Exceptional.",5,2012,05,03
143,probably the best hotel in london,"There are so few hotels in London that are really special-  many of the 5 star offerings exist on reputations from some decades ago and some, like the Savoy, have been updated to modern standards, these are few and far between.

I think the corinthia sets new standards for what one would expect of  a true luxury hotel, the large bedrooms, superb bathrooms and Espa spa make for a wonderful stay",5,2012,05,02
143,Excellent,"One of the best hotels i ever stayed, rooms are great, tv on the bath rooms, relaxing, service is perfect. Location is also perfect, nothing wrong to say! Very good!",5,2012,05,01
143,Fantastic,"My husband and I stayed here as a little treat on Friday. The embankment tube station is literally just across the road from the hotel and is along the northern line running from Euston so was very easy for us to get the train then hop on the tube to get to the hotel.

There's a foot bridge just outside the embankment tube station that takes you across the Thames to the London Eye (approx 10 minutes walk). Royal horseguards is within easy walking distance as is Leicester Square and Covent Garden, I don't think you could get a more centrally located hotel so it was ideal for us as we only had a short time in London.

Upon check in we recieved a very warm welcome and shown to our room and shown how to operate the lights/aircon/TV etc. We were offered a newspaper for the next morning which was delivered. The room was very spacious and had a lovely little balcony that overlooked the courtyard.

We were offered the use of the thermal spa/pool but unfortunately didn't have time to use it on this ocassion. All the public areas of the hotel were beautifully designed and in keeping with the old grandeur of the building. We took advantage of the 24hr check in arriving early and staying late which was not a problem. All in all an amazing stay here, I would really like to visit again this time for a full weekend and maybe a spot of afternoon tea or some treatments in the spa, will have to drop hints to my husband for my birthday!",5,2012,05,01
143,"Great hotel, good location!","I stayed here for a week (last week of April). You can really see and feel the attention to details, from check in to check out, escorting you personally to your room, the attentiveness of the staff. It was my birthday week and when I arrived in my room, there was a cake with a happy birthday on it.
The food tasted good too, reasonable, price wise for a 5 star hotel. I had a meal at the Massimo restaurant, had a drink at the bar, and also had room service without waiting long for the service.
However, their housekeeping seems to be disorganized. Despite the do not disturb sign, housekeeping will knock, or push the doorbell, or leave a sign slipped under the door (which is what I prefer), ringing the house phone, and one time a housekeeping lady came in the room while I was in bed, without knocking just saying loudly ""housekeeping, housekeeping!"" when she saw me, she didn't even say she was sorry, she just said ""I will just come back.""
If not for the housekeeping (which basically invades your privacy when I says do not disturb), I could have given this hotel a 5 star.",4,2012,05,01
143,"Great hotel, would go again","Just come back from a spa break at this hotel. The Corinthia has everything I would expect of a brilliant 5 star hotel. Beautiful luxurious rooms, great food, helpful and efficient staff and great facilities.

What makes this place really stand out from the rest though is the 24 hour check in and out, the amazing bathroom with tv, and the sumptuous if not rather disorientating spa.

There were a few minor points that if corrected would have made the stay perfect in my view: 1) they offered me a free newspaper delivered to the room in the morning which was never sent
2) the vitality pool in the spa was closed for maintenance and we were never informed of this before we arrived
3) 24 hour check in and out caused issues - at check in our room wasn't available because the previous occupants hadn't checked out, and on the day of our departure we were bombarded with staff wanting to enter the room to clean it, add flowers, restock the mini bar etc... And phone calls asking when we were leaving. One bloke even came in when I was in the bath. Where are the ""do not disturb"" signs in the rooms? I couldn't find one and felt very pestered.
4) the food prices are ridiculous. £10 for a packet of jelly babies and £21 for a spaghetti bolognese? Really?

All things considered, I would definitely return for a luxury weekend, but will be taking my own ""DND"" sign and jelly babies!",4,2012,04,30
143,"""One of London's best""","My wife and I have stayed in most of the 5 star hotels in London and can honestly say that this hotel is right up there with the best. We arrived by car after an horrendous journey in the rain and were disappointed that there was no doorman to greet us (but very busy I think) we had to go to reception and ask for assistance as we had booked a valet parking service. This was sorted quickly, though we had to take our own suitcase from the car to check in. Check in was very efficient by Eric and he showed us personally to our room (638) and explained air con etc. I thought I had booked a courtyard room, but Eric said no, so this was probably my error.We carried our own suitcases in the lft and to our room ( not sure if bell boy service is available here) Room was beautiful as expected, there was a slight smell from the bath drain, but I think this was because it had not been used for a while. We sorted this by running the water and putting some shower gel down the drain. Quite a lot of wind noise, but it was ok and it was very stormy in London. Good service from housekeeping for extra pillows.Doorman at 7pm went out of his way to get taxi to theatre for us by walking 100 yards in the rain to hail a taxi for us!! Great service in Lobby bar on return fom theatre. Good
 night's sleep and fantastic breakfast. Spa was out of this world although vitality pool was out of order. The biggest and best 5 star service at this hotel is flexible check out as it allowed us to take our time over breakfast, use the spa,and shower in our room and depart at our leisure around 2.30 pm. Any other slightly negative comments in the above report is more than compensated by this fantastic service. This hotel will be the first I will check for availability on our next return trip to London.",5,2012,04,30
143,Excellent once again!,"I first visited the Corinitha for just one night in December 2011 and said at the time I would definitely be back and return with my husband.  We have just spent 4 nights at the Cornithia and were not disappointed.  My husband confirmed everything I described to him about the hotel stood true from the warm friendly welcome, the decor through to the very comfortable bedrooms.  When I stayed in December I was in a Deluxe Room, this time we were in an Executive room just to give a little more space, however both were lovely and with the bathrooms and wardrobes being the same size in our rooms, either option is very exceptable - a higher floor is a good option to request, both times I have been on the 6th floor, once looking towards Whitehall and once towards the Thames.  Just as the hotel website suggests, the location is excellent for visiting Westminster, Trafalgar Square, Covent Garden, the West End and frankly most of central London. We have both now decided this is definitely our new family hotel when visiting London.  On this trip we also managed to try out Northall Restaurant for evening dinner and then the Bassoon Bar and had very good welcoming experiences in both.  Hopefully next time we will finally get time to visit the Spa.",5,2012,04,29
143,Not Mayfair but Great!,"When I travel to London I prefer a Dickens cloud type environs- Mayfair with its winding streets and old Victorian buildings- each speaking a tale of times gone by. Kensington with its markets and life amidst that sense of time immortal and- one enver wants -really to be- out of walking distance from the great sights: Westminster Abbey St Paul's Cathedral , the Palace and mosre impt- the parks- a great needed green gasp in this so cosmopolitan of cities.  
 So here come the Corinthia Hotel- smack dab in downtown London- a block or two from Trafalger Square and Piccadilly Circus. Walking distance to the Strand and most theaters.  In an old converted government building- the war office I believe I was told. Why would one want to stay so close to the madness at times - of this very central location?
 One alights from your cab ( from the airport) and is immediately taken care of: your luggage is instantly retrieved and you are ushered into a foyer with views of an amazing chandelier in the courtyard tea room.  Check in is painless - during the day shift- you are escorted to your room discreetly- and all the upscale electronics are carefully demonstrated. Flying this room is  not quite as difficult as piloting  a 767-300 but close. I noted the nice young man with his impeccable suit did NOT demonstrate the bidet- hey- we Cdns and USns don't HAVE those at home. Luckily I had travelled before with Europeans etc and ahd an idea how this all worked! but I can imagine  the consternation of other not so well versed travellers meeting a bidet for the first time? is this for feet? What? Actually most Europeans do not complete their toilet without washing down well- whereas we wipe in North America with paper- that is it!  and many countries  not even paper.
 Ok I digress. Great room- marble everywhere good deep soaking tun and separate shower. The entire air remains somewhat true to the original building in form, fabrics, wood , finishings. There is an air of the old Home Office- or Ministry- or something- this is not your Victorian nor even Georgian hideaway but more to the later. Tasteful, everything attended to. Service- impeccable.
 Almost-we had wakeup calls as had early meetings. First day was like a harp. Second day a siren and an announcement regarding and emergency. I was about to flee pajama clad down the hallways when my room mate Business associate assured me that that was the wake up call. What?  Just because we needed three calls the day before? 
 Ok- the eSPA.  First you do not need to have a treatment nor pay a fee to use the facilities- a great rock your socks off gym and then-! the steam, sauna, thermal pool and starlight pool.  Treatments are great- all therapists are highly trained and consult first with you to personalize your treatments.  I would dearly love to return for a detox week- but!!  
 We were most fortunate to book this hotel via Expedia.ca/  I noted on my  return the Globe and Mail  did a feature article on Corinthia Hotel- specials will evaporate soon!  I did not discuss the restaurants etc- of course a 5 star has nexpresso machines etc in the rooms-- just the salient points. Each restaurant- there are two- is stand alone. BTW- best hair salon in London is associated with the spa- I left this quick conference trip looking much better than I arrived- my freind all say 'hotter'. But that- is London!",5,2012,04,28
143,Most decadently awesome spa in London,"The spa covers four floors and is what I imagine Roman Abramovich's basement looks like, which is to say its impressive. Massages were actually what one hopes for. The changing rooms have a sleep area with separate sleep pods in case the massage stressed you out too much. The wet floor with pool, vitality pool, sauna, steam room is certainly the most stylish and best London has to offer. 

Prices seem to be comparable if not a bit cheaper than other high end spas in London",5,2012,04,27
143,Everything is just perfect!,"Stayed here for 6 nights while I was in London for an Easter course.  Everything is superb -extremely comfortable bed, spacious room and very functional (Loewe TV in the room, walk-in closet, TV in the bathroom, Nespresso coffee machine).  Service is very efficient - everytime I called for service, I would get it in less than 10 mins.  Staff is polite and helpful.  The hotel is right across Embankment station, and less than 5 mins walk to Trafalgar Square / Charing Cross.  Although the area is usually packed with tourists, it's hardly noticeable once you are in the hotel.",5,2012,04,27
143,Excellent hotel for both business and leisure,Being located between Trafalgar square and Big Ben near Charing Cross station the hotel provides excellent opportunity to stay in London on different occasions. The hotel itself is very clean with spacious public areas and spacious rooms. The interiors decor is modern and looks very fresh. The staff is well trained and was very helpful. And do not forget to visit the hotel's marvellous spa.,5,2012,04,26
143,A gorgeous hotel with superb facilities and staff!,"Being 3 working mums, my girlfriends and I were looking for a luxury weekend escape, and we couldn't have chosen a better venue than the Corinthia.  The hotel has been fantastically developed and is beautiful from top to bottom.  The common areas are large and lovely to sit in with beautiful floral arrangements everywhere, the bedrooms are spacious and well furnished, and the bathrooms are well thought-out with a modern finish.  All the technology is of a modern standard, even for the smallest things like the key cards and light switch.  And the staff were extremely welcoming and friendly throughout the hotel.  
The spa was particularly impressive.  I have been to many hotels and spas globally, and can honestly say the Corinthia's spa is the best hotel spa I've ever seen.  The spa's decor is stunning and the facilities are very impressive and spacious.  In addition to the sleep pods, there are sitting areas throughout the spa, which means there is always somewhere to sit with a magazine for a quiet read.  And the changing rooms were very plush and discrete, unlike many locker rooms where it feels like you're changing right in front of everyone.  The treatment rooms themselves are very spacious and the treatments very nice.  The pool area has much to offer, including a large heated jacuzzi pool, and large sauna and steam room.  If you're someone who prefers more privacy, there are also single sex sauna and steam rooms in the male and female changing rooms.  
We did not eat in the hotel, but we did take a stroll through and were very impressed by the spaciousness and lovely decor.
I happen to work for a property investment company, so I am familiar with hotels and the requirement for attention to detail, both in the physical surroundings and service.  I am also a Londoner and aware of the Corinthia's competition.  After our lovely stay at the Corinthia, I can honestly say the Corinthia is one of the best hotels London has to offer, its only downside being it is slightly (and only slightly) away from the main tourist areas of London.  However, the hotel rooms, facilities and staff are the best I've seen for a while.  Claridge's looks tired in comparison!  My girlfriends and I have vowed to return for another getaway very soon!",5,2012,04,25
143,Our second visit.............just fab!,"This was our second stay at the hotel. It is simple the best hotel we have stayed at. If visiting London i am not sure why you would stay anywhere else as it is so close to so many great tourist attractions. 
The hotel itself is pure luxury, marble, granite and fantastic soft furnishings all the way.
The spa is, i think one of the largest in central london. Its an Espa spa, and is tranquil, relaxing and pure indulgence. The whole experience is a real must and i havent even mentioned the staff.
Friendly, professional and knowledgeable.
Cant wait to go back!",5,2012,04,22
143,Superior staff!,My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights and the entire place stunning. Walking distance to great shopping and theaters.,5,2012,04,22
143,Excellent !!,Stayed twice here for 3 weeks total and the place is fabulous.  The rooms are nicely appointed and comfortable.  Modern bathrooms.  Staff is exceptionable! Centrally located. Recommend highly....you will not be disappointed,5,2012,04,19
143,Just what you would hope for in a 5 star hotel,"I was very impressed with the Corinthia.  The room was a bit cramped, but apart from that, I couldn't really fault it.  It is comfortable, yet sophisticated and the service is impeccable.  The bathroom was really very special, as are the fitness facilities. This is a hotel London really can be proud of.",5,2012,04,19
143,Amazing Hotel,"I stayed here early April and it is definitely the most impressive hotel that I have ever set foot in.  Upon arrival we were greeted by a friendly member of staff who took us to our room and showed us around-I think this added a nice personal touch as she seemed genuinely happy to introduce us to the room.  Our room was amazing, we had a view of the London Eye and the bathroom was just out of this world.  Unfortunately whilst here for the one night we did not get a chance to make the most of the bars and restaurants at the hotel due to other plans.  The hotel is in a great location, only being a short walk from Covent Garden, and the staff make it clear that they are happy to help with anything to make your stay more enjoyable.  The next morning we ordered breakfast to our room which was delivered promptly, we had stayed for my birthday and the member of staff kindly wished me a nice day again showing interest in my plans for the day.  I would definitely stay here again, the visit really made my birthday-it's not everyday you wake up in a fantastic hotel in London! I would also recommend it to anyone as there is so much going for it. I cannot wait to go back!!",5,2012,04,16
143,What makes this so special....,"Is it the excellent location,walking distance to Buckingham Palace,Trafalgar Square,theatreland,London Eye, Covent Garden,Regent Street
Or the supremely comfortable rooms - good beds,fabulous bathrooms,walk-in wardrobes
The fact that when you arrive your room is ready and you don't have to check-out at the usual 1pm
Or is it that the staff can't do enough to make you feel welcome and cosseted which leaves you feeling that the amount of cash you've expended (this is not a cheap hotel!) feel as if this is money well-spent

Our second stay,we will be back",5,2012,04,16
143,Amazing!,"Fantastic hotel in the centre of London. Great decor, rooms were spacious and very tastefully decorated. The staff (all male, which seemed odd) were very pleasant and extremely helpful. I wouldn't stay anywhere else.",5,2012,04,16
143,Exceptional in every way,"This is an epic new luxury hotel in London, done out to the highest standard. The rooms are lovingly decorated and have the finest finishes. The facilities are excellent with an amazing spa including private treatment suites and a Daniel Galvin hair salon in house. 

It is expensive, but you get what you pay for - excellent customer service standards and a true luxury experience. The location is perfect for me also: close enough to the west end to be less than 5 minutes to Trafalgar Square and yet still off the the beaten track enough that a good night's sleep is guaranteed. Even if you don't stay, I recommend checking out the stunning oyster bar.",5,2012,04,16
143,Stunning,"This hotel is simply stunning. The lobby lounge area up just a few steps from the check-in desk is fabulous – contemporary luxe.  At the same time, the lobby is a lively area, with none of the hushed tones that you can find in some luxury hotels. The staff are professional, helpful and friendly but, thankfully, decidedly unstuffy.

We had booked an executive king room and requested a courtyard facing room. I expected just a room – but no. There was a large entry lobby off which were double doors leading to a dressing room/wardrobe area on one side, a gorgeous marble bathroom on the other, and ahead the bedroom. The whole was beautifully furnished, the bed was dressed to perfection and the bathroom came with a full complement of Espa bath products and extra towels in abundance. The walk-in shower (wet) room had a wonderful rainfall shower, and the bathtub was lovely and deep (with a TV – I didn't actually use it but it's there). I loved that you could adjust the lighting levels to suit you mood. The bed was superb – so comfortable.

We had booked a spa package which included a massage each and a bottle of champers. We were staying to celebrate our tenth wedding anniversary and had mentioned this in passing when booking. When the champagne arrived so too did a glorious 'Happy Anniversary' gateau – a very nice touch.

My husband had a meeting the day we checked in but I was able to check in at about 10.30am under the anytime check-in policy. This meant I had time to sample the spa area which is, without question, the best I have seen (and I have stayed in some very classy spa resorts in my time). The thermal area has a pool, a separate vitality pool with various massage stations, steam room and sauna. There are plenty of relaxation areas too including a sleep pod area to relax after a massage, and in the pool area some heated marble loungers which contrary to expectations were very comfortable. The flexible check-out policy meant we spent another couple of hours in the spa the following day before a leisurely check-out mid-afternoon. 

Breakfast was good and revealed for the first time how many people were staying – until that point we had seldom seen, and certainly not heard, many guests. Whilst in the room we didn't hear a thing although it seemed that the rooms either side were occupied. In fact, despite the location being a stone's throw from the Embankment and within five minutes walk of the Strand and Trafalgar Square, close to the tube and mainline station, even with the room windows open, we didn't really hear any traffic noise. For tourists wanting easy access to the sights and convenient transport the hotel is very well situated.

We are trying to think of a  reason to go back soon – probably the best hotel we have stayed in.",5,2012,04,15
143,"2nd stay, it's still excellent","Stayed at Corinthia on business last November and returned with the family this time.  This must be one of the best hotels in the world.  The design and attention to detail is first class.  My wife has sometimes impossibly high standards and she was impressed.  The lobby lounge areas are stunning, the rooms are superb.  The room I had my first stay overlooked Whitehall and had more windows and light, but we were still happy with our courtyard room this time.
The service was brilliant, the concierges really looked after us, getting tickets to the must see musical Matilda.
The Northall restaurant was very good, we ate there 3 times, going back because of the excellent fish, steaks and burger.
I have stayed at a lot of hotels, but I dont think I have stayed at any others as good as this.",5,2012,04,14
143,Fantastic!,"This is one of the finest hotels we have ever stayed in. The service staff was amazing, the rooms luxurious and the fitness center and spa were gorgeous. The location was also perfect for sightseeing: minutes from The London Eye, Trafalgar Square and Covent Garden. We made the mistake to try to stay in another hotel to experience a different area of London on the third leg of our itinerary (see my other review), we would have been 1000% happier here.",5,2012,04,12
143,A true Gem,"This a very beautifully decorated hotel with eagle eye attention to detail. The designers of this hotel have laid the gauntlet down for others to match.

The room was well proportioned with thought of an international traveler in mind. The luxurious use of fabrics and metals, thick pile carpeting... One does not want to leave the room.

The restaurants were excellent and the service was not stuffy and the staff pleasant to deal with. 

I felt this was well worth the money spent which is a rarity in London",5,2012,04,11
143,"Excellent hotel, really enjoyed our time here.","Great hotel in a great location. Its not cheap, but look out for their special offers. Book it, you won't regret it.",5,2012,04,09
143,Fabulous Hotel,"I think I may have found my new favourite in London.
Beautiful decor, rooms are amazing, spacious and with everything you could absolutely need right down to the waterproof remote control for the flat screen in the bath!!
Turn down service was excellent, staff throughout were very smart, courteous and helpful.
Business service facilities were very good.
Location could not be better, tucked away but within walking distance of all main areas and just across from my favourite part of London the South bank!
But the icing on the cake has to be the thermal spa, the perfect place to recover on a Sunday morning. The heated beds in front of the fire, the largest jacuzzi I have experienced, a beautifully warm pool, a great steam room and the best sauna with showers and ice. I could have stayed here all day.
The prices are very fair for what you get and I will definitely be returning very soon and taking advantage of the 24 hour check in/out which is a huge bonus in London...",5,2012,04,06
143,"Best hotel in London, hands down","I have been going to London for over 30 years and this hotel is my favorite. Having stayed at the Gorham, Lanesborough, Ritz and many others, none compare to the sheer beauty of the building and design. Great location and very attentive staff.",5,2012,04,06
143,Modern,"A very modern looking hotel.  Beautiful interiors.  The rooms are a treat to retire in if you love the dark .  I love the fact that the room is actually pitch black when you close all the curtains (something not all hotel black-out curtains do very well).  The little chocolate treats at night are a nice touch.
I did order a burger the night I arrived - the burger was cooked to perfection however the meat had a gamey taste.  Something not everyone enjoys, but it was good.
Buffet Breakfast at the Northall was my favorite part of my stay.  The selection was excellent!  And there is something about their butter that is deliciously sinful!  (reminds me of the butter in Switzerland).  They were also kind enough to make me a decaf Cafe Mocha every morning (I was told recently that that is something you find only in America ).  
Had Tea in the lobby.  Comfortable.  Nice place to find a spot and read if it isn't full.  And the tea is quite good too.
Convenient location.
Definitely well rested in this hotel!",5,2012,04,05
143,Afternoon Tea at the Lobby Lounge,"On Saturday afternoon we went for afternoon tea at the Lobby Lounge in the Corinthia Hotel. We arrived and there was no one to great you, so were ignored for a short while before being shown to our seats. The decor inside lovely and the environment is relaxed, but not too quiet.

We had the champagne afternoon tea which was champagne followed by the tea and cakes. I had a second glass of champagne, which I was charged for, I should have expected this, but it wasn't obvious on the menu. The extra glass was £12.

The sandwiches were very nice, 5 different varities and complementary extras if you required. The tea was nice, though it was served well in advance of the scones and cakes. The food again was delicious and we really enjoyed the originality of the cakes. Its not clear on the website, but you get 2 scomes each and a selection of 8 cakes and we ended up halving each one in order to try them all!

Overall it was a very good experience. The service was alright, though they were continously having to apologies for things being late. Most of the staff stand around not doing anything, but our waitress, Alexandra, was excellent and tried to serve us as best she could.

We had a lovely 2 hours and the bill came to £120 for the two of us. I think we would return, but would try somewhere else first.",4,2012,04,04
143,A Fabulous Treat!,"Stayed here for my birthday and it was wonderful! The staff were excellent and even prepared a birthday cake and card for me. The room (upgraded to a junior suite) was one of the best I've stayed in. Great location for theatres (reason for our visit) and restaurants. We ate in late in their restaurant that night, food was excellent. Great night's sleep and great breakfast the next day. Would highly reccommend!",4,2012,04,03
143,beautiful hotel,This hotel is a wonderful and beautiful hotel in a amazing location. I love this hotel and will definitely be coming here again.,5,2012,04,02
143,"Great hotel, amazing spa, will be back","We spent Saturday night at this amazing hotel and had a truly memorable stay. We were attending a birthday party at the Savoy but wanted a little privacy so did not stay there with the other party guests.

The spa was amazing. I had done a 20 mile run that morning and was feeling the effects. 2 hours in the spa and I felt like a new man. 

Nearly everything was perfect. The room and bathroom were spacious, light, airy and very luxurious and afternoon tea was lovely.

Overall service was excellent and we were made to feel very comfortable. Unfortunately we had 2 experiences of less than perfect service (surly rather than out and out rude ) but when I raised this the response was very professional. Although it was late I received a call back from the duty manager who was very apologetic and offered us complimentary breakfast. The next day I also received a hand written note of apology.To be honest if the rest of the service had not been so good I probably would have just let it pass but I wanted to mention it as the majority staff seem to take such pride in service levels I did not think it was fair that 2 individuals negatively affect their reputation. In particular the lady that checked me in was professional, friendly and charming (I am sorry that I can’t remember her name) 

 I mention the issues with service now as I think the way it was dealt with marks this hotel out as truly exceptional.

I am running the London marathon this year and think I am going to book here for the night as I can’t think of a better place to recover.",5,2012,04,02
143,Perfect in every respect...,"I've stayed at the Corinthia twice since the beginning of the year and was incredibly impressed on both occasions. The hotel itself is spectacular in terms of decor, the staff extremely friendly and approachable, the food and service at Massimo outstanding and the art deco cocktail bar excellent. The Espa spa floor is amazing, but only got to use the thermal level facilities. I'd stay nowhere else in London if I could!

One point I'd raise is that we found the room on the lower floors of the hotel facing Northumberland Avenue rather noisy with night buses idling outside - however on complaining to reception we were moved swiftly to an internal courtyard facing room which I'd wholeheartedly recommend (as well as the cakes and pastries in the afternoon tea in the lobby lounge which far excels anything on offer at the Ritz or Savoy).",5,2012,04,01
143,EXCEPTIONAL,"I have stayed in many incredible hotels... and this is by far the best hotel in any city I have ever stayed at. The quality of every furnishing in the rooms- from the light switches, the phone, to the bathroom, the bedding, & carpeting- the quality is incredible. They checked us in when we arrived from an international flight at 8am... the most amazing service you can imagine when you just want to put your head down. The hotel is quiet, the room had a ton of closet space and a huge table to put our stuff down.The spa is the nicest I have ever seen with my eyes. I cannot wait for our next visit to London, so that we can experience the Corinthia service again.",5,2012,03,30
143,Superb,"I took my husband to the Corinthia for his birthday last Saturday 24th March. The hotel was stunning and because it was my husband's birthday they gave us a room upgrade to a fabulous room with a balcony overlooking the inner courtyard which was so peaceful. Everything about this hotel is superb from the moment the staff greet you to the moment you check out. We didn't want to leave and will certainly return as soon as we can.
If you are looking for a recommendation before you book then don't hesitate - you will not find a better hotel in London - I stayed at the Savoy with my mother last year and on balance I think this was a much nicer hotel with friendlier staff.",5,2012,03,30
143,SIMPLY FLAWLESS -  BRAVO,"I stayed at The Corinthia some 5 months ago and wrote a review then.  During that visit, not everything was as it ought to have been for a 5 star property - there was room for improvement.  Upon my recent return, I found that everything worked like clock work.  It was truly flawless.
 
Service was exceptional at all levels in the restaurants, bar and reception.  It was clearly obvious that all the staff had made a real effort to improve on the areas where I had commented upon in my earlier review and now there was a perfect understanding of a guests' needs and more importantly anticipating it before one had to ask.
 
Special mention must go to the staff in the breakfast room who made such an improvement from my last visit.  They really behaved like true professionals in their field surpassing my expectations of service standards. Their recollection of my preferences from my previous visit simply floored me.  There was no necessity to remind them of what I wanted for breakfast during my weeks' stay, they politely checked if my preferences were the same each day.
 
The staff have managed so well to pull off what The Four Seasons and The Mandarin Oriental Hotels are so renowned for - guest recognition - this time without exception they all had it nailed down.
 
As on my first visit, Domenico and his staff at the Bassoon Bar were just simply fantastic, making me feel at ease and relaxed upon my return after hectic days at the office.  The Managers Michelangelo, Maud and Renaud were ever so gracious and always checking to ensure that all was in order.  Special mention also to Head Concierge Daren who obtained a ticket for War Horse, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  The Concierge team was fantastic and did not bat an eyelid to my ever demanding and constant requests.  -  Thank you.
 
One other noticeable change, perhaps since I recognize them now; is that there was always a clear visibility of Management at all times, whether one was in the restaurant or public spaces; unobtrusive though but keeping a watchful eye over service standards.
 
Bravo for the improvements and exceptional attention to detail and service.",5,2012,03,30
143,5 Star +,"As a professional working  in the film industry, I was inclined to stay at this hotel as it seems all the A List stars and movie producers have made the Corinthia their home in London. I can see why, the hotel is spectacular.  

Excellent location just  a 5  minute walk to Trafalgar square.  Modern gadgets are in abundance, I particularly fell in love with the intelligent lighting in my room and best of all, the walk-in wardrobe, a paradise for the ladies with full size mirrors and plenty of closet space. 
An abundance of TV channels and state of the art bathroom (especially the shower) places this hotel amongst the best for accommodation in central London.
The public areas are very pleasant with plenty of natural light.  High Tea is popular and a good excuse to treat your loved ones or business associate. 

The hotel is brand new. It’s clearly evident that the owners did not cut corners. I was given a tour of the SPA, which is just incredible and only wished I had the time to chill out.  I only stayed  for 2 nights (19-21st March) and sad I didn’t have more time to indulge in the delights of this wonderful property.",5,2012,03,27
143,A Real 5-Star Hotel,"Upon arrival, we were welcomed back, even though we'd only enjoyed their wonderful high tea last July. We were escorted to our beautiful room--a room so beautiful that we felt like it was a vacation in itself. We arrived with rather bad jetlag so we immediately crawled into bed. We were never disturbed with outside noise or any noise from the hallway. Our room was quiet, very quiet, our entire stay. The bathroom was also magnificent and HUGE; including a “rain” shower, a bathtub big enough for two, a heated floor, and separate sinks. The hotel appeared to have painstakingly pursued every detail imaginable. But, with all the attention to detail, the staff was as warm and friendly as any we've ever encountered. We spoiled ourselves with incredible in-room dining (three times, I believe). The location was also perfect for our exploration of London (for instance, walking distance to Her Majesty's Theatre). I can't imagine a better location, actually. OK...I've reached the conclusion this might indeed be the finest hotel that we've experienced in all our travels! (Oh, and don't miss high tea during your stay!)",5,2012,03,26
143,Beautiful near perfect London hotel,"This hotel is in a perfect location, across the street from Embankment tube station, and which has a pedestrian bridge to cross the Thames where you will be at the foot of the Eye... The Corinthia was a 2 minute walk to Trafalgar square, and literally within 10 minutes walk to almost every theatre in the West End!!!!  
The beauty of this hotel is in the all the fine details... The common areas are stunning, and the restaurants are incredibly beautiful. We ate breakfast daily in Northhall. Our room package included a British breakfast. The food was great however we ordered our eggs as the scramble they serve are a little too liquid for our taste.... The rooms- we had A King Superior our first 2 nights which was very nicely appointed.. Although views are the not the strong point if this property, the room itself makes up for it. The bedroom area is wonderfully appointed with Harrods brand refreshments, wonderful plates and glasses to use and a Nespresso Espresso machine. The bathroom is a delight with a large bathtub, an amazing shower, and nice vanity area...the only drawback is the limited sized closet.... Don't expect to put a weeks worth of clothing in there....
On our third day we experienced a horrible sewer smell.. Engineering was sent and they thought they repaired the problem but an hour later when we returned to the room, the smell was even worse. The front desk manager promised to move us to another room.... My Partner and I packed and waited.... I called again and was told the keys would be right up... 40 minutes later I went to the front desk to move ourselves... The manager could not have been more polite and apologetic for the delay... He immediately made keys and got a bellman cart himself to assist us with our move... He even upgraded us to a beautiful Riverview Suite- which was the most beautiful set I have ever stayed in Europe.  This was a nice way to end our stay and a wonderful example of the great service provided by the staff of this property.
The ESPA spa is very nice and the hydrotherapy wet area and sauna were perfect after long days of walking in the beautiful West End...",5,2012,03,26
143,A revisit,"I stayed at the Corinthia this summer and wrote a review saying it would be fantastic......when it was finished. I urged readers to wait a few months whilst the hotel worked out the kinks and I gave the hotel an average rating.
Last week I returned and all I can say is,"" Wow!"" 
Eight months later the hotel is running flawlessly.
Of course the location was and is still perfect but now the hotel shines and hums.
Afternoon tea is not to be missed. The scones are amazing.
It is time for the five star review.
I can't wait until my next stay!",5,2012,03,26
143,Beautiful hotel with amazing service,"I stayed at the Corinthia for three nights during a business trip and REALLY liked this hotel.  I've stayed at a number of other luxury 5-star properties in London and this is by far my favorite.  The rooms are beautiful and well appointed and the spa is just amazing.  More importantly, the service is outstanding and it feels like everyone really cares and is genuinely concerned about making sure you are enjoying your visit.  Highly recommend staying here.",5,2012,03,24
143,A true luxury hotel,"I stayed at the Corinthia Hotel London for 9 days in March 2012 and would not hesitate to recommend it.

The hotel's location is fantastic for business or leisure - 1 minute walk to Horse Guards, Trafalgar Square, Charring Cross Station.  5 minutes walk into Covent Garden.  5 minutes walk to Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, etc. 10 minute walk to Picadilly Circus and Regent Street shopping.

The hotel's facilities were faultless.  My room (an Executive Room) was very spacious and sophisticated.  The bathroom was wonderful, with a deep batha and a large seperate rainfall shower with excellent water pressure.

Staying for 9 days, I had occasion to enjoy the various dining offerings.  All were exceptional.  I particularly liked a quiet drink or two in the fabulous little art deco Basoon Bar.  The service there exceeded expectations.

All of the service staff were well-trained and most courteous.

The hotel is not cheap, but you certainly get what you pay for.  I will be returning next time I'm in London.",5,2012,03,21
143,Great new hotel and 24 hour check in / out policy is fantastic,"I stayed for a weekend at Corinthia and it was wonderful. The hotel is relatively new so it's all shiny and pretty and most things work seamlessly. Lots of pretty flowers and friendly staff. Location is central and good for trafalgar, west end theatres, westminster, buckingham palace, etc

Rooms are large and bathrooms even larger. My room 138 was decent sized for me however it's part of a annexe for a larger suite room I'm guessing. They link two rooms up to make a suite. So there was only a tiny window in my room facing Northumberland Avenue.

The room was large and had space for arm chairs, writing desk and the mini bar and coffee machine area is decent size too.They provide lovely Espa toiletries in the bedrooms that are wonderful to use especially the Espa bath salts. Bathtubs are deep and long and very comfortable for those who like a long soak. They are comparable to the Savoy and Dorch or Berkeley for it's size.

You get Nespresso machines and tea making facilities in room. The media hub didn't work well for me as I couldn't get the connectivity to my phone working. Their IT help staff came to my room and tried for 30 mins and it still didn't work. Free wifi however so that is brilliant.

The rain shower in my bathroom didn't work but they sorted that out when I was out for dinner. Nespresso machine wasn't working when I used it in the evening and again they sorted that out in 30 mins for me with a replacement Nespresso machine. I would recommend that they have some sort of quality check that they perform on rooms before releasing it to the customer. Savoy and Connaught have this system in place. I've never had to report a technical or a broken fixture issue in those hotels before after check-in.

Sunday lunch at Northall was lovely although the weather played up so the view wasn't as nice. Service was attentive without being intrusive. Food was good.

Afternoon tea was passable and the only part of the stay that was a let down. This was due to a couple of things. One is the quality of the serving staff, as I was served by someone who was clearly being trained and couldn't remember the names of the items on the tea menu. She was desperately trying to recall them to present them to me and was giggling away like a school girl when she couldn't. I took pity on her and told her to skip that part. She didn't take my order correctly and I asked for advice on teas and both her and another colleague was vague and clueless about the offerings. Cakes which looked very beautiful on display was not again not fantastic. The tea is served in a lounge that is open with high ceilings which means your tea gets cold very quickly as they don't use silverware for serving it like in Claridges or Browns or Connaught and instead use crockery teapots. There are loads of places within in a 10 minutes walking distance that serve better afternoon tea e.g. Berkeley, Athenaeum, Stafford, etc. Those places I named also have even better atmosphere. I certainly wouldn't be recommending people to just come for afternoon tea here unless they were guests at the hotel itself or you couldn't get into the other locations.

I was there for 1.5 hours and had to request my tea changed 3 times and this was in January when it wasn't too cold, so I can imagine in summer and the central air-conditioning is on how that will affect the tea serving. My suggestion would be to consider using silver teapots or have some posh tea cosies done up to put over the pot to keep it warm longer.

When you sit on the side of the lounge, near the view of the inner courtyard, there are pillars that obstruct the view of the serving staff who are standing around in the middle. I had to get up twice to get the attention of the serving staff as they couldn't see around the pillars. Maybe the staff should be instructed to check on the tables along the windows by the innter courtyard on a regular interval basis. 

Espa spa facilities are really impressive in terms of the jacuzzi/hot tub area as they have individual water jet massage stations. The large sauna was brilliant as the loungers near the fire places. The steam room was well designed with little alcoves that sit about two persons each so if you were there with a friend or your partner it gave you some privacy so you didnt have to look at strangeers directly. I tried one massage which was very nice. As a hotel guest, access to the spa is complimentary which is great as if you went to use just the spa facilities it can cost £95 alone with no treatments.

The crowning point for this hotel is that it offers this flexible 24 hour check in/ out policy which means you are not bound by the traditional check-in at 2/3pm and out by 11/12pm next day. You really can relax and still plan your day of arrival and departure knowing you don't have to rush or abide by certain hours. Hopefully they won't be changing this policy as they get more popular.

This is not a cheap hotel but then they do provide value due to the facilities and amenities provided complimentary e.g. spa facilities, nespresso machines, free wifi, large rooms and bathrooms, complementary turn down chocs and water etc.This is on top of the great service and responsiveness of staff to resolving problems, large comfortable beds and large room sizes. For the same rates many of the 5 star offerings in the same area would be for less amenities and definitely smaller rooms. I would not hesitate to recommend to my family and friends or colleagues visiting for the Olympics to make Corinthai their base for the weeks. I shall be back too myself.",5,2012,03,20
143,"Expensive, but entirely worth it.","Yes, it costs the earth, but unlike a lot of properties in London where it's painfully obvious you're being overcharged for a ""name"", I didn't feel like I had, in any way, underpaid for this experience. 
The spa, if you're into spas, must not be missed - I've never seen anything like it, even in the Wynn Las Vegas - and guests get the run of the Thermal Floor for free. It's the first ""masculine"" designed spa I've seen - Architectural Digest level design. 
The Northall restaurant is really beautiful and tasty - giant portions, so be warned. (they will let you take dessert up to your room for later.) Room Service appears to have the same menu and prices as the restaurant, which is unusual and a nice touch. 
The most startling thing about the hotel is how quiet it is. I went for a ""rest"" and got it - could barely hear a thing going on outside, and couldn't hear any other guests. 
The property itself is enormous and spectacular. 
For the first time in London, I couldn't wait to get back to my hotel. Usually it is the other way around. Well done.",5,2012,03,20
143,"One of the best hotels, not only in London but Anywhere!","During my first visit not everything was as it should be for a hotel of this standard. However the true mark of a great company and great management is how they react to such things.

Well the Corinthia's management in the form of Mr Mathew Dixon the General Manager could not have been more gracious in his dealings and resolve of our issues.

Since then myself and my guests have stayed at the hotel and visited the bars, restaurants and spa on several memorable occasions. 

As the CEO of two companies, one dealing in hospitality consultancy and a media company dealing in tourist and travel websites I am used to continually staying at different hotels or a regular basis, however at the Corinthia I feel I have found my home away from home in London. 

One of the best hotels, not only in London but Anywhere!",4,2012,03,19
143,Understated Opulence,"My mom and I spent a girly week at the Corinthia and have not stopped talking about it since.  The public areas are breathtakingly beautiful, yet contemporary.  Our room (an executive twin) was supremely comfortable with plenty of space to move around in and two double beds.
We ate in Northall (where the lunch menu is a steal), Massimo, the Lobby Lounge and  had drinks in Bassoon, and service throughout the hotel was friendly without being overly formal.
Room service arrives exactly on time and still warm, a feat for even much smaller hotels to pull off.  Food throughout is very good, with the best assortment of breads I've ever had.  Also, afternoon tea is not to be missed, nor is the blueberry eclair.
Of course, there were some minor issues, like a lack of wardrobe space for a week's worth of clothes, not enough English speaking TV channels (or DVD player) and in my humble opinion, Bassoon should really provide a food menu as well as a cocktail one, because, although their snacks are yummy, I would have loved to have a meal in there as well.  But these complaints are only because everything else was so thoughtfully done, and I mean everything else, including the easiest check in and out I have ever experienced.
Location wise, it's terrific for the theatre, and in walking distance to Piccadilly.  Taxis are plentiful in the area though, so it's not inconvenient to get where you need to go.  Although, once you arrive at the hotel, you may not want to leave.  
We've stayed in several 5 star properties in both London and New York, and The Corinthia puts all the others to shame, both in appearance and attitude.  
Price wise, it is expensive.  Very expensive.  We booked a fantastic deal through American Express, but going forward, we've decided to compromise on our length of stay to enjoy the level of luxury the hotel and its restaurants provide.",5,2012,03,19
143,lovely new hotel  with fabulous spa but expensive !,"Lovely hotel everything is very clean and new,but you are charged for every little extra 
eg..I had a very good hair wash and blow dry but when came to pay the £41 I HAD BE QUOTED had gone up to £65 plus vat and a cup of tea that i had been asked if i wanted was £5 plus vat!!! Also asked for some complimentary water in room and was £4.50 PER BOTTLE..........EVEN SPA TREATMENTS HAVE VAT ADDED ON AT END THIS IS NOT NORMAL....SHOULD BE INCLUSIVE PRICE.....
Also we went for breakfast and waited 15 minutes and where never served!!walked out great italian greasy spoon around the corner had scrambled egg and smoked salmon for the price of a cup of tea at corinthia........but it is a lovely hotel so if money no option  go for it!!
One other complaint when go to spa from room in dressing gown had to walk across foyer...slightly embarassing..later found was another lift,,should have been told.",4,2012,03,19
143,Quite special but a little room for perfection,"Had a birthday weekend + Dinner plus drinks for 20 guests. Overall it was great restaurant staff were attentive but not necessarily responsive and forgot we had asked for drinks twice. They could also have replenished drinks quicker. They had been advised to inform when tabs hit particular levels but chose to ignore that. 

All that said the surroundings and ambience of the Northall are not easily parallel led in London as the unique building has been matched with silatly tasteful interior decor. 

Very classy and tasteful with value to be found if sought for. ",5,2012,03,18
143,"Outstanding Hotel, worth every penny","My wife and I stayed here for our anniversary weekend as a treat, but what a treat it was. The dinner, bed and breakfast package was great value and the food and service were outstanding. We had breakfast in the room, all served for us, and were upgraded to an Executive room which was large and lavish. All the details were there, this place is simply amazing. We felt like royalty.
A big thanks must go to Isobel Marcilla the Guest Relations Manager - she did an overwhelming job for us, and helped make it so special.
The ESPA was fantastic, so well designed and atmospheric. If you want to stay somewhere special in London, then don't look further.",5,2012,03,13
143,Fantastic hotel,"I love everything about Corinthia. Very nice and helpful staff, well- equipped rooms, beautiful building, the best breakfast in London served in a stunning space, two amazing restaurants, and great spa. The place to stay in London at the moment. A head above the competition.",5,2012,03,12
143,Real luxury and grandeur,"Pleasantly surprised by our stay here. We booked a 'top secret' lastminute deal and I hadn't heard of the hotel before. Communal areas are very elegant. Wonderful afternoon tea and dinner. Rooms not huge (even with upgrades) but well appointed. 

Staff helpful. Well located although not in the Mayfair hotspot. Very expensive to stay here but some of the deals on their website are v attractive eg the low season dinner bed and breakfast option. 

Would definitely stay here again. 
",4,2012,03,09
143,Exceeded our highest expectations,"Clearly when you spend well over £200 for a room you expect it to be good and there are quite a few in this high-end 5 star category in London. After reading the other reviews on here I knew the Corinthia was going to be good but for an all-important anniversary weekend it had to be awesome. It was. The staff were the most polite and attentive I have ever encountered (this can be unnerving at first but you get used to it!), you have use of the incredible Espa Spa under the hotel and, because we had a room facing the courtyard, one of the quietest hotel rooms I have stayed in. We were upgraded to an Executive Room and had chocolates and fruit in the room. The room was spotless and had every luxury you could reasonably ask for, the bed was very comfortable and the Loewe LED TV was exactly what you'd expect. The real bonus is that you can check-in and out whenever you like and really allowed us to make the most of the hotel and its central location.",5,2012,03,08
143,A fantastic hotel - Simply amazing,"I stay in 50 - 60 different hotels a year and this is the best hotel I've booked for several years. 

The service is superb, staff are well trained and extremely professional and the rooms are clean, new and fit for purpose. The decor was quite ""business like"", even ""Hilton-esk"" (sorry) and my personal preference is an edgy, boutique style hotel. However, this hotel is perfect, it's even luxurious, just a fraction clinical. 

Overall, I'd give it 9.5 / 10 -- The cooked breakfast was the best I've ever tasted,room service at 2am was like lightening and the food wasn't too bad. The bed was amazingly comfortable and I even looked at who supplied their mattresses so I could get one.

If you're unsure about where to stay, I'd stay here, it's a safe bet and you'll leave delighted.",5,2012,03,03
143,Great experience...,"I have experienced great customer service, excellent team in place and outstanding service from the Hotel's team, without exception.

I have worked with numerous venues because of my work, and can proudly say: never experienced such a great support, so efficiently then working with Corinthia.

Thank you.",5,2012,02,28
143,DO NOT STAY ANYWHERE ELSE!!,"""Wow"" is the only word to easily sum up this hotel! The location, service, and design are truly top notch. Add that to the room size, staff and quality of the decor both in the rooms and the lobby/restaurant areas easily make this hotel the best in London! You must visit the Spa to believe it..probably the best spa in the world!  From someone who has virtually lived in hotels in the past, I felt spoiled and hated to leave this hotel. The word is out on this hotel, go see this place to believe it!",5,2012,02,27
143,Perfect Luxury Hotel in a perfect location!,"We had a really pleasant stay at the Corinthia London. Our room was very generous, and the Spa was excellent. The design of this hotel is truly excellent. The only objectionable thing was the service at breakfast, which was a bit planless and not very professional for an international 5-Star Hotel! Therefor the service at the front-desk and the concierge was very helpful and obliging, as like as the housekeeping team!
It's the perfect hotel for a London City trip, because no other hotel is located in such a perfect location for city breaks as like as business trips! We will stay at the Corinthia, whenever we are going to London!",5,2012,02,24
143,Excellent High Tea,"This is just a review of the High Tea (called Afternoon Tea). Visiting London, we asked our daughter, a resident, to try to find a High Tea. She drew a blank for most of the traditional venues (the days available were limited: it was a Sunday afternoon), but hit upon the Corinthia. Well, it was superb! The tea choice alone seemed never-ending, including some Chinese teas of the rather less common sort. The sandwiches were delightful, but the cakes were divine. And we were offered (free) seconds of anything we wished. Champagne was extra -- a bit steep at 10 pounds, I thought, but the price for the tea was 35 pounds a head. The price and the quality compare more than favourably with some other places which are perhaps resting on their laurels. Staff was most attentive and the tea sommelière (hardly a théière!) very knowledgeable.",5,2012,02,24
143,WOW without a doubt the best hotel in London,"I have just returned from staying at the hotel for the weekend and i cannot describe how brilliant and wonderful this place is. The checkin is so easy, your luggage is waiting at your room with the bellboy. Everything just works in this hotel and i cant think of a single fault.
We had a standard double room and it was spacious and extremely well furnished. The bathroom was amazing and we loved the TV at the end of the large tub.
The turndown service is nice, after going for a meal we came back and the room was all made up with some delicious chocolates and a bottle of water beside the bed.

The staff are amazing, truly amazing.

I had a treatment at the ESPA spa, it was magical, i had a one hour personal massage and then spent some time in the sauna, afterwards i was the most relaxed i have been in months. 
My fiance enjoyed the fact that rhianna was staying at the hotel and the papparazi whre all outside, this added a but of excitment to our trip!

If you are thinking of staying in London i cannot think of a better place to be.",5,2012,02,21
143,Luxurious Incredible Hotel!,"WOW! From friendly staff to over-the-top fabulous fresh flowers (changed every day) this hotel is fabulous! The lounge area is so peaceful and stylish you won't want to leave! Our room was fantastic and good value for central London - a separate bedroom, changing room and bathroom. The bathroom was amazing with a TV in the bath, separate shower room and separate WC. The spa is huge and very impressive. 

With the location being only 5min walk from Embankment tube it's location is also perfect. I can't wait to go back!",5,2012,02,20
143,A seriously good hotel!,Amazing meal here Saturday and everything about the place spoke class and service. Can't comment about the price of accommodation but it all looked high quality and well thought out. London needs more hotels like this!,5,2012,02,20
143,Over the top experience -- you'll love it,"The rooms are lovely with warm tones and wood and marble, as everyone has said. The painting next to my bed was so lovely I'd like it hanging in my own living room! Also, the shower has a rain head which produces an incredible downpour (this is a positive). The toilet room is separate and all the bath and body products are great. I didn't get to take a bath but the tub looked wonderful and had a window looking out over the interior courtyard. The very spacious closet also had a window. The bed was plenty comfortable.

I ordered room service which came promptly and was delicious. Breakfast came with my room so I ate downstairs twice. The food is tasty and fresh and abundant.

And then there's the spa. The heated, marble loungers next to the gas fireplace were simply amazing. And the vast hot pool on the other side also wonderful. Everything is immaculate and relaxing. The gym is kind of dark and you do feel as if you're in the basement but it's perfectly adequate.

The lobby is beautiful with enormous, dramatic arrangements of fresh flowers and attentive staff.

Make sure you try to stay at this hotel while you're in London. It's over-the-top fabulous.",5,2012,02,18
143,One of the great hotels in London...and maybe anywhere,"I spent two nights at the Corinthia in January, and it's perhaps one of the greatest hotels in the city.   The hotel is newer - perhaps a year old since opening - and it shows.   It is very tastefully done, very classic, fresh, and inviting.  The staff is welcoming and attentive without being too intrusive.  I believe I had a fairly standard room with a small balcony facing the interior courtyard, and it was among the most comfortable rooms I have stayed in.   The room was large by London standards, perhaps slightly bigger than most in the US, with the now usual flat screen TV, the bed was comfy, and the bathroom was amazing.  The shower has both a 'rain' feature from the ceiling as well as the normal showerhead, plus there was a full tub.    My only regret was that due to work I couldn't spend more time in the hotel and try out the spa.   If you are up for a splurge in London, look no further than the Corinthia.",5,2012,02,15
143,Absolutely amazing,"I booked a single night at the Corinthia for my wife's birthday and I'm so happy I did. Absolutely 100% the best hotel I have ever stayed at in London by a country mile.

I don't tend to write reviews for hotels when I stay a single night as I think it is difficult to judge something over such a short time, especially considering my overnight stays are usually just somewhere to sleep, but we both didn't want to leave the Corinthia and it completely deserves a glowing review!

I contacted the reservations department prior to our trip to advise them it was my wife's birthday and I wanted to have some flowers and champagne in the room on arrival and also arrange some spa treatments for her. This was handled very professionally and with minimal fuss over email as the spa, the florist and the reservations department all contacted me and confirmed my requests.

When we arrived the porter took our bags with a smile and we checked in with no fuss. We were escorted to our room, which was ready for us and on arrival given a brief overview of the safety deposit box etc. Soon after arriving our bags arrived. The room was stunning. A real treat with fluffy thick feeling carpets, woods and marble in the bathroom with all modern comms that you would expect (Great shower and bath). The flowers and champagne I had ordered were beautifully arranged and they had even provided a little cake and a card wishing my wife a happy birthday! A nice touch.

After going to the theatre in the evening, we decided to stop in the Bassoon bar for a few cocktails. The waitress was very attentive and although she got my 1st order wrong (she misheard me and bought the wrong beer for our 1st round), it really wasn't an issue as we had table service and my wife loved the bubblegum cocktails. Very funky/cool place with a nice vibe.

The bed was really comfortable to sleep in and we had a nice lay in on Sunday. The other amazing thing about this hotel... 24 hour check in/out. We slept in quite late on the Sunday as we got back late, but there was no rush to be out the hotel by 11 or 12 as with every other hotel. When we checked in they asked what time we would approximately be checking out and as we had a day in the spa planned we didn't want to leave until around 6 or 7pm. This was no problem at all and it was so nice being able to get up when we wanted and have a base for the day we were leaving!

My wife had 2 hours in the spa having a facial and a massage and she described it as one of the best she has ever had (and she has quite a few). She said the attention to detail and advice offered during the whole treatment was really good. Whilst my wife was in the the spa I decided to go for a run and concierge was very helpful in providing me with a jogging route up down past Buckingham Palace and around the Serpentine in Hyde Park. I then joined my wife and we relaxed in the hot pool and sauna, before grabbing some freshly squeezed juices from the spa lounge. After an hour or so we could wander back to our room where we got ready to check out, but took our time and didn't feel rushed thanks to the fact we could check out whenever!

This hotel is simply amazing and the little touches are what make all the difference. The fact every time we walked into the reception, the staff addressed us by name (I'm assuming they have some machine that picks up something from our key card and displays it on the computer...either that or they have Rainman like abilities for remembering a face!) The flowers were wrapped so we could take them home and nothing seemed too much trouble. The doormen all helping with our cases. The hotel feels very grand and oozes luxury with the think carpets, clean glass and fresh smells from the wooden floors etc.

The location of the hotel is also great for visiting the sights on London just down the road from Trafalgar Square and Buckingham Palace etc.

I'm running the marathon in April and this will hopefully be the hotel I stay at. We loved everything about it and can't wait to be back and I can't recommend this hotel enough.

Thanks to everyone at the Corinthia for a perfect weekend.",5,2012,02,13
143,Excellent in most but be aware!,"Just finished a really extraordinary stay over the weekend at the Corinthia. I have stayed in many 5 Star hotels but this is truly one of the best!
Having said that there was a VERY unpleasant surprise on checking out. The hotel charged me 140 Pounds!!!! for 2 telephone calls!
There is absolutely NO justification asking so much money - it is to say the least, daylight robbery!
Even though one call was international, the other call was local and I can not see how you can charge 70 Pounds for a local call!
The reception for mobile phones is very bad, and known to the Hotel. There is also no information in the Room on how much the Hotel charges for Phone calls! Having had to make a call regarding a Cruise reservation, I had no option, but to use the Hotel Phone. I would very much like to have an explanation from the Hotel, on what basis they can justify such outrageous prices.
When mentioning this to the staff at reception, even they were shocked and the clerk attending me even said that though he has worked in many 5 star Hotels, he has never seen something like this!
I will certainly be taking this to the UK Consumer Watchdog.
Again, the Hotel is certainly worth its classification and the service and food is impeccable, but it certainly does not justify ripping you off this way.",5,2012,02,13
143,Amazing!,"This hotel is amazing, a true five star. Staff and service is beyond efficient and the facilites are immense, such as the ESPA. In room breakfast is perfect, try and book an offer where this and the spa access is included and you get a late check out. Can be half the price of a normal room.",5,2012,02,09
143,Beautiful Hotel!,"Everything about this hotel exceeded my expectation. The location is ideal, the rooms were fantastic, the food was great and the service was steller. I'm just not sure what I could add to this review that hasn't already been said by so many others. I would definitely go back again.",5,2012,02,09
143,"OMG Discover the best 'Palace"" hotel London has to offer","The Staff at the Corinthia give this the most flawlessy beautifull hotel the magic ingredient. That's the charming Italian lady in the stunningly apointed bar that is actually pary of the longest Piano I have ever seen and the again utterly charming Spanish lady who served us a ( I must apologise extended) lunch in the majestic and magnificent restaurant Massimo - which is worth a visit on it own.

For my Birthday we visited London for a few days, I was treated to Lunch at Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester But overwhelmly the highlight of my stay was discovering the esquite interiors or the Corinthia. They are Fautless and cleverly have an contemporary and artistic twist. I did not realise the building was built as a Hotel and called the Grand before being taken over by a govenrment minstry during the war years. I would suggest its now easily one Londons finest.",5,2012,02,07
143,Great experience,"Great hotel. 

I had a great stay, nice room, perfect service, good lobby bar and a great breakfast. 

I would definetelly stay there in an another opportunity.",5,2012,02,06
143,WOW,"We stayed here for one night and it wasn't enough! The hotel is superb, contemporary but not minimalist. The room was lovely and well equiped. The lighting in the bathroom was great as generally I find there is insufficient light for applying make-up. Breakfast was great and the spa is out of this world.  I've seen lots of 5 star spas, but this is amazing!  The staff were all lovely and the service was without fault. Finally, the 24 hour check-in is an innovative idea and is so convenient. We'll definately be back on our next trip to London.",5,2012,01,31
143,spankingly new and luxurious,We lounged in the spa all day and recovered from the jet lag before beginning a busy week i London.,5,2012,01,30
143,What a great hotel!  Best hotel shower ever.,"I had an absolutely terrific stay at the Corinthia from start to finish.  Here's what I loved:
- My room (430) had great style, was very spacious, and a fantastic bathroom with the best hotel shower I've ever enjoyed. It is a rainforest shower head that is built into the ceiling.  Delightful.
- Perfect for business travelers:  they have a wall of plugs that include 110v so that you don't need to bring an adapter, laptop plug-ins, etc.  Breakfast starts at 6 am for early risers.
- Service was absolutely outstanding- example: I walked in from a long cab ride and flight and the person who checked me in noticed I was green and immediately summoned a glass of water with lemon.  Very friendly too.
 -Location is in the heart of London a 2 minute walk from Trafalgar Square.
- Two good restaurants and the continental breakfast (included in my rate) was delicious!!  Amazing fresh fruit, local yoghurts, smoked salmon, fresh bread.  Truly a great way to begin the day.  The room that it is served in is lovely.
- Very quiet.  Room 430 
In sum if this stays within my budget I will stay here every time I'm in London.",5,2012,01,30
143,Simple elegance at the Embankment,"Every once in a while you meet a hotel staff that cares about their work and what they do.
The staff here is exceptional, and you will notice it a well-- they take extra care for everyone.
While the room cost is a bit high and the entrance location for cabs is a bit different, the location, rooms and staff make up for that. 
Wonderful experience here- highly recommended!!",5,2012,01,29
143,Excellent Hotel for a London trip,"We recently stayed at The Corinthia. Sadly we only stayed for one evening! From our early check in to our departure our stay was perfect. Staff are young and attentive and nothing is too much trouble. Main areas of the hotel are beautifully decorated. Our room was also beautiful, quality fixtures in the Bedroom and Bathroom. The shower is the best shower I have used. We didn't dine at the hotel but we did have a late night cocktail at the Bassoon bar, the barmen produced lovely drinks and snacks. I will definitely be staying at the Corinthia again on my next trip to London and hopefully i'll get to spend some time in the Spa.",5,2012,01,27
143,This is simply the best!,"My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at the Corinthia Monday night. The ultimate in customer service, quality and ambience all first class. From the moment we arrived until we left with late check out the following day it could not be faulted. Staff were so friendly and eager to please. Top quality fixtures and fittings,fresh flowers everywhere. Nothing was too much trouble. It was our anniversary and we requested a quiet room as my husband has difficulty sleeping. We had a beautiful room and a lovely anniversary card and cake. We would not consider staying anywhere else now if we are staying in London. Perfect location, easy access to the trains and getting around London. Thankyou for a fantastic stay!",5,2012,01,25
143,The most beautiful hotel in London,"My friends and I visit London at least twice a year to shop and see a show. We have stayed in many five star hotels over the years but the Corinthia is, without doubt, the best and most stylish of them all. The location is perfect, the meeting and dining areas are stunning, the service throughout is professional and welcoming and the rooms are huge and beautifully designed ( I stayed in a room with a fabulous balcony). The Corinthia has a unique and inspired unrestricted check-in / check- out facility, which allowed us to relax and feel really at home in the hotel.We had an amazing value spa deal which included an hour's treatment and use of the most luxurious spa I have ever visited.My friends and I were so impressed with the Corinthia that we stayed in December, returned in January and will certainly vist again. Helen A.",5,2012,01,20
143,I think I may have found the perfect hotel,"This truly is a beautiful property.  The designer(s), in my humble opinion, did a magnificent job.  I haven't seen this type of attention to detail since I saw the lobby at the Four Seasons in Budapest.  The styles are different, but the detail and quality of design work at the Corinthia is beyond impressive.  Devotion to perfection is evident everywhere.

As for service, they don't miss a beat.  Every staff member that I met was engaging and helpful.  The dining experience in the restaurant was equally amazing.  The wait staff couldn't have been more friendly, helpful or well mannered.  The hotel's overall service is the best I've experienced in a long time.  

I didn't have an opportunity to visit the spa, but my wife did and she said it was beyond amazing.  

If you use public transport as I do, the hotel's location is close to the Embankment tube stop and, of course, cabs and buses are easily found in the area.  I love this hotel.  I ran across some minor wear and tear caused by guests, but it appears that the hotel is vigilant and staying on top of things in a pointed effort to maintain a beautiful property.",5,2012,01,12
143,Excellent hotel,"Stayed 2 nights in January. Went to relax and do a small amount of sightseeing and it was perfect for that. Located in Whitehall - it is 2 minutes from Embankment Pier where you can catch the Tate to Tate river boat which is a great way to do that trip. The hotel is also near the tube (Embankment and Charing Cross are steps away if you need them). Taxis on demand as you would expect. Gorgeous room - I was in whatever the standard one is. It had a very comfortable bed,  fabulous bathroom and tea and coffee facilities. The hotel is incredibly soundproof. Service was very pleasant and mostly very efficient. I did notice that the staff (including the concierge desk) were younger and possibly a little less experienced than you would expect in a hotel in this price bracket but I had no issues with the service in any case - all very friendly and eager to please.  Foodwise I had room service one night and it was excellent - best I have ever had anywhere. Ate in Massimo for lunch and it was also very good. The other restaurant also looked good but didn't have a chance to try it. Afternoon tea in the lobby area (which is beautiful) looked fantastic although I didn't get to indulge. The spa is amazing and definitely worth a visit but I would skip the spa cafe - had breakfast there one morning and it really was ruinously expensive (perhaps to be expected) and very average (not expected).  You might want to note that children are allowed in the spa for an hour in the morning and again in the afternoon - check with the spa reception for details. I would highly recommend this place for a relaxing break if you have the time to relax in the hotel and enjoy the facilities.",5,2012,01,12
143,Beyond exceptional....,"I stayed here following the recommendation of someone who stayed at my guest house. I'd planned a 2 night trip to London, but changed that to one night at the Corinthia when I heard about the 24 hour checkin, deciding to ""sacrifice"" the 2 nights for an upgrade in hotel..... This it turns out was not a sacrifice...... I checked in at around 10 am, and checked out around 8pm the following day........my stay was truly exceptional.. From the moment I checked in, to the moment I left....... I had booked a winter warmer stay, which included dinner.... However I was disorganised and by the time I got round to trying to book a table for dinner, there was no availability,  so they organised our dinner to be served in the room.... It was lovely, including wine etc..... The room was so comfortable...... And felt really luxurious... Especially watching tv in the bath! The spa floor, absolutely blew me away..... So relaxing .....
Breakfast had a great variety and was delicious... (included in the price) though I wouldn't have wanted to pay the prices if it hadn't been included... I recall approx £7 for boiled eggs and toast!
All staff were so helpful and genuinely interested in how our stay was,  something I have never experienced in such a large establishment. I think it would be very difficult to ever stay anywhere else in London without now being disappointed, as I'm not sure the Corinthia can be beaten...",5,2012,01,11
143,Quite simply: wow,"We stayed at the Corinthia at the end of a fun but tiring three week jaunt through different cities. During our trip, we stayed at some really lovely hotels, but the Corinthia blew us away. They've really thought of everything (in fact, an employee told me they built a model room and different managers spent time sleeping in it, so as to tweak the details).

Our room was very well-designed. Foyer, large walk-in closet, very roomy bath, and comfortable furniture. Nothing was awkward, nothing was disappointing, nothing was missing. On the wall by the desk, there is every kind of electric outlet--so handy.

Loved the fantastic Whitehall location.

We also had some spa treatments; they were excellent. Their spa feels somewhat futuristic--you descend down through four levels of treatment and equipment rooms--the bottom level is very clean but dimly lit, and echo-ey, with a stainless steel pool and large, fiery-looking sunken sauna. For massage, Sinead is an excellent, knowledgeable therapist with strong hands that know to go exactly where they are needed.

We had a very good dinner in Massimo one night--the next night ventured out to Ottolenghi, which I'd been trying to try. (Did not disappoint!)  There is also another restaurant within the hotel, as well as a bar. And the large, chic lobby is always available with plenty of comfortable chairs and small tables for drinks and snacks.

A great bonus? They have a ""rolling admissions"" policy--there is no set check-in or check-out time.  Our flight didn't leave Heathrow till 6:30pm and it was so lovely and civilized to have a leisurely last day, without worrying about killing time/storing bags.

Can hardly wait to return.",5,2012,01,10
143,Excelent,"I had the pleasure of stay at The Corinthia few weeks ago. The hotel is brand new and trully luxury but still cosy and welcoming. I stayed in one of the superior rooms and it was absolutely stunning; spacious, sparkling clean and had all the little details that you could expect from a top luxury 5 stars property (charging almost £500.00 per room per night) I loved the floating remote controler for the TV on the bathroom! I decided to spend the whole day at the hotel (believe me; once you get in the hotel you don't want to go out!), had a georgeous english breakfast on bed and after I went to the SPA...The SPA is simply amazing, the best in town no doubt!I also had the chance to experience both Massimo and The Northall (restaurants) I loved Massimo, great seafood (amazing oysters selection) and reasonable value but I found The Northall quite standard and a bit over priced for what it is although it's cheaper than Massimo I would recomend to try this one. The Corinthia is a luxury property but still cosy and home feeling. The rates are high (very high) but the hotel is lovely and the service amazing.",5,2012,01,10
143,"One of the BEST! Outstanding everything, THE perfect stay in London","We spent the Christmas week at the Corinthia and we had a fantastic stay. From the moment we walked into the hotel lobby, then to our suite, we felt instantly relaxed... and almost didn't want to leave! :) we loved our room with a nice walk-in closet where we could leave our luggages and clothes all separated from the rest of the room, while easily accessible between wardrobe and bathroom. Staff team is fantastic, impeccable service and attention to details. We fell sick on Boxing day and ended up being in the room for most part of the day (we LOVED our suite!). Room service made us chicken noodle soup for dinner even it wasn't on the menu! We had 2 dinners at Northall and breakfasts at the hotel and food was just amazing. Although Northall has a fantastic team each with different responsibilities like a traditional 5-6 stars restaurants, we think the coordination will take a bit time to completely gel together seamlessly as it is a very young restaurant. Don't get me wrong, service is great and staff are nothing but only friendly. 
The spa, definitely one of the best spas i have ever been at. We have been to many world class spas and ESPA is hands-down top of my list! From spa lay-out, design, ambiance, staff, service, EVERYTHING was perfect! We spent almost 2 full days at the spa using the facilities and various treatments. Incredible experience!",5,2012,01,09
143,Really want to be more positive........but,"Fantastic location, particularly if you are wanting to visit all the tourist spots in London. We visited for my wifes 50th birthday. Hotel were great in organising our visit, the admin team were fantastic.
My wife used the espa spa, which is also stunning and had 2 treatments. Kindly they gave us a great upgrade to a lovely room. So why only 2 stars?
Dinner was just not good enough, we ate in the Northhall, and the food was only ok.....we expected so much more. Also my wife became very ill whilst we were at the hotel. Whilst i am sure they were not to blame and helped as much as they could, i was felt really let down with how they dealt with elements of her illness. In particular really surprised that despite writing a letter to the General Manager, we have still not heard anything back. Just not what you expect from a 5 star hotel costing this much money.
So as the heading says i really want to be so much more positive with the hotel, but just cant write a review that says that based on my experience.",2,2012,01,08
143,Excellent new hotel,"My husband and I stayed in the Corinthia for a week, right before Christmas.  We were extremely happy and would recommend the hotel to everyone.  As we were very jetlagged (traveling from the west coast of the US), we kept waking up at odd hours, starving.  The Corinthia has 24-hour room service -- and by that they mean _full_ room service.  The first two nights of our stay we were starving by 3 or 4 in the morning, and asked if our breakfast could be delivered early.  A full cooked breakfast arrived, piping hot, within 20 minutes!  It was served with a smile AND a lovely glass globe with an orchid bloom in it (little elegant touches such as that are found everywhere in the hotel).  I think it's pretty darned impressive for a hotel to turn out a perfect 3-minute poached egg via room service at 3am.

The rooms are gorgeous -- the decor is modern yet elegant and inviting.  The public areas of the hotel are also truly lovely, although we didn't have much time to enjoy them (our schedule was packed).  Our first room was right by the elevators, and I was concerned about noise.  Don't worry, promised the front desk clerk.  Our rooms are very well-insulated.  How right she was!!  We couldn't hear any elevator-related noise at all (and I have scary bat-like hearing).  In fact, if I was brushing my teeth and my husband was in the bedroom, we couldn't hear one another through the partially-closed partition doors that separated the two rooms.  The only problem was the windows -- our first room looked out onto the street, and the windows are not well-insulated, so the traffic noise (delivery trucks really start doing their thing around 2:30am) bothered me.  We ended up switching to an inner courtyard room, and that did the trick.  No more 3am breakfasts after that.  :o)

Something else that really matters to me, as a frequent traveler, is the gym.  The Corinthia's gym is really something else.  In addition to a very complete array of cardio and weight-training equipment, they also have a power-plate and a pully-system machine.  Most importantly to me, they had everything I needed for a good mat pilates workout (balls, bosu, foam rollers, etc.).  The gym is open 24 hours by secure access, and there are security camera everywhere, so I felt very comfortable as a woman exercising alone at 3am.  I'm only sorry that our schedule did not leave me enough time to see or sample the spa facilities, which I am sure are extraordinary, if the rest of the hotel is any indication.  

The hotel's location was perfect -- steps away from the Tube, and a brief walk away from the Old Vic.  The neighborhood is safe and clean.  The hotel staff are very, very helpful.  Oh -- did I mention that check-in and check-out is rolling, to accomodate those flying in and out at odd hours?  This is a hotel that seeks to anticipate guest needs in every possible way.",4,2012,01,08
143,Outstanding,"Stayed for 3 nights over New Year. We originally booked a deluxe room and were upgraded to a Junior Suite after a problem with our room safe. Our room 416 was located on the inner courtyard with a lovely balcony. (would of been great in the summer!) 

Customer service, facilities, decor and location of hotel are second to none. We enjoyed the Spa pool. Our 5 year old son was allowed to use the pool between 10 and 11.30 and 3 and 4.30. The Spa facilities are outstanding.  If you're looking for a five star experience with all the extras in London, look no further. We will be back for sure.",5,2012,01,07
143,5 star only for location,me and my wife stayed here for two nights over the new year door men 1st class and very professional front staff who booked us in very professional booked us in at 12.10.pm he telephoned up get our room ready when we went up we realised we didnt get our room facing the road instead we got 7 th floor views very poor looking in at other rooms we noticed by arriving early we must of rushed them to much because our room was mucky on the bedding the was a brown speck of  dirt on the front of cover on the skirt of bed had alot of black dirt onliving room floor carpet had lots of mucky marks on  it when i tried to open windows they are all very stiff may be because they are new old folk may have troube opening them as we waited for our cases to be brought up i put on the radio on the bath tv and over the two nights the reception there was a lot of interferance to the music i was listening to the porter brought the suit cases up put our clothes and cases in the wardrobe  only to realise when we told him they wasnt ours and he had them all mixed up i gave him help in taking them out and retrieving ours my wife felt sorry for him as he looked stressed out and still gave him a decent cash tip we were in  the hotel for a few hours had a knock at the door a chinnese lady came into our room she said ive come to do your room we told her weve only just arrived she stayed messing around in the bathroom then came into the bedroom were i was resting on the bed fluffing the pillows next to me asking if she should make the bed for me this is very unprofessional she was in the room standing there i presume waiting for a tip later on before we were going to see the fireworks my wife got a shower put on her dressing gown i got my shower then to i was going to put  on my dressing gown and it had a horrible orange looking rush spot on it understandingly i never wore mine,3,2012,01,06
143,Very Helpful,"We recently stayed at the Corinthia in London and were very impressed by the service we received.  The Front Desk staff were excellent.  There had been a mistake with our booking by an outside agency and they only had one room booked instead of the two rooms we had pre-paid for.  The Front Office staff went out of their way to sort the issue out and help us as they knew we were off to see a Musical and we did not have much time on our hands.  They did not have any extra roms when we checked in as they we full, however they gave us the one room available to freshen up and whilst we were out they had the entire thing sorted out.  When we we came back in the front door they knew straight away who we were (even though the shift had changed) the key was placed in our hands for our 2nd room and they had upgraded both rooms for us.  We did not use the other services in the hotel on this occasion, however we will definitely be back to experience them as this is now our new favourate hotel in London.  In addition to the above the location for us was excellent, especially for Covent Garden, West End Theatre, Trafalgar Square, Westminster Abbey and Buckingham Palace, all very easy walking distances.",5,2012,01,05
143,Espectacular!!!!,"I stayed one night with my 3 kids and wife. This is the hotel to stay in London. I have never stayed in a hotel room with such detail and good taste. My family loved it!!!!

We where greeted by a staff member that showed us the hotel and explained how everything worked in the room. The bathroom is quite big and very modern, it even has a tv.

I am definitely coming back to this hotel.",5,2012,01,04
143,New Year 2011,"First impressions on arrival at the hotel was excellent, all of the staff were extremely polite and very helpful and this continued throughout the duration of our stay over the New Year celebrations.

The hotel itself is very impressive, the decoration and refurbishment has been done to an extremely high standard with all requirements for the duration of your stay being catered for.

We had a problem with the television in our room as it wasn't working, an engineer was sent up immediately and as the problem could not be resolved we were offered a replacement room and a free upgrade for the inconvenience caused.

On New Year's eve we dined in the Northall Restaurant and my husband and I were the only two people dining in the whole restaurant which was a treat.  The food was excellent and the service could not be faulted.

On our second evening we decided to order a meal via room service and were told it would take no more than 25 minutes, time elapsed and our meal arrived somewhat later than originally advised as there had been a mix up with the rooms.  This meal was provided complimentary with sincere apologies for the delay.

The whole experience was definitely 5* and we both had a wonderful time as the location was perfectly situated for the New Year's Eve celebrations at the London Eye.  

We would recommend this hotel and are looking forward to planning a return trip soon.",5,2012,01,04
143,"Prime location, gorgeous facilities, attentive staff","We stopped here for a two-night stay on our return home to the US from parts east, and were at the Corinthia for New Year's Eve. It was just terrific on all fronts. The hotel allowed us to check in very early (8:30 am), which was much appreciated as we'd just taken a red-eye into Heathrow. We interacted with registration, concierge and housekeeping staff; all were very helpful. The hotel has true pride of place, just off the Thames with two tube stops across the street, the London Eye right across the bridge, and within easy walking distance of so many other central London features. For seeing the fireworks, there really couldn't have been a better location. Our room was chic and well appointed, quiet, and just lovely; I think our kids spent a full 15 minutes oooh-ing over the heated bathroom floor.  The only oddity was the absence of a full plug for the blow dryer in the bathroom (only sufficient for a shaver), so I had to dry my hair in the bar area with its mirror, but this was a minor matter and any negative feelings were easily offset by the flat screen TV above the cavernous tub with waterproof remote :-). I also visited the spa which is just beautiful, one of the very best I've ever seen and with good service. We would recommend this hotel highly for both families and business travelers.",5,2012,01,04
143,Very nice hotel with fantastic spa facilities,"I stayed here one night with my sister. It took us a little time to find the entrance, as there is an entrance to a (very popular) hotel bar on the opposite side of the building to the hotel reception which we got a little muddled by.
The room was luxurious and spotlessly clean, but a little smaller than I had imagined (compared to other 5* stars, like the Savoy), however, we were in a corner room which may have been the reason why, The facilities in the room were great though - the bathroom had a luxury shower with an overhead 'rain' effect and a bath complete with TV! There was also a Nespresso machine and a full size hairdryer which I appreciated.
The highlight of the hotel for us without a doubt though was the spa facilities, which were gorgeous and a real treat, complete with a number of jacuzzi jets, large sauna, steam room and pool. The staff in the spa were very helpful too.
Final plus of this hotel is the position which is great for most theatres, accesible to Southbank and a short walk from the Parks. All in all a very nice hotel,",4,2012,01,03
143,Wow...Amazing...Fabulous...Perfect....!!,"I LOVED this hotel.  We stayed over New Year for two nights.  We were greeted upon arrival by the doormen who were very friendly, the lobby entrance was stunning, the reception staff were friendly and professional.

Our room was an executive room, which I could not fault in any way whatsoever, plenty of space, every amenity one could want for a hotel stay (fully stocked minibar, pens, paper, great TV, air con/heating, large comfy bed, fluffy pillows, ironing board/iron, excellent coffee machine, interesting books to read....).  The bathroom was just as amazing, excellent shower, separate toilet/bidet, jacuzzi bath with television, ESPA toilettries, twin sinks, great lighting (for our make up girls!!).

The location was excellent too and enabled us to see far more of London than we normally do during our stay.  We tend to stay in the Mayfair area but the Corinthia gives you an opportunity to walk along the embankment, get to the Eye easily, Picadilly Circus/Trafalger/Convent Garden/Oxford Street are all within walking distance.  We never used the tube at all during our stay and visited all the areas I have stated.

The decor in the hotel again is perfect, its glamourous and yet modern but also doesnt feel too ""posh"" that it intimidates you as some 5 star hotels can.  We are lucky to be able to afford top hotels and we have worked hard for this but we are not ""posh"".  We like a luxurious hotel when we go away without the pompous atmosphere that you can get at some hotels.

We never ate at the hotel during this trip as we had prior arrangments to eat elsewhere but I dont doubt it would have been fabulous.

This will definately now be my choice of hotel when visiting London, so glad I found it and absoluely cannot wait to stay again!!! 

If you can afford to stay here, STAY!! Its fabulous.  Thank you to all at the Corinthia for our pleasurable stay.",5,2012,01,03
143,"Lovely, great location","Just back from 5 terrific nights.  Perfect, comfy rooms.  Amazing shower.  We have also stayed at the Savoy this year, which we loved, and the Corinthian is equally luxurious, with less hubbub and a bit more desirable location ( 2 tube lines right out the door).  We conveniently walked in every direction.  Breakfast was lovely and you will keep saying ""wow"" as you take in the gorgeous decor.",5,2011,12,29
143,A city resort,"A Hotel? No more. Luxurious? No more. A SPA? No more. This is truly a resort town without any compromise. I stayed in more than 1,000 luxury hotels in the world but never found a service so attentive. Staff were polite and discreet. A perfect evening turn down. Chocolates, water, fruit and orchids are always present in the room. Each request is answered quickly. Definitely the best hotel in all 2011 where I was.",5,2011,12,21
143,Amazing night's stay,"I took by boyfriend here as a surprise for his birthday. I found the staff very helpful- the room was fantastic- I paid a GBP20 upgrade fee to get a delux room. It was beautiful. 

The room was spacious and had everything you could want. The bathroom was stunning and room amenities excellent.

We ordered room service at midnight and it turned up within 15 minutes and was lovely. We also had breakfast which turned up a little earlier than we asked for but was plentiful.

As everyone else has said, the spa is brilliant- in the jacuzzi area there are several different machines which will massage different parts of your body.

The only slight issue we had was finding a bar which was open to guests after 11pm. The Bassoon bar is where reception sent us but there was a birthday party going on that night. A barman eventually got us a drink and sat us in the lobby but it was quite dead so we headed to our room.

Would definitely go again if we could afford it.",5,2011,12,21
143,C for Cavernous,"We live in London, but sometimes treat ourselves to a night out... my partner had heard of a new kid on the block which might rival the great and the good of the old guard. Namely The Ritz, The Savoy and The Dorchester....so I booked...

I had heard of the refurbishment and was shocked at the sea of marble, the pillars, the cavernous interiors in which could house a king (where is the recession? certinaly not in London) Oh boy the owners must have deep pockets..

Our room was not ready (even after 4pm) and we were asked to have tea in the lounge....and the General Manager would come out...he never came out....and they charged us for the tea..(perhaps he was more interested in the new X factor winners that were staying) eventually a lovely lady took us up to a wonderful suite overlooking the river Thames (just)...our room was very blue and art-deco..although it was more designer than functional, and very art gallery (quite cold), although the butler service was delightful.. too many little bits..books etc..The GM needs to visit the Savoy and see how it is done...

We had planned to go out for dinner but decided to go to Massimo..The buzz was amazing and the food was as well...we gorged on so much sea food...I commented to my partner ""that this could be the best fish restaurant in London""... (sorry Scotts you have some serious competition)..

Room service breakfast was a must and was faultless....they even rung us to get us prepared for their arrival....although where was the salt and pepper?

If your going to visit our wonderful city.. stay somewhere else until they get it perfect...although try Northall or Massimo's because they are up there with the great and good already...

We are Londoners and are wiery of the the new kids on our shores..I am sure if they sort out their check-in and their general attention then they will be up there with the rest.. stay again we will see..dine in the restaurants YES",4,2011,12,19
143,Sensationally good,"The best hotel we have ever stayed in, bar none.  The customer service was virtually faultless.  The room was comfortable, beautiful and thoughtfully designed.  The spa was stunning.",5,2011,12,19
143,Excellent new London 5-star hotel,"My wife and I stayed here recently, as well as having a meeting in the hotel during the day.

We had a Standard room, but even so it was a decent size with a lovely bathroom.  My wife checked in during the afternoon while I was in the meeting and told me that the front desk service was excellent.

My experience of the Ballroom was that it had been lovingly restored from its original state, as is the rest of the hotel.

The one thing that has made me dock a ""point"" is that we were disappointed with the breakfast.  The sausages and bacon looked a little anaemic, while the scrambled egg wasn't very appetising to look at.  It was fairly late in the breakfast service, so I'm willing to give them a little leeway, but just felt that it was our only disappointing aspect of the hotel overall.

That said, I would definitely recommend the hotel to anybody wanting a luxury 5-star London experience.  It is well located, just a short walk from Charing Cross station and very good for seeing the sights such as Big Ben, Houses of Parliament, Downing Street, Trafalgar Square and Piccadilly Circus.",4,2011,12,15
143,Mediocre service,"I didn't stay over at the Corinthia but went to the bar off the back of several recommendations.  Unfortunately, I was less than impressed with the service.  I frequent a lot of London hotel cocktail bars as I like the ambience but this was not what I was expecting, considering the Corinthia has a 5 star rating.

The bar is beautiful and has an amazing piano come bar thing and lovely decor but the lack of attention from the staff was disappointing considering we were paying £14 a cocktail or thereabouts.  It took about 20 minutes for the waitress to come over and take our order- they looked rather rushed off their feet despite the bar not actually being heaving- and then she had to come back to ask again as she'd forgotten what we wanted.  Nobody came to check everything was ok once our drinks finally arrived, they didn't clear the table when we had finished our first round until I signalled politely for them to come over.  To add to that, the cocktails weren't actually that great!

Don't think I'll be returning.  Check out the Langham for drinks instead.",3,2011,12,15
143,Absolutely Perfect,"We have stayed at many hotels over the years in London but I must say that the Corinthia Hotel will now be our home away from home. The hotel is located down the road from Trafalgar Square which makes it close to so much in the way of access to the rest of the city in regards to transporation services. It is also across from the Embankment Station which makes it perfect in connecting with many lines. The hotel atmosphere is elegant. The rooms is spacious and superb in luxury. The moment we arrived to the hotel our luggage was taken from us and immediately brought to our rooms. We were then excorted to our room and shown the ammenities that our room had to offer. There is an unbelievable marble bathroom with warm towels, separate bath, beautiful linens and heated floor. There was also a flat screen TV in the bath area. The service is second to none. There is nothing that you would ask for. From the minute we checked in till the day we left, there was nothing we could have asked for more. We didnt eat within the hotel eateries so I cannot comment on them. There is a fridge in the room, free Wi-Fi, all in all I cannot say enough about this hotel.",5,2011,12,13
143,Faultless December stay!!,"Corinthia Hotel has just become my FAVOURITE London Hotel (and I've stayed at a few!). A 2 minute walk from Embankment station it is fantastically located. I received exceptional service from every member of staff from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. The room was more than spacious, very luxurious and we had a walk in wardrobe which my girlfriend loved. The attention to detail is better than any hotel I've stayed in. This has definitely become my hotel of choice when staying in London.",5,2011,12,05
143,Top Secret Hotel..WOW fabulous luxury,"Recently booked this hotel on the description of the location after having difficulty finding a room in a nice hotel. Amazing hotel, great room facilities and wondeful service. The Spa is  luxurious and well worth missing the shops for. We stayed at the Savoy the night before equally as fantastic but much busier and the car parking there was cheaper!!",5,2011,12,05
143,Nearly great,"I've stayed here a few times now.  Overall experience Is wonderful.  But I'll focus on the few downsides.  Mobile phone reception is dire. Fixing this would up my score to the highest level.  Gripe 2 is breakfast.  Slow.  I've stopped bothering (so they might have fixed it by now). A few times I've ordered and waited and experienced painfully slow delivery  and sloppy attention to detail.  Tea without milk, toast without butter. And gripe 3, a few weeks ago, an event which shut the bar and when I walked on intomNorthhall with my guest and asked if we could get a drink their first question was ""are you a resident"". I was but resented the question, and impression it left with my guest. We were shunted into the lobby where we were looked after well but the transition was annoying.  I love the rooms though and the staff are mainly fantastic.  I'd like to think these are teething pains.  Back on Monday so will see....",4,2011,12,02
143,WOW!  Quite possibly the best hotel in the world!,"I'm very fortunate to be able to stay at some of the best hotels, and the Corinthia, London tops them all.  The hotel has been renovated with the best workmanship.  The attention to detail in all areas is amazing.  I can't wait to get back to London and stay there again.",5,2011,11,29
143,Outstanding,"Well appointed with a wonderful staff. This was truly a royal experience in a great location. Spent four nights. Service is warm, efficient and friendly without being intrusive. We were three and had sufficient space even with roll away in our 7th floor deluxe room overlooking the Thames and London Eye. Room opened to entry foyer leading to walk-in closet. Bath area included a soaking tub with TV. (Never got to use) Two basins, separate toilet area and awsome shower stall with water flowing from the ceiling. You won't want to come out. Plenty of plush towels and warm robes. Room was made up twice each day with chocolate left on pillows at night and bedroom slippers on floor.
The Hotel has an exercise room but we were so busy we never got to use that either. I cannot comment on the restaurants. While the look was bright and welcoming we did not eat here.
A one minute walk to Embankment Tube Station gave us easy access to all of London.
Many sites such as Trafalgar, Covent Garden, Big Ben, Downing Street, Westminster Abbey etc are all within a 10 minute walk.
Thank you Corinthia, Mr. Dixon and Mr. Coombs for providing us with an exceptional stay on our first visit to London. We hope to be back.",5,2011,11,29
143,Corinthia Hotel London - WOW,"I have just returned from a very quick trip to London.  I stayed at the Corinthia Hotel which was just spectacular.  Located very conveniently at Whitehall Place.  Warm welcome after a long flight from San Francisco.  Check in very friendly and effcient.  Room was terrific. Spacious, extremely comfortable and stunning to look at.  Bathroom is great with a huge bathtub.  Dressing room with convenient full length mirror - plentiful hanging space and hangers.  Hotel has free wi-fi .  Spa is pretty much beyond description.  Be ready for an experience !!  Lounges and restaruants are excellent.  Hotel staff - everyone goes the extra mile to be friendly and still very professional.  My only complaint -  I wasn't there long enough.  I am a Travel Consultant and would recommend this Hotel to my clients with total confidence.",5,2011,11,28
143,Excellent,"This new hotel is in a great location, just off Trafalgar Square and 1 minute from Embankment tube station. It'san immaculate hotel with sumptuous rooms with large bathrooms. We had an executive room. All the public areas were stunning. If I could find anything to criticise, it would be that the fridge in the room wasn't working and the drinks were warm which wasn't pleasant. Apart from that, a 5 star rating and we will be returning as soon as we possibly can!",5,2011,11,28
143,One of the best service,"We are still at Corinthia. My husband is on work trip and we decided to stay at the same hotel for few personal days first. The staff was very courteous and gave us a nice upgrade (thanks Jean Louis) since we would be here for 10 days... I have a two year old and hotel staff went above and beyond to store his food and heated his meals (thanks Rui Costa). The hotel is very clean. I am one of those who can see dirt behind frames and this hotel hasn't disappointed me yet. The cups/glass were a bit dusty but nothing major. The rain shower is amazing and the various lighting modes are smart. The light fixtures are placed in a subtle way in the bathroom that it is bright but not in your face lighting. Movement sensor on walkin closet is my favorite . Need to get one of those for my own closet. Very convenient.

The location is very convenient. It is on a nice quiet street and not far from the crowded tourist places. Would definitely come back to stay.",5,2011,11,26
143,Simply stunning!,"I stayed at this hotel last weekend in London and loved it, we were totally spoiled for any future hotels stays, the Hotel is luxurious and the service impecable, I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a luxury stay in London.",5,2011,11,25
143,Great new addition to London Hotel scene,"Nice Lobby if a little cold,Very good room with walk in wardrobe.Very good breakfast.
Northall restaurant is a very good value.
Downside is that the hotel is not atmospheric and is a little clinical.But as London hotels go...very good.....",4,2011,11,23
143,Is this the best city hotel in the world??,"I stay in hotels around 4 nights every week (of every standard from 3*-5*)- I am generally not that easily impressed however the Corinthia BLEW ME AWAY!!

Every details from arrival through to departure (each at a time to suit you, not the hotel's housekeeping department) was perfect.

The staff are friendly and make you feel comfortable and at home - unusual for a 5* in London, rooms are amazing and the Espa spa stunning.

It is not (and should not be) the cheapest option but I can guarantee if you stay here you will not be dissapointed.  I will be staying whenever I can!!",5,2011,11,22
143,Wow the best hotel in London.,An outstanding hotel with exceptionally friendly and welcoming staff. We will definatly be returning.,5,2011,11,21
143,Splendid,"Living and working in Asia, I am consistently disappointed by the quality of hotels in Europe, so whilst quite pricey, the Corinthia was a very pleasant and welcome surprise.  Arriving in London at 5 am after an overnight flight, one's state of mind is such that any slight problem at the hotel is amplified.  I arrived at the hotel, checked in rapidly and was shown to one of the best hotel rooms I have ever stayed in.  Everything about the room was just right, from a TV screen conveniently placed in the bathroom, to a decent expression machine and a comfortable armchair.  The hotel lobby is grand and comfortable but on a scale that is not too imposing.  Staff were uniformly helpful but not overly intrusive and appeared willing to ""go the extra mile"" to assist, eg the doormen disappeared down the street to get taxis for us in rush hour.  Treat yourself, stay here.",5,2011,11,20
143,Classic luxury with a modern twist,"We stayed for 3 nights early Nov. New 5* Hotel, ab fab! Everything about this place is wonderful - rooms classicly modern, we all said ""best bed & pillows ever"", nespresso  in rooms, free wi-fi, excellent cocktail bar - amazing staff.  We ate in the Northall restaurant - food & service sublime. The Spa is huge with 2 pools - 1 hydrotherapy. Not cheap but worth every penny - brilliant for a special occasion. ",5,2011,11,20
143,W O W,"It is very difficult if not impossible to find fault with the Corinthia. We thought that our favorite city could not suprise us any more, but we were sooo wrong! We booked the hotel last minute and got a very good deal. Arriving at St Pancras by 9AM, a 15 min taxi ride took us to the hotel where we were promptly escorted to our room (which was indeed available, in accordance with the hotel's policy), which left us plenty of time to walk down to Tate Miodern in time for our 10.30 am slot at the Gerhard Richter's exhibition. The location is indeed hard to beat: 2 min to Trafalgar with its galleries, 5 min to theatreland, 2 min to the horseguards and St james park lying behind, 5 min to Piccadilly and Jermyn street with its unique shops, 10 min to Covent Garden, etc, etc. and I mean walking not driving minutes.

The room was exceptionally big, although according to the floorplan, ours was the smallest. You enter in a hall with the bedroom to the left, the bathroom to the right and the halll itself leading onto a huge walk-in dressing with automatic lighting, lots of drawers, shelves and hangers!!. The room decoration is very stylish, a very comfortable bed, good reading lights, in fact good lighting everywhere, double sinks in the bathroom, a huge bathtub, separate walk in rain shower, and separate toilet and bidet. Everything done with the utmost attention to detail, comfort, esthetics and functionality, which is indeed a very rare combination in hotels these days. The only minor was that our room was facing a very small inner ""courtyard"" (not the two actual courtyards which are nicely decorated with plants). But, as we were on a very low rate, we decided not to complain (even if I had requested a room on a higher floor with a view) and focus on the positive side of this location, it being perfectly quiet at night.

The absolute highlight was our visit to the spa which can easily compete with the most luxurious and spacious in Asia, featuring a design amphitheatre sauna and pool: best is the jacuzzi though!!

Breakfast was very good and we liked the formula with the cold buffet being reasonably priced and hot breakfasts made to order.

All the lounges, bars and restaurants are done in a breathtaking design; we had dinner at the Italian Massimo: service was outstanding, but I was not impressed at all with the food, although my husband's lobster got high praize at the other side of the table.

They kept the best surprise for the last day, when we learned that the no check-in nor check-out policy mentioned at the hotel's website was no fake marketing trick. We checked out by 2 or 3 pm but it would not have been a problem to stay until early evening!

My only concern now is that with all the rave reviews the Corinthia is getting, all this praize must go to their heads and the prices will go steep up!!  That would be a real pity for I die to go back there as soon as I can for another perfect pampering weekend in a perfect hotel in our favourite city!!",5,2011,11,19
143,"Elegance! Location, Location, Location!!","One of the most perfect hotels I have been to in a long time! Convenient to everything,  Tht The Tube, London Market, Parliament, and easy walking to most sites.
Rooms were spacious, immaculate and quiet.
We laughed and said the only thing missing in the room was a clock!  And, who cares?",5,2011,11,19
143,Very hard to fault,I just spent 4 nights here on a business trip and the hotel was superb.,5,2011,11,18
143,Reaching a new level!,"I was very disappointed that we could not stay longer!
Staying at the Corinthia was like reaching Nirvana, everything was utterly perfect! From stepping into the Hotel from it's wonderful location and seeing the lobby with it's plethora of fresh orchids, you know you are in for a real treat. The staff are excellently kind and warm, and you feel so very welcomed unlike other hotels of this level, where you feel conscious about walking in! The receptionist took us to our room straight away, and explained everything excellently. Such kind staff, nothing is too much trouble! This was a birthday treat and they had waiting for me in the room a beautiful desert with 'Happy Birthday' Iced on the top and a box of chocolates, such a lovely gesture!
The room itself was superb. The layout, facilities and decor were just jaw dropping! The bathroom was beyond luxurious, no need to visit the excellent spa!! They really have thought about everything at the Corinthia, it was such a pleasure and it really made our trip. The only disappointment was having to leave early the next morning. 
I really can't wait for the next opportunity to visit. A huge congratulations to the management team and their staff for a truly spectacular experience, and I'm sure that i will be seeing you many times in the future!",5,2011,11,16
143,Afternoon High Tea at the Corinthia Hotel is a Must!,"When my husband and I arrived in London in mid-July, 2011, it was shortly after our 9-hour flight, and we were still suffering from the usual amount of jetlag. We thought to ourselves, ""What better way to experience London briefly that first afternoon before going to bed early than to experience a delicious High Tea for our first meal?"" We consulted my iphone to find the highest recommendations for High Tea in London. We discovered that the premier offering could be found at the Corinthia Hotel, near Trafalgar Square. 

We loved the choices of High Tea, and the variety of delicious small sandwiches, scones, and pastry selections, not to mention the very polite and courteous service with which all these delicacies were provided to us. 

High Tea at the Corinthia completely surpassed our expectations. The next time we are back in London, we will try to stay there overnight, as well. The appearance of the public areas of the hotel's first floor, where High Tea is served, are breath-takingly beautiful and the first floor bathrooms are absolutely stunning! I recommend this hotel without reservation!",5,2011,11,12
143,Stunning,"I have to say I love this hotel; from the heated floor in the most amazing bathroom to the quality of staff.  If I have to find a down side and this is at a stretch, the double bed was 2 singles joined and I could feel the join...it didn't affect my sleep (deep and long), but it was more an annoyance when awake and watching TV.  Overall, one of the best hotels I think I have stayed in...and I've stayed in a few!",5,2011,11,12
143,Do you need 5 stars to charge £6.50 for a cup of tea?,"The hotel furnishing were amazing. The bedroom was a very high standard, and in some ways too perfect. It almost felt like there was staff on  call anytime. I have never seen a bathroom so luxurious, with a TV in the bathroom and water tight control.

I had afternoon tea and a friend just wanted tea at £6.5o. Tea is 95% water, so you are paying this amount for a tea bag! And the afternoon tea i would not take again,( the cakes were like plastic) its better going somewhere else.

The breakfast I've  seen better at a lower star in the Tower Bridge area.

Overall great location, but its almost trying too much ( even the smiles) they need to relax, maybe they should book in themselves",4,2011,11,07
143,Best Hotel EVER,"My experience at the Corinthia was one of the best hotel experiences I have had. Though the hotel had just opened, there were no glitches at all. The suite was fabulously appointed, the view from the room was of the London Eye. Our butler was AMAZING! He took care of everything from unpacking to arranging reservation and even gave us suggestions for other cities. I would stay here again in a heart beat..In fact I am sure I would be disappointed staying anywhere else. 
Make sure to have drinks at the bar, the cocktails are lovely!",5,2011,10,31
143,The most enjoyable hotel stay in my 45 years thus far!,"This was my first stay in London, and from this location I walked easily to Trafalger;Piccadily; Big Ben and Parliment; the Horse Guard; Westminster Abbey and Buckingham Palace. No longer being of backpacking and yout hostel age, and owing to the fact that I get up early and London stays up late, I found myself returning to the room in the afternoon for some rest and relaxation. I stayed i n a Deluxe Room, and it was heavenly. The bed, pillows and bed clothes were luxurious and so cozy, the terri cloth robe and slippers made me feel pampered, and the Spa TV over the soaking tub was a nice touch. The bath is marble and while I stayed in the room alone, there is easily enough room for wardrobe for two adults.
Breakfast was the best I have had in the UK so far, and I had desert delivered to the room every night. I did not utilize the spa, salon or pool, but they look beautiful and luxurious.
The staff was attentive, polite and helpful. I was treated like a king and I will plan another stay here before I leave the UK.

143,"Brand new place, great service, good location, fair price","First I like to report, that this Hotel will be my fist choice for future London trips. Great service, friendly people, very clean room, excellent bath room... Even I got a personal message, beside to the best shoe shine ever, from the housekeeping after they returned my shoes. I can't tell anything bad.",5,2011,10,30
143,So gorgeous we didn't want to leave the room!,"After a ten day stay at the Corinthia London, we have nothing but good things to say about this hotel! From the moment we arrived to the time we left, our every need was attended to by a personable and caring staff. The concierge and our butler were particularly  superb. We also had the opportunity to meet the CEO of the Corinthia who was very gracious and gave us a tour of the soon-to-be-opened suites. 
   We booked the Trafalagar suite with an adjoining room. The setup was amazing. We had ample space to relax and eat our breakfast each morning in the room. The decor of the Corinthia is understated elegance. Our room was elegantly furnished. The only thing that could have been improved upon was the closet space in the adjoining suite. It was a wee bit sparse. The rooms were beautifully maintained each day by Corinthia's housekeeping department. 
   The room was so gorgeous we ended up spending more time there than we thought we would! The spa at the hotel should also be noted. Complete with sauna, steam rooms, massaging pools and heated recliners, Espa was a favorite place of our to hang out after a long day shopping and walking the streets of London. 
   The location was very central. We were attending the London Film Festival and the Corinthia was located in the middle of both of the venues. Additionally, the tube station was right across the street. 
   We had afternoon tea in the Lobby Lounge, drinks at the Basoon Lounge, dinner at the Northall restaurant and massages at Espa. All were fantastic!
   We would be happy to return at any time and would strongly recommend it to our friends. Short of staying with the Queen at Buckingham Palace, I don't think you could do better than the Corinthia London. Enjoy!",5,2011,10,29
143,Beautiful with fantastic service,"My husband stayed here on business and absolutely loved it. Apparently nothing was too much trouble for the staff, and they were incredibly friendly and accommodating. He also enjoyed the breakfast. We stay in luxury hotels frequently and my husband particularly remarked on how beautiful the Corinthia was.",5,2011,10,25
143,Efficient decadence,"So lucky to have a night at The Corinthia.  The scale, design and efficiency of the hotel is staggeringly impressive.  And the spa, oh my, being able to access 4 floors of decadence including 2 pools, the best designed sauna I've ever seen and a steam room is worth the cost of the room alone.  It's a big old place and on a Sunday night it was a little quiet but the Bassoon Bar was great fun with really innovative cocktails and the food at the newly opened Northall was extremely good.  Proper world class addition to London's very best hotels.",5,2011,10,24
143,WOW !!!!,"An Amazing hotel, fantastic staff, beautiful room, dinner at Northall restaurant was a wonderful experience and the Spa is out of this world. would highly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to London. ( and the birthday cake and fruit in room were a great touch )",5,2011,10,24
143,Afternoon Tea - it just does not get any better,"Booked the Corinthia when the Ritz was fully booked.  
We were NOT disapointed.  The setting, the sandwiches, the cakes, the scones were fabulous.  Not a great tea drinker, so if I was really, really, really picky it would be nice to have a choice of coffee as well, but we made do.  

This is a fabulous choice for a really delicious afternoon tea.  It;s not cheap, especially if you have the champagne and cakes, but it is worth every single penny.

The cakes are to die for!!

Fabulous!",5,2011,10,23
143,In one word: Exceptional!,"We are a family of five with children 13, 9 & 7.  We booked three nights in August 2011 with two rooms that were supposed to be connecting. We had just come off a very long train ride from Scotland and there was a little problem at the hotel as they did not have connecting rooms available.  Well, it took a couple of hours to straighten out. We were told this was the first time they had a glitch like that since they had opened in April 2011. I think they could tell I was getting a little aggravated as time went on and I can say that when it was resolved they really took care of us with an upgrade that was spectacular. We were eight days into a 40 night family trip so the way it was handled turned into a real treat for my family. Isabella, who showed us around while things were being worked out was a delight. Personable, welcoming and articulate are just a few of the words that would describe her.

The hotel itself is stunning. The rooms are all quite large and beautifully done.  What I really liked was the hotel room corridors which gave more of a residential feel rather than a hotel.  You really felt like you were going to your apartment instead of a hotel room. We dined at both venues on site and were not dissapointed.  We found although the hotel is magnificent, the staff are the real asset.  There was not a time that I went to the front desk where I was not called by name.

There is also an inner courtyard with fireplace where you can have a drink and relax.  You can also smoke a cigar there which is nice.

This is mostly a hotel for adults, but because of the staff and the location, it is perfect for families as well. We walked from the British Museum back to the hotel without a problem.  I highly recommend it.",5,2011,10,20
143,An Instant Classic,"From check-in to check-out, this hotel is special. I highly recommend it for any business traveler or couple - not a family hotel in my opinion. Their spa is magnificent and the restaurants are fabulous.  The rooms are beautifully chic.",5,2011,10,19
143,Fantanstic Property,"I am a frequent international traveler, and travel to London several times a year for work.   I have to say I was completely blown away by the Corinthia Hotel during my stay last week.    The property itself is absolutely fantastic.   Apart from being one of the most stunning hotels I have ever stayed in, the attention to detail and attentive service really set the property apart.   The rooms were generous in size, beautifully decorated, and comfortable.   The shower and bathrooms were large and luxurious, and the Spa/Gym is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen.    It is located a block from Trafalgar Square, which was just a short walk from Piccadilly, Leicester Square, Soho, and Covent Gardens.   It's now top of my list for my next visit to London.   You seriously can't beat it.",5,2011,10,17
143,Truely Magnificent,"We stayed for one night and it was exceptional. I stay in hotels quite often and this is probably the best I have ever experienced. The service is exceptional and they do everything possible to make your stay special. It was our anniversary and they brought a gorgeous cake and a card to our room, which was a lovely and personal gesture. There was a slight mix up with the room, so they upgraded us to a suite, which was superb. The swimming pool (stainless steel) is something to be seen. The steam room, sauna, heated lounges and general ambience is wonderful and my wife was delighted. We had a couple of drinks in the bar which was expensive, but to be expected in such wonderful surroundings. We dined elsewhere so can't comment on the food. The Reception Manager, Jean Louis Fresta, really made us feel welcome and special. Lovely location and very quiet in comparison to Covent Garden etc. We booked via Lastminute.com and got a secret hotel deal, which was a pretty good deal. Overall - superb and to be recommended. Much better than other hotels in a similar price bracket.",5,2011,10,16
143,A fantastic stay,"The London Corinthia hotel is without any question the best hotel in London if not in Europe .  I stayed here for a week while on business and found the level of service (excellent hospitality, unobtrusive service that is always there, generosity of management, honesty and attention to the tiniest details) to be one of the best that I have ever experienced in any of my stays in Europe during the past 10 years.  As a very frequent travelller, that is a very high commendation.  

Besides the outstanding service and staff, the quality of the rooms and their furnishings is stellar.  The bathroom is a delight (heated floors, amazing water pressure, generous amenities) as was the room lighting, temperature control, bed comfort and room cleanliness.

I hope the hotel will maintain and strive to continue their current standards and raise the bar for all other hotels in London to follow.",5,2011,10,15
143,Excellent choice for a combination of business and leisure,"Stayed 3 nights. Room was spacious, service was unbeatable. Restaurant is great. The SPA area is really unique. Probably the best hotel in London.",5,2011,10,08
143,Beyond all expectations...,"The London Corinthia is an amazing hotel exuding class on all levels.

I was working here for a few days and stayed in the hotel for a couple of nights and was blown away by the comfort and quality.

The rooms are spacious, comfortable and almost completely sound proof.

The bathroom has a heated floor, TV at the end of the bath and everything is spotlessly clean throughout.

But for me, the pinnacle of luxury was the (complimentary) spa. I have never seen anything like this and the multiple experiences within the spa are wonderfully relaxing - a perfect way to ease out the stress of the day. The sauna is beautiful - glass walled with tranquil music makes it difficult to stay awake - although if a nap is what you need, there are sleep pods within the changing area.

The food is excellent as one would expect from a 5 star hotel as is the service and the C&B staff - Erin & Richard - were always on hand and couldn't have been more professional and obliging.

Centrally sited to the key attractions, this is the perfect place for a relaxing base to discover London or to stay over on any business trip

Perfect!",5,2011,10,06
143,Truly Magnificent!,Just wanted to say that my husband and I have just come back from celebrating our 10th Wedding Anniversary at the Corinthia and it was amazing. Our room (executive) was incredible with outstanding detail in all decor. The staff are very welcoming and very  professional. Both restaurants are exceptional and the Spa is definately worth visiting. Location is spot on. Will never be staying anywhere else again!!,5,2011,10,03
143,"Outstanding, by far the best hotel in London !","My wife and I had the pleasure of staying in this hotel twice in the month of September. We had initially reserved rooms at the Berkeley but then received an offer from jetsetter.com for the Corinthia London and decided to give it a try. We had some reservations with it being a new hotel but once we entered the impressive lobby, went through a very quick and efficient check-in process and were escorted to our incredible room (executive) we knew that we would never stay anywhere else while in London.
This is by far the best you can get for your money while in London, the rooms are huge , the decor is amazing , the service is outstanding , both restaurants are excellent and the spa is nothing short of incredible (you cant miss the pool and thalassotherapy section).
We thought the location to be great, walking to most places and never spent more than 5 minutes in a cab going to dinner in either Knightsbridge or Mayfair. Their concierge staff is very efficient and I think her name is Norah (she is from NY) helped us make our stay in London a most memorable one. 
To finish I would like to commend Mr. Dixon and all of his staff for a great job, we can't wait to go back !",5,2011,10,02
143,"GREAT HOTEL, SERVICE NEEDS TO BE TWEEKED","The Corinthia is truly a rare find. My recent stay at the London property was a treat, wonderfully appointed rooms, well maintained public spaces, great decor, amazing floral arrangements. My only gripe is the lack of attention to detail for a new 5 star hotel.
I booked a transfer from the airport to the hotel, upon my arrival I was greeted by name by the doorman, Philippe from reception was at the door waiting for me, after brief formalities, he showed me around the property and then escorted me to my room. 
The Executive room (upgraded) was exceptional, spacious, well appointed, large walk-in closet, huge bathroom with a TV by the bath. The ony thing I did not like was the lack of an alarm in the room and absence of an i-pod docking station to listen to ones' own music.
Bed seemed a little short for me. Pillows a little high.  
Massimo was an impressive dining room, service good and food to match.
Breakfast the next day was a little sloppy, toast was served before the eggs arrived and it is a pity the guest is not asked what kind of toast he would prefer.  So when my eggs did arive the toast was invariably cold.  It is such a nice touch to offer a choice of salted and unsalted butter in all the restaurants but it would have been nice if this was pointed out to the guest. Likewise there is a nice 'buffet' presentation in the room adjoining the breakfast room which I think would be nice to indicate to the guest.
On subsequent visits for breakfast the hostess rather than recognizing me as an in house guest continued to ask me for my room number.  When I asked for crispy bacon, it was served not as I had expected.
Dinner at Northall was great the first time and sloppy on the second visit.  Ordering oysters, it was accompanied with a bottle of tobasco sauce with its seal still intact and when the dish was cleared upon my finishing it, the manager decided to shower my table and floor with some ice shavings - perhaps the plate had too much ice or it had melted. When the bill arrived I was charged for 3 glasses of wine not the 2 that I actually consumed. The manager in good faith promptly removed the beverage charges but alas the damage was done.
Trivial as these may seem, they show a lack of attention to detail, a pitty for an otherwise great hotel with so much potential to attract new clients and build a loyal return guest.  I am on the road for business 6 months of the year and such details do not escape me.  If one pays to stay in a top notch hotel with prices to match, the service should be impeccable and flawless.
The Basson bar was a real treat - the staff here were top notch, well trained - Domenico the manager ever so gracious with clients. Handsome room with much attention to exquisite detailing in the furnishings.  Suberbly astute bartenders a rare find, mixed such delicious cocktails.
Head Conceirge Jennifer was great in undertaking some personal errands for me, not to mention Hope who was as cordial. My only suggestion here would be that there be a weekly list of the hottest plays, concerts, must see list that is avaliable for guests.
The spa was such a treat, on 4 floors it is one of the largest I have seen, I recommend this as a must stop for any in house guest.
The managers Michelango, Maud and Isabel had quite an earful from me, were ever so attentive to my I hope constructive feedback, and I must say were most apologetic of the short comings and appreciative.  Upon my check out I received a lovely note from Maud and a thoughtful gift, welcoming me back to the hotel soon.
On the whole I did have an exceptional stay at the hotel, it is a great hotel, stylish, chic, great location and must conclude that I was most impressed with the hotel, it is truly well appointed. I am sure with a little more training the satff standards can be raised to satisy such demanding guests as my self.  BRAVO - I shall return.",5,2011,10,02
143,"Excellent, beautiful, spacious, spotless","My husband and I just returned from London where we spent three nights here at the Corninthia.  I cannot say enough wonderful things about this hotel.  They have one policy that will make me come back:  no check-in or out time.  Meaning, if you arrive at 8 a.m. your room will be ready and you won't have to wander around London jet-lagged and cranky.  This is clearly an accommodation to their international clients and is a great concession.  The staff is professional and efficient and our room literally stunned me in its elegance and beauty.  We had a suite that had it own dressing room, front hall, large bathroom with huge soaking tub and one of the nicest rain showers I have ever seen in a hotel.  Our bed was comfortable and the lighting system from the bedside was easy to use and had many different functions from mood to reading etc.  
The location is perfect since it is within walking distance of the pedestrian bridge over the Thames and within walking of the West End, theaters, shops and other London highlights.  My husband and I walked to Mayfair, Knightsbridge, the Tate Modern and to the Borough market easily. The hotel is in a quieter part of the city (near the government center) but we felt this was an advantage.  (The hotel is right across the street from the Embarkment tube station but this, for some odd reason, is not mentioned on the Corinthia website.)
 We tried the bar (wonderful drinks) and the main restaurant (also great).  But the decor of the entire hotel is so tasteful and beautiful it was a pleasure to spend time there.  The chandelier in the main lobby was impressive as is all the artwork.
This hotel is a bit on the pricey side but then it seems all good hotels in London will give those of us in the US a bit of sticker shock.  It is our 10th anniversary so was a perfect romantic getaway and worth every dime.  I highly recommend this hotel and plan on returning.",5,2011,09,20
143,Setting new standards of Excellence,"Had a meal in Massimo's . Fantastic presentation , Fantastic service , Fantastic quality. 
For anyone who likes the best things in life , give it a try and expect to be impressed .
This Hotel is quite simply the BEST London Has To offer at the moment .",5,2011,09,20
143,Found My New Favorite,"Just got back from a six night stay at the Corinthia London. When in London I usually stay at the Haymarket NOT ANYMORE!!!! 

The new hotel is very smart, chic and has the service that I so admire from the Corinthia group. The location is fabulous could not be better situated for either business or pleasure. 

Upon entering it is immediately clear that attention to detail is so well executed that there are few words to explain it. (just gaze upwards toward the chandelier and you will get what I am saying)　
 
The rooms are spacious and sound-proofed, so even though you are in the middle of a bustling city, you hear absolutely no street noise. The bathrooms ultra-luxurious (you can watch TV while lying in the tub and the selection of amenities is perfect). Great after a long day.

 Breakfast and high tea at the Northall (which seems to draw a London crowd as well), were outstanding, for dinner you must try the lamb chops additionally the staff is unfailingly friendly and helpful. 

For the seafood lover you should give Massimo a try before the Michelin people tell everyone and it gets over run with people (try the Trout tartare with caviar.... yummy!!!)

 Basoon bar is a great place to unwind after a long day be it before or after the theater. I highly recommend the Bubblegum Martini paired with one of their delicious food cocktails the Bloody Mary made with Swale oysters is particularly delicious.

 On a final note about the service : I was having dinner with a colleague and his wife who are smokers while joining them outside during breaks in courses over dinner, we'd left our wine at the table and without a prompt the waiter appeared with all three glasses topped up on a silver tray : as the British would say..........brilliant. 

Bravo to the management and to the team",5,2011,09,17
143,Unbeatable service,"Corinthia Hotel is friendly, welcoming and totally unpretentious - unlike some of its five star London competitors! 
We stayed in an Executive Room that boasted plenty of natural light (I have a pet hate of dark, “romantically-lit” hotel rooms!) and all the mod-cons we could possibly need.
Whilst we were there we made the most of the dining options with a fantastic starter of oysters and champagne in Massimo's (will definitely return); followed by a delicious dinner at The Northall. Service was excellent throughout. 
After an amazing 10 hours sleep (uber-comfortable bed!) we checked out the spa and spent an hour in there just relaxing. 
I cant recommend the hotel enough and loved the 24 hour check in and check out policy which meant we weren't rushed to pack up and leave in the morning.",5,2011,09,13
143,So Close To Greatness....,"This is a luxury hotel that ups the ante for every luxury Mayfair hotel. Unfortunately its not located anywhere near Mayfair. The guest rooms are the best in London by a wide margin. The service is ok. Everyone is trying very hard and it shows. The restaurants are solid, however, like the hotel, were empty on the dates I visited. Room service is poor with orders missing simple things like salt and pepper. Repeatedly.  Mayfair located, this would be the top London hotel. Given the London traffic pains, the hotel works best if you've got the time it takes to get most places you want to go when in London. The guest rooms are superb.",4,2011,09,13
143,Beautiful hotel,"This is a beautiful hotel which is probably one of the most stylish in London.  We have stayed here twice and enjoyed immensely.  The spa is second to none and Massimo I am sure will be applying for Michelin stars soon.  The bar is elegant and achieves intimacy in such a large hotel.  The rooms are large by usual standards and very tastefully decorated.  Our only one complaint, which wouldn't stop us coming back, is housekeeping.  This is probably due to teething problems, but it is somewhat erratic - two days with no cups or glasses, turn down service knocking at the door at 22.45, chasing to have room made up after returning at 15.00 etc.  These are mild irritations and possibly wouldn't stand out in many hotels, but does here because the rest of the hotel gets everything so right with very enthusiastic staff who are obviously very pleased to be working here.",4,2011,09,13
143,Cant wait to go back. Luxury at a steal !!!,"I stayed here in August with my partner and parents for a 1 week vacation. At first I was a little apprehensive as the hotel had opened not too long along. Service can always be an issue with new hotels. I usually like the service at the Four Seasons but decided to give this new hotel a try. 
The ""anytime ""  check-in was quite convenient as our red eye arrived at 7 am. We were allowed to check in immediately and get a few hours sleep without having to book the additional night before as is the case with most hotels.
Once we entered the rooms, we were all speechless at how spacious and well- appointed the rooms were. There was a  foyer in each room , large walk -in closet and luxurious bath with plasma screen at the end of the tub
There are several restaurants on the premises and service is attentive and food is good. 
The spa is out of this world. It is proable the sleekest facility I have seen at a hotel. 
We found the location to be perfect.....close to all attractions, shopping and dining but off the busy streets.
I am somewhat reluctant to rate this hotel so highly as it was a steal for the price we paid ( 255 pounds with brkfst included) and am afraid that this time next year it will be significantly higher. However, we will definitely try to book there again on our next trip across the pond.",5,2011,09,12
143,"Stunningly beautiful, with it were better located","The hotel is absolutely stunning -- gorgeous materials, classic, creative and stylish.  Service was impeccable and friendly.  The room was bright and large and all products were of the highest quality.  The area is not bad (close toTrafalgar Square and the Thames) but is near many government buildings so it is quiet at night.  It is close to everything by walk, tube and taxi and -- with all the restaurants and spa -- you hardly want to leave.  I would definitely stay there again.",4,2011,09,12
143,"Impeccable style, unbeatable location","The newly opened Corinthia in London is definitely part of the top end London hotels when it comes to style and location. The rooms are spacious, very tastefully designed and the selection of amenities is perfect. I did not have time to use the spa, but it seems to be a very nice addition to the city. My restaurant experience was limited, since I was on a business event there. But the crew does a great job – and overall it is a positive surprise to see that a rather new hotel is running as smoothly already.",5,2011,09,12
143,best hotel in london,"stayed here for my mothers birthday on a weekend break.from the start to finish this hotel delivered on every count.Upon arrival we were greeted by isabell who proceded to guide us through to the courtyard area where we were treated to a bottle of champagne.We then arrived at our rooms which were connecting and more champagne and chocolates waited.
the rooms were spotlessly clean ,very large  and very very stylish.the bathrooms are huge with sinks baths and showers at every turn and even  a tv to watch whilst soaking in the huge tub.the staff we met are all attentive ,polite  and eager to please without been overbearing  in fact you can tell the hotel has invested a lot of time  and money on this side of the operations and it is really paying dividends.
the breakfast proved to be probably the best i have ever had in a hotel anywhere in the world  ,again excellent attentive service . great menu  and all served  to your table .Well done the corinthia this is a hotel  you can be proud of and one i will use on future trips to london.",5,2011,09,11
143,Children in the spa? Are they mad?,This hotel is rather wonderful especially the spa. Espa Life as it's called has state of the art pieces and decor but why on earth are children allowed in?  The whole purpose of a spa is to relax and get some peace and quiet - how is that possible with children splashing in the pool and running around squealing? This is a very bad decision by the management. I had a great spa treatment which wasn't cheap (but excellent) and I couldn't relax in the spa area because of some kids wrecking the serene atmosphere. The spa has obviously had some serious cash spent on it so why spoil it by allowing kids in?,5,2011,09,09
143,surburb hotel,"This is a fantastic hotel. immaculately clean.Staff very helpful and pleasant.Rooms furnished to a very high standard.Food was excellent, would certainly stay there again,I would recommend it to anyone.Only one complaint,on the Sunday morning we had to wait 35mins, before we were served breakfast,and then not all together,three of us were almost finnished , when my daughter's finally came. Staff were very apologetic, saying Sunday was a busy time in the kitchen.Surely this could be rectified.I noticed other guests were unhappy about this situation also.",5,2011,09,05
143,"Lacks vitality, no buzz at all","Beautiful hotels, well anointed guest rooms and spacious bathrooms. However, There is one major drawback which is a lack of special area for suitcases. In fact, the closets are small and suitcases would not fit and they have to be placed at rather inconvenient area.
Another issue is breakfast. The staff at the restaurant did not seem to know how breakfast should be served. The pace of service, where teapots should be placed, should be proper. The uniform of the staff in the restaurant as well as in the reception all seemed rather casual, perhaps is the light colour of those suits, not befitting of a 5 star hotel in London. The lobby is beautiful and is too bad there are just so few clients, so most of the time, the staff are just standing around chatting amongst themselves. 
The entrace of Corinthia is so quiet throughout the day with hardly a doorman seen,  lacking the pompness of a grand establishment such as the Ritz or the Claridges. Unless these shortcomings are noted and be rectified, I will be reluctant to recommend it to my friends or associates.",4,2011,09,02
143,Afternoon Tea - fabulous,"Excellent hotel for afternoon tea - venue, surroundings, service and food are all top-notch.  Thoroughly recommend.  Plus, as it is a new hotel, it is blissfully quiet.... so far!  Don't tell everyone about it....",5,2011,08,30
143,Stunning Hotel,"We stayed for three nights in an Executive Courtyard room.

The Corinthia was absolutely divine, the room was large, and included a walk in wardrobe and a huge bathroom, with a bath and separate toilet and shower.

We really didn't feel like The Corinthia was lacking in any areas, it combined all the best features of other hotel rooms that we've stayed in around the world.

In addition the lobby and the restaurants are stunning, as is the spa. Don't make the same mistake as us and only discover the pool/sauna on your last night, it is well worth checking out.

Also if it is important to you they have one of the best hotel gyms I've used.

We would not hesitate to stay here again, without a doubt one of the most impressive hotels we have stayed at.",5,2011,08,30
143,London's best fitted out hotel and potential for best hotel.,"We stayed for a 7 nights in August after I checked out the hotel in May.  Let me address the negative - breakfast and particularly service.  While breakfast is pretty good there are areas for improvement - I think the bread  for such a top of the line hotel is a bit ordinary and laying out hams one slice thin on the metal serving plate looks good -it also dries out. Toast never got to the table hot, and mostly scraped for after getting a bit burnt. Service for breakfast is hit and miss- the first day we waited for 45 minutes for Eggs Benedict - not good enough, and other days were also too slow.  I addressed this with some of the management and hopefully it will be addressed because otherwise this is an outstanding hotel. Rooms are a good size especially for London, with high ceilings and a great quality fit out - stayed at the Connaught earlier in the year and the rooms just feel so much more spacious partly due to ceiling height.. Showers are excellent, as are mattresses. The public areas are spectacular - the light fittings in particular are superb.  We ate in both restaurants and had excellent meals with Northall being particularly good value.  The spa, especailly for London, is something to check out - super cool with black tiles and aluminum pool and a fantastic looking sauna. If you have money for a suite-  the Riverside Suite is fantastic -for similar price to Intercontinental (Park Lane) for that week where a colleague stayed I was simply embarassed that he paid GBP1350 for the Intercon when he could have had Riverside Suite for similar - at least 3 x bigger and so much better fittted out.  I will definitely be staying again and was happy that I had previously signed up a corporate rate - but August rate publicly available rate offer at sub GBP300 was better and a great deal. If they can sort out breakfast service, for me this is the best hotel in London bar none. 
Further plsitive is location - If you want to be near the City or Theatre it is fantastic. For west end shops a little less convenient, but Embankment station 200 metres away  is probably most convenient in London given 2 north- south lines plus 2 east-west, plus Charing Cross 5 minute walk and Waterloo over the Millennium bridge which is 200 metres away, Also up Northumberland Av is a very good value Japanese restaurant - Watatsumi. I really recommend people to push for good rate while it is still relatively unknown as I can see in a year's time it may be much harder to get a low room rate.",4,2011,08,29
143,Exceptional Stay in London!,"Just got back from a 4 night stay at the Corinthia and am missing it already. Read reviews beforehand and had some concerns around new hotel teething issues... can honestly say they were unfounded. 

Facilities are gorgeous, the spa area in particular unlike anything I've ever seen in a hotel. Rooms are nice size, beds are luxo comfy, finishes are really exceptional. What a pleasure to come back to after a day about the town. Staff and service was top notch... extremely pleasant, discrete, responsive. Breakfast was delicious, both in the room and in Northhall. 

Location is central to everything... Embankment tube right around the corner and Golden Jubilee footbridge just down the street. Btw looking for a great pub? Try the Clarence just  down the street from the hotel on Whitehall, awesome pub grub! 

Kudos to Corinthia for getting it right and providing an enjoyable stay... we'll be staying there next time we're in town.",5,2011,08,19
143,Best Hotel in London by a Long Way!,"I travel regularly for business and pleasure, and its been a while since a hotel has impressed me as much as the Corinthia London. Dinner at the Northall was perfect and the staff were very attentive to all our needs. The highlight was the ESPA facilities and it is simply the most beautiful and state of the art SPA in the world. I would like to thank all the staff for their hospitality during our 3 night stay and i will definitely recommend this to everyone who wants to experience the very best in hotel hospitatlity.",5,2011,08,16
143,One of the best hotels in london with a great location to match,"This hotel is visually stunning, the lobby is a peace of art and the spa is un-describable 
the rooms where very good as they should be.
the spa was one of the best spas I have ever been to, it had equipment I've never seen before.
however on our third day at the hotel  the Jacuzzi broke down because people snuck in and accidentally dropped glass in the Jacuzzi, should'nt the spa have some sort of security to prevent this! any way it was out of order for the rest of our visit.
There was also other problems with this new hotel, for example it had teething problems with the service but it was not that bad.
I would stay here again",5,2011,08,12
143,Nice new hotel in London with a few oddities,"I stayed here for a night on business in August. The location is excellent - within walking distance to many of the sights and theaters. Due to a late arrival and early departure, I wasn't able to take advantage of the hotel's restaurant or fitness facilities. The room itself was well-appointed, although I was a little put off by the presence of an ashtray considering that the entire hotel is non-smoking. Also, while it was nice that there was a Nespresso machine in the room, it was strangely on a table which was crammed behind another table by the window. Maybe it was just this particular room, but I found the arrangement to be a bit odd. Otherwise, very clean and nice place to stay in London. I would return!",4,2011,08,07
143,"Lunch, the Northhall. Excellent value stunning hotel.","The daily menu is excellent value, £22 for three courses. Opulent hotel and restaurant, look forward to returning to have the burger next time and to try cocktails in the evening.",5,2011,08,06
143,Will be fantastic....when it is finished,"My daughter and I stayed at the Corinthia while attending Wimbledon. The hotel is gorgeous, the location excellent and the staff tries hard to please. The problem is that the hotel is brand new and there are kinks to be worked out and training still to be done....and construction still happening. 
I would recommend waiting a bit and trying it in a few months. It is going to be a winner.",3,2011,07,25
143,Luxury and Finess at its best,"Being a new hotel in London I wanted to try it out. After reading about it, its appeal increased and I got tempted to try it on my next trip to London. All I can say is that the experience was fantastic. 

Once entering the from the outside, the warm surrounding inside the hotel immediately welcomed me. The décor is nothing short from spectacular, especially when one looks at the surrounding details. The finish is extenuated to the rooms and all the services.

Whilst there I also had the pleasure of visiting The Northall for dinner, which I also recommend.",5,2011,07,23
143,Brilliant London Hotel,"Recently stayed at the Corinthia. It is quite impressive even if you are a seasoned luxury traveller. Especially in a city like London where top hotels are often limited and confined by the buildings they inhabit, a total brick by brick rebuild comes out even more impressive. The facilities are top notch. The rooms are easily on par with Park Hyatt, Trump and the better Mandarin O's. No doubt. The location is pretty good. I can see that traffic wise its a bit slow getting into the central shopping areas, but thats really not unique to this hotel... The service in my experience was excellent. Room Service food was good, quick, correct. Cleaning and anemities very nice and as it should be. The only thing I could fault is the limited time slots for kids using the pool. I know its mentioned in the in-room guide to the hotel, but perhaps they should mention it at check-in if people are travelling with kids. I know my daughter was disappointed. The ESPA girls were - uhm - not really to my liking. But thats more a personal opinion. The servers in the lobby bar were a bit akward and robotic, and almost too afraid making a mistake, which made it a bit akward. All other staff I encountered were above and beyond 5 stars. Will certainly revisit.",5,2011,07,22
143,"Great building, average location & poor service","We stayed here for 4 days during a short holiday to London. 

1) The building is stunning, both outside and inside. In the public areas such as the lobby and restaurant, you get very high ceilings and the decoration is very stylish. 
2) The location, while very central, isn't the best. To get there, you need to go past Trafalgar Square, where the traffic is constantly clogged up. As a result, not many taxies drive pass the street (Whitehall Place). But I guess an upside is that the street and building do not suffer from much noise. 
3) The staff needs a lot more training. On the day we arrived, we called house service several times across two hours, the line was engaged every time. We asked for some amenities to be delivered to the room; it took several people several visits to get us what we needed. Our TV wasn't working; after  three visits from housekeeping, I was told that they couldn't fix the problem because it was going to be the weekend. 

This hotel has the potential to be great. However, it is ultimately the level of service that makes the difference between a mediocre hotel and a great hotel. To the management of this company who has undoubtedly poured in a lot of money into this project, please take note. You don't really get second chances. On my next trip to London, I will probably be staying at a different hotel.",4,2011,07,17
143,Not ready to take the training wheels off yet,"Stayed at the Corinthia for 4 nights for a combination of business and holiday. Visually, the hotel is stunning - absolutely worth the 5 star rating. Sadly, the service is not up to that level. Maybe this is a factor of being relatively new.
The first issue came when my 7 year old son and I arrived. The person at check in invited us to go view the pool and fitness center. We did so (these are accessible, or rather relatively inaccessible) through the spa. When we went to the spa and said we would like to look at the pool and fitness facilities as per reception's suggestion we got passed off to 4 different people, having to explain to each why we were there. It was terrible, they made us feel like we shouldn't be there, with their comments such as ""we don't give tours"" nd acting like they were doing us a special favour letting us in. Finally we got lead down a very opulent but warren-like spa to ""near"" the pool. They refused to let us actually see the pool. Then they said my son could only swim in the pool during two off-time 1 1/2 hour slots. Way to make your guests feel unwelcome!
Next we tried the restaurants. Again they look lovely, but I was concerned to find something my son would like. After some time looking at the menu, I asked if perhaps there was a children's menu. WOW!  turns out there was, unfortunately even if you are with a child they do not think to show that to you unless you specifically ask for it.
The third strike was in getting the room made up. they have these lovely little buttons in the room, one of which says ""Make up Room"", so we left at 9:30am having pressed the ""make up room"" button. We came back briefly at 2pm, light still on, room not made up. We came back at 5:30pm - ROOM STILL NOT MADE UP. We phoned down, they asked if we had called down int he morning to ask for the room to be made up. Really? Wouldn't having your room made up at some point in the day be a relatively regular occurrence in a hotel? Especially a supposed 5 star one, especially if you had this crazy idea that lighting the ""make up room"" button actually alerted them to make the room up?
Last little jem - their wireless is hopelessly slow. Reminded me of the good old days of dial-up.
There are lots of great hotels in London - next time I'll choose another one!",1,2011,07,14
143,Smile Free Hotel,"This is a beautiful building full of smile free people. Service in the Massimo restaurant is very poor - slow, unattentive and totally smile free. This hotel does not even know who it's GM is. Ruth Scanlan and Mathew Dixon both sign comments on this site as GM. Once they train the staff things could improve.",2,2011,07,14
143,New hotel of choice in London,I will definitely stay here again on my next visit assuming rate is ok.  Got a good rate maybe because it was still in opening stages.  The rooms were of incredible quality... you notice it right away.  Common areas were exquisite and clean.  Breakfast wasn't extravagant but decent.  Fitness center wasn't open yet so can't comment on that.  Only questionable things were: issues surrounding hotel ownership and why are adult channels part of the regular programming accessible by just flipping channels?,5,2011,07,11
143,Simply the BEST,"Incredible warm greeting upon arrival - was taken to my room - and given clear instructions on how to operate various room functions - 
This hotel is quality - from the salt scrub to the paintings in the magnificent restaurants and bars - in all my years traveling around the world - I have never seen such an amazing spa - such incredible details in the ceilings and decor. Since this hotel is a new build and has not been a former hotel that has simply been refurbished - this is London’s hidden gem - and I would stay there again and again
This is easily  the Best of London""",5,2011,07,10
143,Perfect location. Fantastic rooms. Great food. Perfect gym. 5 star class.,"I had the privilege of staying 4 days in the new Corintha for a company conference. It has been a great experience. The room is superb and very spacious. The location couldn't be better and the breakfast is stunning. The hotel is not cheap, but it is truly world class!",5,2011,06,30
143,New hotel in beautifully restored belle epoque premises - highyl recommended,"The Corinthia is a worthy addition to London’s competitive luxury hotel scene.  Well located for the main tourist sites or the theatre, galleries, restaurants and museums in the West End and easy access to the Embankment Tube station next door, this is a new, spacious and beautifully decorated hotel.  The room was large, nicely furnished with excellent amenities, and with big windows and a nice outlook.  No dank gloomy rooms here.  However, the mark of an excellent hotel must surely be the quality of its staff and their empowerment to respond appropriately to its customer’s request for service.  Here, the employees are professional, knowledgeable and friendly, without being overly familiar.  Restaurant staff are obviously highly trained and experienced professionals and not merely keen amateurs. I have not previously heard of this hotel chain, but based on my own recent experience, it is up there in the league of the Four Seasons, Aman, Mandarin Oriental and the Peninsula hotels.  I highly recommend this hotel to London visitors.",5,2011,06,27
143,top notch hotel with best service in london,had drinks in the lobby bar and ate at massimo. This hotel is beautiful but even better is the staff who I think are the best in London. The food was great. This hotel is excellent. I will definitely go back.,5,2011,06,19
143,What a splendid hotel!,"We enjoyed lunch at the Corinthia (The Northall) a quiet Sunday afternoon after having heard many great comments from friends in the hotel business. The hotel was airy and bright despite the unplesant rainy day outside - a true testament to the skill of the interior designer! The light interiors and fresh flowers immediately made you forget about the world outside - and we were quickly wisked off to the Northall restaurant to enjoy our lunch. The dining room with its soaring ceilings and pleasant colour scheme is still intimate with elegant tobacco coloured leather chairs and banquets. The staff was fantastic, and we were pleased to see that a high chair had already been arranged for our son. Service was effortless and natural, and the plesant staff made the lunch a true enjoyment. The Maitre d' was personable, and took the time to come by and chat at multiple occasions - exchanging pleasantries with our son who loved the attention. Several other members of staff asked our son for his name (he is 2 1/2) - and bid him farewell by name when leaving. This is the level of service that makes one happy to pay a premium for a great experience.

The meal itself was was flawlessly executed. The food was most enjoyable, and our Rib of Beef served with an excellent and succulent Grenache from Spain (recommendation of the sommelier) was a nice treat. Three of the diners, including the author, are seasoned hospitality professionals, and in a typical year we see and experience several hundred hotels. As such, we may be slightly more critical than your average guest - but we were all blown away by the genuine luxury experience. In fact, it would have been easy to just lounge away most of the day at the hotel amogst pleasant interiors and excellent staff.

Following our lunch we proceeded to tour the rooms of the hotel.  While we were not staying as guests, the rooms were elegant and inviting - paying hommage to the historical nature of the building with classy and elegant furnishings. The devil is in the detail they say, and this is perhaps where the Corinthia has the most suprises for their guests.

While the Corinthia brand may be lesser know for the luxury traveller - the quality of the hotel and staff should give the London luxury scene a serious run for their money. This is not stuffy London luxury, but a fresh breath for the contemporary luxury traveller. Well done and hope this hotel will achieve its rightful place in the London luxury scene.",5,2011,06,13
143,Best rooms in London,Just stayed on a recent trip for business. The standard rooms are as large as suites in other hotels and with all the amenities.  This is my new favorite hotel in London,5,2011,05,10
143,Afternoon tea in Lobby Lounge and a tour of hotel.,"After having seen Corinthia London's photos (mostly computer generated) online, I was impressed enough to make a booking for afternoon tea. Being a new hotel, I was curious to see how their tea experience would compare to the long standing hotels: Claridges, Ritz, Dorchester and Lanesborough (The Big Four).

The hotel is right next to Trafalgar Square and Embankment Tube - easy access to Westminster, the West End and Buckingham Palace. St James Park is not far and the street itself, Whitehall Place is lovely and quiet.

Inside, the lobby is elegant. Clear vases of white arum lilies were scattered throughout the hotel.

Afternoon tea is served in the Lobby Lounge which is in between the hotel’s two main entrances. Personally, like the big 4, I would have carpeted the floor in the LL to distinguish itself from the surrounding spaces. The feel of the LL is very similar to Apsleys at The Lanesborough due to its sky light & chandelier, but with less formal table settings. The decor is very polished, with natural light flooding from above. There are plans to open a side garden courtyard which will be a unique, welcomed feature.

Despite a few problems with our reservation confirmation, this was soon made up by a personal apology from the LL Assistant Manager, Mr. Carmine, who continued to serve us. This was an excellent touch and he couldn't do enough to make this a positive and lasting experience for us. 

I was seriously impressive by the scones here. The cakes were nice too, as I find most hotel afternoon tea cakes look the part but taste bland. Not so here. The scones were perfectly formed, just warm and ever so crumbly yet stable enough to hold in your hand before gorging away at them. Inside, they were so fluffy, better, dare I say than Claridges which, up until now, served the best scones (Savoy’s were surprisingly large and chewy).

The selection of tea was average, not monstrous like the big 4 but of high quality. This was fine for us but for those who are serious about their tea selection, may demand more. My only concern when (not if) I visit again will be the seating arrangements. Like the Promenade in The Dorchester, the LL’s table settings demand customers to share the same sofa as your stranger neighbour, and some tables were 10cm away from the next,  neither which I am not a fan off. There are separate tables for you and your co, if so desired, which we had on this occasion, so do request this at time of booking. I did pass on feedback regarding the music they were playing from the speakers, which included Bob Dylon. I don’t mind not having a live harpist or pianist playing during tea like the big 4 but tourists or even Londoners on a grand day out might expect this.  I suggested they play classical music – it’s a safe bet. For me, good scones beat live pianists. All the other fine details I look for in an Afternoon tea experience were met. 

Afterwards, I requested a tour of the guestrooms which also included the two restaurants and bar - all stunning, particularly the the Massimo restaurant and the fireplace in the Bassoon bar. The hotel is not finished, but I wouldn't let this put you off staying here. I noticed plenty of security. The guest rooms were cosy, modern yet stately in decor. Rooms have a city view or Juliet balcony (my preference), which reminded me of Paris. Homely touches avoid this from being a ‘corporate hotel', which given it's location, could easily have been. The bathrooms are big and all have a window. Unfortunately the spa was unfinished so we were unable to view it – but it will be ESPA’s global flagship spa, again with impressive CG images so no doubt I’ll try this when it opens.",5,2011,05,06
143,Top spot in London,"My family and I spent a great week at Corinthia. I had particularly high expectations of this stay because my family was there. Now I am sure there would have been no better place for us to go on holiday in London. 

The location of the hotel is second to none in my opinion as it is super central yet comparatively quiet. In a few steps you are at the Thames, St James Park or Trafalgar Square. Westminster Abbey and Big Ben are just a short walk from the hotel. 

The rooms are spacious, well cut and offer maximum privacy. I love the design and layout of the bathrooms (toilet and shower are each separated). The shower has very good water pressure. The tub is large and just perfect for relaxing. Some bathrooms have natural light.  

The SPA area with heated pool is second to none - beautiful and there are times only for adults where you can enjoy your peace and quiet. There is also a large jacuzzi, steam bath and sauna, so you can relax well after a day in the city. 

The service and friendliness of the staff are absolutely unique - you rarely experience anything like this anywhere in the world. The kindness does not seem superimposed. The staff seem to like working here and the guest feels that. I've never seen people go to such lengths to satisfy the guest. Every extra wish was fulfilled. 

Despite the high level of other 5-star hotels in London, Corinthia remains my number one hotel in the city. I just feel right at home here (or better). 

Thanks for the great time to all the staff and also very special thanks to Jason, Lucia and Janusz. My family and I will never forget this stay and will remember it fondly.",5,2024,07,26
143,An incomparably beautiful stay,"The team at the Corinthia London gave us an unforgettable weekend. We never thought we could find this level of perfection in a hotel. It starts with the rooms, the food and drinks and ends with the most important thing: the people. To be welcomed with such friendliness, courtesy and attention was simply outstanding. We often had the feeling that they had the ability to read minds and fulfill our wishes before they even came up.

sprich, wird das zimmer gereinigt , reichen 1500£ nicht. können alles belegen und ist kein joke",3,2023,01,15
143,Charmantes Corinthia,"Gerne kommen wir wieder zurück in dieses wunderbare Hotel. Beste Lage an der Themse, U-Bahn in unmittelbarer Nähe, ruhig, komfortabel und elegant. Die Suiten sind geräumig und stilvoll möbliert, das Frühstück ist klasse und der Service sehr präsent und stets dem Gast zugewandt. Stimmungsvolle Weihnachtsdeko und die neue Bar „Velvet“ mit Livemusik ist eine weitere Bereicherung.
Für uns das Hotel in London!",5,2022,11,25
143,Family-Trip to London,Wir waren für 4 Tage mit der ganzen Familie (5 Personen) in London. der Concierge hat uns bereits vor der Anreise super beraten und sich um alles gekümmert. Das gesamte Team des Hotels ist super freundlich ! Das Frühstücksbuffet ein Traum ! Wirklich empfehlenswert,5,2022,04,14
143,BASSOON BAR TOP!,"La mia recensione é per il basson bar, perché purtroppo nel mio soggiorno a Londra non ho alloggiato in questo hotel.

Struttura per quello che ho potuto vedere di livello altissimo. 
Il bar non da meno.

Cocktail “gold” a base di vodka grey goose con foglia oro davvero eccezionale e ben calibrato.
Anche le altre tre persone che hanno preso altri drink confermano la mia esperienza. 

Nulla era fuori contesto. Dalla curatissima location, all’illuminazione, alla selezione e volume della musica, a come detto la qualità dei drink, all’abbigliamento e l’atteggiamento discreto di tutto il personale.

Un plauso particolare alla professionalità e gentilezza della supervisor Alena, alla bravura e velocità del nostro cameriere Emanuele, e in generale di tutti i ragazzi che erano a lavoro.

P.s. Ciliegina sulla torta, al tavolo di fronte al mio, ad un certo punto si é seduto uno dei miei attori preferiti: Ethan Hawke!",5,2022,03,18
143,"Brillant, nach dem letzten Feinschliff  ","Vor mehreren Jahren durfte ich schon einmal das Corinthia Hotel in London besuchen. Schon damals war es ein Juwel inmitten der Stadt.
Seine besondere Lage, ist gerade für Wochenendtouristen ideal. Viele Sehenswürdigkeiten sind fußläufig zu erreichen.
Der Concierge ist für sämtliche Planungen und Tipps gerne bereit.
Nach langen Touren durch London, freut man sich auf den aussergewöhnlich großen Spa Bereich. Hier kann man es sich richtig gut gehen lassen.
Abends hat man die Wahl zwischen mehreren Restaurants, oder man lässt sich vom Roomservice verwöhnen.
Unsere Penthouse Suite ( Zimmer 605) erstreckte sich über zwei Stockwerke und verfügte über alles was das Herz begehrt.
Dass alles vom feinsten und penibel sauber war, brauche ich hier nicht zu erwähnen. 
Das Frühstücksbuffet  war spitze. Hier fand man alles um den Tag perfekt zu beginnen.
Sollte ich wieder nach London reisen, ist dieses Hotel auf jeden Fall meine erste Adresse.
Der Rohdiamant hat einen brillanten Schliff bekommen.

143,Cena al ristorante ,"Il ristorante di questo bellissimo hotel è aperto al pubblico. Si mangia molto bene, non certo tipico inglese, ma la cucina è leggera e raffinata, di ispirazione italiana, mi è sembrato. Il personale è attentissimo alle tue esigenze. C’è sempre qualcuno che parla italiano per spiegare alcuni dettagli a chi l’inglese non lo pratica benissimo. Interessante la carta dei vini, con proposte dalla Nuova Zelanda che possono competere con i Colli orientali del Friuli. I prezzi rispetto l’ambiente sono buoni. ",5,2019,09,21
143,Ausgezeichnet!,"Leider verbrachten wir nur zwei Tage im ""Corinthia Hotel London"",
und konnten so nicht alle Annehmlichkeiten nutzen,die das Hotel bietet:
Da gibt es ein wunderschönes Spa,mehrere tolle Restaurants;
am Nachmittag werden Tee und Brötchen serviert,
es gibt mehrere Bars und vieles mehr...
Wir hatten ein 39 Quadratmeter großes Zimmer mit einem kleinen Ankleideraum und einem sehr schönen Bad.
Es gab verschiedene Lichtquellen,die man auch getrennt einschalten konnte.
Das Frühstück schmeckte ausgezeichnet und es gab eine große Auswahl.
Das Personal war sehr freundlich und kompetent.
Danke an Herrn Guillaume Le Gal(Concierge),der uns immer geduldig und besonders gut beraten hat und an Frau Sandra(Rezeption),sie waren großartig!
Wir kommen wieder",5,2019,07,23
143,Una decepción,"Nos hospedamos 7 noches en una habitación executive King y la experiencia fue decepcionante. Habiendo elegido el hotel en parte por sus buenas reseñas en tripadvisor no tuvimos la estancia que esperábamos. 
1. En primer lugar, al utilizar la ducha la primera mañana el baño se inundó por completo y tuvimos que limpiarlo nosotras mismas. Esto requirió dos llamados a mantenimiento quienes en su segunda visita nos comentaron que la rejilla existente no soporta la presión de agua de una ducha muy grande, con lo cual el resto de los días pudimos utilizar sólo la mitad de la presión de la ducha para facilitar que el agua drenara correctamente, 
2. La habitación tenía también otras fallas de mantenimiento (manija rota en la puerta del baño, una luz no prendía también en el baño, ausencia de tomas de electricidad cerca de espejos), todas comentadas al personal del hotel y no resueltas en su totalidad. 
3. Ordenamos unos paquetes por Amazon que no estaban en la habitación al regresar al hotel. Al consultar en conserjería no nos dieron una respuesta inmediata, dijeron que nos llamarían. Cuando después de 40 minutos nadie se había comunicado, al llamar nosotras nos dijeron que habían encontrado finalmente el paquete y que lo mandarían a la habitación, lo cual también tomó un tiempo considerable.
4. Al hacer el check out había cargos de un bar al que nunca habíamos ido, como así también se nos había cobrado por pedir agua en el desayuno (incluido), lo cual no sólo nunca se nos había comunicado si no que nos parece por lo menos de mal gusto en un hotel de esta categoría, nunca antes nos habían cobrado el agua! 
Como positivo, destacamos la ubicación del hotel, muy buena para visitar muchos lugares de interés caminando. El personal del hotel era mayormente amable e intentaba solucionar las falencias. 
Por todos estos motivos no volvería.",3,2019,02,28
143,Una volta nella vita!,"Una volta nella vita vale la pena regalarsi una notte qui, anche se ovviamente il prezzo non è indifferente. Meravigliosi i saloni nel periodo natalizio, stanze molto ampie, con il bagno che prevede sia doccia che vasca (c'è anche la tv) e riscaldamento a pavimento. Letto perfetto, spa meravigliosa con piscina, idromassaggi vari, sauna, bagno turco. La spa può essere usata in determinati orari anche dai bimbi piccoli, cosa apprezzatissima da nostra figlia di 3 anni che ha avuto anche mini-accappatoio, ciabattine, prodotti da bagno solo per lei, oltre al pelouche nel lettino che ha trovato in camera. Personale sempre cordiale e nota di supermerito per una colazione indimenticabile. Anche la posizione, tra Trafalgar square e Downing street, perfetta. Da tornarci ogni anno, se si potesse.",5,2019,01,24
143,Eine totale Enttäuschung!,"Ich habe das Hotel wegen der sehr guten Bewertungen gebucht. Das erlebte liess mich jedoch daran zweifeln, ob es sich dabei um das selbe Hotel handelt. Der erste Eindruck am Empfang und Lobby war sehr gut. Auch der Service war stehts bemüht einen freundlichen Eindruck zu vermitteln aber nicht mehr als durschnittlich. Ich hatte das Familienpacket mit zwei Zimmer für eine Nacht gebucht bei einem Preis von 1200€ die Nacht erwarte ich einen excellenten Service und top Zimmer. Schon beim Weg auf das Zimmer wurde jedoch klar, dass dies hier nicht der Fall sein wird. Teppiche abgenutzt sowie die Armaturen beim Lift. Einchecken hat auch sehr lange gedauert. 

Das Zimmer: 

Kopfteil des Bettes mit riesigen Braunen Flecken. Ich möchte gar nicht wissen, was da passiert ist.

Undefinierbare Rückstände auf den Gardinien.

Teppich verfleckt und seit der Eröffnung wohl nicht mehr gereinigt. Ebenfalls eingetrocknet Rückstände.

Recamiere verschmutzt und abgenutzt.

Gläser der Minibar nur kurz abgewischt.

Die Möbel allgemein waren in einem sehr abgenutzten Zustand.

Der Zustand der Möbel und Reinigung zeigte sich in beiden Zimmern.

Kein süsser Willkomensgruss oder frische Blumen auf dem Zimmer. Oder eine Flasche Wasser. 

Früstück:

Eher mässige Auswahl. Service durchzogen.Beim dritten mal Kaffe bestellen hat es mit der Bestellung geklappt.  Egg benedict ist extra zu bezahlen - noch nie erlebt.

Da wir am nächsten Mittag bereits wieder auscheckten wurde mir als Entschuldigung Der Transport zum Flughafen angeboten. Der Fahrer fuhr derart ruppig, dass sich meine Frau am Flughafen angekommen übergeben musste. 

Das Hotel ist definitiv den Preis nicht wert und wird mich sobald nicht mehr sehen.",1,2019,01,06
143,Bemerkenswert freundlicher Service ,"Wir hatten eine Juniorsuite im 4 Stock zum Innenhof. Die Räume waren angenehm groß. Sehr gut ausgestattetes Badezimmer mit bequemer Regendusche. Leider am Abend komplett überheizt mit mangelnder Regulierungsmöglichkeit an der Lüftungsanlage. Der 3.  Bademantel wurde vergessen für unseren Sohn. Ebenfalls war die Versorgung mit Wasserflaschen durch den Turndownservice unzureichend. Das Frühstück entsprach den Erwartungen. Hervorzuheben ist der besonders freundliche Empfang an der Rezeption, auch vom Doorman und in der Lounge. Ebenso im Frühstückssaal. Die bemerkenswerte Freundlichkeit des Personals zeichnet das Haus aus! Die Effizienz des Housekeeping’s kann verbessert werden. ",4,2018,09,02

143,Phantastisches Erlebnis,"Das Hotel ist eines der herausragenden Häuser in London. Die Lage in Laufweite zum London Eye, Trafalgar Square, Big Ben, etc und trotzdem sehr ruhigem Umfeld ist perfekt für einen London-Aufenthalt.

Zimmer

Die Zimmer sind sehr geräumig, verfügen über eine tolle Ausstattung und sind sehr gepflegt. Der Zimmerservice funktionierte reibungslos. Den Zimmern merkt man eine persönliche Note an, die man heute auch in guten Häusern selten findet.

Check-In/Concierge 

Das Personal beim Check-in war sehr hilfsbereit, auch der Concierge-Service glänzte mit Freundlichkeit, Fachkompetenz, Witz und Charme und könnte uns tolle Empfehlungen geben.

Frühstück 

Das Highlight ist das Frühstücksbüffet mit einer großen Auswahl frischer Früchte, perfekten Eier-Spezialitäten, großer Brotauswahl, dem besten Bircher Müsli, das ich jemals probieren durfte, sehr freundlichem und aufmerksamen Personal, das jeden Sonderwunsch erfüllt.",5,2018,05,11

143,Ottimo soggiorno!,"Abbiamo soggiornato due notti per impegni di lavoro a Londra.
La posizione è centralissima (walking distance da Westminster e Trafalgar Square) e la struttura è di un lusso discreto, senza eccessi che a volte appesantiscono gli spazi comuni. Camera superior ben arredata e dotata di tutti i comfort. Ottimo l'afternoon tea nella lounge centrale e la prima colazione.
Tutto lo Staff è molto professionale e gentile, una menzione particolare a Sahil del servizio concierge e a Melissa della reception, per la loro cordialità ed efficienza.
Torneremo sicuramente",5,2018,03,27
143,Lusso e spa per i 30aa,"Ho avuto come regalo da amiche una notte in questo incredibile albergo, con accesso spa. Ovviamente si tratta di un hotel di lusso, in uno dei quartieri più cari di Londra , quindi risparmio ovvietà tipo: servizio impeccabile, ambienti stupendi, arredi scenici, letto comodissimo king, bagno enorme con tutti i confort, massima pulizia. Ma voglio sottolineare due cose che fanno la differenza: la SPA è tra le spa più belle del mondo, senza se e senza ma, e ci hanno anche regalato dei prodotti da portare a casa; e la colazione è incredibile: dal pesce crudo, ai dolci caldi, a qualsiasi tipo di alimento tu voglia. 
Insomma, se economicamente si può, è imperdibile.",5,2018,03,11

143,Bello ma,"È il miglior hotel che ho frequentato a Londra e sicuramente merita gran parte dei complimenti letti sulle recensioni. Ci siamo fermati tre giorni e non si può certo dire che non ci siamo trovati bene ma ... C'è un ma!!!! Quando si vuole essere un grande albergo ci si deve differenziare sui particolari e qui siamo scivolati. Temperatura in camera poco regolabile, accessori nel bagno qualche volta riforniti e qualche volta no, cioccolatino la sera sul letto ora si ora no, bevo il caffè che non viene rimpiazzato etc. Tutte piccolezze in un contesto di grande livello ma le cinque stelle meritano anche questo.",4,2017,11,03

143,"ELEGANTE, SBALORDITIVO, TOP","Si resta a bocca aperta quando si entra al Corinthia Hotel di Londra, posizione magnifica a pochi passi da Trafalgar Square.
Accoglienza eccellente alla reception con il front officer che ci fa fare il giro dei saloni dell'hotel, dei bar e ristoranti prima di accompagnarci nella stanza.
La nostra era una stanza magnifica, una suite, ma posso immaginare che anche le stanze ""standard"" siano di livello eccelso.
Uno dei ristoranti più famosi di Londra, Massimo Restaurant & Oyster Bar si trova proprio  nell'hotel e quindi si ha un passaggio dall'interno dell'hotel.
Merita una nota a parte la SPA dell'hotel. Oltre ai classici trattamenti da SPA (che non abbiamo provato) la parte di piscine , idromassaggio etc è qualcosa di mai visto.
Oltre alla grandezza degli spazi sono rimasto senza parole quando ho visto i letti di fronte al camino (finto) dove rilassarsi. 
Esperienza da provare. Tutto davvero oltre le attese e oltre le 5 Stelle.",5,2017,10,08
143,Perfekter Aufenthalt,"Ich hatte beschlossen meinen 30. Geburtstag nicht zu Hause zu verbringen sondern in meiner Lieblingsstadt. Um das Ganze wirklich zu etwas besonderem zu machen, hatte ich mir das Corinthia Hotel ausgesucht. Und selbst, wo diese Reise schon einige Zeit her ist, denke ich noch sehr gerne an die schönen Tage hier zurück. 
Der Service war vom Zeitpunkt der Anreise immer sehr aufmerksam - die persönliche Begleitung aufs Zimmer, die sehr freundlichen Doormen sowie das Personal im Frühstücksraum. Es hat einfach alles gestimmt. Ebenso der allabendliche Turn-down Service. 
Mein, bei der Buchung geäußerter, Wunsch nach einem Zimmer etwas weiter oben wurde problemlos erfüllt und ich hatte einen sehr schönen Ausblick. Auch hatte ich bei meiner Anreise eine kleine Überraschung zu meinem Geburtstag auf dem Zimmer, was ich als sehr aufmerksam empfand. 
Die Betten sind sehr bequem und ich konnte, trotz Zimmer zur Straßenseite hin, sehr ruhig schlafen. Das Hotel liegt sehr zentral und man erreicht bekannte Punkte wie z.B. das London Eye, Whitehall, Big Ben, Trafalgar Square, die National Gallery und National Portrait Gallery,... in wenigen Minuten gut zu Fuß. Aber auch durch die nahegelegene U-Bahn Station sowie die nahen Bushaltestellen ist man schnell überall dort wo man hin möchte. 
Ich würde das Corinthia jederzeit uneingeschränkt weiterempfehlen und freue mich schon auf den nächsten Aufenthalt.",5,2017,09,24

Das Zimmer war großzügig und freundlich gestaltet und mit allen Annehmlichkeiten ausgestattet, die man für ein Zimmer dieser Kategorie erwartet. 

Aufmerksam hat das Personal vom Gästeservice zur Kenntnis genommen das die Reise ein Geburtstagsgeschenk war, dies wurde durch eine kleine Aufmerksamkeit auf dem Zimmer unterstrichen. 

Die Abreise zum Flughafen mittels Chauffeur Service hat das Hotel organisiert und lief einwandfrei ab. 

Ich kann dieses Hotel uneingeschränkt empfehlen. ",5,2017,09,01
143,Grandios,"Der Aufenthalt von Samstag bis Mittwoch war das Ende unseres Englandurlaubs...und dieses Hotel gehört zu  den besten Stadthotels, die wir weltweit besucht haben.
Die Mitarbeiter waren in allen Bereichen ausgezeichnet. Angefangen beim superfreundlichen Empfang an der Rezeption bei der Anreise, beim Frühstück die wunderbare und hochprofessionelle Daniela, die uns bereits am zweiten Morgen mit Namen begrüßte, die schnellen  Doormen ( auch hier ein rumänischer Mitarbeiter, der uns ganz selbstverständlich mit Namen begrüßte und sich immer nach unserem Wohlergehen erkundigte ) und die blitzsauberen Zimmermädchen.
Das Hotel selbst ist in absolutem Topzustand, alle öffentlichen Räume geschmackvoll und luxuriös, die Blumenarrangements eine Augenweide, der Frühstücksbereich ausreichend groß, das Frühstückangebot entsprechend gut  und hochwertig.
Die Hotelflure im Park Hyatt Stil sehr geschmackvoll und die Zimmer wunderschön. Ausgestattet mit super bequemen Betten, mit großem Bad, begehbarem Kleiderschrank und  sehr guten Pflegeprodukten . Wo bekommt man außerhalb von Asien am Abend ein ständig wechselndes Betthupferl?!
Die Lage des Hotels direkt an der Station Embankement tut ihr Übriges für dieses großartige Hotel.

",5,2017,08,09
143,Lusso e servizi al top,"Il Corinthia Hotel è diventata la mia base a Londra. L'hotel unisce lusso, buon gusto, atmosfera. Ogni dettaglio è super curato, in ogni angolo ci sono composizioni di fiori freschi (all'interno c'è uno dei migliori fiorai della città). Camere e bagni sono ampi ed eleganti. C'è anche un centro benessere di alto livello. Ottima la colazione: ricca e varia. Personale molto preparato, sempre pronto a risolvere qualsiasi esigenza. Su richiesta è disponibile un driver per raggiungere in berlina nera (gratis) una destinazione nel giro di 2 miglia. La posizione è strategica, a pochi passi dalle principali attrazioni. E' tutt'altro che economico, ma il rapporto qualità/prezzo è buono considerato il livello della struttura, delle camere, dei servizi e della posizione.",5,2017,07,20

Anche la posizione centralissima e comoda a qualsiasi mezzo di trasporto lo rendono un'ottima soluzione (anche se certo non economica) per un viaggio di piacere o di lavoro a Londra.",5,2017,05,17
143,Luxus pur,"Wir waren für ein verlängertes Wochenende im Corinthia London. Nach anfänglichen Startschwierigkeiten - Raucherzimmer bekommen, Tasche nicht auf dem Zimmer - bekamen  wir ein Upgrade in ein größeres  Zimmer.
Das Hotel ist wirklich purer Luxus, wunderschön eingerichtet und super-zentral gelegen. 
Das Frühstück ist mehr als reichhaltig und lässt keine Wünsche offen. Dabei sind es auch die kleinen Dinge, die zur Perfektion beitragen, wie etwa vernünftig-grosse Saftgläser, USB-Anschluss im Zimmer, ein großer begehbarer Kleiderschrank und der mehr als zuvorkommende freundliche Service.
Einziges kleines Manko: das überfüllte (aber sonst sehr schöne Spa) mit Gästen, die in Jogginghose und Bikini in die Sauna gehen...
Fazit: ein (nicht ganz billiges) Luxus-Erlebnis!",5,2017,05,01
143,De todo mi Gusto,"Obviamente es un hotel de gran lujo y todos los detalles están cuidados la máximo! Me encanto su mezcla de modernismo con la clase británica! El personal increíblemente atento sobretodo los botones y las chicas del spa! Ah y para quien no lo sepa el spa de este hotel tiene el premio al mejor spa en 2017! La verdad el circuito del spa me decepciono un poco es pequeño aunque los camerinos super lujosos y te dan todo lo necesario para tu aseo personal cuando terminas! Hay un bar de batidos, y el gym con super tecnología y muy bien dotado. Las habitaciones me encantaron con cantidad de detalles (no me quería ir nunca) el baño grande, la comida deliciosa y muy bien ubicado. A 5 min caminando del big ben y del London eye. Para mi vale cada euro q se paga ",5,2017,04,27

Sandwiches alle tip top und frisch, alles am selben Tag gemacht, hat man sofort geschmeckt. Scones traditionell, mit einer Auswahl an Marmelade und Clotted Cream, sehr sehr lecker! Das Pastry, in Form eines Eis, beinahe ein Kunstwerk.

143,Top-Hotel in zentraler Lage,"Nach einem Wochenendaufenthalt mit insgesamt fünf Personen läßt sich das Corinthia Hotel in London einfach nur mit sehr gut bewerten. Bereits die Buchung hat einwandfrei geklappt und im Gegensatz zu anderen angefragten Hotels konnte man uns auch von Anfang an zwei Doppelzimmer mit Verbindungstür für eine mitreisende Jugendliche zusichern. Auch der Checkin, der Aufenthalt selbst und die Abreise haben sich als problemlos erwiesen. Alle Mitarbeiter waren freundlich und hilfsbereit, die Zimmer schön gestaltet und das Frühstück mehr als reichhaltig und vielseitig. Wir kommen gerne wieder. Auch die Lage ist übrigens vorzüglich, zumal eine U-Bahn Station fast direkt vor der Haustür liegt und man somit sowohl zu Fuß als auch mit der U-Bahn sehr schnell überall hin kommt. ",5,2017,04,24

Il personale è attento, curato, discreto e preparata a rispondere a qualsiasi esigenza. Il ristorante alla guida di uno chef italiano è da considerarsi stellato da come si mangia bene. Vicinissimo al centro di Londra e con il servizio di transfer o taxi si arriva facilmente ad ogni meta. 
All'interno vi si trova anche un fiorista che confeziona i meravigliosi e profumatissimi mazzi per l'intero hotel, ma su richiesta anche per gli ospiti. Un servizio unico.
Lo consiglio per qualsiasi tipologia di viaggiatore. ",5,2017,04,19

143,UN SOGGIORNO DA REALI!,"Sono stato per lavoro a Londra ed ho avuto la fortuna di soggiornare presso il Corinthia Hotel nella Royal Penthouse. La Penthouse si trova al 6 piano di un bellissimo palazzo dietro Trafalgar Square. Appena entrati subito si ha un'idea di calda accoglienza. Il personale efficacissimo mi è venuto incontro all'auto per prendere i bagagli e senza che me ne accorgessi hanno portato le valigie nella penthouse una volta controllata la prenotazione. 
Preso l'ascensore l'ingresso della camera ha una doppia porta. Entrato si accede ad un immenso ingresso con un tavolo circolare, di fronte un salone circolare con tutte finestre che danno sul tamigi comprendente una sala da pranzo e una sala riunioni completamente specchiata...STUPENDA. Poi uno studio molto ben arredato con quadri ed opere d'arte. Da questo ingresso a destra c'è un ascensore privato che porta al secondo piano della penthouse ma anche accessibile da una maestosa scalinata in marmo scuro dove al centro presenta un lampadario che partendo dal soffitto del secondo piano arriva fino al primo piano. Salendo le scale, lo spettacolo è davvero da stendhal! Un attico comprendente: due camere da letto con king bed, due bagni con vasca, doccia e camino, un guardaroba immenso specchiato, una spa privata e un salone con un televisore gigante. Ma non è tutto perche questo secondo piano ha anche una bellissima terrazza elegantemente arredata con anche un barbecue molto discreto. La vista ovviamente mozzafiato, di fronte al London eye ed è possibile vedere lo skyline della city e tutto il corso del Tamigi. La penthouse quindi come potete immaginare è molto luminosa dall'alba al tramonto. Ovviamente tende e tendaggi tutti controllati elettronicamente da dei pannelli vicino al letto. La penthouse è davvero curata nei dettagli e il servizio è eccellente. Un numero elevato di camerieri e personale accorreva in camera per portarmi, quando richiesto, colazione, pranzo, caffe e pronti a farmi sentire come a casa. Un'altra cosa che ho notato è il servizio di cambio biancheria, efficiente e nonostante la grandezza della penthouse ( 465 mq) sono stati velocissimi ed efficientissimi! la Penthouse era pulitissima dopo poco senza che neanche me ne rendessi conto. Posso dire di aver vissuto una permanenza da reale e sicuramente se ne avrò la possibilita in futuro tornero senza dubbio in questo meraviglioso hotel! Se esistessero piu di 5 stelle sicuramente questo hotel le meriterebbe tutte! Se avete quindi voglia di vivere un giorno da reali non potete mancare la prenotazione in questo favoloso hotel! Ciao Corinthia a presto!",5,2016,12,15
143,Charmantes Hotel mit Flair in ausgezeichneter Lage,"Ein paar Urlaubstage in London und wir wählten das Corinthia dafür aus. Zum einen hat uns die Lage sehr gefallen und zum anderen die geräumigen Zimmer mit Tageslichtbad. Das ist besonders für London. Man ist schnell in allen Richtungen unterwegs, die U-Bahn ist in direkter Nähe. Trotzdem kann man ruhig schlafen, das Bett ist zudem sehr bequem. Stilvolles Ambiente im ganzen Hotel, tolle Dekorationen, gerade jetzt in der Vorweihnachtszeit. 

Was uns nicht ganz überzeugte war der Service beim Frühstück. Dieser entspricht nicht der Klasse eines solchen Hauses. Das Buffet war gut, jedoch jeden Tag dasselbe. Etwas Abwechslung im Angebot Wurst/Käse/Schinken wäre angebracht.

Dennoch kommen wir beim nächsten London Besuch gerne wieder in dieses schöne Hotel, wir haben uns hier sehr wohl gefühlt!

143,Sensazionale,Il massimo che un hotel possa offrire. Suite di mq 50 con tutti gli optional possibili. Personale impeccabile e pulizia eccellente. Colazione per ogni palato. Situato nel centro di Londra è l'ideale per raggiungere tutti i luoghi di maggiore interesse. A due passi dal Big Ben e Trafalgar Square. Ci ritornerò. Da provare!!!!!!,5,2016,11,21
143,Schon sehr gut,"Das ist schon ein Spitzenhotel, und auch mein Apartment war toll. Leider gab es kein richtiges Fenster, aber das hat man auch nicht vermisst, weil ich den Tag unterwegs war.. Ich hatte auf einen Blick auf die Themse gehofft, aber den hat man nur vom Dachrestaurant.
Obwohl, 
Sptizenhotel, und entsprechend teuer, war doch nicht alles perfeckt, die pappigen Brotchen, die stumpfen ""Reitmesser"", also Messer, auf denen man reiten konnte, so stumpf waren sie. Mir hat der aufmerksame Service nach dem ersten Tag unaufgefordert eine Steckmesser fürs Brötchen gebracht, das aber anfangs auch nur für butterweiche Steaks geeignet war. Ab letzten Tag kam dann der Staurantmanager und verpche Besserung, er wollte mir auch ein goodie zur Entschädigung anbieten, aber  ich musste ja bals fort, zu spät! Auch das Northern Restaurant im Haus war gut, aber nicht umwerfend, es entspricht seinem durch die Preisgestaltung vorgegebenen Anspruch nicht.
Die Lage in der Stadt ist bestens, Charing Corss und Trafalgas Square in der Nähe, Subway und Themse nicht weit. Besser geht es nicht.",4,2016,11,08
143,The best,"Ottimo sotto tutti i punti di vista. Personale professionale, stanze eleganti e spaziose, colazione davvero di qualità, spa a cinque stelle... non riesco davvero a trovare qualcosa di negativo. Sarà difficile, dopo il Corinthia entrare in un'altro hotel. Assolutamente the Best.",5,2016,10,25
143,De lo mejor de Londres,"De todos los hoteles en los que he estado en Londres, el Corinthia ha sido el mejor de todos ellos. He tenido la oportunidad de estar dos veces y la verdad es que era todo perfecto. Servicio, habitación muy grande, el baño impresionante, con ducha, bañera gigante con televisión etc. La habitación es muy elegante, pero a la vez muy práctica. El desayuno muy bueno.",5,2016,10,13
143,Gelungener Aufenthalt ,"London ist immer eine Reise wert. Und dazu der Aufenthalt im Corinthia hat diesen Urlaub zu einem ganz besonderes gemacht.
Die tolle Lage an der Themse haben überzeugt. 
Die Zimmer waren recht klein aber geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Die Betten sind sehr bequem. 
Das Frühstück war reichhaltig und abwechslungsreich.
Wir kommen gerne wieder.",5,2016,10,11
143,Alto livello,"Siamo stati 2 notti in famiglia (con 2 bimbi piccoli). Hotel di lusso, alto livello in tutto. Ambienti suntuosi. Moderno. Camere ampie e pulite. Posizione ottima..! SPA fantastica con accesso alla piscina anche per i più piccoli..  Colazione di buon livello. Personale cordiale. Prezzi alti (ma Londra è così..). Ci voglio tornare.",5,2016,09,05
143,"Perfekte Lage, super Service","Ich habe das Hotel über das Reisebüro meines Vertrauens gebucht, ausschlaggebend war hauptsächlich die sehr zentrale Lage und dennoch gute Erreichbarkeit, vom Flughafen Heathrow hat die Anreise mit Heathrow Express bis Paddington und anschließend der U-Bahn bis Embankment nur knapp 30 Minuten gedauert; auf der Rückfahrt ging es mit dem Taxi bis Paddington ähnlich zügig. 
Selbst die einfachste Zimmerkategorie (Superior King) ist großzügig geschnitten mit hervorragendem Badezimmer (Dusche und Badewanne getrennt). 
Das inbegriffene Frühstück hat keine Wünsche offen gelassen, das  Personal war sehr bemüht sofort jeden Wunsch zu erfüllen allerdings ohne dabei aufdringlich  zu wirken.",5,2016,09,01
143,EXCELENTE EN TODOS LOS SENTIDOS.,"La ubicación maravillosa, al lado de todos los puntos turísticos que se deben visitar en Londres. Impecable el trato de los trabajadores del hotel. 
La habitación grande y espaciosa.
100% recomendable, SIN DUDA.",5,2016,08,29
143,Londra al top,"Davvero stupendo questo Hotel, camere ampie, confortevoli e pulitissime, bagno spazioso e dotato di bidet (non così scontato a Londra). Ottima colazione internazionale, particolarmente ricca e varia. Ambientazione curata nei minimi dettagli, dall'arredamento ai fiori, al profumo negli ambienti. Il personale è gentilissimo, professionale e attento ad ogni richiesta. Prendetevi il tempo per trascorrere un paio d'ore nella Spa, decisamente merita.",5,2016,08,24
143,Erholsame Tage in London ,"Sehr gute Lage, im Zentrum. In der Nähe zum Travalgar Square und zum Charing Cross Bahnhof. Auch die Embankment Underground Station ist nur um die Ecke. Wunderschöne Lobby mit sensationellen Blumensträusse! Gute Auswahl an Restaurants und Bars. Auch ein herrliches Spa. Schöne Zimmer mit jeglichen Komfort. Schnelles Internet. Schönes Badezimmer mit separater Badewanne und Dusche. Guter Zimmerservice, feines Essen. Ich würde dieses Hotel wieder wählen!",5,2016,08,23
143,Che dire? Notevole,"Location ottima, hotel davvero notevole. Personale cortese  e super professionale, colazione ottima. Si dorme davvero bene in camere pulitissime e ben arredate. Equo il rapporto qualità prezzo considerato che parliamo di un cinque stelle di Londra.",5,2016,08,22
143,Muy elegante,Visitamos Londres con un grupo de 80 personas... Un hotel en el centro de todo... Cerca del Río Támesis a lado del tren cerca de la plaza y rodeado de tiendas de todo tipo ... Servicio de desayuno exquisito!!! De nuestra parte muy bien recomendado!!! Regresaré tan pronto pueda!!!!,5,2016,08,02
143,Excelente ubicación,"Ubicación estratégica. Cerca del Parlamento, del Palacio de Buckingham, y del Museo del Arte. Un excelente ambiente y tiene lugar para fumadores dentro del hotel en un área no techada donde se presta para terminar con los comentarios del día y que además se puede pedir bebidas a esa área.",5,2016,07,25
143,splendido storico hotel a pochi passi dal Tamigi,"Stupendo, elegante, una spa favolosa, L'albergo è  ben ubicato,  a pochi passi da Trafalgar Square e 10 minuti da Regent Street. Uno storico edificio vittoriano completamente ristrutturato. La cortesia  del personale è al livello, sempre molto attenti. Servizi davvero efficienti. La camera molto spaziosa, confortevole e silenziosa completa di ogni comfort.  Colazione a buffet fantastica. Davvero molto bello. 
Un unico difetto (nella mia camera) attribuibile agli architetti, arredi favolosi ma quasi totalmente privo di spazi, non per appendere ma cassetti dove mettere il bagaglio.",5,2016,07,12
143,Gediegenes Hotel im Art deco Stil an top Lage,"Ich war für 2 Nächte während einer Geschäftsreise im sehr gediegenen Corinthia. Der Empfang an der Reception war sehr professionell und freundlich. Obwohl unser Zimmer bezugsbereit war, machten wir einen Abstecher an die Bar um unseren Durst zu stillen. 

Die Bar ist sehr elegant im Art deco Stil (wie auch der übrige Teil des Hotels) gehalten. Alle Materialien sind von hoher Qualität und die Aufenthaltsräume sind sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Das Personal an der Bar ist sehr aufmerksam und zuvorkommend. Zum richtigen Zeitpunkt wird nachgeschenkt und nachgefragt ob man noch einen Drink möchte. 

Das Zimmer (ein Superior Kind Room) mit rund GBP 800 nicht ganz günstig selbst für London, erfüllt jedoch alle Wünsche. Grosszügiges Schlafzimmer, Walk-in-Closet und wunderschönes Marmor Badezimmer mit separatem WC und Dusche und zu guter letzt ein sehr bequemes Bett mit einer grossen Auswahl an Kopfkissen. 

Zum Nachtessen haben wir uns für das Massimo Restaurant entschieden. Beratung und Bedienung war top. Small Talk der Servicepersonals mit einer guten Portion Humor. Essen und Präsentation der Gerichte war excellent. 

Frühstück am nächsten Morgen, welches im Preis inbegriffen war, lässt keine Wünsche offen. Cappuccino wie beim Italiener. Frische Früchte und Muesli auch für jene, welche sich schon am Morgen gesund ernähren wollen. Aufmerksamkeit des Personals, wie sich dies für ein 5 Sterne Hotel gehört, war top. 

Alles in allem: Top Adresse in London. Ich würde das Corinthia dem Savoy jederzeit vorziehen.",5,2016,06,13
143,Sehr hoher internationaler Standard ,"Wir haben in London schon viele Hotels gesehen und kaum eines hat unsere Erwartungen in puncto Anspruch und Wirklichkeit erfüllt. Das Corinthia ist eine rühmliche Ausnahme im trüben Teich Londoner Hotels auf hohem Niveau. Der Service ist außerordentlich aufmerksam, die Zimmer sind großzügig bemessen - das ist eine absolute Ausnahme in London!!! Die Lage ist ebenso genial - man kommt sowohl zu Fuß als auch mittels Tube wunderbar voran. Unser Zimmer zum Whitehall Place gelegen waren überraschend ruhig. Die Ausstattung der Räumlichkeiten ist zeitlos und super elegant. ",4,2016,05,31
143,Ausgezeichnet!,"Das sehr gut gelegende Hotel (4 U-Bahnlinien ab Embankment) bietet für den Preis den Erwartungen entsprechend die beste Dienstleistung: Zimmer gross, sauber, sehr komfortabel. Kein Lärm (sehr lärmempfindliche Gäste: Zimmer Seite Whitehall Place buchen). Sehr zuvorkommende, freundliche und umgehende Bedienung. Das Frühstücksbuffet ist einmalig und der Kaffee ist ausgezeichnet (Filterkaffee oder vom Automaten). Das Fitness-Center im Basement ist sehr gut eingerichtet.",5,2016,05,22
143,"Fast Perfekt, mit hinkenden Service","Das Corinthia Hotel erstrahlt schon beim Betreten wohlbehagen aus.
Die Lobby ist sehr einladend gestaltet und läd zum Verweilen ein. Besonders schön ist der Terassen Bereich, der Abends beheizt wird.
Das Einchecken war problemlos und sehr freundlich. Ich wurde in meine Suite gebracht und es wurden die Basics nett erklärt.
Die Zimmer sind sehr konfortabel und wunderschön. Die Aussicht und die zentrale Lage ist ein großer Pluspunkt.
Abends probierte ich das italienische Restaurante Massimo des Hotels aus und ich wurde nicht enttäuscht. 
Toller Service, tolle Weine und das Essen war einfach nur ein Gaumenschmaus.
Hier wird mit viel Liebe und Können gekocht.

Von dieser Gastfreundlichkeit sollte sich das Frühstücksteam eine Scheibe abschneiden.
Obwohl das Buffett keine Wünsche offen lässt, ist der Service etwas lahm, bzw gar nicht vorhanden.
Die Teller wurden nicht abgetragen, erst als ich sie zu einem Turm stapelte incl Tee,- und Milchkanne.
Irgendwie fühlte sich keiner für meinen Tisch verantwortlich. Der Service war nicht unfreundlich aber eben auch nicht freundlich. Man fühlte sich nicht Willkommen sondern eher als Störfaktor.
Es wurde auch nicht gefragt ob alles in Ordnug ist, oder man noch etwas möchte.
Ich musste an allen drei Tagen der Bedienung hinterher rennen um noch einen zusätlichen Kaffee zu bestellen.
Dafür war das Angebot der Speisen sehr reichlich, frisch und äußerst lecker.
Gutes Essen versöhnt mich mit allem.

Das Housekeeping war auch nicht unbedingt auf fünf Sterne Niveau. 
Es war einfach nicht gründlich sauber. Die Brotbrösel nach dem indoor dining waren noch komplett erteilt. Leider musste ich im Bad Haare finden, die nicht von mir waren. Genauso Lippenstiftreste etc.
Die Weisweingläser wurden jeden Tag abserviert aber nicht mehr aufgefüllt.
Die verwelkten Blumen wurden zwar entfernt aber ein neuer Straus kam leider nicht mehr.
An einem Abend kam der Turndown Service erst gar nicht (und nein, das do not disturb war nicht an)
Das alles sind Kleinigkeiten die sich summieren und das dürfte in einem Hotel dieser Preisklasse nicht vorkommen.

Alles im Allen war ich aber sehr zufrieden und würde jederzeit dort wieder nächtigen",4,2016,05,22
143,Schön und zentral,"Wir haben 3 Nächte mit unserer Tochter (2 ruhige, grosse Zimmer mit Verbindungstüre) in diesem eleganten Hotel, das in einem sehr schönen Viertel liegt, verbracht. Der Service war ausgezeichnet und die Zimmer ruhig und ausreichend gross. Nette Bar, elegantes italienisches Restaurant, wunderbares Frühstücksbuffet .. ob Egg Benedict, Egg Royal oder Egg Florentine - alles war perfekt zubereitet. In nur wenigen Gehminuten gelangt man zum London Eye, zum Trafalgar Square oder, wenn man ein paar Minuten dranhängt zum Buckingham Palast.",5,2016,05,11
143,Excelente hotel,"Este hotel, si bien es un edificio histórico, es nuevo, por lo cual las instalaciones están increíbles. Las habitaciones son amplias y cómodas. El desayuno muy bueno. El bar del lobby también. El room Service excelente. Con chicos estuvimos muy bien. La ubicación es la mejor. Esta cerca de todo. La atención excelente. Muchos empleados hablan en español.",5,2016,05,10
143,Das Beste was ich erlebt habe,"Dieses Hotel (gegenüber der Themse und den Riesenrad) ist das Beste was ich je
erlebt habe.
Einrichtung - Bad - Frühstücksraum - Empfangshalle - Zimmer Luxus pur praktisch nicht
zu überbieten, auch nicht in der Sauberkeit oder das Frühstück.",5,2016,04,25
143,Modernes Luxushotel in Bestlage,"Im November 2015 habe ich ein Wochenende im Londoner Corinthia verbracht. Das Hotel liegt ruhig in Mitten des Regierungsviertels. Big Ben, Downing Street, London Eye, Trafalgar Square und National Gallery sind fußläufig in wenigen Minuten erreichbar. Der Empfang und Check in gestaltete sich erfreulich angenehm und sehr freundlich. Die Art und Weise wie uns seitens der zuständigen Mitarbeiterin das Hotel sowie das von uns gebuchte Zimmer gezeigt wurde war vorbildlich. Das Zimmer war wie das gesamte Haus sehr ansprechend gestaltet und perfekt ausgestattet. 

Besonders hervorzuheben ist die wunderschön eingerichtete Wohnhalle des Hauses (""The Lobby Lounge"") und die in allen öffentlichen Räumen präsentierten Blumenarrangements. Auch die Räumlichkeiten des Restaurants ""The Northall"", in denen auch das Frühstück eingenommen wird, beeindrucken durch historische Architektur und modernes Interior Design. Das Frühstücksbuffet entsprach in Bezug auf Qualität und Vielfalt voll und ganz unseren Erwartungen.

Die Bassoon Piano Bar, in der allabendlich Live-Auftritte lokaler Künstler stattfinden, fällt gegenüber den übrigen Räumlichkeiten klar zurück. Zwar entsprechen die Drinks höchsten Ansprüchen, jedoch hat uns die Atmosphäre hier nicht zugesagt. Die Bar ist auch bei externen Gästen sehr beliebt, sie ist damit schnell überfüllt, das Mobiliar steht zu eng und die auftretenden Künstler werden mangels Platz an einer engen Abseite des Bartresen platziert. Ein Besuch der im Restaurant angesiedelten Bar ""The Nordhall"" ist eher empfehlenswert.

Das Hotel verfügt über einen großen, sich über mehrere Stockwerke erstreckenden SPA- und Wellness-Bereich. Der über Saunen, einen kleinen Pool und zahlreiche Ruheräume verfügt. Insgesamt schätze ich an diesem Hotel sehr, dass sowohl das Zimmer als auch sämtliche öffentlichen Räume in Kombination mit einem schönen Wellness-Angebot zum Verweilen einladen - das ist insbesondere an den vielen regnerischen Tagen in London ein großer Pluspunkt.

143,Immer wieder DAS Highlight in London !,"Wir waren schön öfters Gast in diesem Haus und bei der jährlichen Planung freuen wir uns im Vorfeld schon auf das Hotel. Dieses Jahr waren wir zum 1. Mal mit der ganzen Familie für 3 Tage da. Das Haus begeistert einfach immer wieder aufs Neue! Die Mitarbeiter alle durchweg ausgesprochen freundlich, hilfsbereit und kompetent. Die Sauberkeit im ganzen Haus ist erwähnenswert und  hervorzuheben. Die Lage, der gemütlich, eingerichtete Außenbereich (auch für Raucher - das ist nun wirklich einzigartig in London!), die traumhaft schönen Zimmer mit den tollen Bädern- freies W-LAN - es fehlt an nichts - alles perfekt. Der High Tea in diesem Haus gehört zum Pflichtprogramm - hervorragender und sehr aufmerksamer Service, der auch Allergiker berücksichtigt und diese bestens verköstigt. Ein solch hohes Niveau über so einen langen Zeitraum halten zu können,alleine das ist schon beeindruckend. Corinthia bleibt für uns das ""Jewel of London"" - schade dass es hier keine höhere Bewertung gibt, es hätte sie verdient! Ein großes MERCI an dieser Stelle an alle Mitarbeiter, die uns im Februar so schöne, unvergessliche Tage mit unserer Familie beschert haben. Wir freuen uns schon auf unseren nächsten Besuch!",5,2016,03,07
143,Luxus pur,"Das Hotel liegt in der Nähe von Whitehall. Beim Eintreffen wurden wir freundlich empfangen. Das Zimmer war modern eingerichtet, sauber und gepflegt. Reichhaltiges Frühstücks-buffet inkl., asiatische Abteilung. Londoner Hotelpreise, eher teuer.",5,2016,02,27
143,Hotel splendido per godersi Londra,Splendido hotel in un palazzo bellissimo vicinissimo al London Eye. Ristrutturato con gusto; camera ampie e ben fornite. Ricchissimo il buffet per la colazione.

143,Situacion + elegancia + comodidad + buen servicio = perfeccion,"Tiene todo lo que requiere un 5* 
No hay duda que esta entre los mejores 10 hoteles de 5* de Londres (y eso que es dificil escoger solo 10).

Es posible que otros hoteles sean mejores pero si reservas en este hotel, aciertas seguro.

Habitacion exterior, con vistas al rio o al Royal Houseguards. Las vistas son mucho mejores",5,2016,02,21
143,Alto livello,"Ho soggiornato con mia moglie in questo bellissimo hotel a pochi passi da Trafalgar Square e devo dire che ci siamo trovati benissimo sotto tutti i punti di vista.
Arredamento molto classico e attento in ogni minimo particolare, camere spaziose ed arredate in modo semplice. pulizia maniacale e servizio e gentilezza degno di un Hotel di tale importanza.
Tengo a precisare la fantastica insonorizzazione delle stanze, dal momento in cui non si sente volare una mosca a qualunque ora del giorno, risultato, splendide dormite.",4,2016,02,17
143,Kein 5* Service,"Wir haben eine Nacht im Corinthia Hotel verbracht und waren sehr gespannt auf unseren Aufenthalt in diesem sehr luxuriösen Hotel. Wir kamen ziemlich früh an und wurden herzlich an der Rezeption begrüsst. Danach war aber Schluss. Nachdem die Rezeptionistin gesehen hatte, dass wir keine Uhrzeit angegeben haben, hat sie mit einem sehr arroganten Ton gesagt, dass wir doch das nächste Mal eine Uhrzeit angeben sollten, wenn wir schon so früh Anreisen. Nachdem Sie dann ein Zimmer für uns gefunden hat wurden wir auch sofort hinbegleitet. Soweit so gut. Dann kamen wir jedoch ins Zimmer und es war nicht als Anreisezimmer vorbereitet sondern als Turndown. Ich selber arbeite im Hotel und finde so etwas sollte definitiv in einem 5* Haus vermieden werden. Das Zimmer an sich war sehr schön, außer dass der Duschkopf kaputt war und der Teppich etwas heruntergekommen. Die grösste Enttäuschung war für mich das SPA. Sehr schmutzig, überall lagen Handtücher, leere Flaschen und Plastikbecher. Am nächsten Tag gingen wir zum Frühstück wo ich definitiv das beste Granolamüsli hatte. Nachdem wir dann das Zimmer frei gemacht haben, wollte wir noch etwas rausgehen und London erkunden und somit auch später zahlen, da wir auch eh das Gepäck da gelassen haben. Die Dame die unsere check in am Tag davor gemacht hatte, war damit nicht einverstanden und hat mir gesagt, dass Sie meine Karte belasten wird und ich nicht später zahlen kann. Sehr unprofessionell.Dies ist mir in einem 5* Hotel noch nie vorgekommen. Im Grossen und Ganzen waren die Rezeption vom Verhalten her  und das SPA was die Hygiene angeht eine Grosse Enttäuschung. Schade für ein Haus, dass normalerweise ein 5* Haus sein sollte und welches beim check-in behauptet das beste SPA in UK zu haben.",4,2016,02,10
143,Erstklassiges Hotel in zentraler Lage mit Promifaktor,"Leider nur für ein Businessmeeting ohne Zeit in London verbringen zu können

143,Il top a londra,"Con tre amiche abbiamo deciso di festeggiare il comply di una di noi in questo posto meraviglioso. Abbiamo prenotato una magnifica camera con due letti alla francese e vista sul cortile. Che dire, la stanza era incredibile, con megaschermo al plasma, letti comodissimi, lenzuola pregiate, vari tipi di cuscini, spaziosissima, tavolino con cesto di frutta di cortesia, set da bagno meraviglioso, doccia e vasca in marmo, ambiente separato X tazza e bide', accappatoi è tutto ciò che si può desiderare. Abbiamo usufruito della SPA, la più grande di Londra, con piscine calde e grandi di cui una fantastica con più tipi di idromassaggio e sauna e bagno turco. La colazione regale, con staff preparatissimo e gentilissimo.
Insomma, senza parole.

143,Großartiges Hotel im Herzen Londons,"Das Corinthis ist ein erstklassiges Hotel mit diskretem Service, der keine Wünsche offen lässt. Zimmer groß und ruhig (Executive, 1. Etage), wunderbares Bad, traumhaftes Bett (harte Matratze) und ein wirklich hervorragendes Frühstücks-Buffet in einem wunderschönen Raum.

Dinner: Hochwertig, leider waren einige Speisen eine Spur zu kalt (Genüse, Fleisch). Weil wir ins Theater mussten, haben wir von Reklamation Abstand genommen. Wir haben es aber irgendwie nicht übel genommen. Frühstück: Exzellent. Lage: Wunderbar. 

Die Spa: In der Tat etwas dunkel und auch sehr laut, der große Whirlpool - der optisch was her macht - erzeugt große Lautstärke. Leider nur drei Ruheliegen.",5,2015,10,13
143,Casi Perfecto ,"Situación: Óptima. A un paso de los sitios más emblemáticos de Londres. 
Instalaciones: Modernas, bien decoradas y extraordinariamente limpias. 
Habitación: Bien distribuida con baño muy funcional. La única pega fue que el colchón en mi opinión era demasiado duro. Tuvimos problemas con un enchufe y la televisión. 
Desayuno: Bufet muy completo, con productos muy frescos. Única pega es que la bollería era de poca calidad. 
Servicio: Extraordinariamente amable y bastante profesional. La mayoría del personal, de origen extranjero aunque con buen dominio del inglés. 
Restaurante:  Impropio de un hotel de lujo. Aunque el entorno es muy agradable, la calidad de la comida es mediocre y el servicio muy lento. 
Spa: Muy bien instalado. ",4,2015,10,10

Che sia un viaggio di lavoro o per piacere, hotel che soddisfa ogni esigenza per il servizio sempre puntuale e cortese ma anche per il comfort, sia delle camere che degli spazi comuni.

143,Sehr stylisches Hotel in perfekter Lage,"Um es gleich vorwegzunehmen - selbst für Londoner Verhältnisse ist das Corinthia nicht günstig. Aber es ist seinen Preis wert. Das ganze Hotel ist sehr stylisch und superschön eingerichtet. Der Concierge schafft es sogar, für den nächsten Tag Wimbledon-Tickets zu besorgen (konnte Centurion nicht). Das Frühstück ist sehr gut und auch das Abendessen im Restaurant hat uns gut gefallen. Wenn ich überhaupt etwas monieren muss, könnte ich nur sagen, dass der Spa für meinen Geschmack etwas dunkel ist, das wäre dann schon alles. Alles in Allem - sehr empfehlenswert!",5,2015,08,24
143,La mejor estadia,Un hotel de aspecto clásico ubicado en el centro de Londres. Desde que ingresas al lobbie un personal magnificamente adiestrado te da la bienvenida a una de las mejores experiencias que vivirás en  hoteles,5,2015,08,17
143,Top Hotel in erstklassiger Lage,"Das Hotel war ein tolles Quartier für unseren Aufenthalt in der City of London. Die Lage direkt an der Themse und nahe Westminster und Trafalgar Square ist einfach ideal für Theater- und Pub-Besuche.
Das Zimmer war zwar etwas voll gestellt und die Aussicht (zum Innenhof im ersten Stock) etwas mäßig. Dafür war die Ausstattung des Zimmers und das Bad einfach toll.
Der Service war immer sehr freundlich und zurückhaltend, allerdings die tägliche persönliche Kontrolle der Mini-Bar während wir im Zimmer waren, fand ich durchaus störend.
Das Frühstück ist eines der besten, welches wir in den letzten Jahren in einem Hotel hatten (hat aber auch seinen Preis).
Beeindruckend ist das Spa, welches sich über 4 Etagen erstreckt und vor allem die Sauna in einem Glaswürfel haben mich beeindruckt.
Insgesamt ein toller Aufenthalt und nur zu empfehlen. Wir kommen gerne wieder.",5,2015,06,09

Es gab ein kleineres Serviceprobleme beim Frühstück, wurde von uns kommuniziert und es gab eine elegante Entschuldung. Wow. So gut kann Guest Relations funktionieren.

Sehr freundliches zuvorkommendes Personal. Fantastischer Service egal ob an der Rezeption, Zimmer oder im Wellnessbereich. Dieser ist ebenso einfach paradiesisch. Lage ist einmalig.

143,"tolles Hotell, daß leider immer teurer wird","über die letzten Jahre waren wir sicher 6-7 mal in diesem schönen Haus. Wir hatten immer andere Zimmer die fast alle gleich gut waren. Ein einziges mal waren wir in einem Zimmer zum inneren Hof, dieses war leider sehr laut, denn wir hörten die Abwasserleitungen von mehreren anderen Zimmern.
Dass Personal in der Halle ist großartig, die Teetime ein Erlebniss. Ebenso gut ist dass Frühstück in diesem Haus. Auch lassen die Zimmer keine Wünsche offen.
Der  Spaarbereich war für uns bei den ersten Besuchen ein großartiges Erlebniss, bei unseren letzten Besuchen waren wir allerdings sehr entteuscht, was die Sauberkeit und die negativentwicklung was den Service dort unten anbelangt. Wir sahen Personal mit Strassenschuhen, und viele nicht weggeräumte Getränkebehälter, so wie einige abgeschlagene Ecken. Hier wäre eine Veränderung dringend nötig.",4,2015,04,15

Macchina Nespresso, ghiaccio, televisore Loewe, vere ciabatte, letto ampio e comodissimo. Bagno con vasca spaziossiima e bella doccia a pioggia. Due lavandini. Il servizio è cordiale, anche se il checkin ha richiesto più tempo del normale per problemi tecnici con il PC. Colazione ok, anche se come è normale a Londra orientata al salato. Ogni sera la camera viene allestita per la notte dalle cameriere, portando cioccolatino o altri pensierini (come un sacchetto di lavanda), acqua, ciabatte sotto al letto e telecomando sul comodino. Ottimo.",5,2015,03,10

Tomamos el desayuno bufet y estaba todo verdaderamente delicioso. La atención es de primera. como corresponde a un hotel de esta catégoria. Precios altos, pero justificados. Una delicia de hotel que recomiendo para un viaje a Londres .",5,2014,12,28

prima colazione di ottimo livello.
personale eccellentemente diretto e professionale.

non si può dir nulla... hotel di elevatissimo livello",5,2014,12,21
143,Luxushotel in erstklassiger Lage,"Wir haben hier drei Nächte verbracht und waren unglaublich zufrieden! Das Hotel ist ein 5-Sterne-Hotel vom Feinsten. Unser luxuriös eingerichteter Executive Room zum Innenhof gelegen war sehr großzügig geschnitten ebenso wie das Bad. Noch nie habe ich eine so wunderbare Regenwalddusche benutzen dürfen - der Wasserdruck war so gut und der Brausekopf so groß, dass ich wirklich das Gefühl hatte, unter einem warmen, weichen Wasserfall zu stehen! Toilette, Dusche und Bad waren durch Mattglastüren getrennt, ein Bidet direkt neben der Toilette war vorhanden. Die Balkontür zum Innenhof konnte nachts offen gelassen werden. Man kann gar nicht alles aufschreiben, aber hier noch einmal die absoluten Pluspunkte des Hotels: Super Lage, fußläufig erreichbar die Houses of Parliament, Trafalgar Square, Covent Garden, Soho, British Museum, Oxford Street u.v.m. Frühstücksbüffet sehr gut aber mit 35 Pfund auch sehr teuer. Wir hatten das Glück, eine Rate buchen zu können, bei der die dritte Nacht umsonst war. Bei gleichzeitigem Beitritt zum hoteleigenen Members-Club war das Frühstück für zwei Personen im Preis enthalten ebenso wie 60 Pfund Credit für die Minibar. Jeder Wunsch wurde vom überaus freundlichen Personal sofort erfüllt. Obwohl das Hotel am Wochenende ausgebucht war, hatten wir den Fahrstuhl meist für uns allein. Der Aufenthalt war wirklich ein tolles Erlebnis!",5,2014,12,03
143,Assolutamente perfetto,"Belle le stanze (macchinetta della Nespresso a disposizione, bollitore con dell'ottimo The, ottimi prodotti nel frigobar, bagno con vasca e doccia separati e televisore sulla vasca, Wi-Fi gratuito in tutto l'albero perfettamente funzionante) bella la posizione, bella la colazione (il buffet è ricco ed elegante con prodotti di ottima qualità), bella la spa con una meravigliosa sauna dalle pareti di vetro con il caminetto a vista (peccato che i bambini possono entrare solo un'ora e mezza la mattina ed un'ora e mezza il pomeriggio), piacevoli i ristoranti,  personale estremamente gentile. I bambini vengono comunque trattati con grande attenzione: la sera sul letto abbiamo trovato un peluche, un set con shampoo, crema e bagnoschiuma per bambini,  un grande lecca lecca, accappatoio e ciabatte, delle caramelle e un succo di frutta.... la gioia è stata tanta! Un posto dove si vuole ritornare.",5,2014,10,26
143,Magnífica estadía!,"Si buscan una experiencia de 100 en Londres, este es su hotel.
Nos quedamos 4 noches en el Corinthia a finales de septiembre, y la experiencia fue 100% positiva. Es un hotel verdaderamente 5 estrellas, tanto por sus instalaciones, amenidades y nivel de servicio como por su super conveniente ubicación. Se puede ir caminando a la Abadia, al Parlamento, al London Eye, a la zona de los teatros, etc.
Nos quedamos en una Executive King, y muy espaciosa. Tiene un walking closet, y el baño más amplio de todo nuestro viaje, con una hermosa tina de baño, doble lavamanos y la ducha por separado.
El desayuno buffet que ofrecen es muy variado y rico. El personal está siempre al pendiente de que todo funcioné correctamente y el servicio sea rápido y oportuno. En el equipo de Relaciones con el cliente, cuentan con Tanya, una chica super amable que habla muy bien español, así que eso también ayuda mucho.
También ofrecen servicio de traslado gratuito a cualquier punto dentro de la zona 1 de Londres, lo cual significa que pueden llevarte a lugares como Harrods, el Museo Británico, la Torre de Londres, y la estación de St. Pancras. Importante considerar que está sujeto a que el auto esté disponible, pero también se puede reservar.",5,2014,10,03
143,Höchstes Niveau,"Wir waren auf dem ersten Teil unserer Hochzeitsreise, welche von London über Paris nach Venedig führte im Corinthia. Das Corinthia war mit grossem Abstand das beste Hotel, obwohl wir auch in den anderen Städten in renommierten Häusern nächtigten. 

Das Corinthia setzte sich vom Rest ab durch ein wirklich tadelloses Haus, die Zimmer sind in einem sehr guten Zustand, alles funktioniert und ich auch für Laien verständlich bedienbar. Das Personal ist durchwegs zuvorkommend und wirklich hilfsbereit. 

Das SPA ist sauber und funktioniert. Eine gute Atmosphäre, und nicht überlaufen. Ich konnte sowohl Dampfbad als auch Sauna und Whirlpool alleine geniessen, nachdem sich die wenigen Gäste zum Mittagessen zurückgezogen hatten.

Die Restaurants Massimo und Northall bieten für Londoner (bzw. englische) Verhältnisse gutes Essen und auch die Bar hat ein gutes Angebot. Der Afternoon Tea ist wirklich hervorragend. 

Unser Aufenthalt war herrlich und wir können diese Adresse nur weiterempfehlen, wenn das nötige Kleingeld vorhanden ist.",5,2014,09,26
143,Stupendo!!,"Di questo albergo posso solo parlare bene, ho soggiornato con il mio compagno i primi di settembre e posso assicurarvi che rispecchia in tutto un vero 5 stelle! Il fattore più importante sul quale baso la mia recensione e' il comfort,l'eleganza dell'albergo, la cordialità di tutto il personale che si è rivelato sempre efficiente. Ottimo il ristorante Massimo, servizio impeccabile e personale estremamente professionale.Sicuramente torneremo in questo incantevole albergo!",5,2014,09,19
143,"Caro, pero vale la pena",Tuve la oportunidad de cenar en Corinthia mientras celebraba el cumpleaños de una amiga en Londres. La comida y el trago de lo más fino. El trato del servicio es único y las instalaciones del hotel de las más elegantes que he podido ver en toda mi vida.,5,2014,09,01
143,Lieblingshotel in London,"Das Corinthia in London ist in jeder Hinsicht ein Traum und mein bevorzugtes Hotel wenn ich geschäftlich in London bin.

Die Zimmer sind für Londoner Verhältnisse riesig, sehr schön mit warmen Farben designt und bieten jeglichen erdenklichen Komfort. Nespresso Maschine und Badewanne mit TV Screen (oft ein abendliches Highlight) inbegriffen. Sehr bequemes Bett und kuschelige Bettdecke/Bettwäsche. Man fühlt sich fast wie in einem Spa Urlaub...
Das Spa ist sensationell und ein Erlebnis für sich! Unbedingt einmal besuchen!
Das Personal ist durchgehend sehr freundlich, aufmerksam ohne dabei aufgesetzt zu wirken.
Und auch das Frühstück erfüllt alle Erwartungen.

Das Corinthia ist vielleicht nicht das modernste, stylishte Hotel in London aber dieser Ort hilft mir mit seinem Gesamtpaket im oft hektischen Londoner Businessalltag herunterzukommen und zu relaxen...insgesamt unschlagbar!",5,2014,08,28
143,"un buon albergo, forse un po troppo ""antico""","essendo un 5 stelle superiore, non stiamo a dire che il servizio funziona,le camere sono grandi e pulite...ci mancherebbe! posizione ottima, struttura un po , per il ns gusto, troppo classica, ricorda un Meurice, ma lo sapevamo. un grosso vantaggio, il BIDET!!!!
abbastanza silenzioso, bagni grandi,letti comodi, molto spazio ovvunque, solo le luci sono scarse, arredamento de gustibus.
GROSSO PREGIO: non c'è la moquette....!

ripeto,un'ottima struttura,assolutamente, una delle migliori a Londra, ma non entusiasma ma forse non deve, se è comodo, pulito, silenzioso,benissimo ubicato. o forse non èil tipo di albergo per noi. comunque, ripeto, consigliato, assolutamente.
e non vorrei che il commento sembrasse severo, non lo vuole essere, abbiamo trovato 5 stelle decisamente e spesso molto peggiori.

143,Impresionante Hotel,"Probablemente el mejor 5 estrellas de Londres. Muy bien ubicado cerca de Trafalgar Square, impacta desde la entrada con su enorme hall y la enorme lámpara en el centro de la misma. La habitación muy espaciosa y confortable aun siendo la standard. Todo el personal extremadamente amable y atento logran que uno verdaderamente se sienta en Londres. El desayuno completo y de alta calidad. 
Por supuesto no es nada económico, pero para lo que ofrece la relación precio producto es excelente en un hotel de esta categoría. 
Sin dudas lo volvería a elegir en próximos viajes a Londres ",5,2014,06,19
143,Ein fantastisches Hotel,"In London herrscht kein Mangel an exklusiven 5-Sterne-Hotels. Da aus der Masse hervorzustechen Bedarf besonderer Anstrengung.  Das Corinthia Hotel ist in dieser Hinsicht etwas ganz Besonderes und die durchweg positiven Bewertungen haben uns inspiriert, bei unserem letzten London-Besuch auch einmal hier zu übernachten. 

Der Service ist makellos, die Zimmer geräumig, edel eingerichtet mit tollem Bad. Die Lage ist super zentral. Die von uns gebuchte River Suite hat einen spektakulärem Rundumblick über die Themse, vom London Eye bis St. Pauls.

Die Restaurants im Haus sind ok aber nichts Außergewöhnliches. Es gibt ja unendlich viele Alternativen außerhalb. Sehr gut gefallen hat uns die Hotelbar, die großartige Cocktails serviert. 

Natürlich hat so etwas durchaus seinen Preis, man sollte versuchen eines der immer einmal wieder angebotenen „stay-3-nights-pay-2-nights“–Pakete zu ergattern um die Kosten ein wenig erträglicher zu gestalten.",5,2014,05,02
143,Eccellente! ,"Ottimo hotel sotto ogni punto di vista.  Il servizio, la gentilezza e professionalità del personale, la camera, una executive king nello specifico,  la colazione a buffet, ricca e molto curata negli ingredienti, ne fanno un punto di riferimento assolutamente da raccomandare.

143,Das Juwel in London,"Wir kennen bereits eine Menge 5 Sterne Häuser in London - aber ich denke mit dem Corinthia Hotel haben wir unsere zukünftige Adresse gefunden. Die Lage ist grossartig, direkt an der Tube St. Embankment, keine 5 min. vom Trafalgar Square entfernt - alles prima zu erlaufen. Dieses liebevoll dekorierte Haus, mit seinen wunderschönen, hellen, hohen Aufenthaltsräumen, verströmen eine Wohlfühlatmosphäre bereits in dem Moment in dem man es betritt und laden zum Verweilen ein - gemütlich - cosy. Das Personal allesamt zuvorkommend, sehr freundlich und aufmerksam. Toller Conciergeservice, super Frühstück, gemütliche Bar und einen wunderschön angelegten ""Wintergarten"" (zum Himmel offen), ausgestattet mit bequemen Sitzgarnituren und 2 Kaminen - man darf dort sogar rauchen - wohl einzigartig in London! Es fehlt einem wirklich an nichts.
Die Zimmer ein Traum: modern, sehr geräumig, mit allem Komfort (Nespressomaschine, kl. Wasser pro Person allabendlich am Bett, sowie ein Schoko-Bett-Hupferl :). Hervorzuheben: die Matratzen- fantastisch! Alles perfekt unterhalten und sehr sauber. WIFI funktioniert überall problemlos. Wir haben uns rundum wohlgefühlt und möchten uns nochmal herzlich beim ganzen Corinthia -Team für unseren schönen Aufenthalt bedanken. Ein Juwel in London - absolut empfehlenswert!",5,2014,01,07
143,Wonderful HOTEL con decoración contemporánea e inmejorable ubicación.,"Creo sinceramente que es unos de los mejores hoteles que he visitado, no solo en Londres. Aspiran a ser el numero 1 de Londres y creo que lo van a conseguir.
Las instalaciones son inmejorables, tiene 2 restaurantes, uno italiano y otro británico, de altísima calidad, con un personal amabilísimo, que también habla español; tiene un bar de copas con música en directo, y tienen habilitada una zona para fumadores en un patio muy bonito, aunque exterior, pero con chimeneas. Además, tienen un spa con piscina climatizada, un gran jacuzzi, baño turco y sauna. La habitación es de las mas bonitas que he visto, y extraordinariamente acogedora.Llama la atención, en general, en todo el hotel, el espléndido servicio y amabilidad del personal. El desayuno es muy completo, y el fin de semana hasta las 11,00h. 
Y esta muy bien situado, a dos pasos del Parlamento británico, y de la Abadía de Wetsminster, y en general de la zona monumental de este distrito. Esta junto al Támesis y tiene al lado una estación de metro Embankment, lo que te permite moverte con gran agilidad y rapidez por Londres de una punta a otra.
Lo peor, el precio, es bastante caro, pero merece la pena. Volveré.",5,2013,11,23

Die Lage ist nach meinen Begriffen sehr zentral, direkt am Trafalgar gelegen und der Ciyty Airport ist in ca. 20 Min. mit dem Taxi zu erreichen.",5,2013,03,18
143,"Siamo stati molto male, personale carente e non all'altezza.","Sono arrivato con mia figlia alle 22 abbiamo fatto il chek in e con grande sorpresa ci indicano gli ascensori e ci dicono andate al terzo piano. E' la prima volta che in un albergo a 5 stelle ci mandano in camera da soli senza che nessuno ci accompagni e ci spieghi i dettagli della camera. Ok saliamo in camera la 303 decantata come de luxe  e quindi spaziosa e con sorpresa non abbiamo spazio a sufficienza per appendere i nostri abiti. siamo in due  e troviamo solo tre cassetti di 30 cm dove dovremmo mettere il nostro intimo, una è occupata dalla cassaforte le altre due son talmente piccole che abbiamo difficoltà a inserire tutto il nostro vestiario. L'armadio è largo 80 cm e una volta messi i cappotti non ci va più niente. è incredibile non c'è spazio per inserire il vestiario per due persone. Al check in ci hanno chiesto che quotidiano volevamo leggere la mattina, ma la prima mattina non c'era abbiamo fatto presente il fatto e ci hanno detto di non preoccuparci che la mattina seguente l'avremmo trovato, bene siamo stati 4 mattine e il quotidiano non ci è stato mai fornito nonostante le ns. lamentele. Dulcis in fundo la mattina della partenza sentiamo bussare alla porta insistentemente, alle ore 9 ci svegliano e ci chiedono candidamente a che ora avremmo lasciato la camera. ""Pazzesco"" mi sono messo a ridere per non urlare e mandarlo a quel paese. Ci vogliono altre premesse per gestire un albergo, in questo modo non state gestendo un albergo ma state soltanto indisponendo le persone che vi frequentano e che scelgono il vostro albergo per avere un servizio dignitoso ma non lo ottengono. Il resto colazione con prezzi stratosferici mia figlia ha mangiato un croissant e un cappuccino e ha pagato lo stesso che un adulto ben 33,75 sterline. Il ristorante Da Massimo è un ottimo ristorante ci siamo trovati bene e siamo stati serviti adeguatamente.",2,2013,02,26

143,Einfach exzellent,"Seit mehreren Wochen verbringe ich jede Woche einige Tage in London und habe dafür das Corinthia gewählt. Für mich ein absolutes Top Hotel. Standard und Ausstattung der Zimmer sind wirklich top, vor allem, wenn die etwas größeren Kategorien bucht. Ein solches Badzimmer, begehbaren Kleiderschrank und Platz in den Schlafzimmern verbunden mit der Top-Ausstattung bis ins Detail bekommt man nur ganz selten in London. Mir gefällt besonders gut, dass Stil und Design nicht zu aufdringlich sind. Hier wirken schlichte, moderne Eleganz gepaart mich hochwertigsten Materialien.

Bar und Restaurant sind ebenfalls Top. Der Service des gesamten Personals ist wirklich gut. Besonders gefällt mir die persönliche Ansprache als Stammkunde. Aber das darf man bei einem Hotel dieser Kategorie auch erwarten.

Für mich immer wieder und daher empfehle ich es sehr gerne.",5,2012,12,09
143,Muy bueno,"Personal muy atento y agradable. Spa extraordinario. Las habitaciones están bien aunque dado el precio y categoría del hotel podrían ser mas grandes. Los baños son particularmente buenos. Lo mismo cabe decir de los amenities, bolígrafos, diferentes tipos de enchufes, detalles tipo paraguas, bolsas etc, todo de gran calidad. El desayuno también es muy bueno.

Puestos a poner algún aspecto negativo me referiría al personal del bar, desayuno y particularmente el restaurante Máximo. No son ni parecidos al del resto del hotel ( recepción, portería, Spanish etc). Particularmente el servicio del restaurante Máximo y concretamente el chef que da nombre al restaurante le hacen a uno un favor atendiéndole . Una revisión de educación y trato no vendría mal.

En definitiva un gran gran hotel con un restaurante ( local precioso) muy revisable y no recomendable.",5,2012,09,24

143,Vero lusso nel cuore di Londra,"La scorsa settimana ho avuto la possibilità di soggiornare in questa struttura recentemente ristrutturata nel cuore di Londra, ed ho potuto assaporare il significato della parola Lusso, trattandosi a tutti gli effetti di un hotel 5 stelle L.
Per prima cosa la location, posizionato nel cuore di Londra, a poche centinaia di metri da Trafalgar Square da una parte e da Westminster dall'altra, vicinissimo al Tamigi ed alla City, situato in un antico palazzo londinese sapientemente ristrutturato.
All'esterno una bellissima scalinata vi conduce nella prima hall dell'hotel, al cui interno potete trovare un enorme tavolo sempre adornato con fiori freschi, e sopra pende un bellissimo lampadario che permette una perfetta illuminazione a qualsiasi ora.
Alla vostra destra il banco per il check-in, l'unico punto forse un pò debole della struttura, infatti la registrazione risulta essere ancora quella tipica di un hotel di vecchia conceziona, ed il personale risulta essere piuttosto sbrigativo e non particolarmente conrdiale, in caso di notevole afflusso si corre il rischio di dover fare una fila di attesa piuttosto fastidiosa vista la qualità della struttura.
Sulla sinistra dell'ingresso il banco del concierge e la prima serie di ascensori che portano alle camere.
Salita un'altra serie di scale si entra in un ampio salone coperto da una cupola di vetro sulla quale si affacciano le camere interne dell'hotel, all'interno del salone il bar molto curato.
Alle due estremità si trovano i due ristoranti dell'hotel, io ho provato il ristorante Massimo, di chiare origini italiane, arredato con marmo ovunque, cascate di pesce freso dietro al bar, ed una bellissima cantina a vista.
Il personale è molto cordiale, i piatti molto curati e di primissima qualità, come i maccheroni cacio e pepe, il carpaccio di manzo, il fritto misto di pesce, oppure le numerose portate di pesce crudo freschissimo.
Una volta saliti alle camere i corridoio risultano essere gradualmente illimunati, così da creare ad ogni ora del giorno e della notta una piacevole atmosfera.
Le camere sono molto grandi, dotate di corridoio con armadi, cassaforte, necessario per la pulizia delle scarpe e necessario per problemi di sartoria, una zona bar molto ricca con macchina Nespresso.
Si accede poi alla camere, enorme, con letto a due piazze comodini laterali in grado di controllare le luci di tutta la stanza (che sono ad accensione graduale), tv color a schermo piatto ed una zona salotto ricca di suppellettili interessanti.
L'impianto di condizionamento non è dell'ultimo modello, e la notta risulta essere un pò troppo rumoroso.
Il bagno è un inno al marmo, con due lavelli, vasca con tv color, doccia con piatto a cascata e zona bagno, il kit bagno è tutto sponsorizzato ESPA (uno dei migliori marchi di spa al mondo), che è anche il gestore della splendida Spa dell'hotel (che però purtroppo non ho avuto tempo di provare).
La notte la camere viene rifatta, preparando il letto, mettendo le ciabattine, l'accappotio già pronto sul letto ed un cioccolatino per la buona notte.
La colazione viene servita in una zona al piano terra dell'hotel, un discreto buffet, altrimenti si deve utilizzare la carta (per la qualità dell'hotel dalla colazione mi sarei aspettato qualcosa di meglio).
Nel complesso una struttura molto bella, forse non ideale per un soggiorno turistico a Londra, ma ideale per viaggi di lavoro.",4,2012,05,28
143,Particolarissimo!!!,"Lussuosissimo Hotel, situato in posizione strategica. La struttura si presenta come un mix tra passato e futuro, senza nessuna nota stonata. Particolare cura nei dettagli , che lo rendono meravigliosamente particolare. Le camere sono dotate di tutti i confort, e il personale è davvero accogliente e disponibile. Ottima la cucina, dei ristoranti all'interno. 
La stazione della metro di Embankment è proprio a due passi dall'hotel, ma si possono raggiungere facilmente e a piedi il Big ben, London eye, Trafalgar square, Covent garden e tanto altro ancora. E' proprio l'ideale per una meravigliosa vacanza all'insegna del comfort e della spensieratezza",5,2012,05,17
143,Leider nicht so gut wie erwartet,"Ich hatte von der Eröffnung im letzten Jahr gelesen und war von der Berichterstattung und den Fotos begeistert. Über Ostern war ich eine Nacht in London und natürlich im Corinthia gebucht. Zimmer (schlechteste Kategorie) wie erwartet, nicht klein, nicht groß, Nespressomaschine, Fernseher im Bad (wer es braucht), nette Badprodukte. Beim Turn-down Service gab es ein Osterei, eine Schale mit Äpfeln stand bereit. Hochwertige Slipper im Bad. Alles okay, aber auch nichts Besonderes für den Preis. Check-in sehr schnell, Concierge sehr hilfsbereit, Türsteher sehr freundlich. Ist aber eigentlich alles eine Selbstverständlichkeit. Jetzt das Schlechte. Ich bin ein absoluter Frühstücksjunkie und liebe es, in aller Ruhe zu frühstücken. Leider entsprach das Frühstück überhaupt nicht meinen Erwartungen. Nur vier unterschiedliche Saftsorten (auch hier nichts Besonders, kein frischgepresster Saft), schlechte Brotauswahl, keine besonderen Spezialitäten (Ausnahme: Butter aus Cornwall und einige Käsesorten), dazu grausliches Rührei aus dem Warmhaltebehälter (sah dazu wie Eipulver aus), das ist für ein Frühstück für über 40,- -Euro umgerechnet ein absolutes Nogo. Einige Sachen konnten von einer Karte bestellt werden.Porridge ohne Geschmack, Pancakes waren keine Pancakes, sondern Pfannkuchen. Alles in allem sehr enttäuschend. Dazu sitzt man auf der Bank viel zu tief für den Tisch. Lunch im Northall Restaurant war lecker, der Preis angemessen. Die Lage des Hotels ist sehr gut. Zu Fuß ist vieles erreichbar. London Eye - vom Northall Restaurant aus zu sehen - gleich gegenüber auf der anderen Seite der Themse.",3,2012,04,10
143,una perla nel cuore di londra,"Sono stata anni fa al Corinthia di Praga e il soggiorno è stato molto piacevole, ma l'hotel di londra è di un livello decisamente superiore. L'arredamento è elegante e raffinato e si nota una particolare cura nei dettagli che lo rendono davvero un hotel di classe. Camera  molto luminosa, accogliente, arredata con gusto e dotata di ogni comfort. Da segnalare la gentilezza e cortesia del personale che si è reso disponibile in ogni circostanza. Complimenti a tutti, continuate così!",5,2012,04,04
143,"Grande fascino, ottima posizione","Dell’albergo colpisce innanzitutto la posizione, semplicemente straordinaria: situato nel cuore di Londra, con il Tamigi ai suoi piedi, è a pochi passi da Trafalgar Square, House of Parliament, Buckingham Palace, Soho. Si è accolti da uno staff gentilissimo e molto professionale. La struttura, immersa in un’ovattata atmosfera, è una felice combinazione di passato e futuro: ad un gusto attento per la tradizione si affianca ogni tipo di comfort di altissimo livello. Le stanze sono arredate con raffinata eleganza.  In definitiva, uno splendido albergo per un soggiorno londinese davvero indimenticabile.",5,2012,04,03
143,perfektes frühstück in der northhall,"ich war kein hotelgast, sondern habe an einem verregneten samstag morgen fürhstück eingenommen. unbedingt reservieren. eine große halle, marmor, edel, großzügig, viel platz zwischen den tischen, so dass man privatsspähre hat. gute rservice, große auswahl an gerichten. preis/leistung ok. publikum international und ca, ende 3o/anfang 40. 
eine angenehme erfahrung und ein toller start in den tag.
insgesamt ein bischen wie die grand hotels der 20ziger jahre.",4,2012,04,01
143,ein traum.......,"denn das hotel nimmt einem gefangen vom ersten moment an. ich hatte für vier nächte ein zimmer im 7. stock mit wunderbarer aussicht auf die themse. das zimmer, modern aber mit charme und stil eingerichtet (wie im übrigen das ganze hotel), eine dusche die es wirklich regnen lässt und viele extras mehr. den unterschied machen aber nicht nur die zimmer sondern auch das - für ein fünfsterne hotel - eher ungewohnte sehr junge aber absolut kompetente und äusserst aufmerksame personal aus. auch das frühstück (mein tipp: zimmerpreise inkl. frühstück anbieten) war beeindruckend mit herrlich frischen zutaten. leider hatte ich keine zeit fürs spa, werde dieses aber bei einem meiner nächsten london besuche bestimmt nutzen. kurz gesagt, kein wunsch blieb offen und das Corinthia lässt sich mit keinem anderen hotel in london vergleichen. es hat ist schlichtweg bezaubernd und man fühlt sich auch als alleinreisende sehr wohl.",5,2012,02,03
143,"Raffinatezza, cortesia e posizione strategica","Appena arrivati all'Hotel Corinthia siamo subito stati accolti con efficienza e cortesia. Non abbiamo dovuto attendere per avere la camera in quanto già disponibile fin dal primo mattino come pure non ci è stato chiesto nessun sovrapprezzo per un late check out il giorno della nostra partenza. 
Camera sufficientemente spaziosa e molto bene arredata. Forse la temperatuta del riscaldamento un po' alta (con poca possibilità di regolarsi) ma comunque sopportabile. Il bagno di grandi dimensioni con ampia vasca con TV lcd incorporato e a parte grande doccia con erogatore a cascata (favoloso).
Peccato che neanche un hotel a cinque stelle a Londra sfugga all'assenza del bidet.
Disponilita' di canali televisivi da migliorare.
Da segnalare l'accuratezza della pulizia della camera e l'ottima preparazione per la notte.
La cena al ristorante Northall era inclusa nel nostro pacchetto (winter warmer). Ottima la cucina sia internazionale che nazionale inglese. Una nota particolare molto positiva è stata la cortesia del personale di sala. 
Solo discreta la carta dei vini.
Abbiamo anche preso un ""tea"" pomeridiano alla lobby lounge molto buono e con prezzi allineati alle sale da te del centro città.
Forse i prezzi della SPA un po' troppo elevati anche per un albergo di questa classe.
Edificio storico ed esso stesso molto bello in posizione assolutamente strategica in pieno centro di Londra a due passi dalla metropolitana.
Assolutamente consigliato per un soggiorno all'insegna del confort e della classe.",5,2012,01,07
143,soggiorno di lavoro,Ho soggiornato per lavoro in questo hotel molto comodo per l'ottima posizione e molto elegante. Le camere sono piccole ma ben curate ed estremamente pulite. Ottima la colazione con ricca varietà di cibo e bavande. staff molto cordiale e disponibile. Wi fi gratuito nelle camere . Nel complesso é stato un ottimo soggiorno.,4,2012,01,03
143,...begeistert... - tolles klassisches Hotel,"Absolut begeistert von diesem Haus. Das Corinthia wird mein neues Lieblingshotel, wann immer ich jetzt geschäftlich nach London reisen werde. Ein tolles, feudales Ambiente. Hochprofessioneller, zuvorkommender Service. Sehr elegant mit modernem Touch. Vergleichbar mit Westbury Mayfair, The Langham, The Metropolitan. Tolles Haus!",5,2011,07,03
