227,Great location and great hotel!,"Fantastic hotel in central Dublin that is a 10-minute walk to train stations, stops for the hop on/off busses, and endless amounts of pubs and restaurants.  The hotel staff is top notch with the front desk being staffed 24/7.  They were very helpful for advice, directions, getting taxis, or just a extra towel.  Room was clean, modern, and the A/C worked like a champ.",5,2024,10,18
227,Lovely hotel and staff are amazing,"Staff at Drury Court are friendly, professional and go out of their way to help guests. The hotel is clean and in a good location near bars and restaurants and not far from the city centre. I would recommend- thanks to staff on reception and well done!",5,2022,08,25
227,Lovely weekend made special by staff in hotel,"Wow, a lovely hotel, comfy beds, excellent service with a smile.
Breakfast was hot and delicious. Plenty of choices too.
Everything we asked was no trouble...made our anniversary trip very special.  They were knowledgeable of sights to see, best pubs for music and food. 
They gave us a small gift for our Anniversary,  that was so thoughtful.",5,2024,10,12
227,Should have stayed longer!,"The staff are extremely helpful and friendly, we arrived hours before check-in but they took our bags for safekeeping and offered to call should the room be available earlier, which they did.  The room was beautiful, all tea and coffee facilities incl biscuits were ready and waiting along with the most comfortable beds! The room was very quiet, no noise at all from the nearby nightlife which considering how close it is, was testament to the fab double glazing. We had breakfast in the morning which was amazing, well worth the small cost when booking I would definetely recommend it.
Every member of staff we met were just so friendly and helpful and gave us the signature Irish welcome, it felt like we arrived as guests and left as friends.
 5* from us Drury Court Hotel you were fantastic!",5,2024,09,28

227,Ideal location in Dublin!,"Booked this hotel based on TripAdvisor reviews, and on its close proximity to Temple Bar.  Did not disappoint.  Hotel is older, but has everything you want.  Staff should be commended, as they are all VERY friendly, and most helpful.  Nothing was too much trouble.
There are plenty of great pubs and restaurants near to the hotel.
Breakfast was awesome, including the made to order offerings.  
My daughter and I had a twin room, and it was great.  Beds super comfy.  Pillows were very flat, which didn't suit me, so thought maybe an alternative could be offered?  I didn't let them know though, so maybe it is already?
All in all we loved our stay here.  Would definitely stay again if we travel to Dublin.",4,2024,09,05
227,Great hotel,"Hotel room was clean and well decorated. Had all the amenties you might need.

227,"Great experience, fantastic location","My friends and I stayed in one of the 6 people apartments. The hotel was in a fantastic location for our needs, and the apartment was a great size, with enough space and was very comfortable. The rooms were clean and well furnished.

227,Excellent hotel and location,Excellent location and super friendly staff. Spacious room and very comfortable beds. We liked the hotel but found Dublin a big disappointment. Only ten minutes walk to the museum quarter and a similar walk to the Temple bar area. We would recommend this hotel,5,2024,07,03
227,Thank you 🥰,"This hotel might be the best I’ve ever stayed in. They were so unbelievably friendly and such a joy.

Good size bathroom with great shower. Towels were a good size and plenty of them. 

Breakfast was amazing, lovely restaurant with a good choice of hot and cold food all cooked to perfection, staff really attentive checking everything was ok. 

Nothing negative to say. 100% recommend this hotel.",5,2024,06,02
227,Great choice for Dublin Stay,"We originally chose Drury Court based on recommendation, availability and price for our group of 6 - and after staying there we are so glad we did! The location is fantastic, safe area, in a busy yet quaint section of Dublin filled with small shops, pubs, and dining establishments. It’s near Grafton Street and Temple Bar area, situated  perfectly for walking to almost all Dublin attractions. We walked to Guinness and Teeling Distillery (only time we needed a taxi was for our visit to Kilmainham Jail). The rooms were spacious, clean, and with updated bathrooms. Aside from that, we cannot commend the staff members enough for their friendliness and pleasant demeanors. Each one met us with friendly greetings and smiles - and offered suggestions on what to do and see in the area. Email Communication prior to our stay was timely and helpful. Thank you for your hospitality while we visited Dublin. Drury Court was the perfect place for us!",5,2024,06,01
227,Terrific stay - highly recommend,"Believe the other positive reviews. This is a very reasonably-priced hotel in a central location. It’s easy to walk to all of the main attractions from here. It’s also clean, neat, and comfortable. The staff at the front desk were super friendly and helpful. I arrived early morning and stored my luggage; by noon I had already received a call that my room was ready. In addition, this was the only hotel during my 10-day stay in Ireland that offered a top sheet for the bed and/or washcloths, if a guest so desired, since they knew that was something most Americans were used to having, I would definitely stay here again on a future visit and highly recommend this hotel.",5,2024,05,26
227,Nice Centrally Located Hotel with a Welcoming Staff,"In preparation for a private group tour with Overland Tours, I booked our group of 19 at the Drury Court Hotel. The hotel is centrally located within Dublin, as we walked to the Temple Bar area, Trinity College and the EPIC Immigration Museum. Attached to the hotel is it's pub whereby an exceptional breakfast is served every morning. We found the rooms to be quite clean and very reasonable in size for Ireland. The help at the front desk was clearly exceptional, as the reservation Manager Emma even booked the Old Storehouse Pub in the Temple Bar area to insure that our group could dine together. Should also be aware that just across the street from the hotel is the Hairy Lemon, another well known pub in the city. The staff here really goes beyond to ensure your stay is memorable!",5,2024,05,25
227,Five Star Service & Excellent Location,"We walked all of Dublin in 2 days and this is by far the best area for accomodations, close to shopping, walking distance to the main attractions and yet out of the ""party scene"". A very comfortable and convenient hotel. Our room looked out on the alley and lacked some natural light. The garbage trucks run late at night and there's a popular bar downstairs so bring ear plugs. That said...we slept well and the room was quite lovely. The staff at the desk were outstanding! They went out of their way to assist us with transportation and restaurant recommendations. Five star for the service!!! We would stay here again.",4,2024,05,25
227,Return Stay,"We recently returned from a trip to Ireland.  We were very happy to return to the Drury Court Hotel!  This conveniently located hotel feels like home to us when we visit Dublin.  The staff in reception are lovely and extremely knowledgeable.  We actually booked two stays during this trip.  Two nights at the beginning and four nights at the end.  Both rooms were very comfortable and nicely appointed.  
Our favorite room is a corner room at the front of the hotel.  It’s large with plenty of drawer and closet space.  The bathroom appeared to be recently renovated.  The large windows offered great views of the street below but due to double glazing it was quiet even though we were on the first level.  
We are looking forward to staying again when we visit next year!",5,2024,05,24
227,Phenomenal Staff!,"I have never stayed at a hotel with such a nice, helpful, and knowledgeable front desk staff as here at the Drury Court Hotel. Rooms do not come with refrigerators, but you can request a small one. The bed was quite comfortable, and the breakfast is very good. The location is absolutely superb. Besides Trinity College, the Temple Bar area, and St. Pat's, Christ Church Cathedral , the Castle, and the River Liffey are in walking distance, as are a number of wonderful pubs and restaurants, the Grafton Street shopping area, St. Stephen's Green, and Ireland's National Gallery. 
I cannot recommend the Drury highly enough.",5,2024,05,23
227,Very nice hotel in a central location.,"Great hotel! The rooms are very nice and the staff is very friendly and helpful. They go out of your way to make your stay great. They gave good recommendations for restaurants and even packed us a take away breakfast when we had to leave before getting the breakfast offered by the hotel. 

Perfect location - within walking distance of all major attractions.",5,2024,05,15
227,Central location,Small centrally located hotel.  The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was very clean and comfortable.  Was disappointed that the restaurant was under construction but was not a deal breaker.  You could walk anywhere from the hotel.  Would recommend staying here while in Dublin.,5,2024,05,14
227,Very nice hotel in an outstanding location.,"Very nice hotel in an outstanding location, walking distance from everything.  The staff was super friendly and helpful, and the room was quiet, clean and had plenty of space for our family.  The restaurant was under renovation, but there's no shortage of great breakfast options very close by.  Would absolutely stay here again.",5,2024,05,11
227,"Comfortable, clean, centrally located","Had an excellent stay! 

We flew in early on the day of our checkin (around 11AM) and the front desk staff was so gracious with allowing us to check in early since a room was available. I cant thank them enough for this given how tired we were after a long overnight flight. This isnt a guarentee that they would have rooms available but we got lucky and they were also nice enough to accomodate - not all places would despite having rooms available. 

As for the hotel itself - its in excellent location, close to a ton of bars and restaurants. As first timers in Dublin, it was a great place to base ourselves. 

The hotel itself was extremely clean, the bed was very comfortable, the temperature control settings work well. Quiet inside the room despite being in a centrally located area. 

The front desk staff is very helpful with everything, including providing recommendations for food, sightseeings, etc. 

I would probably just stay here again if we went to Dublin due to our excellent experience.",5,2024,05,04
227,Wow! Three good days!,"Four out of the six of us have never been to Dublin. My wife and I have never traveled outside the United States. As soon as we arrived to Drury Court, we felt at home. The rooms were perfect for us. The bed was comfortable, and there were good places to store our gear. Our beds were changed each day. Our room was tidied up each day as well. 
We certainly appreciate the help the clerks gave us. They were constantly bombarded with silly questions from us. Maddy, Jayne, and Fiona pleasantly answered our questions each and every time. Thanks for making our stay so nice!",5,2024,04,26
227,Highly recommended !,"I stayed in Drury Court as a stopgap arrangement for a night, but I am glad I did. There are many hotels in this area, and most of them are good, so beyond a point its the people who make a difference and Drury court is the perfect example of it. 

As far as the hotel is concerned its located in the middle of the downtown, very accessible via public transport as well but somehow feels quiet and isolated at the same time. The rooms are neat and clean, decent sized with the old style charm but also have a good modern bathroom. The interior decoration of the rooms is done in a very thoughful way, which gives a personal touch and happy vibe. The room is equipped with anything and everything you will need for your stay, the TV supports streaming (it doesnt happen everywhere in EU) and they even had the Netflix guest account logged in (hope that was not by mistake :D).

Coming back to the people, right from the begining I was made to feel very welcome with bright and smiling staff. I was given the information about things to do nearby, commute and places to eat around. Their kitchen/restaurent was under renovation but I did not miss much due to lot of breakfast places around. I forgot my Germany to Ireland connecting adapter, and they were so kind to even lend me one for my stay. 

Overall it was a very positive experience, and I would highly recommend Drury Court for a pleasent stay.",5,2024,04,12
227,Advised for a stay in Dublin,"Loved the upgrade I received at this hotel! The room was super cozy and comfortable. Plus, being right in the heart of Dublin, it was awesome to have public transportation and great restaurants within walking distance. Surprisingly, despite being in the bustling city center, it was really quiet, which made for a peaceful stay.",4,2024,03,28
227,"Absolutely loved our stay. Beautiful room, clean and fully kitted out. Amazing staff!! Excellent service and value for money.","We will definitely be back to stay here again. Very central, the car park was just around the corner from the hotel and everything within walking distance. The staff here were the most attentive and helpful that I have experienced for a while. Loved it. ",5,2024,03,25
227,Super duper lovely staff,"Amazing reception staff, incredibly welcoming. We were greeted by Fiona then Valmir looked after me throughout the night and kept me company in the lobby as I wasn’t ready to sleep whilst my buddy wanted an easier night. The receptions stored with lots of goodies such as crisps, chocolates, ponchos for the rain, bird seeds to feed bits at the park and even at st Patrick day accessories for the weekend. The rooms are sufficient and clean and the item is in a fabulous location close to the city town, temple are and the park. If you’re light sleeper sun for rooms on the higher floors or it can be quite loud. Apart from that the hotel is full of lovely staff we had Emma and Sofia who helped us look after the luggage supple us with more yummy Tayto crisps and even helped me look for stamps for my postcards. So it was a lovely send off with exceptionally friendly and welcoming staff. I’d go back just because everyone’s so sweet.",5,2024,03,20
227,Dublin with friends,"Great location  everything is walkable and nice location 
Lovely quiet rooms and comfy beds 
Super clean 
Couldn’t fault anything 
Everything you could need in the room 
Great breakfast options and option for Irish breakfast which looked lovely 

Super friendly 
Felt very safe

227,Friendly front desk people!,"My husband and I stayed here for one night and loved it! Front desk people were great and gave lots of suggestions for attractions, restaurants, and pubs! Discounted parking is available just around the corner from the hotel! The room was nice and quiet! Definitely would stay again!",5,2024,03,04
227,Faultless stay in February.,"Had a lovely stay here this week.  Just an overnight to attend a performance at the Olympia, but we were very impressed.  Great location and very clean and comfortable.  Great shower!  Staff were friendly and attentive without being obsequious.  Breakfast was great and set us up for our homeward journey.  I know this place can be quite pricey in high season, but I was very happy with what we paid and my only regret was that we hadn't booked another night.  It really was faultless.",5,2024,02,29
227,Top-Notch Hospitality: Our Charming Stay at The Drury Court Hotel,"Our stay at The Drury Court Hotel was exceptional from start to finish. The reception staff kindly offered us an early check-in for free, and their insider tips for nearby brunch spots were spot-on. We were impressed by the spaciousness and modernity of the newly renovated bathroom in our room. Despite the central location, noise was barely noticeable, even on a busy Saturday night. As we departed, we couldn't help but feel grateful for the exceptional service provided by the reception staff. Their kindness and warm professionalism left a lasting impression on us, and we cannot wait to return to The Drury Court Hotel for another unforgettable stay. Highly recommended for anyone seeking a perfect blend of comfort and hospitality in the heart of the city.
PS. We couldn't stop talking about our wonderful experience at The Drury COurt Hotel even after returning home, and our family members were so impressed that they've already planned their next stay at The Drury COurt Hotel during their visit to the city.",5,2024,02,25
227,Outstanding in every way,"Just realized we forgot to post a review on our stay here. This hotel is remarkable. The location is great, making all of central Dublin's attractions easily walkable, or there's a tram stop around the corner. Lots of shopping nearby, both small stores and two large shopping centers, and lots of restaurants and pubs close by. We had a twin-bed room, which was very comfortable. Good sized closet for storage. And they know how to deal with the preferences of Americans. Don't like the duvet? They'll give you a top sheet. There's a basket of washcloths at the front desk, since these are not commonly given in European hotels. Security is great, as you have to swipe your room key card to enter the vestibule leading to the elevator. Another door from the lobby leads to the pub next door, where they serve an excellent buffet breakfast, over and above what a continental breakfast typically is. Many choices, all good, and hot choices such as pancakes cooked to order. If you're a coffee drinker, they'll serve your own individual French press. We were there 10 nights and all the front desk personnel were friendly and helpful with tips on attractions and transportation. If you're considering this hotel, it's definitely worth the money. Can't say enough about the location, people and comfort. You won't be sorry if you stay here.",5,2024,02,17
227,Top Class,"I stayed here whilst on business in Dublin. I have to say my stay was top class from start to finish.
We arrived on an early flight and got to the hotel around noon. Didn’t really expect the rooms to be ready, but the extremely helpful lady on reception moved some things around, allowing us to check in ahead of our meeting.
Lovely spacious clean rooms and a fantastic bar attached too, coupled with an amazing central location, what’s not to like?",5,2024,02,07
227,"Central, clean, amazing staff.","One of the cleanest hotels I've seen in the city.
The rooms were great - the beds were super comfy and the shower looked so good!
Location is superb, close to everything for day and night life in Dublin.
And cherry on top, the staff was lovely, they were incredibly accommodating and detailed when giving information - you could really ask for anything - they had the answer!
Super recommended.",5,2024,01,30
227,Decent Hotel in a Great Location.,"Very pleasantly surprised by this hotel.  It’s clean, reasonably priced and in a great location for exploring Dublin.  Very handy for public transport, site seeing on foot and very comfortable.  The only minor issue that cropped up was internal maintenance work on our floor starting at 8am.  That aside, I will definitely stay here again, and recommend it to others.",4,2024,01,23
227,An amazing hotel in a perfect location,"My friend and I were visiting Dublin for a few days and the Drury Court Hotel was recommended to us.  It certainly didn't disappoint.  It was absolutely perfect.  The staff were amazing and couldn't do enough to help us during our stay.  Our twin room was absolutely spotless with plenty of space and extremely comfortable beds.  We chose to add the cost of breakfast to our room for our 2 night stay for the sake of convenience.  It was absolutely delicious with so much choice and good value for money.   There are many attractions right on the doorstep, including the beautiful St. Stephens Green Park.  A huge thank you to the lovely staff for looking after us so well, we will certainly be back.",5,2024,01,21
227,"I will definitely go back to this hotel, it is very central, walking distance to shopping centers restaurants and bars. ","I accidentally booked a single occupant fir my stay, my partner decided that he could make it, so I send a message to the hotel on the day I was going to check in, unfortunately I did receive a message back, when we arrived, I check in and the girl say it was not a problem, my partner could stay at the same rate. The receptionist was very helpful to show us where to go. Always a smile when we passed the lobby. Great receptionist.",5,2024,01,11
227,Excellent Hotel for a weekend trip,"Fantastic place to stay. Location wise, it was 10/10, right in the centre, within walking distance of all the spots we had on our list to visit. The staff were really great, giving me loads of useful information in the run up to our visit, and their attention to detail was impressive, down to a box of chocolates left in the room for my husband for his birthday. Breakfast was simple but really tasty and the room was exceptionally clean and comfortable. Thank you for giving us a really great base for our first trip to Dublin!",5,2024,01,09
227,Superb,"Stayed here with my daughter Sabrina and my son Eric on 23/12/2023. We had a fantastic greeting from the two receptionists and very central, good area, good price, good breakfast, highly recommend this hotel.",5,2024,01,05
227,In the middle of it all,"This hotel was in the middle of it all!! It was a very busy weekend right before Christmas. Very helpful staff and had a tremendously good breakfast with the room. In fact, they provided a bag breakfast for us because we were leaving before breakfast opened. Fantastic!",5,2024,01,03
227,Great stay,Had the most wonderful experience here. The receptionist Emma House is so welcoming and made our experience a memorable one. Emma really made our stay here so special. I would really recommend staying here.,5,2023,12,24
227,Excellent Staff,"Stayed here in December and found the staff there to be excellent, arguably the friendliest I've come across anywhere. 

The hotel is centrally located and ideal if you want to be in Dublin City Centre with lots of bars and restaurants nearby.

The hotel needs some updating in parts but the room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable. ",4,2023,12,13
227,Lovely hotel,This hotel is in a great location in Dublin! The front desk staff was very pleasant and accommodating. The rooms are lovely even though the beds and pillows  are a little harder than I prefer. I would stay here again. ,5,2023,11,28
227,Excellent beyond expectations,"I stayed here twice during my visit to Ireland. The customer service was beyond expectation. They were very helpful.,  the girls going beyond the normal duties to help. It was more like staying with family than in the hotel. I will definitely stay here again if I have the opportunity to come back to Ireland",5,2023,11,27
227,Truly the best hotel staff of all time!!,"I have stayed at the Drury Court hotel a few times in the past but it had been a few years. I always have a lovely time but I was blown away by their hospitality and service on this occasion. The reception staff are incredibly welcoming, particularly Fiona and Emma. I was so surprised that they remembered me, even mentioning specific details of my previous stays. Unfortunately my luggage was lost by my airline and I had to have it delivered to the hotel days after I landed. Knowing that I was busy with work and events, Fiona went out of her way to coordinate with the curriers and ensure everything was received securely. I arrived back to my room to find that my bags had even been brought upstairs. I was so grateful to have an annoying and stressful situation completely taken off my plate so that I could focus on the purpose of my trip. Thanks again as always to the incredible staff and I look forward to seeing you soon!",5,2023,11,12
227,5 Star service and experience for a 3 star price!!,"I had a fabulous stay again in Drury Court hotel. Having travelled to more than 50 countries I can absolutely vouch this is the nicest hotel I've stayed in. The staff are the friendliest and always very thoughtful and helpful. 

Previously when I stayed during the St Patrick's Day weekend the hotel provided a free paddy's day goody bag with paddy's day items and noe for Halloween there were free trick or treat candy and snack station. 

No other hotel I've stayed in goes above and beyond the way the staff in this hotel do. Honestly the nicest hotel in a gorgeous location with the loveliest staff. ",5,2023,11,01
227,Thank you for making my stay so lovely. ,"Having stayed at the Drury Court Hotel, my experience from the time I checked in until the time I checked out was absolutely delightful. Having been given a very warm welcome by the front of house staff, I immediately felt at home. I was greeted by the friendliest staff who could not have done enough for me, ensuring all I needed for my stay was their priority. Emma and her colleagues ensured my stay in Dublin was one I wouldn't forget providing me with local information on events happening around city, as well as local restaurants which served delicious food. My hotel room itself was very comfortable, especially after a day of touring the city. I cannot thank all the staff at the Drury Court Hotel for making my stay so wonderful. ",5,2023,11,01
227,Poor customer service ,"What might otherwise have been a good review was unfortunately marred by some not so great interactions with a member of their front desk staff and management.
My complaint- that we were never told there was a charge for continental breakfast and there is no mention of it anywhere (the menu has prices for the hot food but not the continental breakfast). Just in case they haven’t fixed it by now, it’s €12.50/ person.
Staff waited until we sat down and were eating the food before asking us to sign a receipt. We weren’t the only ones unaware of the charges.

We arrived early, our room was unavailable (totally fine since they let us leave our bags behind the counter). The staff on duty took our names and told us we could go have breakfast (we didn’t have a room number and were not informed of the charge). We elected to go elsewhere so we could start exploring the city. (This would have been the perfect opportunity to inform guests of the charge for continental breakfast. Other hotels we stayed at in Dublin let us know up front).

On our last day, prior to checking out, we decided to have the continental breakfast. This was when we were informed via a room charge (as mentioned above) that our breakfast was not free.
I stopped at the front desk to register a complaint about the lack of information and was met with immediate pushback. Instead of validating my complaint and letting me know she would pass it along, she chose instead to tell me I was wrong, argue with me, and smirk. She even went so far as to grab a menu to point out that I was wrong (regardless of how many times she pushed the menu at me, there was still no price listed for the continental breakfast). 
After arguing with me for several minutes, I pulled out my card to pay for my meals- that’s when she told me she had waived the charges- as if she was doing me a favor. I have no problem paying for meals I ate- I just wanted a little transparency in the pricing.
I realize that many people may wave their white privilege flag and demand free stuff they think they deserve, which makes customer service more difficult. I didn’t ask or expect free food- I just asked to lodge a valid complaint.
When I emailed the management about the poor interaction, I was met with gaslighting and placating. 
Her staff member was never rude (hate to break it to you but everyone is rude sometimes) and that her first inclination was to offer me a free meal (also not true). 
When someone in a customer service role chooses to argue and tell a customer that they are wrong, then are backed up by their management, that’s not a place that cares about their guests. Yes, we all have bad days but an apology, acknowledgement, and validation of the customer’s concerns goes a long way to making things right.",2,2023,10,29
227,Recently refurbished,"You will not find a friendlier staff anywhere to match this hardworking team. Rooms are clean, cosy and very comfortable. The bar is busy with an interesting clientele. Gorgeous breakfast served in bar. Great stay and thank you for my lovely room.",5,2023,10,24
227,Met all our needs and more,"A great location, clean and quiet room (facing the back of another building), with really comfortable (firm) beds, wide choice of breakfast options, and lovely, helpful staff. We stayed three nights and would definitely stay there again.",5,2023,10,04
227,Fantastic hotel in great location ,"Just got back from a 4 night stay at this amazing hotel and can honestly say I really did not want to leave. The location is perfect, walking distance to Grafton Street, Temple Bar, O’Connell street and most places easily accessible. The Hairy Lemon pub opposite is a must to visit and the noodle bar across the road was great (tasted better than it looked). The rooms are spacious, well designed and spotlessly clean. The reception staff are incredibly friendly and always on hand to help and give advice. The breakfast in the adjoining pub was lovely (recommend Bap to the future) and again great attentive staff. Compliments to housekeeping for top cleanliness. I thoroughly recommend this hotel and will definately be staying here again on my next trip to Dublin. ",5,2023,10,03
227,Great stay at the Drury,"We stayed at the Drury Court Hotel for four nights on a recent visit to Dublin.  The room was comfortable and clen, the water pressure in the shower was great, the location is wonderful, but what made our stay special was the staff.  They were very enthusiastic to help and seemed to genuinely want us to enjoyed our stay in the hotel and in Dublin.  We opted to include the breakfast with our stay and were happy with the food and attentive staff.  Plus on a day that we had a day trip that meant we had to leave the hotel before breakfast service, they provided us with a packed breakfast. 
The location couldn't be better - within walking distance from so many attractions and great pubs and restaurants, but not on a busy street.   I would not hesitate staying there again.",5,2023,10,02
227,Great hotel,My friends and I stayed here for two nights in early September.  Our rooms were comfortable and quiet.  Our breakfast was included and it was served promptly and was tasty.  The staff were incredibly friendly!  The location is excellent - within walking distance of many of Dublin's interesting sites.  ,5,2023,09,24
227,Excellent hotel in the heart of Dublin,"This hotel was the best hotel we stayed in during our 10-day European trip. Emma and Emma at the front desk went out of their way to help us, from allowing us to check in to our room early to helping us get a room with a bigger bed for my husband for our last night. We stayed there twice during our trip, and each time the staff went above and beyond to offer assistance. The rooms were clean and comfortable, with perfect air conditioning. We would stay here again in a heartbeat. Great breakfast, too. Absolutely outstanding hotel in a great location to explore Dublin on foot.",5,2023,09,12
227,"GREAT CHOICE!! Excellent location, friendly reception desk","We loved our stay here. The staff is excellent and make this hotel a stand-out. Everyone at the front desk went out of their way to be friendly and really help us. They are locals with great recommendations and really cared about us. On top of that is the location which is excellent- this hotel is close to many of the sites you’ll es t to explore, right up the road from the Gaiety theatre, Grafton street and Trinity college, essentially everywhere you want to go. The breakfast st the adjoining restaurant was good too.",5,2023,09,03
227,Hidden gem in center of Dublin,"This is an excellent hotel right in the heart of Dublin
got here based on the reviews and got an excellent price direct with the hotel
we were worried location might be noisy but the glass was totally sound proof and we had a quiet night sleep
location allows easy access to anything you may need including cafes, restaurants pubs and more
easy parking across the street in a garage with very reasonable price
front desk service was above and beyond for anything we needed - very nice and knowledgeable ladies :)

would definitely return!",5,2023,08,24
227,Perfect stay in great location,"So glad we decided to stay here. Booked my trip months ago; I needed a larger room 2 weeks prior to trip as son traveling with me. They upgraded us to 2 beds with no fee.  Breakfast was phenomenal.  We ordered off menu and able to help ourselves to croissants, fruit, etc. Best croissant I’ve had in forever!  Room was very quiet at night. Location was perfect to walk everywhere. 
We asked for dinner referral and Darkey Keely’s was awesome. Food and music best in town.",5,2023,08,18
227,Exceptional Service / Amazing Find,"Stayed here at the start of July with family and what an amazing find! Beautiful hotel, spotlessly clean and in an ideal location within walking distance of all amenities and sites worth visiting. The best part of the hotel is the staff. They are by far the most professional, friendly and helpful team I have come across in any hotel in recent times. Special shout out to Emma that was especially helpful in changing around my booking at the last minute and accommodating the request at the last minute.  I would highly recommend staying here.10/10 experience and the front desk has any info you needed on how to get around.Will be back soon for another stay!",5,2023,07,25
227,Highly recommend - so friendly and helpful,"100% satisfied with our stay. The staff could not have been more welcoming and informative, and incredibly helpful with finding a solution to parking our big van which made an enormous difference to our stay. The proper sized apartment was so convenient after a long journey. We were able to cook ourselves a proper meal and relax. Very conveniently located on the edge of Temple Bar district and short walks to Grafton St and Trinity College.",5,2023,07,22
227,Would definitely stay here again,"The staff was fantastic. especially Aine and Emma; location is awesome for walking to most key sites, too.  Restaurant/bar was so busy, that we didn't even try to get in.  Rooms were fine and very clean; windows were quite sound proof despite the bar below. But darn it, somehow we missed that the rooms have A/C (unlike all the other hotels we stayed at in Ireland the week before); we certainly could have used it in June. Security/access was quite good, too.   It was on the expensive side for a weekend stay, but reasonable given the location and overall experience.",5,2023,07,22
227,Irish Hospitality at its finest,"We spent one night at the Drury Court Hotel during our 11 nights traveling around Ireland. We had two rooms for our party of 5 and slept SO well. The rooms had air conditioning (this is not standard in Ireland and it can be noisy to leave windows open in a city over night). Water pressure was awesome, the room was clean and quiet. They have double windows which keeps street noise out and room darkening curtains (the sun sets after 10pm and is up at 5am--so this is important). Emma and the rest of the staff could not have been more hospitable. They provided excellent recommendations for places to eat, and even let us park our car in the staff lot, as one of the spots was available during our stay. They are centrally located--an easy walk to all the attractions we were interested in. We would highly recommend staying at the Drury Court, the accommodating staff really was the icing on the cake, making it our best hotel stay of the trip! Thank you for your hospitality!",5,2023,07,19
227,Putting the hospitable in hospitality,"Have stayed in this boutique hotel several times throughout the years with both family and friends and for different occasions and it never fails to exceed expectations.
They certainly understand hospitality and the staff, from reception & front of house to accommodation make this hotel what it is.
Excellent location, central to everything.
Had booked two rooms and on arrival to rooms we were greeted with a beautiful box of chocolates and a welcome back message- what a nice touch 😍
Excellent security in hotel, great bar P Macs, spotless rooms with spotless pillows and mattresses and nothing is ever a problem.
Keep up the great work ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",5,2023,07,14
227,Luxury accommodation in the heart of the city,"A real gem we discovered (well, my husband did!!) as part of our wedding anniversary celebrations, which included a Bastille concert at Trinity College, just 15 mins walk away! Perfect location, easy to find, a 45-minute bus-ride from the airport right to the heart of the city centre.  We were greeted on arrival by a wonderful smiling and helpful reception staff, and after going through the basics, were able to check in early and plan our visits to the best attractions, restaurants and bars during our 3-day trip.  Absolutely nothing was too much trouble - they even organised ponchos when rain was forecast for the concert, bus timetables, hearty breakfasts every day, and a take-away breakfast for an early departure on our last day. Lovely bedroom with all mod cons, including iron and ironing board, safety deposit box and hairdryer, daily towel change, plus triple glazed windows as we were front-facing the best (and noisiest!!) bars in the area. Simple but luxurious, quality accommodation in a wonderful city we were thrilled to be exploring.  Thank you to the whole team! (and to my husband for organising the trip!!) We will be back",5,2023,06,29
227,New favorite hotel in Dublin,"Can’t recommend this hotel enough! The location is beyond perfect, right in the center of everything you’d want to do from tours to nightlife, the rooms however were soundproof lending to some great nights sleep. The staff went above and beyond offering amazing recommendations for day trips/dining and more. The rooms were incredibly clean and comfortable and had ever amenity needed, from an iron to a smart TV. The apartments had a kitchen which was a really welcome amenity for people getting tired of the cost of constant dining out, best of all each room was set up with a fan, a really nice touch for a comfortable sleep in the summer months. Truly the best quality for the most reasonable price in Dublin. Special thanks to Emma and Fiona for being so attentive and making this stay even better. Already looking forward to booking again",5,2023,06,29
227,"Great, central and safe hotel","What an amazing stay! 
The staff is super friendly and helpful and can recommend stuff.  The breakfast buffet is plentyful and has options for dairy free and gluten free as well, and you can order hot breakfast for an extra charge.

We stayed as a family in the 3 bedroom apartment, which is very well equipped- there is even oil, salt etc so you can cook properly, there is a small freezer compartment in the fridge and the TV is a smart TV so the kids could watch Netflix while the parents relaxed.  The beds are comfy and the place is quiet, other than the occasional seagull shriek at night and while there is no ac, there are several very effective tower fans that you can place wherever.
",5,2023,06,20
227,"Great hotel, in good location","Great hotel, in good location close to St Stephen’s Green and Grafton Street. Staff very friendly and welcoming and the hotel is very clean and tidy. Good breakfast served n P Mac’s Bar next door. Some noise at night time but no more than any City location, the triple glazing helps. My booking was held over for 3 years from the pandemic, so it was great to finally visit Dublin again!",5,2023,06,18
227,Great accomodation.,We stayed two nights. Terrific location to explore Dublin. Everything exceeded our expectations. Great staff made our stay perfect. Special thanks to Emma at the reception for making us feel right at home.,5,2023,05,31
227,Cold Hotel,"Cold Hotel, cold room and cold bathroom and breakfast served in a dark bar. Orange Juice for breakfast was Orange Cordial . Car park was near which was good. The room had Air Conditioning but it was poor and I had to go to reception to have the heat in the system turned on. ",3,2023,05,05
227,"Great, reasonably prices hotel, within an easy walk to all attractions.","The Drury Court Hotel is centrally located within an easy walk of central Dublin, St. Patrick's Cathedral, Trinity College, Steven's Green Shopping Center, Dublin Castle, The Little Museum of Dublin, and on and on.  The location is near numerous pubs, yet quite.  The staff was outstanding - I left my iPad at the airport and they worked for two days to track it down and get it back to me.  The rooms are slightly bigger than  many central city European rooms, modern,  and very clean.  If you choose to include breakfast it is a loaded buffet, with the option of ordering a variety of items (including a really good full Irish plate).  I highly recommend the hotel and will stay there again next year when we return to Dublin.",5,2023,04,21
227,Perfect location and very helpful staff,"Very friendly welcome from staff. Provided us with map and marked couple places to walk to and included hotel for walking back.
Continental breakfast was excellent, kids loved the pancakes. 
Requested 2 rooms to be close together as travelled 4 adults & 2 kids. Rooms only slept 3 so 1 child had to sleep in Grandparents room. Hotel honoured request and rooms were opposite each other ⭐
Helpful in storing our luggage and booking taxi for return to airport. 
Def recommend and would stay again. ",5,2023,04,18
227,"Great Hotel, Lovely Staff","This hotel is right in the heart of the city, yet I was able to sleep even on the weekend. My single room was perfect for my solo visit. The continental breakfast os good, but could use some variety from day to day. The staff are lovely and I felt very taken care of.",5,2023,04,16
227,Wonderful location & Great Hospitality!!!,"We stayed at Drury Court for 6 nights and were very pleased with the great location and wonderful staff working the front desk. We enjoyed talking to Maddy and Emma!  The hotel is centrally located and within walking distance to shops & restaurants. We especially loved Taste Food Company for breakfast, just 2 minutes away. The beds were very comfortable. We had a triple room with one double sized bed and one single bed. The room was a good size for 3 people & the bathroom was too. I would recommend this hotel if you are staying in Dublin and we will definitely stay here again when we visit in the future. Great customer service with a smile. We hope to see you all again soon. Thanks Ladies!! Elena & Family ",5,2023,04,14
227,Drury Court . . .top notch boutique hotel!,"I felt so at home . . .the accommodations were excellent and the
staff couldn't have been any more helpful! They helped guide me
with directions and maps to various museums and locations I was
interested in seeing. They are top notch!",5,2023,03,29
227,Great find!,"Well located. Fantastic staff-very helpful suggestions for dining and sightseeing. Super friendly service all around, very accommodating. Really cute room-king size with a single. Typical room but the location and staff make this a total winner-great place!",5,2023,03,12
227,Hidden Gem,"Drury Court is a hidden gem in the highly desirable St Stephen’s Green area of Dublin.  Located just steps across the street from the famous Hairy Lemon pub, this inconspicuous little charm was exactly what my daughter and I were hoping for on our first trip to Ireland. We were thrilled to learn, after landing at 9 am, that we were able to check in early. Another pleasant surprise was the bountiful daily breakfast (so worth the additional €10 pp) held in the fun and funky P Macs. Our vegan and gluten free dietary needs were served well.  The best part of our stay was the friendly, personal service provided by the lovely Fiona. She was a tremendous assist to us with train directions, maps and cabs. We’re excited to stay again for college move in!",5,2023,03,04
227,"Great People, great location","Stayed for 3 nights.  Arrived early, checked right in.  Room had a bit of wear and tear, but nothing major.  Staff very friendly, helpful and accommodating.  Cant beat the location...in the Temple Bar area and just a few blocks from St. Stephens Green and rail line.  We had to leave early in the a.m., the staff provided us breakfast ""to go""  in a bag, which was quite filling.

Look forward to my return to Dublin and will definitely return to the Drury!",4,2023,03,02
227,"Nice hotel, great location, helpful and friendly staff","Stayed here for 3 nights last week.  Arrived before check-in expecting to just be able to drop off our bags, but the Reception staff checked and found us a room straight away.  Room was clean and comfortable, and fully equipped - even had a fan for my hot flushes!!  Breakfast was lovely, and included in our rate, and the location was perfect for my daughter and I to base ourselves for exploring Dublin.  Would highly recommend - thank  you.",5,2023,02,21
227,Great service and location,"This place was in the absolute perfect location and Emma at the front desk took her time to walk us through all her recommendations for the area. We had a drink at the Hairy Lemon and also went to dinner at Sheehans during our stay. Both were perfect! 

I can’t recommend this place enough and thank you again for all your help, Emma! We will be back next time. ",5,2023,02,10
227,Nice hotel in a great location,We stayed here a couple nights while in Dublin. It is in a great central location close to Grafton Street and St Stephens Green. We were able to walk pretty much everywhere from here.  The WiFi worked well and the beds were comfortable. Overall a great stay.,4,2023,01,31
227,Highly recommend,"Stayed for two nights here, great location, rooms very nice, no road noise as they are double  glazed. Special mention for the friendly staff from font desk, to house staff and bar, all very helpful and pleasant. P Mac's is a lovely old style bar with great value bar food",5,2023,01,31
227,Great hotel when travel with young kids.,"The hotel is in a perfect area close to shops, restaurants, pubs and even a great park were our daughter enjoyed watching the ducks, Swans and squirrels. We were staying in an appointment since we were traveling with young kids. The apartments are easily accessible by a lift. Towels are changed everyday. The staff are the absolute best, so friendly and helpful. Lastly, the breakfast was perfection, a wide variety of options and everything was fresh and tasty. They also catered for my daughter who is coeliac and requires gluten free food. Thank you for hosting us Drury court ❤️",5,2023,01,03
227,Apartment stay,"Booked an apartment through the drury court hotel for a one night stay for four people. The apartments are located next door to the hotel but check in is via the hotel. Staff were friendly on check in and although our room wasn’t ready they stored our bags for us. They also gave me a call to let me know when the room was ready. The apartment itself is lovely, really spacious and is equipped with a mini kitchen, hairdryer and shower toiletries as well as  a large tv in the living area. The apartment was a little cold albeit being December. Location is great and only a short walk to most key places in Dublin. My only negative was the noise at night, being so central we could hear all the noise of Friday night and struggled to sleep. 
Overall I would recommend and would stay again, just be aware that you may hear some of the noise from central dublin.",4,2022,12,18
227,It was ok.,"The location is good, but the hotel is quite dated. The rooms were a good size but were carpeted, with older furnishings, and the elevator and check-in area were small. The staff was very nice, but the hotel wasn't for us for the money spent. We were last-minute bookers based on a flight, so the price was quite expensive and, with all due respect, not nearly worth the price charged.",3,2022,12,17
227,Lovely stay,Lovely hotel. We had a very early flight into dublin and arrived at the hotel at 7.30am now we knew we couldn’t check in but just wanted to leave our bags for a day of touring around. We were great by a very friendly lady who let us leave our bags and even let us check in so it would be a quick process when we came back.  Hotel was very clean. Beds were nice. Bought ice to the room when asked for it. Rooms had everything we could need. £10pppd for breakfast which was well worth it. Would definitely stay here again. Really central to everything a tourist in dublin would need.,5,2022,12,03
227,Great apartments,"I booked 2 x 3 bedroom apartments for family. Many thanks to Fiona who was very helpful. The apartments were perfect for us. Spacious double bedrooms, comfy beds with extra pillows if needed. The apartments were well equipped and very clean. Each had a balcony. The location was excellent, a short walk (minutes literally) to Temple Bar and attractions. Would highly recommend",5,2022,12,01
227,Birthday city break,"Fantastic hotel. Excellent staff from our first greeting at check in to the maids servicing the rooms & the waiting staff at breakfast. They were all very attentive, polite and genuinely helpful.  The breakfast was delicious. One of the nicest cooked breakfasts we’ve had.  It was my daughters birthday & they had left a box of chocolates in the room for her which made her day.  Great location. Would thoroughly recommend this hotel.",5,2022,11,17
227,Central hotel with a big heart,"This hotel is in a fantastic location. The room was clean, spacious and with some extra nice little touches, given the hotel knew about a birthday and some of our personal circumstances and they wanted to make it an extra nice stay. Those extra touches were much appreciated. The staff are lovely and can't do more to help make your stay comfortable and are keen to help wherever they can.",4,2022,11,07
227,Great Hotel in a great spot,"Lovely hotel in the heart of everything to see! 
Really lovely staff, polite and helpful. 
The best cooked breakfast I’ve had in a hotel! 
Lovely clean tidy rooms. 
I would recommend and will return to this hotel.

227,Long birthday weekend,"From check in staff so friendly & helpful, the 3 bed apartment we had was better than expected,  lovely living area, bedrooms with plenty of space needed more mirrors for 6 ladies , beds comfortable, toiletries & tea & coffee supplied, cleaners checked we needed anything, apartment was spotless apart from we needed to move bed so it does need a clean , central to everything would defo stay again",5,2022,10,20
227,Excellent hotel for location standards and staff.,"We stayed in Dublin for a stag weekend and the hotel exceeded our expectations. A central location, friendly helpful staff. The price bracket of this hotel makes it a really viable option for all sized parties of travellers and I would thoroughly recommend booking.
Kind regards,

227,A Diamond in the Emerald Isle,"Six or more stars please for these guys. A lovely crisp and clean hotel, right in the middle of the city, and a perfect base to explore and enjoy the delights of Dublin.

First impressions arriving at this hotel were superb, and just got better as the [albeit short] stay continued. The location is pertect - a side street, just South of the noisy temple bar area, so you can visit plenty of bars/pubs/clubs/concerts, but not surrounded by drunks - but a really nice street-scene, with a noodle bar spilling into the street outside.

We were greeted by the utterly charming Fiona - who was funny and witty, and put everyone at ease after the usual frustrations and drizzle of travel. I'd mentioned in passing on the booking form that it was a treat-trip we were going on - a concert trip for my wife, at the venue The Button Factory. They'd obviously listened, as there was a lovely box of Milk Tray chocolates in the room - a total and genuinely totally unexpected surprise. 

The room is amazing - really nice quality, and visually appealing as well as comfortable. Nice well-stocked bathroom, with a bath and a shower. he room was surprisingly quiet - has aircon, (although we switched it off - possibly that was why it was nice and quiet). They also have an iron and ironing board, (I bet that doesn't get used much!), but they also have a hair-dryer, which is nice, and a TV but who'd watch TV in a place like Dublin!

We came back very late from our concert, (we'd checked easrlier what time was lock-down time), and there was a party afterwards, but even that was no drama - the night-porter let us in, and was all smiles as we tip-toed in at around 2am. 

Breakfast was a lovely surprise, (we had not realised it was included, so that was a real bonus). Quality of the breakfast is 100% spot on. You can buy extra cooked breakfast etc, but continental breakfast is there, (toast, croissants, yoghurt, cereal, cheese, and fruit salad). Fresh orange juice, and nice coffee. Most of all, a bright and friendly team at the breakfast place also - such a nice team of people - we really felt like we were visiting friends, rather that at a hotel. 

Lastly - and this is the real shining star for us. We booked this hotel via AirBNB, and actually we had booked another place, ages ago on AirBNB but it turned out to be a scam listing - luckily for us, we realised in time, and AirBNB staff were great, enabling us to cancel the scam listing without too much loss/cost, and we were booked in to the Drury Court on the very morning we travelled - so super-last-minute. We were very lucky. 

And the recommendation? We'll definitely stay here again next time we visit Dublin, and I totally recommend this place to any traveller!",5,2022,10,10
227,Staff are amazing,"The staff here were so lovely. They let me store my suitcase for a few days which was incredibly helpful. Any question they were willing to answer. Breakfast was included which surprised me and had a great range of options.

Very close to many restaurants and attractions.

Only downside was it was a bit noisey on a Saturday night due to the bars etc in area",5,2022,10,09
227,"Try It, You'll Like It","What a fun little hotel!  The front desk staff (Fiona and Sophia) were just the greatest.  They were so fun and welcoming, just full of useful information and friendliness.  The restaurant attached to the hotel is a real surprise.  I would never want to tell why and ruin someone else's experience!  Rooms were really nice and the hotel is very conveniently located in downtown Dublin.  It was a bit tricky to find, but more that worth the winding around!  Parking was very close to the hotel and easy to access.",5,2022,10,09
227,LOVED this hotel ,"I can't say enough good things about hotel. The staff are simply amazing first off. The location is great. Rooms and bathrooms are big by European standards and exceedingly clean. We had a discounted rate and got breakfast as well. Breakfast was great and you'll leave full. The day we left, we had to catch our bus earlier than the restaurant opened. They made us huge bags to take breakfast with us! So thoughtful. I would totally stay here again and recommend it to anyone visiting Dublin! ",5,2022,10,07
227,Great stay!,We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The staff went above and beyond to help us from lending us an adapter and suggesting great nearby restaurants. They were excellent! The location is great and rooms are clean and a good size.,5,2022,10,04
227,Location! Location! Location! & Best Staff,"The hotel was clean, rooms bigger than expected, however the best part about our stay for 6 nights is the Staff! they all went above and beyond to make sure we were enjoying our stay.  Emma, Emma, Laura, Lionie, Jaime, (I forgot his name, he is from Algeria) they were all amazing, willing to help, give tips on dining, shopping etc. The restaurant staff were also amazing. Also, the location is the best because its close to everything within walking distance.",5,2022,09,30
227,Wonderful place to stay in great location,"We loved staying at the Drury Court Hotel. 8 ladies were traveling together and 4 stayed in the hotel and 4 in one of the apartments. We loved our rooms, the staff was incredible, breakfast unbelievable. WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Location was great. 
Really cannot say enough nice things about the staff. Helped with anything that we asked for. One of our ladies lost a bag traveling to Ireland and they even made calls to help find it. I felt they were always going above and beyond.",5,2022,09,29
227,Great place,"We stayed two nights in a room for 3 adults.  Very nice, helpful and great staff, excellent location for food, shopping, and an easy walk to everything Dublin has to offer.  Would definitely stay here again next time.   Rooms are great, larger than most, very clean and nice.",5,2022,09,22
227,Highly recommend - excellent location and service,"Family of 4 stayed for two nights, we were so happy with our stay. The service from reception was impeccable! They were all so helpful with anything we needed at all. Our room was very clean, easily fit my family plus all our luggage - website photos are accurate. Double windows made for a quiet sleep (we were on the first floor, facing the street!). Close to food options, shopping, a walk to Trinity College and other sites easily. Would highly recommend!",5,2022,09,19
227,Perfect Accommodations for a Family or Travel Group,"The Drury Court Hotel provides a great set-up for a family, a few couples or singles who prefer their own rooms. My family stayed in apartment 36, which had three bedrooms (two rooms with one double bed each and one room with a king bed that could separate into two twin beds), one bathroom, a kitchenette and a sitting room. There is also a combination washing machine and dryer, although we couldn’t figure out the dryer settings (that’s on us). The entire place was bright and airy and a lovely place to come back to after sight-seeing. The staff was incredibly accommodating and quick to help with any questions or needs. The hotel was also in the perfect location. It was a quick walk to St. Stephens Green, shops and restaurants. Highly recommend this place and getting breakfast included!",5,2022,09,14
227,Great Location,"Perfect location to see all the city center has to offer, majority of things are within easy walking distance.
The staff were all exceptionally friendly and very helpful by responding to all my questions prior to arrival.
Hotel was very clean, and the room was spacious.",5,2022,09,05
227,Great reception and treatment,"The staff at this hotel is extremely helpful and cordial. They do their utmost to make you feel at home and are always ready to help with any requests. 
Apart from this you cannot get any more central than this. A must in Dublin
All the best",5,2022,09,04
227,An absolute treasure,"Cannot speak highly enough about this gem. Have stayed here several times and cannot find a single negative thing to say. The staff is this establishment’s big positive, there’s an air of happiness from the moment you open the door, to be greeted by a smiling face or two and nothing is too much trouble. Location is central and lots of eateries and cosy bars on the doorstep. Looking forward to my next visit already.",5,2022,08,19
227,The kindest staff and best location,I cannot say enough kind words about this place. The staff is phenomenal. Everyone was so helpful and gave great suggestions. Laura especially! So helpful and kind. Excellent location. Clean. We will look to book here again when we return to Dublin.,5,2022,08,08
227,Would stay here again!,"I stayed here for a week and thoroughly enjoyed my visit. I would say the hotel's two biggest strengths are its location and the friendliness of its staff. Everyone, from the people at the front desk, to the servers in the attached pub, to the cleaning lady on my floor, were all very friendly. My room was clean and it had a nice spacious bathroom/tub. The hotel felt very safe with an extra key pad for security to get to the elevator to the rooms. My only small small suggestion for improvement is that the carpet in my room was looking a bit old and dingy and could be replaced soon. But again--I had a really lovely stay here and I would definitely consider this hotel again next time I'm in Dublin.",5,2022,08,03
227,Great Location,This hotel is in such a great location.  Lots to do nearby.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  There was discounted parking around the corner from the hotel.  The Drury Count Hotel more than exceeded my expectations.,5,2022,07,25
227,Second visit. Superior service from the staff.,"This hotel is located close to Grafton Street and St. Stephen's Green. All the staff were very pleasant and helpful. We left an expensive camera across the street at the Hairy Lemon Pub. We were leaving Dublin in the 
morning and were already at the airport when realized where we had left it. An employee of the Pub took it across the street to the desk at the Drury Court.  The front desk staff packaged up the camera and was
very patient with us and DHL as I was making arrangements with DHL while waiting to board a flight.  We cannot say enough good things about this hotel and its great staff. Its conveniently located and clean with  comfortable rooms and a full breakfast. Looking forward to another stay.

227,John Steele,My family and I stayed at the Drury Court hotel the weekend before July 4th. From the moment we arrived Emma and the staff at Drury Court could not have been more helpful. They were extremely friendly and knowledgeable of the area offering suggestions about places to eat and what to see while in Dublin. They had a thorough knowledge of transportation options and helped us navigate the city and trip back to airport. I cannot say enough about their response to any query or concern we had and would definitely recommend anyone when visiting dublin to stay at Drury Court as I know I will. Thank you for pleasant visit.,5,2022,07,07
227,"Location, location off Grafton Street in Dublin!","As an Irish woman living in the US, I returned to Dublin to walk down memory lane in the city I lived in for many years. From the moment we arrived, Emma at reception and all the staff made us feel genuinely welcome. Our room was small but perfect for our 4-night stay.  

We will return and I plan to recommend it to others!",5,2022,07,05
227,Friendly welcoming staff,"Really lovely welcoming and friendly staff
Clean room 
Night porter so felt secure
Great location - very accessible to the city center bars and restaurants
Gave me a takeaway breakfast as my train was before service time which was super nice and above",5,2022,06,27
227,Tired looking rooms and not 5 star service,"I joined my husband at this hotel for our birthday and stayed for a few days. When I arrived at the hotel first impressions were good as the hotel entrance is impressive however when I got up to the room the carpet had threads in the doorway and under the desk the was carpet pulled to the extent that went to the underlay. The bathroom was tired and stained with marks on the mirror and chrome bars. Add to that the aircon didn’t work.
The bed wasn’t changed during the entire stay (5 nights). Which is not what you’d expect from a 5 star hotel. They replaced the towels every day even when we put them on the door to indicate we will use again but never changed the bed? We went to the bar a few times and each time we were ignored for a good few minutes when we were acknowledged they then went to do something round the side rather than serve us.
The program won’t let me upload any pictures.",3,2022,06,17
227,"Brilliant hotel, staff and location","This hotel deserves 5 stars and more. The staff could not do enough for our party of Seven and the rooms were very clean and well equipped. We had ordered a taxi for 5 passengers via reception and a car arrived which could only carry 4 passengers. The hotel immediately offered to pay for an extra taxi. The quality of service all round was brilliant and I cannot wait to visit Dublin and stay in this hotel again.
Kind regards,
Chris",5,2022,06,08
227,"Friendly, helpful staff.","We stayed twice at this hotel recently, both before and after a country house wedding, and we were delighted with our stay. 
Our room each time was clean, light, airy, and nicely laid out with plenty of space. There were complimentary toiletries and hot drink making tray. The bathrooms each time had lovely hot shower and bath options. 
The staff were consistently friendly and helpful, both in giving advice about places to visit, giving directions and arranging for a taxi.
The tasty breakfast, which was available in the adjacent bar, was served with a smile, and there were both cooked and continental options.
The hotel is within easy walking distance of a range of shops, restaurants and pubs.
I will certainly return here if I have occasion to visit Dublin again.",5,2022,06,01
227,Comfortable in a great location,"Great location, walkable to pretty much anywhere you want to go in Dublin. Very close to Grafton street and excellent restaurants. A little loud but nothing unexpected for a busy city hotel. The pubs nearby were a bit loud despite the windows being closed but nothing that wasn’t unbearable. Beds were comfortable and the room was clean. Front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. If ever in Dublin again, I would stay here again.",4,2022,04,28
227,Excellent choice for our family,"I had chosen this property due to the good reviews and recommendations from TripAdvisor experts. We were not disappointed!

The front staff were always so pleasant and Rachel was very kind to book us a tour at Kilmainham Goal while we enjoyed breakfast as she had knowledge that they release extra tickets at 9:30am 
We booked a suite room so it gave us a little extra room for our family with two teens .

I felt safe at this property as they require a key to get into the building to have access to stairs/elevators to rooms right in front of the staff at the desk.
Our room was a little noisy looking over the hairy lemon but we actually liked the sounds of people enjoying conversations and laughing after all we’ve been through with  Covid. 
We are from Canada and our dollar is quite low compared to the euro the staff were very kind to give us a complementary breakfast to make our stay more affordable. The breakfast was out of this world with so much selection and we’re missing our pot of tea and food,
There’s so much to walk around dining shopping all within walking distance. 
If we needed ice the front desk would bring ice buckets up for us or extra towels. 
The property is older but so is everything else in the area so to be expected. 

If we have the pleasure of going back to Dublin we would definitely stay at this property and  highly recommend it .",5,2022,04,27
227,Fantastic,"Drury Court Hotel was a fantastic place to stay for our family of 4. The location is the best- all kinds of nice places to eat and see within a few minutes walk. You step out into the street and are in the heart of it all, yet the room is quiet and peaceful and the STAFF are the best. So incredibly friendly and helpful. Eager to chat and give tips and suggestions on the best local spots, day trips, anything to help you have an awesome stay.  Will stay here again if we are lucky enough to return to Dublin.",5,2022,04,23
227,The next time I am in Dublin I will definitely stay at this hotel.,"A very pleasant hotel perfectly situated between the charming St. Stephen's park, Dublin Castle and Temple bar. Delicious and hearty breakfasts. Rooms clean and equipped with everything necessary.

227,Three star warrants a four statlr status. Great location. Staff fantastic. Food excellent. Perfectly clean. Great place,Girls night away. Location very central. Short pop into Grafton Street for shopping and restaurants. Rooms spacious and clean. Friendliness of staff second to non. Breakfast delicious. No complaints. May be three star but warrants four star status.,5,2022,04,16
227,Above and beyond!,"We, 3 adults stayed at the hotel for 1 night B&B. From arrival to departure, the trip was most pleasing. I can not emphasise how saifactory the high standards of service, facilities and food were. Everything was laid on in a highly personal and professional manner. Staff were most obliging and helpful. The location could not have been better to the city centre shops etc and parking was a sheer bonus. We most certainly will return. Special thanks to Emma and all the staff for their attentiveness and care during our stay.",5,2022,04,11
227,Everything we needed,"Family run, family oriented, friendly and a great location! We felt like family every time we came into the lobby. The girls at the desk were eager to help and give recommendations. Our room was clean and prepared when we arrived and there’s the option of eating in for any meal. Our room was exactly as pictured and promised and serviced daily. We loved our short stay and would stay here again.",5,2022,03,13
227,Perfect place for us and amazing staff  -  will be back,"Visited Dublin mid-February, stayed 3-4 nights at Drury court. 

Location was very good and the best of all was the staff. Amazingly friendly and helpful. Particular thanks to Emma and Rachel for having made our stay so nice.

Nice and spacious room, part of the furniture may be not at the most modern standard, thus the bed was very comfortable.

Will stay there next time we are in Dublin !!",5,2022,03,13
227,Great hotel in a great location ,"A great hotel in a great location. The room was spacious and the bed was really comfortable. They only had one small complimentary pot of shower gel in the bathroom, although the maid found us a couple of extra the next morning. So you might want to take your own. Reception staff were lovely and so helpful on check in advising where to go etc. It really is in a great spot and had the best local pubs/bars around and although we did pop to temple bar (as you have to!) I would advise to stay around the hotel area for drinks way more fun. Would definitely recommend for others to stay ",5,2022,03,03
227,Great Location and Great Staff,"Stayed here for just two nights for a concert. Super convenient to many sites as well my venue of interest! The front desk staff was amazing with recommendations of where to walk and eat, sorting a taxi and holding bags whilst I was out and about after check out. They even offered me cutlery and a plate when I returned with takeaway! Wonderful attention :)

The room was great, spacious, quiet and clean which I definitely care about. The neighborhood can be noisy at night but I didnt really hear much as they have triple paned windows. I really enjoyed this stay and would definitely stay again next time I'm in Dublin City!",5,2022,01,31
227,Amazing staff and great location!,"Just returned from a trip to Dublin...stayed at Drury Court Hotel for 3 nights.  Right from the start of planning my trip, Emma, was amazing!  She provided very detailed local information regarding places to see, eat and ways to get around town. She also recommended the best company for a private day trip excursion (Little Gem Tours).  Emma and the rest of the concierge staff were extremely prompt at responding to emails and giving great insight on local things to do and see.  The rooms were clean and I have to give a shout out to the staff in the restaurant...very attentive and great food.",4,2021,12,10
227,Nothing to dislike,"This hotel is clean, ideally situated and all staff were courteous and accommodating. 
My room was bigger than I  expected and well set out. Really nothing to complain about. When three friends and I arrived (slightly early) the receptionist was anxious to help with directions etc.",5,2021,12,09
227,Overnight apartments,"Stayed in apartments on Saturday night. Friendly & helpful staff. Breakfast delicious good selection. Good service.?Got reduced parking rate & breakfast included in overnight price. There were 4 of us so great value 
Noise from street at night after bars close.",5,2021,11,30
227,Great location and amazing staff,We stayed in the Drury Hotel near Grafton street.  It was a quck visit.  I rang beforehand to book a parking space in the hotel's parking and received a very helpful and friendly person on the phone. When  we arrived at the  reception we received a lovely friendly welcome from Rachael and Áine making us feel at home. From the beginning of our stay to the end these girls could not do enough for us.  We asked them to recommend a restaurant serving later than 9pm.  They must have rung about ten restaurants for us.  We had to leave the hotel but Áine  rang us 30 mins later to tell me that they found a restaurant and booked us in.    I have full respect for this hotel having the good sense to employ these irreplacable employees.  They absolutely make this hotel!   The hotel is in a great locality if you need to do a bit of shopping.  The beds were comfortable. Our room was clean and a good size.  RECOMMEND ; Updating the bathrooms at some stage.  Shower was obviously designed by a man :)  Also match the room decor to the reception area.,4,2021,11,23
227,"Great location, staff and excellent value!","We were keen to find somewhere close to the buzz of town, with good amenities, a nice room and good value for money. We weren't disappointed!

The hotel staff were lovely, the room was a really nice size and very clean. the location was brilliant, so close to everything! We had a great time.",5,2021,11,16
227,Great location. Poor Breakfast,"The small hotel is surrounded by pubs and coffee shops, and a 5-10 mins walk to pretty much everywhere. The rooms was large and quiet. Breakfast was served at the pub next door with very little choice. No OJ, no yogurt, no vegetables one or two different fruits and very slow and poor service. Lousy Irish breakfast as well.",3,2021,11,07
227,Great Hidden Gem - Apartments are Perfect for Traveling Family!,"We booked one of the apartments while staying in Dublin (18).  It was great.  It had three good bedrooms with double/queen beds, a living area, a small kitchenette and a single bathroom.  The staff was great and got us right in and explained everything to us.  The location is excellent - an easy walk to a lot of the hot spots in Dublin - we walked to the Temple Bar on the first night and then over to St. Stephens Green, The Little Museum of Dublin, Trinity College, Grafton Street and many of the National Galleries.  Also, there are tons of places to eat and shop nearby.  If you want to cook for yourself, the kitchen is equipped and you there are a few grocery stores nearby.  All in All - a great location and a nice/quaint hotel.",5,2021,11,06
227,Best choice in Dublin,"I’ve stayed at the Drury Court a handful of times over the years. The hotel is conveniently located in Dublin near Grafton St, all of the shopping, restaurants, theater etc. The rooms are very clean, comfortable and inexpensive. What keeps me coming back is how friendly, accommodating and downright nice the staff are. I really appreciate it and write this review to really say thank you and job well done.",5,2021,10,09
227,Fabulous,"Stayed here for several nights and absolutely loved it. Staff was beyond nice, kind and helpful and room was wonderful.
Adjacent bar was great and breakfast was very good.
Price was very competitive and we would love to stay here again.
This is a great location and great value; stay here and enjoy Dublin!",5,2021,10,06
227,Excellent hotel in the heart of Dublin,"My wife and I enjoyed a lovely 4 night stay at The Drury Court Hotel at the beginning of September. The hotel is in a lively location in the heart of Dublin with loads of pubs and restaurants and the shopping areas within easy walking distance. They upgraded us to a room overlooking the street and the triple glazing cut out all the noise from the revellers below. Unlike a number of other hotels, breakfast was included and we enjoyed a full cooked breakfast and pancakes on another day. The staff were really friendly and helpful (eg ordering us taxis). Highly recommended and we would definitely stay there again.",5,2021,09,13
227,First Class Experience in a Great Location at a Great Rate,"A couple of us spent a night in one of the apartments here which are, like the rooms, great value for money. The location is within a stone's throw or, more importantly, a brief and pleasant walk to some of the city's best pubs. Even on a ridiculously busy night, the concierge (Aine) went way out of her way to be very helpful and patient and pleasant as I dealt with my phone falling into two pieces right before all the shops closed and with an early flight the next day -- with her help I was up and running and no longer stressed about my boarding passes and Covid passes and all that other vital stuff we all carry about with us.

The rooms are clean and spacious, those that have kitchens etc. are clean and well stocked with coffee and teas and utensils etc.  The bathrooms are well stocked and clean. Our room also had a balcony which is a nice way to let in fresh air or a place to grab the first quiet coffee in the morning or the last drink of the night.

I've stayed in a lot of rooms over the years and these are second to none and great value for money, even leaving aside the excellent location.  But what really stood out to me was the service. 

Will be returning for sure.",5,2021,09,13
227,Fantastic stay,"Very friendly hotel staff - told us where to go sightseeing and were very helpful throughout our short stay. The hotel is of a good standard with our room being full of amenities and was comfortable to stay in. The hotel is also not far from the city centre, Temple Bar district and everything you’d want but the triple glazing on the windows made the room peaceful. Would return and highly recommend.",5,2021,09,08
227,Fantastic Stay,"Just back from a weekend break in Dublin staying at Drury Court Hotel with my mum, we were so impressed with the hotel and staff,  couldn't fault it. 
Staff are lovely and so helpful and the hotel / rooms are clean and well looked after. It's in a great location as well, central and close to everything you need 
A great stay, will be back again - Can't recommend the Hotel enough!",5,2021,09,07
227,Home away from home. Excellent location with the friendliest staff.,"This was my third time staying at the Drury court hotel, and, once again, it was a first class experience. Due to my line of work I was required to stay here during the height of the pandemic, and for the entirety of my stay I felt extremely safe and welcome. The staff are always so friendly and more than happy to help me with anything I might need (Fiona, Emma and Sophie on reception are the BEST). During my stay I accidentally left behind a very sentimental piece of jewelry, and before I had noticed Emma had contacted me and it was posted to me hastily. I cannot recommend this hotel enough. The location is amazing, the food is always great, and the staff are the loveliest in Dublin! This is my home away from home and go-to stay whenever I am in Dublin. My family will never stay anywhere else!",5,2021,09,07
227,Outstanding Hotel with Friendliest Staff,"My husband and I spent 2 nights at the Drury Court Hotel a couple weeks ago and were so pleased with the accommodations, including the quality, comfort and cleanliness of the room and location of the hotel, as well as how incredibly kind, helpful and friendly the staff were. We were in Ireland celebrating my husband's 50th birthday, and we returned the first evening from dinner to find a box of chocolates and hand-made happy birthday note in our room. We couldn't believe that special touch! We'd stay there again in a heartbeat and would highly recommend it to others.",5,2021,09,01
227,Superb service,"Although we werent any length of time in the hotel,this was again a brilliant stay.we had booked the 2 bed apt. As we arrived early to attend graduation Fiona made sure we could avail of another room in order to change.many thanks Fiona. Staff really couldn't be any nicer and not only had they  left chocolates bubbly and a card for our daughter. How nice is that , after  long day they moved all our belongings to our immaculately clean and welcoming apt.To be honest I no longer look at any other hotels or apt as drury court delivers all at reasonable prices especially when we only stay in rooms for short periods of time when we're in the city. To top it all I really think the attention given to guests by  staff at front of house is is nothing short of EXCELLENCE .Thank you and looking forward to staying with you soon. Kind regards.AONeill",5,2021,08,26
227,Fourth stay,"Stayed here for a night with my seven year old daughter in a twin room. The location is perfect. We arrived two hours before check in time hoping that the room might be ready. It wasn’t but the receptionist gave my daughter a bag of bird feed and we dropped our bags and were happy to stroll around saint stephen’s green and visit the playground for 40 minutes while we waited. The room (501) was clean and spacious with a nice seating area. There was plenty of tea coffee and biscuits in the room and the ‘welcome back’ note and box of chocolates was a nice touch. We visited the national gallery, the book of kells exhibition, Merrion square playground and bewleys. The drury court is a perfect base for visiting Dublin. We had great pizza from the Dublin pizza company as recommended by the receptionist. The staff were all helpful and friendly as always. We are looking forward to our next stay in December.",5,2021,08,21
227,Weekend away,"I had the pleasure of staying here for two nights last weekend and in one word to describe my stay was “outstanding”. The staff were so helpful and friendly. Breakfast was delicious, and we also had dinner there on one evening and it was top class. Location is second to know and I recommend this hotel to anyone. Thank you Hyatt Centric for an outstanding stay and I will certainly be back.",5,2021,08,18
227,"Clean, comfortable, great location.","Stayed here last week with group of friends and it’s in a great location in the Stephen’s Green area. The apartment was three-bedroom and very clean and comfortable with small kitchen area so very suitable for those who want to have a light snack. Lots of towels, plus bathroom toiletries provided. Front desk staff very friendly and accommodating. Not my first visit here and certainly won’t be my last.",5,2021,08,11
227,Gorgeous Room,Booked a 4 person hotel room for my 21st birthday and the hotel was nothing but accommodating. They not only upgraded us to an apartment but also left chocolates with a little happy birthday note. The apartment was very spacious and clean and the staff were lovely so I would highly recommend it.,5,2021,08,09

The location is brilliant - close to so many things.

3 good size double rooms, all very clean.
Kitchen is quite small but OK for basics.
Nice big sitting room with balcony.
3 good sized double bedrooms.
This place is in a fantastic location - few mins walk to all the main tourist spots and great food and drink on the doorstep.
The staff are extremely helpful, friendly and effective.
I would definitely stay here again.",4,2021,07,22
227,Priceless service,"I stayed here alone the night before a very important exam. I thought it would be a stressful evening and night of study, but the reception staff dissolved all of those fears. Chatty and friendly from the first minute, they were  more than accommodating of everything I needed, and made sure I had as relaxing and restful an evening as possible. I can’t put a price on the importance of a friendly face at a time like that, but I can definitely rate it five stars. Isabel is a legend, and has impeccable music taste. I will absolutely be back, and I can’t recommend it enough. Thank you for being a friendly face and creating such a welcoming atmosphere.

227,Excellent service,Once again drury court turned up trumps. Staff as usual were fantastic excellent service . Very friendly welcome didn’t even have to give our names on check in😀 welcome back note with box of chocolates left in room for us. Room  large and spotless.  We were last down for breakfast but were made feel very welcomed excellent service . Very central spotlessly clean hotel with fantastic staff who give excellent service. It’s our go to hotel when we are in Dublin,5,2021,07,12
227,Gem of a hotel!,I stayed in one of the Drury Court’s lovely apartments and can’t recommend it enough! The apartment was beautiful and located right in the middle of Dublin. The staff could not have been more friendly or helpful. No request was too big and they had excellent advice on how best to enjoy the city. When I had to extend my stay at the last minute they went out of their way to accommodate me. I can’t wait to visit again!,5,2020,12,05
227,Perfect place to quarantine,"I am almost done with my 14 day quarantine, which I have spent in one of the Drury Court Hotel's self catering apartments. 

From the booking process through to my stay at the hotel, things couldn't have been smoother. 

I started my reservation the night before I arrived so that when I arrived from an early transatlantic flight I could access the apartment immediately. The reception area is very clean - they provide hand sanitizer, face masks and gloves for guests which is a great bonus. I am staying in apt 38 which is comfortable, modern and has everything you could need for a stay in Dublin. 

As the hotel staff knew that I was going to be quarantining in the apartment and needed to limit my contact with others, they made sure to stock up the apartment with everything I could need for a 2 week stay, so if this is the case for you I would advise you let them know in advance too. I had more than enough towels, linens, toilet paper, tea, coffee etc to last me my whole stay. In addition, if I did order food to be delivered to the hotel the staff were very accommodating and dropped it to the front door of the apartment so that I did not have to go out. As well as other things I needed like an extension cable for working. All the staff I saw were wearing face masks when bringing any of these things to me, they are clearly taking Covid safety recommendations very seriously which is a big comfort. Another big bonus is the balcony, it is great to have an outdoor space for some fresh air while in lockdown!

The apartment is freshly decorated, the bed is very comfortable and the hot water pressure is great! I have been working from the apartment for my two weeks of quarantine and the internet has been perfect, I have not experienced any interruptions or lags and have been easily able to continue working. 

I can't thank Emma, Sofia, Dylan and the rest of the staff at the Drury Court Hotel enough for making my stay comfortable and safe!

I highly recommend the hotel and will be definitely staying here on future trips to Dublin!",5,2020,09,30
227,Highly Recommended!,"This is a lovely,  comfortable hotel in a great location.  You could not meet more helpful,  friendly staff who responded quickly to emails and went the extra mile to make our visit to Dublin for a wedding a memorable one.",5,2020,09,14
227,"Great stay, would book again in a heartbeat. Friendly and helpful staff.","Very clean and cosy hotel in a fantastic central location. Surrounded by great bars and restaurants. 
Staff were very friendly and helpful, our receptionist Emma was exceptional. Would highly recommend. ",5,2020,08,21
227,Fantastic find!,"Stayed here for 1 night after switching another hotel in Dublin, wish i had have found this one first though! Room was huge and spotless, and no noise from outside street whatsoever. Veronica at reception was so very welcoming and they are lucky to have her!! Cannot wait to stay again!",5,2020,08,11
227,"Five-star stay, wonderful hotel!","My stay here was perfect. I had to travel urgently from NYC to Dublin during the first week of April, which was right in the middle of the Covid-19 lockdowns. Going online to find a hotel in Dublin that was still open was a stressful experience, but luckily the Drury Court was indeed open and willing to take my booking. 

I arrived at around 6am, and the Night Porter, Nabil,  was extremely welcoming, and willing to let me check-in despite the early hour. My room was cosy and super clean, and it had one of the comfiest beds I've ever slept in!

I was one of just a handful of guests staying there, which felt surreal! But all the hotel staff I met during my two days at the hotel were extremely warm, friendly and reassuring. I had a lovely long chat one morning with a Receptionist named Maura, and my heart went out to her as she'd arrived in Dublin from the US to start working just before everything shut down!

The hotel is in a great location, as it's right in the heart of the city, and just a two-minute walk from Dunnes Stores, which, thankfully, was one of the few supermarkets still open. Walking around an empty Dublin was an eerie experience, but returning to Drury Court was like coming home!

The hotel has a real 'family' feel - very cosy and comfortable. When i'm next back in Dublin (hopefully in Normal Times!), i'll definitely return to the Drury Court. It was literally a 'port in a pandemic storm' for me, and i was so grateful to have somewhere comfortable to stay while the world outside was upside-down.",5,2020,04,22
227,Amazing Location and Wonderful Staff,"My family and I booked a stay over the 2020 St. Patrick's Day celebration - too bad it happened to fall just as COVID-19 started to take hold of the world.  Everyone from Front Desk to Housekeeping made our stay wonderful.  Great location, we could walk almost everywhere.  The three bedroom apartment was extremely helpful in allowing us to cook full meals, when all the restaurants were shut down.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat when back in Dublin.",5,2020,04,21
227,Great apartment,"Two nights stay in an apartment. From arriving to leaving, all receptionists were very friendly. 
Well equipped kitchen and spacious lounge. 
Extra large bed in bedroom. Sofa bed not  comfortable so just used the sofa. 
Wish we had more time to try out the bar next door.
Shall definitely stay again. Great location.",5,2020,03,11
227,"Lovely hotel, great location, fantastic staff","Perfect stay here. The lovely women at reception were so kind and helpful. Room was clean and comfortable. The location is fantastic, right in the buzz of city centre without being on top of any particularly noisy bars or clubs. Beds are very comfortable! ",5,2020,03,11
227,brilliant,"I can't believe we haven't found this hotel in the centre of Dublin before - it's terrific in every way; location, value, cleanliness, comfort, convenient and cheap parking, amazingly quiet, friendly staff, tasty breakfast.  Bathroom needs a little updating but not a big deal.

We will absolutely use this hotel again.",5,2020,03,10
227,Fabulous Hotel ,"Stayed for just one night in the Drury Court Hotel, but had wished it was longer. The room was spotless and comfortable, very little light and noise pollution considering its location in the city. 
Very close to a huge number of restaurants, pubs and shops, Grafton street, stephens green, etc. 
The staff were exceptional, especially Veronica and Maura at the front desk, who were so helpful and friendly. 
Would definitely recommend, and will be staying here again next time I'm in Dublin. ",5,2020,03,04
227,Hidden Treasure,"This was a fantastic find; such a fabulous location with extra friendly and helpful staff.We didn’t do the breakfast but it looked excellent. Very quiet even though it’s very lively area.I left an item behind and was immediately contacted by phone and email, and the item posted up to me. ",5,2020,03,01

227,In the Heart of Dublin ,"For our first time in Dublin, we wanted a central spot where we could walk to restaurants, shops, and historic sites. The hotel offered the central location we were looking for! The room had plenty of space for our family. What stood out most was the excellent front desk staff. We felt warmly welcomed and were grateful for their recommendations on the rest of our travels and driving tips. 😀",5,2020,02,26
227,"Great location, great staff, great price","We got a family room for 4 ladies and it was huge, a double bed, 1 single, 1 couch bed that could have fit 2.Big, clean, comfortable rooms. Couldn't hear the street outside. Staff were amazing, so so nice and helpful",5,2020,02,24

Good mattresses and bedding.  Beds are very comfortable.

227,Nice. But nothing more,"The big plus for this hotel is the location. Centeral. Loads of pubs and hang out places around. 
The big minus was their house keeping. On my second day they simply did not clean the room. I returned at 830p and room was a mess. 
Guy down stairs could not offer an explanation as for why it has not been cleaned. 
When paying 150 euro per night you dont want to go back to the room and find it messed up. Hostels that charge 50 euro will give you better service",2,2020,02,19
227,Top Service ,"I have nothing but  praise for the staff of the Drury Court Hotel Dublin.  During our week stay there wasn't anything that was too much trouble for them.

The room was of a high quality.  Though there is not a refrigerator in the room, they provided a small portable unit. 

Location is superb, only a short walk to St. Stephen Shopping Centre, the major shopping street ""Grafton Street"", Trams & tour buses.   

The Drury Court Hotel Dublin is really located in the centre of Dublin’s cultural quarter & according to the Taxi drivers the better part of the city. 

Taxi fares to or from the City center were approximately €10 - €12.

The Hairy Lemon pub is over the road with good meals,offence packed out on weekends. Say hello to Annette she is a real nice person.

We highly recommend this hotel & would stay there again.

227,Excellent location in Dublin City Centre!,"The location is excellent, and is in quite a safe quarter of Dublin City Centre.  

The staff on reception were so welcoming throughout our stay.  We have stayed in many Dublin City hotels where the check-in experience is less than welcoming, but the Drury Court Hotel staff were so lovely!

Our room was clean and comfortable, and there was very little noise during our stay.  We didn't opt for breakfast during our stay so can't comment on it, but there are plenty of lovely restaurants and cafes in walking distance of the hotel! 

We stayed here many years ago but always chose different hotels during our last few stays in Dublin. Next time we come here, we will make sure to book into Drury Court Hotel!",4,2020,02,15

227,Lovely hotel in a great location,"We stayed in this hotel for for two nights in February and it was great. It is in a prime location being in walking distance from Temple Bar area, Grafton Street, St Stephens Green park & Dublin Castle. The Guinness Factory is only a 25 min walk as well so everything is near. The hotel itself is really nice, the reception staff were very friendly and welcoming and were able to provide recommendations for local attractions, bars & restaurants. We were in a triple room as there was three of us which had lots of space for three girls getting ready (needed) and were clean and tidy. I think the rooms may have recently been done up as the carpets felt knew and it looked lovely. Would recommend for anyone who is looking for a good hotel in the city centre!",5,2020,02,11

227,"Lovely staff, delay in returning lost property, average room but bad view.","The staff at Drury Court are some of the nicest i've came across. Really feel like they went above and beyond, special thanks to Dylan and Emma for their help and constant contact when I left my bracelet and ring in the room. After my stay I got in contact with Drury Court to say I left my ring and bracelet in my room. The house keeping staff checked for it as did other members of staff and no one found the bracelet until nearly a week later when it was down the side of the bed. For me this is a bit long not to find a bracelet after the room had been 'cleaned and checked' numerous times. However, very grateful to get my items back and Drury Court sent them back to me with no charge. Very good customer service.
As for my actual stay, checkin and check out was very quick and easy. The room was nice/basic (room 503) Downfall would be the view. It was out onto a multistory car park. Good location and a couple minute walk from stephens green.",3,2020,01,06
227,Loved it!,"Drury Court is a very central hotel with a very friendly and helpful staff. The room was quite small but that was ok since this is Dublin center!

The bedroom was clean and comfortable, had a king size bed in the room, nice bathroom. Excellent location, close walk to town centre and all the tourist attractions. Plenty of places to eat and drink at within a 10 minute walking distance. Breakfast was excellent, continental breakfast had a spread and cooked breakfast was available to order. This time I drove in Dublin and there was a car park across the road, which is discounted by the hotel. I would stay here again as overall it is a lovely hotel in a great location.",4,2019,12,31
227,Great location for reasonable price,"My stay was in September 2018.  There was construction next door but that's probably gone now.  Even with that, the room was quiet enough at night.

227,Absolutely Marvellous ,"We stayed here at the beginning of our driving holiday around Ireland and were so impressed we unexpectedly returned at the end for 5 days.  The staff are the best I’ve had, so friendly and super helpful, nothing was a bother.  It’s so close to Grafton St shops, is a quick walk to Temple Bar, the best area to stay really as it’s safe but has a thriving nightlife and restaurant culture close by.  We had breakfast down in the adjoining Pmacs bar and it was yum! Very reasonable prices too.  Thanks for the comfy rooms and quality customer service, we definitely will be back",5,2019,12,11
227,"Great location, decent prices, and comfortable accommodations.","Had a great stay at the Drury for our 2 nights in Dublin.  The staff was friendly and helpful, the room was comfortable, and the location was perfect.  

The Drury is just far enough from Temple Bar to stay away from the bustling, noisy crowds but still close enough to walk to almost all of the main sites in the city.  

There is pub on the street level and adjacent to the hotel, but despite it being popular and loud we slept fine.  Sensitive sleepers may want to request a room on the 2nd or 3rd floors but earplugs were sufficient for us.

Definitely recommend a stay if you need a comfortable place with reasonable rates in Dublin.",5,2019,12,10
227,Central location,3 bed apartment perfect for family of 5 great central location in Dublin great access to all Dublin has to offer . Rooms a bit dated but very clean and excellent staff on check in/ out . Will definitely revisit .,5,2019,12,10
227,"Perfectly situated, great value, no frills, accommodation.",Went to Dublin on a girls' weekend and we stayed in this little hotel. It's really central for getting anywhere you want to see and yet just tucked away enough to be quiet. The rooms are clean and comfortable and the staff were all really friendly and helpful. We stayed on a room only basis so couldn't comment on the food but its so near places to eat it really wasn't a problem.,4,2019,12,10
227,Great place to stay!,Great location for going to restaurants and pubs - we walked everywhere from the hotel. It is also a great value for the price. The staff was very friendly and available 24/7 (which was helpful when we departed for the airport at 5:30 am and needed a taxi called). We would definitely stay here again!,5,2019,12,08
227,Truly a hidden gem!,"Stayed here after a last minute find, changed from Travel lodge and I am THRILLED. Brilliant location, well appointed comfortable rooms, plenty of tea/coffee in rooms. Bed was so comfortable and loved the leave a book shelf and travel pin board by the lift! The price was more than reasonable and they even stored our luggage to free us up to explore the city. However, the true asset of this gem of a hotel is definitely the staff, from check in to check out every staff member we met was happy, friendly and nothing was too much trouble....as I write this I received a call from the front desk trying to track down the owner of a lost scarf (not ours) but wow, that's service! I will DEFINATELY be back and will be telling everyone heading to the capital to stop here.... don't change a thing! Thanks so much.",5,2019,12,07
227,Perfect location,"Fantastic location for walking to the main sites, all the great restaurants, pubs and shopping.

227,Girls on tour,"Stayed in Drury Court on 4th Dec. Could not recommend highly enough. We stayed in 3 bed apartment. Absolutely spotless. Beds were so comfy. Staff were ,5 star. Could not do enough. Location was perfect for Olympia. Loved it. We will b back.",5,2019,12,05
227,Would Stay Here Again,"We spent two nights at the Drury Court Hotel in Dublin mid-November.  The rates were reasonable, the place seemed dated but was clean, and the staff was very helpful and super friendly.  
THINGS I LIKED:
 - Great location!  Within reasonable walking distance to Temple Bar area, National Museum of Archeology and History (a must), and Grafton Street shopping
  - Bank ATM steps away - just turn right and walk less than half a block 
  - Convenience store almost directly across the street (in case you need another beer after Temple Bar!)
THINGS I DID NOT LIKE
  - No real negatives.  It is as it states on the website.
  - Pricey cab ride from airport - but traffic was insane and was still better than driving
BOTTOM LINE
  - If my travels ever take me me back to Dublin, I would stay here again.",4,2019,12,03
227,Fabulous,Beautiful hotel with very friendly and helpful staff. Nothing was too much to ask. Room was spotless and comfortable. Very cosy bed. Very relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. Will recommend and definitely stay again.,5,2019,12,02

",4,2019,12,02
227,"Super location, excellent staff, very comfy","I spent months researching hotels in Dublin before my trip recently and I am so glad that I ended up at the Drury Court Hotel.  I arrived very early, maybe around 11 AM or so after an overnight, connecting flight from the USA and I was thrilled that my room was ready so that I could take a few minutes to relax and freshen up.  I prepaid my stay (though my rate was fully refundable) and the hotel was nice enough to call me to get my payment info!

The room was very clean and comfortable with ample storage.  While the room wasn't huge by American standards, it was-or at least seemed-bigger than I had anticipated (and incidentally was bigger, with more storage than my hotel in London).  The bed was quite comfortable and even though the hotel has radiators and no a/c, I was able to regulate the temperature well and the room wasn't too hot nor too cold. 

The welcome bottle of wine was much appreciated as was the prompt housekeeping service.  While I didn't prepay for breakfast, I wound up dining in P.Macs for breakfast on 2 of the 3 days I was there.  The 10.50 euro breakfast had a couple options, either a full Irish breakfast or a continental that also had porridge as an option.  The Irish breakfast was delicious, especially the eggs cooked in actual butter (or so it tasted) and I really liked the Irish bacon.  The following day, I went light with porridge and pastries which were also yummy.  I wanted to have a pint in the evening but PMacs was always really busy so I didn't get to see how charming the place looked in person in the evenings. (LOVED the red, dripping candles that I saw).

I walked around the city easily and liked that there were numerous places to eat and shop close to the hotel.  The Hairy Lemon across the street was fabulous and there's a noodle shop, also across the street, that provided a nice light dinner on the day I arrived.

Any time I asked a question, the friendly receptionists were so helpful, and it was really cool to meet one from my home state of New Jersey!  Small world!  I really felt welcomed and that the Drury Court was really a home away from home for a few nights.  They also happily got me buckets of ice each day as well.  My room, 401 was reasonably quiet as well.  I only heard a little bit of noise on my final night there but it wasn't too loud nor did it last too long.

I would happily return to this quaint hotel and I am so glad that I chose Drury Court over some other hotels.",4,2019,11,29
227,Good  for a sleep,"Location is very good; in city centre, many bars and restaurants around.

227,Perfect Location,"We stayed in the 3 bedroom apartment (4 adults & 2 kids). It was a perfect size for us. After our overnight transatlantic flights, they were able to get us an early check in (luckily the previous guests had left early) which was greatly appreciated. The beds and pillows were some of the most comfortable I have ever had staying in a hotel or house. They have pillows of various firmness/fluffiness so they had something for everyone. The discounted parking they have with a local lot was very close to the hotel. And the location was perfect for us. Everything was an easy walk to get to.  I wish we had more time to stay there. We were only there 1 night before leaving Dublin to travel the rest of Ireland. We would definitely stay there again. ",5,2019,11,25

The ladies at the front desk were so    helpful planning some food places to eat etc.   They also helped plan some of the tour guides we took.

Service: 5/5
Cleanliness: 5/5
Decor & Style: 4/5

5 stars overall for the amazing service the front desk provided and the spacious room. I was shocked to see how big and clean our room was for the price we paid. Excellent location as well because it wasn't noisy like the Temple Bar area was, however still right in the middle of the city which was minute walks away from it all. 
In fact, downstairs is a restaurant/bar that I rate as my fav pub in all of Dublin called P.Macs!

Most places in Dublin (like most of Europe) won't have Air Conditioning so if it happens to be on a warmer day leaving your window open at night is a must. And in a crowded area that makes it hard to sleep. Here everything was quiet enough. 

I would happily stay at this location again when I visit Dublin!",5,2019,11,17
227,Our New Home Away from Home in Dublin,"We recently stayed at the Drury Court Hotel for a week while visiting Dublin.  Previously my husband and I stayed at another hotel in the same vicinity which had closed for renovations.  The Drury Court will now become our go to hotel in Dublin.  The location is very convenient to Grafton Street, Temple Bar, St. Stephen's Green, Peter's Pub, The Hairy Lemon and many other popular spots.  The reception staff offered great advice on transportation, dining and obtaining tickets to sites such as the Guinness Experience.  Our room was a good size, comfortable and the double glazed windows kept out the sounds of traffic and nearby pubs. The room was maintained well by the housekeeping staff.
We have found out new home away from home in Dublin and will certainly return!",5,2019,11,13

227,Great little boutique hotel,Great hotel right in the centre of Dublin you can walk everywhere. Lovely staff and extremely helpful. We stay anytime we are in Dublin it's great that we don't need a car. Good optional breakfast. Would highly recommend this hotel. ,5,2019,10,26
227,Old Dublin,"Great room, very clean and comfortable. Fabulous staff. Front desk personnel were helpful with recommendations on places to see as well as restaurants. In the heart of the city and sights. Everything is a short walk.",5,2019,10,25
227,Convenient Location,"The average rating is mostly due to the condition of the room.  The staff were very friendly, the breakfast was great, and the location was convenient.  
Our room’s carpet had a lot of stains!  It wouldn’t hurt for the hotel to invest in some carpet steam cleaning!!  The first night we found a stain on our duvet. The staff were apologetic and brought us a new one, but we had to strip the comforter ourselves and put the new one on...which we thought was odd but this was the first time we experienced a stained sheet at a hotel.  I would have thought the staff would have helped.
After the first night discoveries, the room (except the carpet) felt clean and we didn’t run into other problems.  
The mattress was extremely uncomfortable for both of us.  Every morning (and middle of the night) we woke up with bad back pain.  I see that other guests haven’t really commented on this issue so it may be that our room had a super old mattress.
Location is walkable to every attraction!  Front desk staff always had a smile and greeted us, which was pleasant.

227,Going home,"Stressful reason for going home... staying there took the stress away... perfect location and great staff! Room was just right and breakfast was perfect!

Lovely traditional Irish breakfasts in pub attatched to hotel below it.  Good double glazing so not noisy.  Would recommend to anyone.",4,2019,10,23
227,Larger rooms,We stayed in Dublin in arriving and another night before departing.  The Drury court room was large compared to the other hotel. Staff was very friendly and helpful.  We would definitely stay there again. ,5,2019,10,20
227,Coming back!,Front desk staff VERY helpful online pre-trip and in person during.  They helped greatly when only email was available. Excellent location. So many services within easy walk of hotel.   Ask for sheets if want to use lighter blanket. ,5,2019,10,20
227,Great location,"We were deciding if we should stay at a 4-star hotel a bit farther from the city or this hotel, and are very glad that we chose this hotel. It is close to the town centre, meeting points for sightseeing tours, and numerous tourist attractions plus the shopping area. There are tons of good eateries around the area, and we felt very safe walking around the neighbourhood at night. The hotel room is well appointed, clean and comfortable, and housekeeping did a fantastic job looking after us. The reception staff is also worth a mention, everyone was super friendly and courteous, and made our stay a most enjoyable one. Thank you!",5,2019,10,19
227,Irish honeymoon,One of the best hotels we stayed at on our honeymoon we will return and recommend this place for any of our friends or family traveling to Dublin we couldn’t be happier the front desk was amazing especially Dylan ,5,2019,10,15

227,Hidden Gem,"I read a previous review calling Drury Court a hidden gem, and they were right! Convenient, inexpensive, clean, comfortable bed, beautiful room, great front desk and housekeeping staff. The area felt safe, and there were countless restaurants nearby. We could walk to everything we wanted to do in Dublin from Drury Court!",5,2019,10,14
227,Solid Hotel; Nice Apartment,"We stayed several days at the Drury Court Hotel, renting a three bedroom apartment. The pricing was reasonable, and the unit we rented was nicely appointed and clean. It was spacious by European standards. 
The desk staff was very helpful in dealing with the few issues we faced. The hotel is right in the heart of Dublin, convenient to everything. I would gladly stay there in the future.",5,2019,10,13
227,Incredible service and genuine employees ,"Veronica was the best! I got lost on my way to the hotel and was extremely frazzled to the point of crying. When I walked in, she noticed immediately the distress I was in and took such good care of me. I was checked into my room early, she got me a glass of much needed water, and escorted me to my room! The room was adorable and perfect for me. It was very quiet at night despite being above a pub. The front desk really knew the area as well and had tons of great recommendations for food and coffee. I would 100% stay here again. ",5,2019,10,10
227,Great value in a great location ,"Dublin has a range of hotels, both on quality and price. The Drury Court is great value, while providing spacious, clean and well-appointed rooms. The location is great, and it is close to everything the city has to offer. 

I've stayed a few times, and the hotel is now my 'go to' choice when I need a short stay in the city.",5,2019,10,08
227,Great place | may be bit noisier on Fri night,"Stayed back in July for 4 nights. In regards to the hotel, cannot say anything against - friendly & helpful staff, clean and spacious room (was a corner one with plenty of windows). Didnt attend the breakfast (as there are plenty of places to get a bite around), thus cannot comment. The locations is very convenient - whole town pretty much a walking distance, numerous bars and restaurants in the hotel's surroundings. This however has a downside, especially on Fridays nights, can be really noisy, meaning impossible to sleep with windows open (btw, no AC in the room) during sweaty days. So unless you plan on partying on Fri, this may be something you may not be necessary happy about..  Other days were not so bad in terms of noise and with windows closed you can have undisturbed sleep. Despite that I will consider staying again and will also recommend to my friends heading out to Dublin.",5,2019,10,08
227,Excellent experience at the Drury Court,"The staff at this hotel was absolutely the best I have experienced in a long time.  They stored luggage for us for several days while we toured Ireland; they called taxis for us when needed; they gave us helpful information about places to see in Dublin and restaurants in the neighborhood.  They even helped us try to find my wife's iPhone, which she lost in Dublin.   I would certainly recommend this hotel to couples staying in Dublin.",5,2019,10,08
227,Great place in a great location,This hotel is centrally located to all of the best pubs and restaurants. My room was very clean and the bed was comfortable. You need a key card to get to the elevator so it has some added security. I would stay here again.,4,2019,10,04
227,Drury court hotel is Highly recommended,"We stayed in a 3 bedroom apartment, it was very spacious and location was wonderful . the stuff was very nice and very helpful. The hotel is located in the middle of the city and close to everything. For us it was perfect!",5,2019,10,04
227,Spacious Apartment,"Our family of four stayed in a one bedroom apartment, with the kids on the sofa bed. It was clean and comfortable. The location was perfect for visiting the center of Dublin. Far enough from Temple Bar to be a little quieter, but easily in walking distance to that, Stephens Green, Trinity College, Dublin Castle, good restaurants, and shopping. Helpful front desk. We would definitely stay again.",5,2019,09,27
227,Excellent hotel,"Stayed here for 2 nights, very comfortable, hotel is central for Temple Bar, reception staff very knowledgeable and happy to help.
Did think we had booked bed and breakfast, but that was with Booking.com. look forward  to going again, Dublin is amazing ",5,2019,09,25
227,Great location!!,"The Drury Court Hotel is a great hotel and is in a great location! This hotel is located within walking distance to so many different sites and also is very close to one of the Do Dublin bus pick up/ drop off area. The rooms are clean, the showers had good pressure and were hot, beds were comfy and breakfast was very good. The staff are so helpful and friendly! The 1st night I realized I needed a desk fan because I am used to sleeping with fan noise year round. I went to Grafton street and could not find anything! The young lady at the desk went on a stores website with me, I picked a fan(less than $20), she reserved it for me & I walked less than 5 minutes away back to Grafton St to pick it up at the store and had a wonderful nights sleep. (I did not know about this store - you shop online 1st and then pick the item up the same day) Without that fan, I would have been screwed!! (Also no air conditioning) I was so appreciative to her for helping me! This hotel was 3 star nice but the location and the service the front desk people give is what takes it to a 5 star hotel!",5,2019,09,22
227,Great location and helpful friendly staff.,"Great hotel located beside shops, theatres and all attractions for a great city visit. Discounted parking nearby. Staff very friendly and helpful. Rooms clean and spacious and quiet even though the street outside was buzzing. We were upgraded to a suite. Breakfast served in the adjoining PMacs was very tasty with lots of choice and very attentive waiting staff. Will definitely return. ",5,2019,09,22
227,Fabulous!,"We had booked in to this hotel for two nights, we were on a slight budget and this hotel was within our means. It was rated as 3* but it was far more than that. It was very close to amenities and the lovely Temple bar area. We were on the top floor of 5, brilliant fast lift, and when we walked into our room it was big bright clean and beautifully presented. The beds were comfortable and our room was ready early for us, we couldn’t have been more pleased. The staff on reception were friendly, helpful and so knowledgeable. We had breakfast there both days, and while it wasn’t included in our price it was well worth the extra money. The spread laid out was full of fresh fruit, toast cereals pastries, we had poached eggs that were included and they were perfectly cooked and tasty. We thoroughly enjoyed our two nights here, so quiet and comfortable, thank you Drury Court.",5,2019,09,22
227,Excellent location! Outstanding service!,Can't say enough about our stay at this hotel. When we arrived from London we were  warmly greeted by Veronica.She was so refreshing! She helped us with everything from showing us on a map where we would need to meet both of our tours for the week and gave us excellent recommendations for places to eat and things to do; again helping us with the map. Our room was clean and comfortable. The location is very busy but we heard very little noise from the street or popular pub attached to the hotel. We walked to almost everything we wanted to do; Jamesons and Guinness being the exception. We will be back!,5,2019,09,20
227,Highly recommended,"The location was excellent, the rooms very comfortable and the staff excellent. The triple-glazed windows ensured that we heard none of the noise from the street. Even though we arrived three hours before check-in time we were given a room and the breakfast was very good.",5,2019,09,18
227,"Perfect location, excellent, professional, & knowledgable staff!","This hotel was perfect for our first trip to Ireland. We enjoyed it so much that we booked our last night in Ireland next week here instead of a hotel near the Dublin airport. We’ll be in Galway this week, but we are looking forward to one more night at the Drury Court.

The location couldn’t be more perfect - very walkable to all central locations: Temple Bar, Shopping, Pubs, Grafton St., etc. We even walked to the Jameson Distillery on the north side of the river. It’s not quiet at night, especially weekends, because of the pub downstairs, however if the room window is closed it isn’t unbearable. 

The breakfast in the converted pub to breakfast room next door is reasonably priced, convenient, and tasty.

The staff at the Drury was exceptional - especially Veronica. She went out of her way to make sure all of our questions were answered and our needs addressed. I cannot say enough about how comfortable it was to stay in this hotel. 

With understated elegance & top notch service, our travel dollars were well spent in this centrally located hotel.",5,2019,09,14
227,Exactly what I needed,"This hotel is located perfectly. Easy walking to most of Dublin's must see venues. The staff was really nice and check in/out was super easy. My room was quiet, clean and could be made super dark for a great night's sleep.",5,2019,09,09
227,Wonderful experience,All of the Drury Court front desk workers were super friendly and accommodating. The hotel is in an incredible location in Dublin--perfect for sightseeing. The rooms were clean and quiet. Would certainly stay there again!,5,2019,09,08
227,Fantastic Hidden Gem of a hotel in the heart of Dublin,"I have to say on of the best hidden Gems in Dublin City centre. The staff are so friendly and helpful. The rooms are spacious and so so clean. The beds are really comfortable. 

The breakfast was so fresh and tasty. Service lovely was brilliant. Will defo book again when in town. ",5,2019,09,08
227,Fabulous Hotel in the Centre of Dublin,"Great location, clean rooms & wonderful staff! We had a brilliant time in Dublin and I will definitely stay here again when I return. In particular, the receptionist was so friendly and helpful in giving us recommendations of things to do and places to eat.",5,2019,09,07
227,Excellent hotel,Stayed here for 2 nights recently and couldn’t fault it. All staff were very friendly from reception to bar staff and couldn’t have been more helpful. Food was excellent aswell. Had a beautiful lunch when we arrived and there was a great selection for breakfast. Will definitely be staying again when next in Dublin as it’s also so well situated!,5,2019,09,01
227,Nice hotel. Excellent location.,"Hotel was very nice, very clean and is in the perfect location to walk around Dublin. The only issue we had was noise from the bar below. The weather was unusually warm when we were there in late August so pub goers were on the street into the wee hours of the morning and we had our windows open because it was so warm. So ask for a room in the back in the summertime if the weather forecast is good. We were there is March previously and had no issue with noise from the pub then. ",4,2019,09,01
227,"location good, service/welcome good, bed: not good, no a/c: not good","The location is great, and the welcome we received on arrival was excellent. The front desk are very helpful, the room was clean and the facilities also. Problem was: bed was really pretty uncomfortable. There was also no a/c in the room, and sadly in August that proved to be an issue. Very little sleep was had...",3,2019,08,26
227,Enjoyed my stay,"Excellent location to explore Dublin by foot. Clean room, courteous and helpful staff. My room was over the pub and on the street so it could get loud at night but that is to be expected with a room in the city. I travel with foam earplugs anyway.",4,2019,08,23
227,Perfect,"The hotel is very central and quiet. There are many restaurants and tourist places nearby to visit.The workers at the reception are very friendly, the breakfast is very good.The beds are very comfortable. Only cleaning of the sink should be improved.",5,2019,08,23
227,Great stay in Dublin,"This little hotel was a great find.  Spent a week with family (my wife, our 20 year-old son and myself).  Comfortable room, great shower, extraordinary desk staff, and a fabulous location made our one week trip a great success.  ",5,2019,08,23
227,Very nice place to stay,"The location was good. Walking distance to everything. The front desk staff was so nice and so very helpful. Whether you need directions, suggestions for things to do or setting up taxis. I would definitely recommend this hotel.",4,2019,08,15
227,3 swedes in Dublin,"Close to everything we´d been planning to  Super helpful staff
Breakfast at ""Taste"" down the street is reccomended. Afternoon Beer at ""Peters Pub"" just beside ""Taste"".
Rooms very big and also bathroom.  
Dont understand the idéa with a shower that doesn´t have a handleshower to wash ""downstairs"", or maybe i´m just not agile enough...",5,2019,08,14
227,overpriced for the value,"This tiny 5 storey hotel is in a great location (very close to all tourist attractions). We rented a family suite (sleep 4) for C$387 a night (very expensive - and did not include breakfast). By the end of our stay, the location alone didnt make up for the price. The room size was adequate, the standard beds were comfortable (the pull out beds were not), the room was clean, and the washroom was decent.
i would stay it was our best hotel, but it certainly wasnt our worse.
A big shout out to the pub staff and the quality of the breakfast (continental option was light but the irish breakfast was terrific).",3,2019,08,14
227,No better place to stay on my birthday,"We arrived ultra-early in Dublin (5 am flight from US). The desk staff couldn't have been any nicer, they actually called me to share we could check in ahead of time. I was very grateful since lugging luggage around Dublin is no easy task. Once checked in, we left immediately to play tourist and upon arrival back found a complimentary bottle of wine and happy birthday card!  Very nice touch and very sweet.  They called us taxi's when we needed them, gave us advice on walking directions to places we needed to go and were always very pleasant.  We'll stay there again for sure, our next visit over annually.",5,2019,08,11
227,"Fab location, charming hotel ","Traveling with two teens we’ve had lots of hotel experiences and this was all round one of the best. Location first - walked everywhere in downtown Dublin from here, tons of restaurants, cafes, shops and the wonderful Stephen’s Green Park on your doorstep. So much going on that I was a bit concerned about noise- no need at all with the first rate double glazing on the windows, we didn’t hear a thing. Also nice quiet air conditioning for the warm weather we were lucky to have. The room itself was compact but with lots of storage, comfortable beds, generous towels, great pressure in the shower and overall spotless. The staff were very helpful and friendly/ just need to sort out their wake up call system since we received ones we didn’t ask for on two of our mornings - one at 5am!",4,2019,08,09
227,The three C’s,"1. Clean
2. Cheap
3. Central 
 
I would stay here again. It’s in a great location. The rooms are basic but clean.  
The staff are very welcoming and friendly. 
We stayed two nights mid week in August for approximately €300. The car park across the road was €12.50 per 24hrs with hotel validation. 
We had a room overlooking the street, it wasn’t too noisy as there is triple glazing- so keep the windows closed- and if it’s a hot summers night ask for a fan- we had a large noisy fan but we slept fine. 

If your looking for a descent place in the heart of Dublin this is great. 

We didn’t have breakfast so I can’t comment on that. 

There are hundreds of restaurants with in walking distance. 

We will be back again! ",5,2019,08,08
227,Beautiful hotel and centrally located!,My go to hotel in Dublin. Minutes walk away from the Luas and the airport bus. Stephen's green park is 3 mins away. Plenty of restaurants close by and the receptionist Sofia and Emma are consistent with their service. I've stayed in hundreds of places and this place is by far the best when it comes to making a guest comfortable. Definitely will be coming back!,5,2019,08,05
227,Very Helpful Front Desk Attendants,"We landed at Drury Court for 4 nights in Dublin. We were looking for a location walking distance to the National Concert Hall, Temple Bar district, and the community center, and we booked through hotels.com. Location was GREAT! It is an easy walk to and from the Airlink Express bus-stop making getting back and forth from the airport convenient. It's on the edge of the Temple Bar district, so easy to get to fun pubs and other attractions, but a little quieter than being in the middle of it. The National Concert Hall was just a quick walk through Stevens Green. 

Also, the front desk attendants were very friendly and helpful, greeting us each time we came to or left the hotel lobby and quick to offer directions or recommendations. Bus tickets being offered at the front desk was very beneficial for us. 

Worth noting is that the hotel is a bit austere. It has a small lobby that was sometimes crowded, the common hallways and elevator were well-worn, and the rooms were relatively unadorned. Amenities important to me were present like free wireless internet, hot shower with good water pressure, clean room, and an overall sense of security. It served very well as a safe home-base to sleep, shower, and store our things while we spent most of our time exploring the city. ",5,2019,08,04
227,Central room with sound proof windows,"Hotel is very easy to get to places from, not far from anything in Dublin and reception staff offered recommendations. Bed was comfy and surprisingly very quiet room, due to triple glazing, as the street was very busy! Room was fine; nothing special but all we needed for one night. Handy place to stay and free to leave your bags after check out.",4,2019,08,03
227,Central,Really nice hotel central location beside grafton street and St Stephens green with plenty if pubs and restaurants near by.  Staff very helpful and nothing is too much trouble for them.  Room was good size with bath.,4,2019,08,02
227,Great Staff!,"My room was comfortable and clean and the hotel was conveniently located. But what made my stay special was the staff...very pleasant, very helpful! Special shout outs to Emma, Nabil, Sophia, Victoria, and Dylan! Thanks!",5,2019,08,01
227,Awesome hotel! Great Staff! ,"Arrived 2 hours early! Not a problem! 

Was nervous and didnt know anything about the city or what to do or where to go? Not a problem! 

I booked my trip last minute and when i got to the hotel, the staff immediately greeted me with friendly faces and amazing knowledge base for all the tourist attractions AND some awesome local bars, restaurants and pubs to experience. 

They went above and beyond and booked all my tour guide tickets, reservations for dinners and events. I literally felt like i had the best personal assistants to make my trip easy and fun! All i had to do was tell them what i like, and they took care of the rest! - STAFF WAS AMAZING! 

The hotel room was clean, spacious and cool.  If i needed something house-keeping  was at my door with in 5-10mins!  Fast and friendly service!  ",5,2019,07,30
227,Excellent location - very walkable,"The location can’t be beat. It’s close enough to walk to all the shops and restaurants, but is about 2 blocks or so from Temple Bar so it’s not crazy at night.  Service at the hotel was excellent, morning breakfast was also very good. Rooms are a bit tired and they didn’t have air conditioning so sleeping was tough. Our room was adjacent to a construction area which took away any relaxation.",4,2019,07,29
227,Fantastic location,"Superb location, and friendly staff, who happily held our bags while we explored on the first and last days. 
We selected Drury Court on price, reviews, and it's central location and got everything we wanted. We could't fault the hotel one bit.
We didn't have the breakfast, opting instead to get out and explore, we tired a few of the wonderful breakfast places nearby.
Very happy with our stay and would come back.",5,2019,07,28
227,Had a great stay!,"We had a great stay here.  I was trying to find a hotel that was tucked away a bit instead of staying in the heart of the Temple Bar area.  This place is tucked away on a side street but right now (July 2019) there is construction going on next door which was loud one morning.  The other thing I didn't realize was there is a pub with outdoor seating on the corner and that too was loud - but I guess in Dublin, it's hard to find a spot without a pub nearby!!  Overall it didn't bother us too much, we were on an upper floor but the hotel itself was clean, the staff was really wonderful and we did like the location.  Beds were comfy and the room was a nice size for the three of us.  Thank you for making our stay enjoyable!!!",5,2019,07,28
227,Another Great stay at the Drury Court,"Another great stay in the centre of Dublin. 
Around same money as a travelodge but far superior. 
Great staff and fantastic breakfast. 
A must stay for a very reasonable price 
Two minutes walk from Grafton street and 10min from Temple Bar",5,2019,07,27
227,"Awesome location, great service and SO accommodating ","We traveled to Dublin with our 8 month old baby ... I was super nervous! Drury Court made me feel so comfortable. 
They provided a room on a high floor so it was quieter. However, we noticed that the (very cool!) bar downstairs was VERY soundproofed.
They gave me a small fridge for storing the baby’s bottle and food.
They worked with us on getting a much earlier checkin time, which was absolute heaven to two adults and one baby who just got in from an overnight flight.

The hotel itself and was clean and well appointed.
The location was incredible! We were in the heart of it all and the price was SO reasonable. 
Loved being so close to the hairy lemon (it’s a great bar!)

Just wanted to give a big thank you and shoutout overall to this hotel and its staff for a spectacular time! Keep up the great work! ",5,2019,07,26
227,Long weekend Break in Dublin,With one or two exceptions we felt welcomed in Dublin for our break. The Hotel was conveniently located and the rooms of good quality. The staff were excellent and always helpful when approached. The breakfasts provided a varied and adequate choice. We would stay in this Hotel again. ,5,2019,07,25
227,Good experience,"Parking is a problem. If you get a space in the garage, don't give it up Table service in the bar not good. You must stand in line at the bar and carry your drinks back to your table.Friendly service.",3,2019,07,24
227,"Good Location, Friendly and Helpful Staff","Hotel is centrally located and very close to sights and pubs.  Room was comfortable.  There was a lot of noise late into the night from the neighboring pubs.  The staff, especially Katarina, were very friendly and helpful.A good place to stay when visiting Dublin.",4,2019,07,23
227,Great Independent Hotel in a great location,Good value and central location makes this a nice option if your visiting Dublin. The staff is helpful and we particularly found Rachel helpful in advance of our visit.  The street noise was was a little noisy but we didn't  really mind that too much. ,4,2019,07,23
227,Loved it,"The rooms were clean and nice, staff was friendly and helpful. We were a little warm the first night until we found a fan in the closet. Loved the location - close to shopping and pubs. Was a little noisy until the bar below closed, but that didn’t bother us. ",5,2019,07,20
227,"Good location, sparse amenities","I had a smallish room which was clean and functional.  The hotel does not have a fitness center but there are gyms nearby that have available day passes.  I chose the FlyteFit gym on Georges Street - about three blocks away. 18 Euros for a two-day pass. Breakfast is available downstairs and room service is available from noon to 8 or 9 PM.  The hotel was just a few minutes' walk from my meeting site.  So, it was a good choice for this trip.  I wouldn't recommend it for leisure travel.",3,2019,07,17
227,"Great location, a little noisy","I picked this hotel because it was within walking distance of Dublin's main attractions. Unfortunately the weekend we were there a concert was happening at the football stadium and 80,000 fans were in Temple Bar to party. The street noise was perceptible but not overpowering. Also, for the price of the room, breakfast should have been included instead of being extra. There are plenty of places to eat nearby so it's not really a problem, just sayin'.",4,2019,07,16
227,Dublin visit,"The staff is extremely helpful and outgoing; Emma and Rachel checked us in / out. The hotel is within easy walking distance to Grafton Street, St. Stephens Green, all mass transit and many restaraunts & pubs. ",4,2019,07,15
227,Located Right in The Thick of Things,"Good-sized room for 3 people with reasonable furnishings; acceptable bathroom. Good desk staff. This hotel, though, is all about the location. And the location has its pros and cons. Pro - centrally located to most of the tourist sites. Con - Noise from near-by bars thru windows that are open because there is no air conditioning.",3,2019,07,14
227,Very impressed,"I was very impressed by this hotel ,very central nice location ,polite and professional staff and the room wow -clean & comfortable. This place is certainly  making a name for itself in Dublin. Not sure it was ever on my radar previously but now that I have stayed here I will definitely keep it in mind for future stays. A very homely feel about it ,which I guess is what you need when you're travelling !",5,2019,07,14
227,Outstanding location!,"The Drury Court Hotel is centrally located and within waling distance of numerous restaurants, shops, attractions, and tours.  I found it a great value that also included a more than adequate breakfast having a number of food choices. All staff was very accommodating and friendly.  They put forth a great effort to assist us with our tour bookings and promptly respond when we requested additional services and service items. Thank you for a wonderful stay.  I cannot wait to return with family and friends! ",5,2019,07,14
227,Make sure you add the breakfast to your stay,"Hotel was great, great location , great service and massive breakfast next day. Would very much recommend staying in this little boutique hotel.
I’d read reviews about it being too noisy, however we stayed on a Friday night in a room on the first floor right at the front of hotel.
Noise was minimal as double glazing has been added",5,2019,07,14
227,Great hotel and location,Very nice hotel - clean and well  maintained.  The room was a good size. It was clean and had everything we needed.  Great location - walking distance from many sights.  The staff was very nice and helpful.   ,5,2019,07,13
227,"Great hotel, nice staff, cnetral location","I was at a gig in Iveagh Gardens & needed somewhere to stay. Travelling alone.This was a great find. Lovely hotel, easy to find, extremely central & convenient for any city centre facilities or events. Staff were very helpful. The room was comfortable & in very good shape. I really cannot fault it at all. Breakfast downstairs in the P Macs bar was really good, with good, efficient & friendly service. 
I would just mention that it may not necessarily be the world's quietest hotel. This is not a criticism. I expected this. It is so central that, until bar closing time, there is a fair dash of noise outside. The windows shut it out well, but if you are delicate about such things, maybe just be mindful.
Thanks for a great stay.",5,2019,07,13
227,Perfect location and lovely staff,"Drury Court was the perfect place for our stay in Dublin. The location was perfect; we walked to everything! What set them apart was the staff, they went above and beyond throughout the whole stay. Being in a new city, they made us feel so welcome and helped us navigate the city. ",5,2019,07,13
227,"Excellent hotel, great location","We stayed two nights at the Drury Court Hotel. What a great location - close enough to Temple Bar to walk there in about 7 minutes but far enough away to enjoy a more ‘local’ atmosphere. Situated in a really nice part of Dublin, close to the Gaiety Theatre (Riverdance on there at the moment), St. Stephen’s Green as well as some terrific bars and restaurants - nearly everywhere of interest is within walking distance.
The hotel rooms are clean and spacious, the staff are really helpful and room prices are reasonable.
Will definitely stay at the Drury Court on our next visit the Dublin.",5,2019,07,12
227,Location Great; Apt Cleanliness Below Average ,"We were drawn to this hotel based on reviews, price and location.  We rented two one bedroom apartments.

The location is great for touring Dublin. You can walk pretty much anywhere from here and you are close to many restaurants and Temple Bar. 

The price is good but I guess you get what you pay for? 

The linens and towels were clean in the apartments. The beds were decently comfortable but it ends there. I literally do not think they swept the floors or even understand what it means to clean floors. There were literally multiple dust bunnies and just debris  in the middle of the floor in all the rooms. It was crazy because it wasn’t just an oversight—a few remnants in the corner —it just looked like they hadn’t cleaned the floors in a long time. It was like that in both apartments. Also, the furniture just needed to be wiped down and upholstery vacuumed. The kitchen utensils were old and gross. The bathroom contained lots of mold and could use a good scrub with bleach. 

Maybe the hotel portion is better? I’m not sure. Even though the location and price are good, I wouldn’t stay here again.

227,Family vacation,"We were very happy with our stay at Drury Court Hotel.  
We found the property to be well maintained and the employees helpful and friendly.  I would definitely recommend the Drury Court Hotel to family and friends.  Thank you for a wonderful stay.  ",5,2019,07,09
227,Loved it,"Great hotel! We stayed for 2 nights during our week vacation in Ireland. It was the best hotel that we stayed.  Clean, comfortable and in great location. Walking distance to city attractions, close to stop 17 of on/off green bus. Breakfast is not included but there are many options to go since Hotel,is in great location. We loved everything about this hotel. If in Dublin again- for sure in this place.  ",5,2019,07,08
227,Hidden gem,"What an amazing hotel right into the city centre. Everything is in walking distance so you do not need transport at all.
We had a double room on 2nd floor facing to the Hairy Lemon and it was very specious, plus our room had a triple glazing what put outside noise on the minimum. 

There is P.Mac's pub attached to the hotel who has amazing pub food and big sort of craft beers.

What makes this hotel so amazing is staff who is working there, every time we walked into the lobby they welcomed us with a smile and friendly vibe. On arrival the gave us local tips how to avoid tourist traps and where to eat around area. Specially thanks to Dylan, Rachel and Katarina who went beyond.

I highly recommend this hotel and will stay with them next time I get back to Dublin.",5,2019,07,08
227,"Not perfect, but the service made it excellent!","We had a 1 bedroom apartment. There were some small issues (water, heating, etc), however, the staff quickly responded and helped us in every way they could. They comped us a breakfast, and also allowed us to have a bit of a later check out, which made up for the small issues we encountered. 

The apartment was just fine - nice enough, and great for the price we paid. We enjoyed being able to make our own meals. The apartment was quiet and had comfortable sleeping arrangements, and best of all, the location is unbeatable! 

But as I began to touch on before, the staff working at this hotel is excellent. They really take care of their guests and go the extra mile to make their guests feel welcome and taken care of. We had several things we needed help with (not related to the room), and everyone really went out of their way to do what they could. A special thanks to Matt, who really went above and beyond for us!",5,2019,07,05
227,Excellent Value and Location,"Bright modern apartments with excellent cleanliness and location . Three good size double bedrooms, nice living room and bathroom. Small Halley kitchen which was well equipped.
Really enjoyed central location and great value. 
Would highly recommend",4,2019,07,03
227,Quiet Gem of a hotel,"It is rare to find a quiet room is bustling exciting Dublin city centre. We did. The Drury Court. We too had a 4th floor room on the corner, above the hotel bar and next to the construction site. However this did not bother us at all.  The nights were quiet even with windows opened. During the day we closed the windows, so did not hear a thing. The hotel's new double glazed noise occluding windows are the SOLE reason we chose this hotel. It was a pleasure to have peace and quiet for sleeping time.
All reception staff was good. One i think her name was Rachel went beyond, with her helpfulness. Especially sharing with us some of her favourite non touristy places to visit in and around Dublin. Like Howth by train.  Wonderful.",5,2019,07,02
227,Comfortable stay,"Room was spacious for 3 adults (1 twin bed, 1 double).  Window opened slightly and there was very nice and cold AC available.  The room was clean, and the bathroom was sufficient and large.  I hated the bathroom sink knobs though- very slippery, poorly designed, and not ergonomically pleasing.  But, hey if the bathroom sink knobs were the worst part about the stay that's pretty good!  The front desk staff was very friendly and knowledgeable, and the location was perfect for walking to Temple Bar, Trinity College, Grafton Street, and St. Stephen's Green.  Location proximity to the happening parts of Dublin was probably the best part about the hotel as well as it feeling like a safe area.",4,2019,06,24
227,Great Value ,Great location with moderate pricing. I’ve stayed here twice now and each time the staff is very friendly and helpful. The rooms are immaculate and comfortable. The hotel is steps off of Grafton Street and just a couple of minutes walk to Temple Bar. Basically you’re in the center of everything for a lot less. Has great internet and morning breakfast buffet. ,5,2019,06,22
227,Great location and quaint and quiet rooms,"Great central location with all the amenities you need. The rooms were clean, quaint, and quiet for a good night’s sleep. Friendly and helpful staff. Great breakfast and bar. Within walking distance to St Patrick’s Cathedral, Guinness and Jameson Distillery, ChristChurch Cathedral, restaurants, parks, ...",5,2019,06,19
227,"Prime location, great service","Definitely a great location!  Right in the heart of downtown Dublin, walkable to most anywhere, plus near a tram line.

I requested and got a room high up on the side street- I'd ask for that as it's right over a bar (but I barely heard anything- the windows are quite thick).

The service was great- I got in around midnight and they guy there printed some work documents for me and lent me a converter.

The only downside is no gym.
I would stay there again.",5,2019,06,17
227,Nice hotel in great location,"We stayed only one night.  The hotel is in a great location, a bit noisy but that's Dublin on a Friday night.   The service was excellent.   They gave us detailed directions on how to get around and where to go.  They called a taxi for us the next morning to go to the airport.   The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable.   It's a basic but nice little boutique hotel.",4,2019,06,17
227,Great location with clean room,"Stayed here for one night during a business trip. Like all the hotels in the area, it is expensive and bit noisy from the bar below, if you leave the windows open. The bedroom was clean and comfortable, had a king size bed in the room, nice bathroom. Excellent location, close walk to town center and all the tourist attractions. Plenty of places to eat and drink at within a 10 minute walking distance. Breakfast was excellent, continental breakfast had a spread and cooked breakfast was available to order. I would stay here again as overall it is a lovely hotel in a great location.",4,2019,06,16
227,Fabulous Location,Excellent hotel with friendly staff and excellent breakfast. Fantastic location. You can not beat this. Highly recomend. I had never been to Dublin before and researched everything. This is the exact location in the center of town but in a quiet side street.,5,2019,06,08
227,"Wonderful staff, location","This is a wonderful hotel ideally located in downtown Dublin. Like all the hotels in the area, it is expensive, but worth it. With 3 people, we had reserved a triple room--1 double and 1 twin bed. They upgraded us without charge to an apartment with 3 bedrooms, kitchen, and washing machine for our clothes. It was spacious and quiet. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful with printing airline boarding passes and looking into reservations for attractions, as well as making copies of our passports for us. There were really only two negatives. We found an empty beer can full of tobacco on the patio and a bit of tobacco odor within the apartment (the hotel was supposed to be non-smoking). Also, the apartments have a different entrance than the hotel lobby, and the key is difficult to open the second entrance door. Despite those small issues, we would definitely stay at the Drury Court Hotel again especially if the 3 bedroom apartment were available.",5,2019,06,08
227,Perfect location,"We stayed here for 2 nights and really enjoyed it! The location couldn't be better--we walked everywhere--and the front desk staff were incredibly nice and helpful. Matt gave us some great recommendations, including the Teeling Distillery tour which we loved! While the hotel was a bit pricier than I would've liked for what it was, it was in line with most of the other hotels we looked at in central Dublin.",4,2019,06,04
227,Be in the middle of it all!,"This hotel is right in the center of town in walking distance to the Trinity College, the Book of Kells and St Patricks and all kinds of food and drinks. Great location with parking just around corner.  Staff wonderful and helpful",5,2019,06,04
227,Drury Court Hotel Stay,"This was the perfect location for walking about in Dublin centre where there are plenty of pubs and restaurants and lovely sights to see.  The staff were very friendly, welcoming and helpful with tips on things to do and see and directions.  The rooms were very comfortable and clean and breaksfasts were very good.  ",5,2019,06,03
227,The BEST STAFF EVER!!,I could not have had a more enjoyable experience thanks to the staff efforts to make the best suggestions that made for a perfect vacation experience!! Great location & very comfortable & relaxed setting! ,5,2019,06,02
227,Great Location. ,Stayed at this hotel on holiday and was totally pleased. Excellent  3 star hotel with a perfect location. Staff were great and very helpful. The breakfast was nothing special and a little pricey. There are other nearby restaurants that have better breakfast selection for less. Will stay here again next time we’re in Dublin. Good value. ,5,2019,06,02
227,Great location,We enjoyed the location and breakfast.  Breakfast staff very  nice. They even got us almond milk. Dylan’s postcards were beautiful. He is a good photographer. Staff gave us great dining tips. We would stay here again. ,5,2019,05,31
227,Business Trip,"Good Hotel in the center of Dublin's night life. Restaurant closes early at 8am. other restaurants in the area very busy, so make sure you book a table.
I am 6.3 feet, so found bed a bit sorter than normal bed and room was a little cold, no control over heating in the room.",4,2019,05,30
227,Great staff make this an easy stay,"Our stay had a few hiccups but the staff there helped us immensely several times, including running after us down the street to catch us at the bus stop with the boarding passes we forgot. We can't speak highly enough of how comfortable and easy they made our stay.",5,2019,05,29
227,Very nice place in Dublin,"The hotel staff were very friendly and eager to help with suggestions. The location, in the city center, was Rey convenient and quiet. The room was sparkling clean and very comfortable. We appreciated the choice of shower or bath!",5,2019,05,29
227,So impressed with how great it was.,"We checked in to room 402 on May 27, 2019 not sure what to expect, we were so pleased with how genuinely nice they were. No it is not a huge hotel and that made us love it even more.
When we arrived the windows were open and the room smelled fresh but we could hear some noice from down the way. We closed the windows and couldn’t hear a sound, great windows that block out all noise.
After a long overnight flight the beds were perfect, we just melted into them.
The room looks like it has been recently redone, very clean, great bathroom and decor. Nice white fluffy spa towels. We enjoyed how large it was and lots of space to settle down.

We were able to buy our Hop on/ Hop off tickets at the front desk and the bus stops really close to the hotel.
The attached bar was so much fun, music, cards and board games.
2 doors down is the best little coffee and pastry shop, even though there is coffee in our room.

I called the front desk at 8:30pm on where to get a bottle of wine, she told me she would bring a bottle up to my room in 2 minutes. The wine she picked was so good and a great price. 

We have traveled a lot but the people here are very genuine and care about taking care of us.

Parking was so easy and close.

We will be back.
Thank you 
Tim and Brenda Pike",5,2019,05,28
227,Slàinte!,"I greatly speak highly enough of our stay at this hotel. The location is the main positive, being just a short walking distance from most of the main sites of Dublin, including the Temple Bar and the Guinness Storehouse. Our room was spacious and clean and the bed was comfy, and the staff were very friendly and full of helpful advice about the city from start to finish. Five stars!",5,2019,05,27
227,Great find in great area!,"I only stayed one night at the Drury Court Hotel but I thoroughly enjoyed my stay! It is very clean, the bed and pillows were comfortable and the staff was very friendly. It's a little off the beaten path in the Temple Bar area but not bad, still close to a lot without all the noise of being right in Temple Bar. I can't say enough good things about this hotel, if I come back I would definitely stay again! ",5,2019,05,27
227,Great place,"Everything was great!  I would love to go back there again.  We did not check out the bar but it was very popular.  Breakfast was excellent.  I highly recommend it to travelers. We only stayed one night because our meeting was near Galway. 
",5,2019,05,26
227,Website photos are misleading,"The staff is lovely but this place is in dire need of an upgrade. Doors have fingerprints and dirt on them, chairs and sofas in the rooms & hallway are stained or torn, bed is less than comfortable. The breakfast is limited. Would not stay there again.",2,2019,05,26
227,A Delightful Little Hotel,"The Drury Court Hotel is in a perfect location for walking to many of the top Dublin sites, restaurants, and pubs.  Hotel staff is very friendly and totally accommodating.  The room was very comfortable and clean.  Nice to have breakfast on site.",5,2019,05,24
227,"Excellent location, great value and friendly staff! Highly recommendable...","Stayed at this Dublin city centre hotel for two nights back in February. Was amazed at the exceptional value for its location. All the staff were friendly, kind and accommodating. Will definitely return. Don’t ever change your unique bar experience either Drury Court!!",5,2019,05,24
227,Central location and Spacious Rooms,"The room was everything we could ask for. Central location, within walking distance to most landmarks and restaurants so very rarely needed a taxi. Very close to shopping areas as well. The room itself was very spacious and the bed comfortable. The bathroom was fine and was cleaned daily. Wifi works well and the staff at the reception were incredibly friendly and helpful- printing out tickets for us when we realised we forgot to. The hotel is expensive but considering this seems to be the price range for hotels in this location, would not deter me from coming here again. Furthermore since you can walk everywhere from the hotel you'll be saving a lot on taxi money anyway.The closest bus stop for the bus taking us to and from the airport is only a 5 minutes walk too. Perfectly pleasant stay and would highly recommend.",5,2019,05,22
227,helpful staff great location,"Quiet rooms in the centre of town. rooms good clean and quiet.
great bar attached to hotel. food options limited to bar food with breakfast in pub. 
parking next door to hotel at subsidized cost so very good. staff very helpful",4,2019,05,22
227,I will go back,"I stayed 6 nights at Drury Court Hotel for a business trip and I cannot deny I had a pleasant stay.
The hotel is very well located, just 2 minutes off Temple Bar, with the advantage of being in a quiet street also during the weekend (at least at 5th floor). Basically, all Dublin's sites of interest are at walking distance, as well as many bus lines to reach all areas out of town (UCD campus included). All possible shops, cafés, pubs and restaurants are just around the corner.
The room was plenty of space, clean and the bed was unbelievably comfy - I slept so well! Nice shower. Wifi works well. Breakfast only average. 
Extremely friendly, supportive and professional staff. No issues whatsoever.
The not very nice thing was that my room window looked on a very narrow street exactly on a building undergoing refurbishment and with little natural light. So definitely not a room with a view. Not sure about other rooms. Moreover, there was a constant noise in the background I could not identify, but it did not bothered me.
The hotel is rather expensive for its level. However, I am afraid this is mainly due to the global cost of hotels in Dublin. 
I recommend staying at Drury without hesitation.",4,2019,05,20
227,Great Location,"This hotel is walking distance from pretty much everywhere you would want to go in dublin - even the Guinness Storehouse. You can’t beat the location and the rooms are clean and spacious. If you go on a weekend like we did, be mindful that the hotel is located directly on top of a lively bar. We stayed on the 4th floor and I actually enjoy the white noise of people talking so I did not have any problems sleeping but if you need silence to sleep this may not be the best place for you. Also if you can help it - avoid using the basement restrooms. We used them after we checked out of our room and they’re clean but super spooky with motion detecting lights that will shut off while you’re in there then spontaneously turn back on without movement. Gave me the creeps!",3,2019,05,16
227,Almost Perfect!,"Great location, within walking distance to everywhere in the city (tourist sites, restaurants, even the airport bus). I had a lovely little room with a comfortable bed, and nice bright bathroom. The street noise was a little loud one night and the interior fire door between the rooms and the elevator slammed all night, keeping me awake, but had a great stay otherwise. I’ll definitely be back to Dublin and would stay at the Drury Court again.",4,2019,05,13
227,My Home Away From Home,"I have been coming to Dublin for 11 years, it was the first hotel I stayed in and has been my favoured one ever since, no frills, just small, clean, and friendly perfectly located for major attractions.",5,2019,05,11
227,Good location; Helpful staff.,Comfortable hotel in good location near Stephen's Green. Staff were very nice and helpful. Bar/restaurant is a separate place next door (didn't go there). Noisy surroundings but my room's double glazing worked very well.,4,2019,05,11
227,Don't know," I Don't know what it mean, and I don't understand what you want.
But I just want to tell everyone that the room was simply perfect, not too expensive and next to my favourite pub: ""The Hairy Lemon""....so we really enjoyed our trip.
Thank you",5,2019,05,11
227,Refreshing,"Convenient, quiet location.  Clean rooms and pleasant staff. Great recommendations of lunch while we were waiting on room.  Staff was also helpful in coordinating one of our activities when we were confused by venues hours due to Easter holiday.  Pleasantly refreshing after disappointment in other hotels on our trip.",5,2019,05,10
227,"Well located, great staff",We stayed there for a day after a cruise. The hotel is well located downtown that allows to visit the cultural quarter and the Guinness Storehouse by foot. The staff was extremely helpfull and welcoming,5,2019,05,08
227,"Excellent location, pretty clean rooms","We enjoyed our stay. Everything was within walking distance. The room was clean, but bathroom sink had some moldly spots. Wall to wall carpet is not a very good solution if you have people with dust allergy. Breakfast was ok. The personnel were very friendly both in reception and breakfast room. ",4,2019,05,07
227,Great location and staff,"Front desk staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Matt did a great job taking care of our needs. Excellent location within walking distance to many sights, restaurants, and pubs. Would definitely recommend the Drury Court!",5,2019,05,05
227,Location is everything,"The location is perfect. The greeting from the staff is welcoming and accommodating. We got good advice on where to eat. The room was rather dark but gave a warm impression due to the coloring (red and brown). The bathroom could do with a helping hand. 
Breakfast is served in a Pub and it smells Pub. You order what you want to eat from the staff. Only the cold dishes are on the buffé. ",3,2019,05,05
227,Dublin for families,A great little spot in the heart of Dublin. Close to so many of the cities attractions . We were a party of 5. The 3 brm unit was compact but comfortable.  Washing machine and kitchen facilities were handy. I also found it very clean.,4,2019,05,04
227,Just...perfect!,"Situated in the center of the town this hotel is perfect for visiting Dublin. All the staff is very kind and always smiling.

227,"Friendly, professional service and a great location","Lovely hotel close to Grafton Street, Trinity College and Temple Bar. Double glazing meant road noise was minimal and allowed for excellent nights sleep.  Close to great bars and restaurants.  Will happily return with friends / family.  Staff very knowledgeable and helped us with public transport so we were able to get to destinations e.g. Botanical Gardens really easily.",5,2019,04,30
227,location location location!,For the hotel being in downtown the room and bath sizes are very generous. The price is reasonable for large comfort able room sizes and for it being so conveniently located. The hotel is right in the middle of everything. The staff was very friendly. The hot breakfast is good. ,5,2019,04,29
227,3 Night City Break,Had a 3 night stay at Drury Court Hotel. Staff very helpful & friendly nothing was too much trouble for them. Hotel is well positioned in the City.

227,Very happy!,"Great location, very near Grafton Street,  lovely friendly hotel, great room. Very clean and organized. Had everything we needed. Breakfast was very good with a lovely choice of cereals, juices, fruits and frys. Staff very friendly and good at their job. Katriana  was our receptionist and couldn’t be more helpful. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Loved the bar with the board games and candles, Will recommend it to all my friends, Will definitely stay there again. Keep up the good work, well done!!!!",5,2019,04,25
227,Perfect for a large family,"Our family of 6 was given the large room on the fourth floor and found it to be incredibly comfortable.  The bathroom was modern, the room looked to be recently renovated, and was clean.  My wife and I took advantage of the really strong wifi.  The beds were comfortable (though the large bed was a bit short; I'm a little more than 6'0"" and my feet were off the bed).  The hotel lobby was manned 24/7 and the people working there were professional and helpful.  The location of this hotel can't be overstated.  We were able to walk to all the major sights in Dublin.  While breakfast wasn't included in the very affordable price, there are many coffee/donut shops nearby or breakfast can be purchased in the bar next to the hotel.

We would definitely stay in the Drury Court Hotel again if we get to return to Dublin.",4,2019,04,20
227,Convenient Location,We returned to Dublin on our final day in Ireland to see Riverdance at the Gaiety Theatre and this hotel was conveniently located 3 minutes from the theatre.  The hotel was in a safe location and had comfortable beds.  It was a good value for the location and for the room.  The next morning we walked the 10 minutes from the hotel to the Airport Bus pickup.  ,4,2019,04,19
227,Fabulous apartment in the heart of the city 😊,"Stayed in the 3 bedroomed apartment with my mum, aunt and sister. Great deal via booking.com .. super location and facilities and value for money .. comfy beds . One minor down fall was the view but I guess a small price to pay for the central location . ",5,2019,04,18
227,Excellent location & Quiet room,"I was traveling with my parents to celebrate my birthday, and we were very happy with the size of our triple-room as well as a thoughtful gift & card that the Hotel Staff left for us to enjoy.  Our goal was to stay in an affordable, but safe & comfortable place that was within walking distance to as many popular attractions & restaurants. Drury Court is certainly the hotel for that!  We were a little worried about the construction that was going on in the street being a noise problem, but it was not an issue at all. We also appreciated the attentiveness of the staff who helped us figure out the controls on the radiator.  Highly recommend a stay at this hotel!",5,2019,04,16
227,Lovely stay,"The staff were really friendly and accommodating, meaning we were able to check in after midnight.

There was a rogue workman on Saturday morning who woke us up, but reception were quick to apologise profusely and filed a report against him. They also gave us a generous discount to apologise for the inconvenience - what more could we ask for!

Overall, it was a lovely, clean room with friendly reception staff. With the windows closed, you barely hear any outside noise, and we slept great. 

Would definitely stay again and recommend!",5,2019,04,14
227,Enjoyed Drury Court  Hotel!,"Thanks to the staff for their warm, welcoming, 
 awesome service! Hotel is located in the heart of restaurants and pubs. Clean bathroom and room. Would recommend. The staff surprised my husband with cake for his birthday. ",5,2019,04,04

227,"great location, friendly staff","Friendly helpful staff, great location, comfortable room, the bed was better mine at home!  When asked the staff offered tips to places to avoid (tourist trap, over-priced) and where I should go for a good pint or healthy meal.  Walking outside there was plenty of options for a quick breakfast or formal dining, and shopping for any taste.  A great location.",5,2019,04,01
227,Great hidden gem in a wonderful location,the hotel was in the perfect location. It had  clean rooms and great service.  Close to everything.  It is a small hidden gem on a side street but so convenient to everything.  I would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2019,03,30
227,"Wonderful Location, Staff and Hotel  = Awesome Trip","We had a truly fantastic trip  - first of all  - the hotel is a gem in regards to location, staff and rooms!!   We spent 4 nights here and our room was spotless upon arrival and cleaned beautifully everyday.  The Staff are the friendliest and nicest staff of any hotel we have ever stayed in - they go above and beyond!  The location is just perfect - the hotel is on a safe and quite street but so close to everything! We walked everywhere  - you are literally a few minutes walk to all the top attractions and food options galore! We had no idea of what a fantastic location this was when we booked as we had never been to Dublin before. We just kept saying how fortunate we were to be staying here as this place is so centrally located.  This place was an awesome find and we will be staying here again in the future!!",5,2019,03,29
227,"Perfect location, great hotel","I really think this hotel deserves more than 3 stars as the service, rooms and location are all fantastic. I couldn't recommend this hotel enough, as you can walk to all the bars/restaurants. The reason I booked it was because it was so close to the Gaitey theatre, so if your going down to Dublin for a show, this hotel is literally 3 mins walk away. The rooms are a good size and nice and warm. Bathroom was great, and very clean. 
As you are in the city center is was quite noisy but there's no way to avoid this, just bring some ear plugs! There are 2 multistory parking options near the hotel and the hotel gives a discount when you check out so we parked for almost 24 hours for a mere  12 euro! 

The guy who checked us in was very friendly, there was no iron in the room but he was quick to provide one for us. I couldn't recommend this hotel enough",5,2019,03,24
227,"Perfect Location, Friendly Staff","Had a wonderful (but short) stay at Drury court hotel. For a 3 star you do not expect much but this was perfect, rooms very clean ! Although the bed sheet was not fitted on the bed properly that was just a minor thing that could easily be sorted.  

For the price of €100 on a Friday night to stay in that location on Patrick’s weekend it was definitely worth it ! So close to everything, so many options for eating out including their own P macs. Breakfast served in P macs was also great and a good price. Staff very nice and friendly.  

Would definitely recommend for anyone who is coming to stay in Dublin and looking for somewhere comfortable, clean and convenient 😊",4,2019,03,22
227,Great place lovely staff great location  ,"Stayed here for St Patrick’s night as we were attending a show on the 3arena,

227,Fantastic hotel,"I stayed here for three nights and have nothing bad to say about my stay here.  The room was immaculate, and had everything I needed.  Close to all the main tourist attractions, including Temple Bar.  Even though it’s nearby to Temple Bar, the road it’s on is quiet, so there’s no noise at night.   Will be staying again.",5,2019,03,21
227,Comfort with value,"Stayed for one night and the Hotel was comfortable and clean, the receptionist was very helpful, 
Had a good nights sleep has the windows have an extra layer of glazing fitted.
Great location for access for Grafton Street and St. Stephen's green shopping center.  ",4,2019,03,21
227,Great hotel,"Lovely welcome

227,Excellent stay at the Drury Court Hotel during St Pattys,"Excellent hotel overall. Comfortable and cozy rooms. The hotel is located within walking distance from good restaurants and night life. However, it is in a bit of quieter area- which was definitely a plus. Very helpful and friendly staff. Very enjoyable stay. Would definitely recommend to anyone traveling to dublin!",5,2019,03,17
227,Love this place,Always love staying here. Central to all attractions and very close to grafton street. Staff are always friendly and helpful. Rooms are quiet and have all you need for a couple of nights stay in Dublin. ,5,2019,03,15
227,dublin break,"great location , very friendly and helpful staff , nice size and comfortable room. can walk to all the main areas like grafton street , temple bar good transport nearby on trams and buses , plenty of great pubs and restaurants nearby",5,2019,03,14
227,Great Stay while in Dublin,"The Drury Court Hotel was in the perfect location and the perfect price for our stay in Dublin. The staff were all extremely friendly and helpful, and the room was exactly what we needed. Very clean and tidy and safe. We will definitely book at the Drury Court again in the future should we be in the Dublin area.",5,2019,03,14
227,Drury Court,Nice hotel in a great Dublin location.  Car park is across the road and the hotel gets you a concession that basically halves the price.  Good restaurants and pubs a stones throw away.  Nice staff and a comfy hotel.,3,2019,03,11
227,Great Location!,"This hotel has a fantastic location! I stayed at the hotel for a little over a week. I was able to reach the majority of the tourist spots within a 5-15 minute walk and in those instances where public transportation was needed the bus stop was right around the corner. Everyone I dealt with at the front desk was courteous and helpful. They went the extra mile to help with all of my inquiries or requests and I appreciated their help and/or recommendations immensely. The cleaning staff were polite and helpful as well. The few drawbacks I saw were that the decor was a little worn and the bed wasn't bad but not as comfortable as I've experienced elsewhere. Overall, considering the price, location and customer service experience I would consider booking them again in the future.",4,2019,03,08
227,Started off great...,We were just here for one night and got one of the apartments as there were 3 of us staying there. The room itself was great. Very cozy and felt like home. Had a little balcony kitchen and the sofa bed was very comfortable. We had to leave very early in the morning to catch a bus back to the airport. There was no hot water. Someone from the front desk came up( believe the name was Tim) and reset something said it would be hot again in about 10 min otherwise he’d have to call maintenance. We didn’t have time for maintenance as we had to leave so we waited and waited but no hot water. We had to shower with ice cold water when it was 20 degrees outside. As we were checking out I mentioned this to the same front desk clerk and his best and only response was “Sometimes the hot water works and sometimes it doesn’t”. I think that was unprofessional and uncaring considering you wouldn’t want that yourself when you’re paying that price for a room. Was extremely disappointed. We were told we could also purchase bus tickets at the desk in the morning but turns out you can’t. This could have been a great trip and review but the hot water issue was handled terribly. ,2,2019,03,07
227,Brilliant Location,"Found hotel through Booking.com. Very warm welcome from reception ( Matt & Rachel ). They were helpful and gave us lots of information about the area. Location is very good. We walked everywhere, Grafton St and Temple Bar close by. Guinness Storehouse took us 15 minutes and the airport bus stop was 5 minutes walk. Lots of restaurants but the Hairy Lemon opposite hotel was a particular favourite. Excellent food. Spacious room with air conditioning and a really nice shower. They have triple glazing so it is amazingly quiet considering how central you are. This hotel is very reasonably priced and we would definitely recommend it. ",5,2019,03,03
227,Excellent value ,"This hotel is perfectly situated, just 200 meters from Grafton Street and Stephen’s Green, across the street from the Hairy Lemon Pub, and an easy walk to Trinity College, Temple Bar, and O’Connell Street. Our room was spacious, clean and comfortable. Double panes windows kept things quiet even though we were in a busy night life area. The staff was very friendly. The price was quite reasonable considering all the pluses.",5,2019,03,03
227,Wonderful Stay!,"My partner and I stayed here after originally planning to stay at a hostel. Our experience was amazing! We booked through hotels.com the day we needed to check in (because of the hostel we were originally planning to stay in). We were amazed at how close to everything it was. We chose the option where breakfast was included with our stay. Our room had a double bed and a twin. It was clean, and everything was excellent. Our bathroom had amazing water pressure and was probably the highlight of our stay. Breakfast was great. Since we booked breakfast in advance, we had both the hot and continental breakfast included. Both options were delicious. The hotel staff was great and gave us great recommendations for food, as well as transit to the airport. I would definitely stay here again!",5,2019,02,28
227,"Great location, very reasonable imo","I found the price was ~very~ fair for what turned out to be a small apartment - definitely more comfortable over multiple nights than a regular hotel room. Seemed clean enough, and ours being in the back of the building it was pretty quiet. The extremely central location made it feel like an even greater bargain as it was within easy walking range of many of the city's attractions. Several very good restaurants in the immediate neighborhood, some right around the corner. Also worth mentioning - the breakfast arrangement for Drury Court guests with the place on the corner is a nice touch - better food, imo, than what many hotels struggle to serve up as breakfast. Very pleasant staff. ",4,2019,02,28
227,Lovely hotel,Had a twin room which was very nice and clean... Lots of bars and restaurants around the hotel. I would totally recommend this hotel.. And if you go pmease try the hairy lemon pub across the road fantastic food and beer.. ,5,2019,02,28
227,Perfect location,"Ideal location , loads of restaurants pubs and clubs all within walking distance. Room triple glazed for a quiet nights sleep. Room was fairly compact but had all you needed except maybe an ironing board",4,2019,02,25
227,Highly recommend,"The location and price of this hotel are unbeatable.
When I booked it, it was far cheaper than the other places I had considered. So I expected it to be a bit shabby & rough around the edges - you get what you pay for, afterall. 

It's certainly basic, nothing fancy. But it was clean, the beds were comfortable, the staff were extremely friendly and helpful, the shower was powerful, they supplied separate shampoo & conditioner (I find this is rare) 
For the price, this hotel is perfect for a city break in Dublin and I wouldn't stay anywhere else. I definitely recommend it.",5,2019,02,24
227,nice stay in the heart of Dublin,"I like my Stay , everything was very good, especially the breakfast, mostly i took the Irisch with Toast and Marmelade, what I sometimes missed that you dont offer baked beens but it was in the end very delicious",4,2019,02,23
227,Quick trip to Ireland,"This was the perfect location to walk around and explore Dublin. Bus stops are close by. Restaurants and Pubs within a few feet to enjoy after a long day exploring! We, 3 adults are happy to have booked here!",5,2019,02,22
227,Good hotel...poor room,The location of this hotel is great. Staff were friendly and the room was clean. However the hairdryer did not work and was wired to the dresser. The shower was poor and the bed was small in length. The worst part was our room was beside a building site and there was heavy machinery working at 7am! I would not stay here again,2,2019,02,22
227,Fabulous location and staff!,"Clean comfortable hotel in a great location...lots of great places to eat and shop ..round the corner from Grafton street and St Stephens Green 
Extremely helpful and friendly staff 
Would definitely stay again Next time in Dublin ",4,2019,02,22
227,Good place in Dublin,"A nice and sufficiently spacious place south of the Liffey.  Close walk to Temple Bar area and in the heart of it all.  The breakfast situation was a little complicated (I assumed it was complementary, it is not.  But the rooms are rather nice despite the dated hallways and kind of antiquated entrance to the hotel.  I was pleased with cost and my comfort level for the single night I stayed here.",4,2019,02,20
227,Central accomodation. Great stay,"First time to dublin. Hotel was very easy to find. We stayed in 3 bedroom apartment and was huge. Proper home from home, 3 double rooms, a lounge with seperate kitchen and lovely clean bathroom. As a group of 5 girls we had plenty of space.

We were within walking distance of all the sites, lots of pubs, shops and resturants on the doorstep too and only 5min walk to famous temple bar. 

Staff were lovely and very helpful. Would recommend and stay again.",5,2019,02,20
227,Great reasonably priced hotel!,"I literally signed up for Trip Advisor today because I wanted to write a review for Drury Court. This was such a great hotel. Perfect location, minutes from the Temple Bar area, Trinity Church, etc...The room was clean and really comfortable. It was also very quiet. The staff was also super nice and really helpful. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. ",5,2019,02,20
227,Great find close to Grafton Street,Was delighted from the arrival at reception. The staff were pleasant and extremely helpful. Had breakfast in our room. It arrived on time and was lovely.  I asked for suggestions for nice restaurants and was much impressed by the advice. My favourite was Brassiere 66.   Try the EARLY BIRD.  Great value. Was unimpressed with the furniture in the hotels restaurant. Seats were SO UNCOMFORTABLE. Perhaps because I’m 73 years old and like my comfort lol 😂. The shops are 2 minutes away. I will return again very soon to Drury Court Hotel. Thank you for the complimentary wine for our 54th wedding anniversary. ,5,2019,02,15
227,Fab hotel in a great location at the right price,"Loved my stay here. Lovely hotel. Fab location. Reduced cost parking in the car-park right beside it. Friendly, kind and helpful staff - I was travelling on my own with a baby and the staff were great.  Got a great online deal to stay here. I will be looking out for another opportunity to stay at this hotel :) ",5,2019,02,15
227,Loved the apartment - Excellent location and value,"Stayed in one of the apartments this past week.  Apartments are separate from the main hotel by a few feet.  Unit was large, clean and had a comfortable bed.  Outside area was awesome as we enjoyed sunny weather during our visit.  Location is good for shopping, eating and exploring.  Breakfast in the pub on the ground floor was excellent.  Shout out to the young lady in glasses (forgot her name) at reception, she was professional and warm.",5,2019,02,14
227,Great location,This hotel is in a great location only a couple of minutes walk from the main shopping area of Grafton Street. The room was spotlessly clean and very comfortable and the staff courteous and very helpful ,5,2019,02,11
227,Budget price but excellent quality,"The hotel is brilliant value and perfect for exploring Dublin. The breakfast is excellent and the reception staff were friendly. The room was practically spotless and the decor surprisingly plush considering the price. My only slight niggle was that the bathroom bin hadn't been emptied since the previous guest, but this was remedied the day after when the room was cleaned so was obviously just a small mishap. ",5,2019,02,10
227,Great stay!,Great hotel in Dublin. Everything was clean and the hotel staff were friendly and eager to help. The room was spacious and up to date. The bathroom was clean and clean linens were provided. The room had a safe and plenty of storage.  I would stay here again! ,4,2019,02,09
227,Brilliant hotel,"Again we have found our stay at the drury court hotel excellent from the location ,cleanliness ,value for morning and as usual friendly staff that deliver excellent service . Would definitely recommend this hotel",5,2019,02,09
227,Outstanding value and so central to all the action the City has to offer,"My first time at Drury Court. A lovely , cosy comfortable Hotel. Everything was fab. The lighting in the bedroom was fantastic. ....I like a well lit room.  The bathroom was well equipped and the shower was  tip top. As I was in town to see the Cripple of Inishmaan , it was great to get a Hotel about a 150 meters from the Theatre. I will def. return to this wonderful Hotel.",5,2019,02,08
227,Great Hotel,"The hotel is conveniently located close to every main attraction, in an area with bustling restaurants and bars. The room was clean and very comfortable. I recommend paying the for breakfast at the hotel in the morning. It is a very good deal, and the food is delicious. Service by the staff was exceptional, and deserves to be acknowledged. Overall I was very impressed, and will definitely stay here again when I come back to Dublin.",5,2019,02,06
227,wedding aniversary stay,"Arrived on the 4th Feb and was greeted by very friendly staff at reception. 
Proceeded to our room which  were very spacious and clean and  the same of the Bathroom.  Breakfast was hot and delicious . Price for the stay was very good , Have found a little gem in an otherwise expensive city to stay. Will DEFINETELY return",5,2019,02,06
227,Excellent stay,"As soon as I walked in, I was greeted warmly by the receptionist and given the rundown on my room and amenities, and then I proceeded upstairs to handle my business. The room was clean and well-furnished, and I had plenty of space to set my stuff up and get comfortable. The hotel itself was in walking distance of the vast majority of Dublin's attractions, which made getting around town easy. Checking out was also simple, and the receptionist was very helpful in showing me how to get back to the airport. No complaints at all, very enjoyable stay.",5,2019,02,02
227,Charming and Delightful and Quaint,"I spent 7 nights at the Drury Court Hotel. The hotel is a few blocks south of the river and in a nice area. The hotel is small but busy. There is a lift / elevator for luggage transport. 

The water pressure is good and the soap and shampoo have a nice spicy scent. 

The Good
The staff is fantastic! The young ones laughed at my stupid tourist jokes and always greeted me when I entered the lobby. The staff have great suggestions for food and activities in Dublin. Any issues that came up, they quickly and cheerfully resolved. The staff are one of the reasons I would return to Dublin and the Drury Court Hotel.

The Not-So-Good
The rooms could use a good deep cleaning. There was a lot of dust and dirty corners. The beds do not have top sheets, they have a bottom sheet and a comforter with a duvet.",4,2019,02,01
227,Wonderful!!!,"Drury Court was incredible.  We stayed in the apartment, and the staff was incredibly responsive for any issue that arose.  Additionally, when our flight was cancelled the staff at Drury Court helped us secure a room in the hotel and helped us move within five minutes of calling.  The apartment was great, and we had a great terrace -- we felt like actual Dublin residents!  The room in the hotel was immaculate and cozy at the same time.  Excellent hotel, great staff, wonderful location!",5,2019,01,27
227,Great location but cleaning concerns,"This tiny hotel has a great location: 2 minutes walk from Grafton Street and 5 minutes to Temple Bar. Nice people working there, nice breakfast in a lovely vintage pub. The only concern was the cleaning. They didn't clean our bedroom floor as they should have during our stay.",4,2019,01,26
227,Great value and location,"This was a business trip and I couldn't resist booking this hotel when I saw the strong reviews and the price much lower than the alternative place my coworkers generally stay at. The staff here were super welcoming and the location is great, right near some awesome pubs and restaurants. The room was super clean and comfortable and I'll definitely be back when I'm in Dublin. ",5,2019,01,23
227,All Good!!!,Everything was great about our stay her in the hotel....great service....excellent breakfast with huge selection and brilliant service...….clean rooms and quiet at night even though in the heart of the city.....good value....highly recommended....will be back.,5,2019,01,22

227,Drury Court Hotel,"Hotel was clean and good size for twin, very spacious bathroom.Helpful staff at Reception.  My only dissatisfaction was the service at breakfast was very slow and it wasnt very busy. We had to ask for butter twice and we were handed one butter each while others were given a plate of butters. ",4,2019,01,14
227,40th birthday,"When we arrived there was a note wishing my husband a happy birthday. Room was lovely, staff friendly and helpful. Would definatley recommend. Plenty of places to est and drink within the area.Thank you for makung our stay very enjoyable. We will be back.",5,2019,01,11
227,Perfect Stay in a super location,"Stayed here for New Year’s. Location is great, close to everything. Rooms are clean, comfy, quiet.  WiFi worked great. Lift was quick and roomy. Best part is the staff. EVERYONE was helpful and went out of their way to help. ",5,2019,01,10
227,best value in dublin,"Everything was excellent, unbeatable price (via Hotels.com) and location. Only issue was heater wasn’t on when I checked in, quickly fixed after calling front desk. Very attentive staff and room was solid!",5,2019,01,10
227,Couldn’t Ask For Better!,"This hotel is exceptional! The staff are friendly, knowledgeable, and always willing to help! The room was very clean and spacious. The location is desirable; quiet but still in the middle of everything. ",5,2019,01,09
227,Third stay,"We stayed at Drury Court for 3 nights from the 2nd January with our four year old and one year old children. The staff were friendly and helpful. The receptionists are really lovely and very efficient. We arrived well before check in time and were able to go to our room immediately at 1.30pm. We were in Dublin to visit Wild Lights, Dublin Zoo, Imaginosity and the National Gallery. The hotel is centrally located and was perfect for our trip. Housekeeping did a great job on our room every day. The beds are comfortable and our family suite was quiet despite overlooking a busy street. The windows keep the noise out well. We didn’t eat breakfast at the adjoining premises as we visited Le Petit Parisien and Avoca for breakfast. Grafton Street is a two minute stroll away and there are gorgeous shops nearby. There is a fabulous book shop for children called Tales for Tadpoles that is well worth a look. Parking was conveniently located at Drury St car park and was well priced at €12.50 per day.We will be back next year again and wouldn’t stay anywhere else.",5,2019,01,09
227,"Clean, great location","We stayed at the Drury Court in January 2019 and couldn't have been happier.  Everyone at the reception desk was exceptional, the room was clean and quiet, the location is amazing.  Many of the major Dublin sights are within an easy walk of the hotel.

We can't wait to go back.",5,2019,01,08
227,Fantastic!!!,"We booked the Drury Court Hotel due to our original accommodation in Dublin being booked out for the extra nights we wanted. This was a blessing as we LOVED the Drury Court Hotel and it’s location. If we hadn’t discovered it, we never would have explored the surrounding neighbourhood.
Our room and bathroom were huge and while there isn’t a large foyer or restaurant/bar attached, there are so many places nearby to visit, it didn’t matter. The ammenities were all great and the next door restaurant used for breakfast service, very atmospheric and a wonderful Irish decor. It’s not a five star hotel but we’d take it any day over a large chain hotel. 
The staff on the front desk were superb. No question or query were too much trouble for them and they went above and beyond in helping us with our stay in Dublin. Highly recommend the Drury Court Hotel! ",5,2019,01,06
227,Great stay in every way,"We travel full time, so I am getting lax about reviewing every spot.  But I am compelled to review this hotel because it is a standout.  The standout was the staff. And not just one example of one friendly employee.  We stayed a week and every day someone went the extra distance to be helpful and cheerful. Everyone was engaged and knowledgeable.  Someone at this hotel has chosen and trained staff with this intent. Great location. We have no car. Short walk to Temple Bar, Grafton street for shopping, All city-located sights.  Bus for out of walking distance destinations was about 2 minutes in an area that seemed safe.  Lots of eating options, pubs, groceries within a block. Breakfast was good, unhurried and not busy.  Bed fine, shower pressure good.  Enough space in room and bathroom. Security good.  Quiet, Noise was not a problem (read some of my other reviews, I do not like noise). Lift was adequate.  The cost was very good for the Dublin for what you get. This hotel was a good choice in every way.",5,2019,01,06
227,weekend visit,"I booked this trip about 9 months ago and chose this hotel as we have stayed before. the hotel is a mix of usual hotel accommodation and a selection of apartments in a block a few yards from main hotel. first, the desk staff were brilliant, very friendly and helpful. the apartment was spot on. 3 bedrooms, bathroom, lounge and kitchen. well appointed and clean with lots of towels and clean bedding. we were welcomed with a bottle of wine as an apology for a small issue when we booked. I had completely forgotten about the issue as it was resolved immediately at the time. on arrival, my sister and her family went to check into their hotel(not this one) to find that the booking had been made for June not January...oops. no problem I spoke with our hotel who managed to get thenm two rooms here. saved the day and actually made my sister's stay more convenient. in summary, if you are looking for good accommodation in a really great location for tourist things eg bars, (temple bar area is very close) hop on hop off buses etc this is a great place. only watch out would be it is a bit of a noisy area and you can hear local businesses clearing up during the night. personally that doesn't bother me and if I wanted a quiet location I would have chosen a hotel well out of the city centre. ",5,2019,01,06
227,"Good hotel, nice stay","I have sojourned here from 30th December to 2nd January, and must say that I am quite satisfied by the room, service and friendliness of the staff.
The room was pleasant and well cleaned, and the position strategic in the town's center. ",4,2019,01,04
227,Excellent location,"Very comfortable and clean.  Easy walking distance to the centre, all major attractions (such as Trinity College), restaurants/pubs and access to the Hop On/Hop Off buses.  Wifi is included. Breakfast is offered but it is served in the restaurant next door - there is a connecting door. Cooked to order and a good choice. I don't think you would be disappointed if you chose to stay here, I would return.",4,2019,01,03
227,great Dublin hotel,"Small hotel located within walking distance (or taxi) near lots of pubs & restaurants. Rooms all have bathroom inside and were larger than typical European hotels. All expected amenities. A very avant garde bar next door (attached) but you can bring your drinks to your room. This is where they serve a nice breakfast buffet (and will even cook eggs to order) for a reasonable fee. There is a lift, so handicap access is no problem. Small lobby with very nice staff.",4,2019,01,03
227,Great value,Everything as it should be helpful polite employees. Nice rooms all facilities kept in good condition.  When you factor in the food and drinks this place really is a value. If there is one nearby on my travels that's where we are staying.,5,2019,01,03
227,Nice place to stay ,"My husband and I have stayed here twice now - once at the beginning of November and for New Years Eve. The hotel is nice and clean and the reception staff are lovely and helpful. The rooms are ample for what we needed. Beds are soft and have tea & coffee making facilities. The first time we stayed in room 101 and the second 204. We got quite a bit of street noise in 204 especially in the bathroom due to it being on the corner above PMacs bar below and the bathroom window looked faulty. It had no handle and had been screwed shut so because of this it was letting noise in. All we had to do was close the bathroom door and it shut off the noise. The only little issue we had was when we went in November our room was cold. My husband rang reception to report the radiators weren’t working but they advised him the heating wasn’t on and that they would switch it on. When we went back in December the heating wasn’t on again in the mornings or the evenings but when we came back to our room around 2pm to collect something it was really hot in our room. Personally I’d like the heating on early morning so it’s warm when I get out of bed and on an evening. I’m unsure what the timers are set at in this hotel but surely customer comfort should be paramount and heating should be on at reasonable times. 

Would I stay again..... yes definitely. Great location with only a 10 min walk to Temple Bar. ",4,2019,01,02
227,Best rapport quality/price/location,"We were two adults with two children (14 and 9 years old), the family suite was big and confortable.
The hotel is in a strategic position, near to all the most interesting places.
The only negative thing is about the breakfast, don't ask for 2 min boiled eggs, they don't know how to make.",4,2019,01,01
227,Great value in a great location,The staff were lovely and helpful. One of them took a nasty tumble while getting us a taxi in the rain. Hope he was ok! Location was great. We didn't have the breakfast but staff happy to suggest somewhere.,4,2018,12,23
227,Gorgeous 3 bedroom apartment,"We stayed at the Drury Court hotel (in one of the apartments) at the beginning of December ‘18. Fabulous accommodation, 3 double bedrooms, a kitchen, bathroom, lounge area. This hotel is in a great location, near to all the main visitor attractions. The hotel stafff were very helpful. We’ll definitely stay here again.",5,2018,12,22

227,My favorite Dublin hotel for the price so far,"After staying at multiple hotels in Dublin over the years that were similarly priced, I found Drury Court to be my favorite by a large margin. Very clean, not dated, convenient location, didn't experience loud street noise at night, roomy and comfortable.",5,2018,12,18
227,Great Experience,The hotel experience became part of our travel memories.  Friendly and knowledgeable staff.  Close to many areas we wanted to visit.  Having a lift was essential for my sister to travel with me on this trip.,5,2018,12,17

227,Very suitable hotel,See previous writeup . The staff were very helpful and access to the room was suitable as I am disabled. The hotel is in the centre of the city near major attractions.A nearby car park with special rates for residents was also a bonus,5,2018,12,09

227,Cozy hotel in the center of it all!,"The Drury Court Hotel was the perfect accommodation for our recent stay in Dublin. The location really can’t be beat. It is walking distance from all of the main attractions (St. Stephen’s Green, Grafton Street, Temple Bar, Trinity, cathedrals, etc.). There are great dining options just steps from the hotel, and we spent nearly every night at the attached bar, P. Mac’s. The neighborhood is prime for the young traveler who is looking for a vibrant scene. But there are double-pane windows so it’s quiet as well. The room was great, comfortable beds and was cleaned every day. We had a safe and great closet to hang our clothes for the week. The staff was incredibly friendly and very accommodating. They were all knowledgeable of the city and had great suggestions for what to do. I would definitely stay here again the next time I book a trip to Dublin!",5,2018,11,18
227,Amazing apartments close to the city,"Rooms: 2 rooms, one kitchen and a living room. The bathroom is only 1Location: wonderful, close to city center and temple barPersonal: Extremely nice and willing to help, they give maps and tips Internet: Good and available in all rooms.I extremely recommend the place",5,2018,11,12
227,Great Little Hotel in the Heart of Dublin!,"I’ve stayed at the Drury Court Hotel twice during the past week, divided by a four day stint to Galway. The location is fabulous - just a short walk to Grafton Street, St Stephen’s Green and Stephen’s Green Shopping Centre - as well as several great pubs and restaurants. It’s a lively area with a busy pub adjoining the hotel, but I wasn’t bothered by noise in either of the two rooms in which I stayed. A buffet breakfast is served in the pub for 10 Euros. I only went one morning - it was standard fare and a little rushed as they needed everybody out in time to close before lunch. The first room I had on the third floor was spacious with 2 twin beds, a bathroom with a shower over the bath - which took me a while to figure out. The room was clean with comfortable beds and nice linen, but I felt it was slightly tired. The second room I had on the second floor was lovely. It was smaller, but far nicer. The reception staff are young but very efficient, extremely helpful and friendly - a great team! You can order room service from the pub which arrives quickly. I would definitely stay at the Drury Court Hotel again but I would ask for the room on the second floor. ",4,2018,11,04
227,Not to be missed ,Stayed one night .. amazing place to lay your head .. so central.. close to brilliant bar & restaurants .. fantastic accommodation.. clean .. safe .. great shower .. reception staff couldn’t have done enough for us .. highly recommend this hotel ... ,5,2018,11,01
227,Days away,Enjoyed a 2 night stay in Dublin at Drury Court Hotel. Location fab as Grafton St and shops 5 mins in one direction and Temple Bar 5 mins other way. Recommend hop on hop off bus tour. Guinness storehouse and Kilmainhaim Gaol. ,4,2018,10,31
227,"Center of the city, good enough","Location of the hotel is excellent, short distance to all the major attractions. A lot of bars and restaurants around.
Windows soundproofing is good enough but inside the room, sometimes there was a little annoying whistling noise, apparently from the heater.
The room is clean and comfortable. There are a kettle, tea, and coffee making things, a safe too. Good lightning near the bed, comfortable for reading.
What we didn't like was breakfast. It was in the pub located in the same building (and it's very busy and popular pub in the evenings) but not so good for breakfasts. A choice is limited, food is not bad quality but not tasty.
Be aware that the bathroom has separate taps for hot and cold water. You get used to it, but it's not really convenient.",4,2018,10,31
227,Gem in the City,"Amazed with the size and cleanliness of the room, very courteous staff at the reception, and access to the room is secured. Plus, the location of the hotel is near to most of the sightseeing places like St Patrick Cathedral, Temple Bar, and many more. ",4,2018,10,30
227,Our stay at Drury Court Hotel,"Perfect location, clean and comfortable room, friendly and helpful staff, great breakfast at P.Mac's. Next year my sons and I will visit Dublin again, and we will certainly stay at Drury Court Hotel!!",5,2018,10,30
227,A Gem in the heart of Dublin.,"Stayed hear with 5 fiends taking part in the Dublin Marathon. Excellent accommodation and first class staff. Will be back next year. The location was perfect. Just off the top of Gradton Street. Would be ideal for families also. A big thank you to Emma we are forever in your debt, you were most helpful.",5,2018,10,30
227,Great location!!,Hotel is in the perfect spot for sight-seeing! Although there were bars all around us we never heard a peep (nor did our sleeping baby). Room was a bit small but we mistakenly booked as 1 person occupancy. staff was very accommodating and helpful,4,2018,10,29
227,Great hotel ,"We stayed at the Drury Court on the last few days of our trip to Ireland. The hotel is in a great location as it is a short walk to all the nightlife but far enough not to be disturbed by any noise. It is easy to visit all the main tourist attractions in central Dublin. 
The room was very comfortable and clean. Plenty of room. I was very impressed with all the staff. They are professional and very friendly and helpful. It is a well-run establishment. ",5,2018,10,27

227,"Great location, very spacious apartment","Check in was easy & they allowed us in a couple of hours earlier than stated. Location was perfect & within easy walking distance of all areas. There was a bit of noise from construction going on but nothing major. Couple of wall sockets didn’t work & no drainers in either sink so you couldn’t fill the sink to wash up. The apartment was big & spacious, plenty of room for 2 tall teenagers.",5,2018,10,25
227,Great place to stay in Dublin,The Drury Court Hotel is at a good location in Dublin.  The staff is very accommodating and the rooms are nice.  The hotel is near many good restaurants and shops.  There is plenty of transportation.  Another good feature is that the windows open!,5,2018,10,24

Great staff, huge comfortable rooms, good wifi and a parking deal with the multi storey across the road. Very reasonably priced. Will stay here again the next time I'm in Dublin.",5,2018,10,24
227,Cleanest Hotel we have ever stayed in,"The Drury Court is a wonderful hotel in a perfect location.It is also one of the cleanest hotels we have ever stayed in.  
The staff were extremely friendly & helpful. We arrived very early & they stored our luggage & we went across the street to get breakfast. When we came back they had our room ready.  
Sasha House Petite is around the corner from the hotel & has an amazing breakfast & the Hairy Lemon Pub is across the street & has great food & live music.
We would definitely stay at the Drury Court Hotel again if we went back to Dublin.",5,2018,10,23
227,October trip,"The apartment was very spacious and an excellent (cheaper) alternative to two separate single rooms in the hotel if you don’t mind sharing a bathroom. We also ate in the hotel, lots of choice at breakfast. All staff were friendly and very helpful.",4,2018,10,18
227,Great Reception/Great Location,We were able to check in an hour early and the woman at the front desk was very helpful in answering all of our questions and giving us info about the city. It was also located directly in the city centre and was a quick walk to all of the local pubs.,5,2018,10,15
227,"Small, neat hotel in the heart of Dublin","This hotel is well-appointed and serves the very best breakfasts in an interesting bar that occupies part of the ground floor.  Don't get a first floor room, however, as the noise from the bar is inescapable, even with earplugs.",3,2018,10,14
227,One of the best hotels!,"While this isn't the fanciest hotels I've stayed in, I would still rank it as one of the best!  The front desk staff were simply amazing -- friendly, quick to go out of their way to make our stay comfortable, and always willing to answer questions.  As others have said, the location is great, with plenty of shops, restaurants, and stores around.",5,2018,10,13
227,convenient location,"Centrally located for shopping, walking at St Stephen's Green and for night time pub visits.  Rooms were a bit small but comfortable enough for our overnights.  Noisy streets day and night with construction, deliveries and bar overflow were only somewhat mitigated by the double windows being closed, so no opportunity for a little fresh air. Very helpful staff and reasonable but not great breakfast",4,2018,10,12
227,"CONVENIENT, AND A VERY GRACIOUS STAFF","Having just returned from Ireland, I am happy to suggest the Drury Court Hotel to others.  Price is moderate, cleanliness of hotel was A+, and the staff went above and beyond to be sure that everyone's wishes were taken care of.  SUPERB!",5,2018,10,12
227,"Great location, accommodations  and service! ","This hotel is in a great location and safe part of town. The staff were super friendly and helpful- took the time to really go through the map with us and help us plan our time in the city. Super convenient that they have the bag check for early arrivals or late departures and always someone at the desk to help. The rooms were nice and it was super convenient that they had usb plugs so this way travelers can use their adaptors for other uses simultaneously while their phones are charging. Rooms were also equipped with coffee makers which isn’t something you find everywhere in Europe. Overall, very convenient location and amenities, great accommodations and a friendly staff. ",5,2018,10,07
227,Very good hotel and in the heart of Dublin,"We did not have the time to explore all the great attractions and history so close by, but everything is in close walking distance.Hotel staff was very friendly and very helpful with local restaurant suggestions, in addition to arranging transport to the airport.",5,2018,10,06
227,Great staff!,"When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted by a very welcoming staff!  Very helpful by providing us with area maps and how to get around.  The hotel lobby was nice and comfortable.  My brother, dad and I stayed in the apartment which was very spacious and clean.  Loved that we could get a 3 bedroom apartment.  The hotel is in walking distance to Charles Beatty Library, Dublin Castle and St Patrick’s Cathedral.  We ate breakfast at the Drury pub; I had the  salmon and eggs - very good.  ",4,2018,10,06
227,Perfect location,Perfect location in the center of Dublin.Very quiet during all night and no noise from the other rooms.          Various restaurants and pub around the  hotel.         Very warm and smiley welcome from the staff.          I will come again for my next travel.          ,5,2018,10,06
227,Super Location and fabulous Breakfast Staff,"This hotel has a great location for enjoying Dublin. Just put on your walking shoes and 'go'.The breakfast staff deserve special mention because they really give your day a delightful start. Bernard, Tais and Carolina were most helpful in explaining how the breakfast worked. They were friendly, efficient and added a great start to our fun days in Dublin. The ""Croque Madame"" breakfast special which I thoroughly enjoyed my last two mornings was exceptional. A return visit is a must :-)",4,2018,10,05
227,Convenient location.,"The hotel was very clean with a friendly, helpful staff. It is very conveniently located in the heart of Dublin. It is close to St. Stephen Park to have a nice walk. There are many restaurants and pubs all within a few blocks. I would stay here again when I come back to Dublin.",4,2018,10,05
227,Great location,The staff at the hotel are fantastic and the location perfect for being able to walk to everything. It feels safe and the rooms are well glazed so street noise is not a problem. We were in the back part so that helped too.The breakfast in the section next door is very good value and yummy. the staff in there are friendly and courteous too. We were able to store luggage on arrival till the room was ready and also on our day of departure which was very helpful.,4,2018,10,04
227,Great Place To Stay,We stayed in the apartments which are very roomy with a full kitchen. Great for families. The apartment was very clean and the staff extremely friendly and helpful. The location is excellent for City center and Temple Bar area.  Highly recommend and hope we can stay there again!,5,2018,10,03
227,Two day stay in Dublin.,"Great location.  Just go out your door and you can walk to may pubs, shops and restaurants.  Front desk very helpful and provided a to-go breakfast due to an early tour.  Was able to check in early.  Nice breakfast. Felt safe.",4,2018,10,02
227,Great location!!,Drury Court is a great location in the heart of the city. Rooms were expansive as was the shower. Breakfast in the morning was filling. The staff was helpful and friendly. I would definitely stay here again. ,5,2018,09,30
227,You can walk everywhere!,"Clean room, nice and service-minded staff and very central location. Taxi from the airport costs about 30 euros. Around the hotel you will find good restaurants, bars and shopping streets.You can walk to everything!",4,2018,09,29
227,Great central accommodation with wonderful staff,"As most reviewers have reported for Drury Court Hotel, it is very centrally located and the staff is wonderful. We stayed in a 2-BR apartment last week and had everything we needed for our 2 day stay in Dublin; highly recommend!",5,2018,09,28
227,Very comfortable and clean,"Hotel staff friendly and knowledgeable. 
Loved staying here. Beds very comfortable. 
Breakfast was not included in our room rate but was reasonable and very generous  portions. Would definitely stay here again. ",5,2018,09,26
227,Surpassed my expectations,"This 3-star hotel was a lot nicer than many 4-star hotels that I've stayed in.  The furnishings are a bit dated but the large room and bathroom were immaculately clean, comfortable, and quiet.  I loved the in-room tea service, the downtown location, the various safety mechanisms in place.  Location was perfect ... close to everything! 
Everyone on staff was friendly and knowledgeable.   Would definitely stay there again, and recommend to other travelers.",4,2018,09,24
227,Nice and safe,"Good location, walk distance to main interesting points of Dublin.Breakfast OK, I was in the first floor and it was a bit noisy.Could have other options in terms of linen ( there is only duvet).Friendly people at restaurant, reception just OK",4,2018,09,20
227,Hotel would be a 4* if they had their own restaurant,"The hotel is a very good modern standard, they partner with the bar, which is where you can have your breakfast and dinner and bill it to your room.  Rooms are of a high standard and have all the mod cons, usb power ports and plenty of them.  Beds are very comfortable and the rooms are clean.  Only thing missing is AC, but it's Ireland so that's not really an issue.  I have been in 4* that are not as good as this hotel.  Food in the bar/ restaurant called P-Macs is a great standard.  The staff in the bar and hotel reception are so friendly and helpful, you just have to love this place.  I will be back as I will start to use this hotel for my weekly business trips. Well done and thank you all at this hotel.  Highly recommended.",4,2018,09,20
227,"Nice Hotel, Wonderful Staff","This review is about our experience at the Drury Court Hotel, which was as much about the staff as the property.  The hotel itself is very nice.  It's clean and comfortable, with a small but functional bathroom.  It does not have air conditioning, but with the temperature in the mid-60's, it certainly wasn't needed.  We asked for a room in the back of the hotel on a higher floor, as I had read that it was quieter there.  And the room we had was on the 4th floor in the back, which was perfect. The windows do block out the noise, so even if you want to take a nap during the day, you can have relative peace and quiet.
But as nice as the hotel was, the staff was amazing.  My wife and I arrived from an overnight flight at around 9:30am.  Our room wasn't ready (which is expected), so they checked us in, stored our bags and gave us directions to a cute cafe to get some breakfast, with a promise to call us as soon as they could get us into our room.  By 11:30am, we had finished a delicious breakfast, done a bit of touring and were in our room for a nap.  
For the rest of our stay, the front desk team couldn't do enough for us, giving us places to see, restaurants to have our meals and local pubs to have a pint.  They also knew how to work the website for the train system so we could book our train to Cork online without an address in Ireland.  And the hotel is centrally located, within walking distance to most of the things to see and do.
If you you're looking for a hotel that is comfortable, friendly, and right in the middle of everything, I recommend the Drury Court Hotel.",5,2018,09,19
227,Very good location,"6 of us recently shared their 3 bedroom apartment (2 doors away from the hotel).  We found the location to be superb, 5-10 mins walk to Temple Bar, Grafton Street, Stephen's Green, etc.  The staff were really friendly too.  We normally stay on Fleet St, but went here because it was cheaper, but I think I'll be staying here from now on.  Plenty of bars and eateries on the doorstep.",4,2018,09,19
227,Everything we needed for our stay,"We  stayed in this  Hotel for 3 nights  and  the Hotel  is very clean  and we had everything  we needed.

The hotel  is near  the local  tram and bus service.  we had a choice  to use the bar ( the staff  served  breakfast
there in the morning  )   the food was good  and the household staff  were great.

the only  ""drawback  ""  is that it gets very noisy  at night as the rooms  are  above the main bar  but at least its not all night.

the Hotel is a family run  Hotel   and all the staff  are more than helpful.

we would stay here again. a big thank you to all the household staff  and all the team",5,2018,09,18
227,Great Location in Dublin!,"This place was very close to Temple Bar area and great shopping.  Also close to pubs, river, sights of Dublin in the heart of old Dublin.  We had a small apartment which allowed us to prepare breakfast in.  Also had a washing machine (no dryer). ",4,2018,09,17
227,First Ireland trip,"Hotel recommended by friends and relatives that live here. Lived up to expectations. GREAT LOCATION. STAFF WAS FRIENDLY, informative and welcoming. Rooms are typical European rooms and clean. Great wi-fi as well. Central to most all tourist attractions and bus tour location. ",4,2018,09,15
227,3 of us in Dublin,"Ask the front desk, they are so helpful, sold us our hop on and off tickets, recommended restaurants, and handled a bag of laundry, excellent staff, great location, quiet at night for sleeping, lovely room",5,2018,09,14
227,"Great Location, Clean Boutique Hotel & Lovely Staff!","I booked this place last minute when the hostel I was staying at didn't work out. Had to split my 2 nights between their apartment and double bed hotel room and both of them were well-decorated, clean, and spacious. The staff was really lovely and helpful. I had an early morning day tour on my 2nd day so forgot to give the apartment keys and move my luggage to the other room but they were very accommodating and moved my luggage for me. The location is amazing - you're right in the heart of The Creative Quarter so there are some great restaurants/pubs that are visited by both locals & tourists. The only thing that comes with that is the noise though - I was on the first floor of the hotel so I could hear people out on the streets till late and construction in the building next door in the morning. No complaints though as this was expected...since it was a last minute booking I wasn't fussed about the rooms/floors. Also, the price is lower than other places around this area so great value for money. ",4,2018,09,13
227,Excellent value,My husband and I really enjoyed our stay. All of the staff were friendly and helpful.  Everywhere was clean. The location is good.The breakfast was good value. We would definitely return and recommend.,5,2018,09,13
227,Great Location!,Great location where you can walk to all the attractions and parks in the Temple Bar area.  Moderately priced and a decent value with respect to other hotels in the area.  Would definitely stay again and recommend to others,4,2018,09,13
227,Great Location!,"This was a nice hotel in the downtown of Dublin.  It's close to a lot of things to do, parks and shopping.  If you want to use the ""hop on/hop off"" buses, it's close to a stop.  The rooms were the smallest we've had in Ireland, but it is in downtown Dublin.  The Hairy Lemon is across the street and a fun pub to visit; the hotel also has a nice pub attached to it.  The breakfast was really good and the service, both at the front desk and for breakfast, was great.  If you get a lower level room, expect some noise from the pub, but it wasn't that bad.  It is a bit pricey, so consider that.  Not a bad hotel choice.",4,2018,09,10
227,Exceptional place to stay!,"This place is 5******* star all the way in everything they do .The experience starts st front desk where they help with your recommendations .The wait staff is very attentive & courteous. One of the nights we opted for 3 course meal, it was everything you could imagine. . Food is excellent ! Can’t wait to come back next year.   ",5,2018,09,09
227,Family Trip,"Very nice hotel in a great location, walking distance to just about all attractions and on a quiet street. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Rooms were a bit small but was expected as we are from North America where rooms tent to be larger.",4,2018,09,06
227,Ideally located but choose ‘room only’ stay ,"This hotel is ideally located in the city centre, surrounded by a good choice of restaurants. Staff are very pleasant. The bedroom is comfortable and nicely decorated.  By contrast, the breakfast room is dark and dismal and the buffet unappetising. For example, fruit was presented in small, separate bowls of sad looking grapes, strawberries, melon and pineapple. Staff could not compensate for this despite their cheery disposition. I was under time pressure, otherwise I would have gone elsewhere for breakfast. I noted several better options on nearby streets. ",4,2018,09,05
227,Good Location,Stayed here in August 2018 - Great Location next to all the bars and restaurants in st Stephens green area and Temple Bar. We had Breakfast which was served in a bar next door which felt abit separate to the Hotel. Staff very friendly on reception and helpful ordering a Taxi. Booked it quite late so did think it was expensive for 1 night and thought it was overpriced for the room but probably paid the price for being in the middle of August and late booking!,4,2018,09,04
227,Great hotel,"Fabulous location, excellent service and friendly staff. We had the family room which was perfect for 3 adults sharing. Far more generous than other city hotels we have been staying at. Highly recommended.",5,2018,09,03
227,august vacation,great location and very friendly staff. Room hot as hotel has no air or fans for summer stay. This was a unusually hot summer. However with global warming Ireland has been getting better and better weather in the summer and will have to improve confort of hotels with airconditioning.,4,2018,09,02
227,Right in Temple Bar,"This hotel, is well situated with nearby offsite parking that they give you a break on.  The rooms are clean and neat and the staff is very helpful.  The hotel is situated close enough for a drunken stumble home but not so close to the center that you hear all of the partying noise.  There is a trendy pub across the street.",4,2018,08,30
227,Should be 5 stars but...,"Positives: front desk staff are A+ going above and beyond (with a real smile) to give tips for restaurants, theater, siteseeing. Rooms are clean and locations smack in the city.

Negatives: no refrigerator in room. the biggest for us was the bar underneath. They told us it would stop at 1 at the weekend but it was well past 3 in the morning before they stopped their hooley out side our ""quiet"" room. Heard someone else saying the same at front desk the morning when we left. 

Still worth it for service and location. Just ask for a high room if you don't sleep good.",4,2018,08,30
227,Comfortable and Clean," Nice boutique hotel situated in a busy area but because of that close to everything.Trinity college is a short walk away. Beds are extremely comfortable with nice linens. Nice shower and exceptionally friendly staff. ",4,2018,08,29
227,Great experience! ,"I had 24 hours to see Dublin on a layover and this hotel provided a great base. The location can’t be beat - right next to so many bars and restaurants and shops and a short walk to museums and tourist attractions. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. The room was a little small, but the price was right for it.  ",5,2018,08,28
227,"Great value, but noisy...","We stayed in the apartment section and the apartment was well outfitted, with two small bedrooms and a shared bath a small kitchen and living area. It worked well for four people. The location was phenomenal, people were helpful and the apartment was clean. The only draw back was the street noise from the bars below, and that’s to be expected in this location. Would stay again with earplugs. ",5,2018,08,28
227,Great for Our Stay,We stayed in the apartments next door to the main hotel but the staff was super helpful.  The 3 bedroom apartment was great for space and very nice clean bedrooms.  The kitchenette however was tired and a little scary (no manual for the combined washer/dryer so I wasn't willing to try it no matter how badly we needed clean clothes) so we did not use it. The location is great - very close to great pubs and restaurants and main parts of Dublin.  There is no AC so only open windows and one night there was a row with some guys sleeping in the alley below that got very loud.  But all in all this was perfect space for our family to spread out at the end of a long trip!,4,2018,08,27
227,Perfect adress to visit and also relax,"Very good hotel, not noisy. Close to the Airlink Express line 757 and also a  tram station. Lots of nice pubs and restaurants in the area, as well as many tourist attractions. The staff  was perfectly friendly and helpful. For the next visit we will book here again. ",5,2018,08,27
227,All of them are good,"Staffs are very kind !! They gave me some information about transportation ....  Room is clean  This hotel is very close to city center , so you can walk . And there are lots of restaurants , bars, and shops, so it is convenient location  とてもスタッフの人がいい感じでトラブル起きても丁寧に対応してくれました！英語苦手でも頑張って伝えれば大丈夫ですよ！！シティーからも歩いていけるし、治安もいいところです。周りにはたくさんお店やレストラン、バーもあります。スタッフに尋ねたらいろいろ教えれるかもしれないです。",5,2018,08,25
227,Comfortable Boutique hotel in a good location,"This hotel was well placed, walking distance to many of Dublin's attractions.  It was small boutique hotel but had most of the requirements.  Friendly and helpful staff.   The breakfast was simple but good.",4,2018,08,24
227,"Nice value, clean and comfortable","In a good area for bar hopping and nightlife.  Room was very comfortable, parking right around the corner.  For the price this hotel was perfect for our one night in Dublin.  I would definately stay there again!",4,2018,08,24
227,Charming room - great location,"This was a nice hotel with a great location. Our room was decorated with lovely green and gray colors. Beds were very comfortable, bathroom was large. The hotel staff was very friendly. I would stay here again. I think we paid $310.00 in summer. Parking was nearby. Only negative no AC, but they did have a nice fan in the room.",5,2018,08,24
227,Wonderful place to stay in Dublin,I can’t express how friendly and helpful the staff at the Drury were to us not only while in Dublin but also before we arrived.  This being our first time to Ireland I emailed them several times with questions and looking for advice.  They always got back to me asap even with the time difference.  We will definitely be back for another stay at the Drury!  They had even left a bottle of wine with a lovely note wishing us a happy anniversary in the room.  Thank you to the staff for making our trip wonderful!  ,5,2018,08,23
227,Great location,"Great location in the heart of it all.The staff were super helpful, that makes all the difference!! Unfortunately the prices in Dublin are quite expensive and August is high season.  The rooms were nice and spacious.",5,2018,08,21
227,Perfect location - amazing service!,"We had a fantastic 2 night stay in the hotel for our anniversary trip from London to Dublin. It’s perfectly located in the city centre, a stone’s throw from everywhere worth going in Dublin.
The staff were super polite and helpful the whole time we were there, always saying hi and making sure we had everything we needed.
Room was perfect for what we needed and really quiet considering how smack bang in the city centre we were. For a central Dublin hotel, the Drury Court is by far the best value you’ll get and always recommend it to those travelling to the city.
Thank you Emma and team for a fantastic stay - can’t wait to be back!!",5,2018,08,20
227,Rather excellent place to stay with a large family!,"So 4 children (plus 2 parents) on a trip across Ireland, staying in 6 hotels over 7 days. We were able to start our holiday in sanity and peace because of this very generous hotel in a brilliant location. Everything was clean and pleasant and well set out. The suite of rooms flowed beautifully. I loved the sittingroom (where there was more than enough space for all of us). The beds were comfortable and there was loads of space for all our stuff and the baby's cot. 
One of my favourite things was that the staff were not only friendly, but actually helpful.  We had a problem with the water and they sent someone to see to it immediately and when a similar problem recurred one of the staff members came up to our room within a few minutes and personally sorted it out with us. I was impressed as we were leaving the next morning and they didn't just write it down for the future to be fixed. 
My other favourite thing was my husband happening to mention that many hotels in Dublin are a bus ride outside the city, but we were able to walk from our hotel to all the places we wanted to go. We had a good time in Dublin and found it to be a great hotel.",5,2018,08,19
227,Excellent Location within Dublin City South.,"This older but updated hotel came through with everything we asked for.  Our stay was in mid-July, 2018.  Ask for an upper floor for quiet sleeping.  Unlike many hotels this one had a fan which saved us on warm nights.  It is within walking distance of most major historical sites as well as great pubs &  restaurants.  For seniors, it is a safe location and the staff is extremely helpful as well as polite and desirous to make your stay a memorable one.  You would never know there was a pub attached unless you walked by it at night.  It transforms into the breakfast room in the morning.",4,2018,08,19
227,Clean and comfortable room in excellent location,"We were very pleased with our stay at the Drury Court Hotel in Dublin.  The location could not be better- central city, walkable to most things we wanted to visit.  The room was clean and comfortable, staff was very friendly and helpful.  We had a triple room that was not street-facing.  It was quiet and did not seem to attract street noise, in spite of the central location. The price we got was reasonable and lower than other similar accommodations in the city. I would definitely stay here again and I highly recommend it to others.",5,2018,08,18
227,Great location!,"I spent August 5-7 here.   Fantastic location within walking distance to everything!  Everyone that works here are so very helpful!  I felt like I was coming home at the end of each day!  There is construction going on next door, I slept with my windows open as it was warm when I visited.  The beds are very firm so that may be an issue for some.  Room equipped with a fan and kettle.   Bathroom perfect for me.  No outlets in bathroom ladies.  I had no issues.  I walked to Temple Bar, Trinity College, Dublin Castle and Ha'penny bridge.   I had a fabulous time and will be returning!  Check out the Hairy Lemon Pub while here.  A no charge ATM located at the supermarket one block away.   ",5,2018,08,16
227,Staying in Dublin,"The hotel was decent.  I liked the location because the hotel was on a quiet street but good restaurants and pubs were easily accessible.  The front desk staff was terrific - friendly and helpful.  Our room was nice and clean but a little smaller than I was expecting - especially given the price for the room.  Wifi was good.  Only complaint, and we discovered this too late, was that across a narrow street outside of our window was a building that was undergoing renovations/construction.  We were awakened at 6:30AM to the sound of work going on.  That was a negative particularly given the price of the room.  Overall we had a good experience and, if ever in Dublin again, might consider this hotel.",4,2018,08,15
227,Dublin City Tour,"I stayed in the Drury Court Hotel this summer as part of my Ireland vacation. The hotel was centrally located and walking distance to Grafton street, Trinity College and many more sights. It is surrounded by a number of wonderful pubs and restaurants. ",5,2018,08,15
227,A Motel 6 without a/c,"Great location. That’s why we made the mistake of booking this worn out dump. Well, that and all the better hotels were full. No a/c, which is needed in the city.  Typically, a Motel 6 is in better shape, and the photos and reviews on Hotels.com are complete b.s.  If this place was anything like a three star and it’s photos we’d be fine with it. It’s not. The real treat is the huge construction project across the alley, which means almost ALL rooms in this dump face the site. Why bring an alarm clock, right?

In short, guest reviews on Hotels.com are 4.4 out of 5.  Complete and utter nonsense. At the very best maybe 3 out of 5, based solely on location, and assuming you don’t mind construction noise and visuals, and ignoring the fact the place is a stupidly over priced dump. 

Argh!",2,2018,08,11
227,great location,"Close to virtually everything, 5 minutes from Grafton St., tons of pubs like Hairy Lemon, McDaid's, Neary's & Bewley's, not too big, but very clean, & excellent staff. Not luxurious but more than basic, and quiet!! Would go back.",4,2018,08,11
227,Nice hotel in great location,"We had weekend break in Dublin last weekend and stayed at the Drury Court Hotel. The hotel is in a great location near St Stephens Green, you can walk to many local attractions easily and the bus stops are very close too.  There are plenty of bars and restaurants nearby too.  The hotel itself was very comfortable and clean, and hotel staff exceptionally friendly and helpful. We were on the second floor at the side of the hotel and were not bothered at all by any noise from the street.  We would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay there again!",4,2018,08,11
227,Drury Court Hotel,Perfect! Extremely comfortable and quiet. The reception was exceptionally helpful and friendly. Drury Court is very convenient for restaurants and shops. The Dublin Airport shuttle bus is within 10 minutes walk. ,5,2018,08,11
227,Nice hotel: will stay again,"Perfect location close to all the major attractions and tour departing points. Staff is nice and friendly. Blah-blah-blah to reach 200 minimal characters, required by this site: blah-blah-blah again...",4,2018,08,09
227,Guy's review,"A personal call before check in. Restaurant next door for breakfast was very good quality and service. I happened to leave some personal garments in the closet when leaving and was promptly notified , very pleasurable interaction/ service in general. Great location really.

227,EXCELLENT HOTEL!,"Excellent location to do Dublin on foot!  St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin Castle, Temple Bar, Trinity College all close by!  Very CLEAN hotel, very comfortable beds and nice rooms!  The breakfast was delicious too! The staff is super friendly and helpful. Loved this place and will definitely be back! Highly recommended!",5,2018,08,07
227,Lovely hotel!,"The hotel is in a great spot and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Even in a heat wave, the room was very comfortable as a fan was provided - and clean! it was such a pleasure to stay here.",5,2018,08,06
227,Great start in Dublin city.,"It is a place near to the centre of the city. You can enjoy the live music in merchants arch or temple bar. If you are hungry you may choose out of so many excellent possibilities.
And not at least the people who work in the Drury Court Hotel are very friendly.",4,2018,08,03
227,Great location.  Excellent staff and communication.  No Air Con,"The location truly can’t be beat!  Just a short walk away from Grafton Street, St. Stephen’s Green, Merrion Square,  Trinity College, etc.   

Here are the pros and cons:

We booked a family room which was a bit tight for the 4 of us.   Sadly when we arrived around midnight the sofa bed had not been made up and it was quite an ordeal to get sheets, etc. as there was only one clerk on duty.  I was tired and annoyed but they REALLY REDEEMED themselves. Not only offering apology the next day, but explanation and a bottle of wine and some chocolates.  They had last minute put us in another room as I had requested a quiet room and they had a cancellation and they were sweet enough to switch us but the housekeeping didn’t get to make up the bed before we arrived.  So just know that the staff is really lovely.  The only other negative is NO AIR CONDITIONING and it was HOT.  BUT ALSO KNOW that MANY hotels in Dublin do NOT have AC including The Clarence with is almost twice the price.   Chains like Radisson, Hilton, etc. will have AC but the location is not as good and prices much higher.",4,2018,08,02
227,Dublin Gem,"Great location, clean and comfortable accommodations, and friendly helpful staff made our stay enjoyable. We were traveling around Ireland and only had 1 night at this location but wish we had stayed here longer.",5,2018,08,01
227,Nice Hotel,"Like most places we stayed in while in Ireland, there's no air conditioning and the windows did not provide for much cooling. Even with the outside temperature in the 60s the room was warm. A fan was provided. The area was noisy, but closing the windows eliminated virtually all noise. The tub is quite high, and again like in most places we stayed there are separate hot and cold faucets in the sink.  Pretty good location, near the Temple Bar area and the Grafton shopping area.",4,2018,08,01
227,"Perfect location, wonderful staff and great value!","Drury Court helped to make our stay in Dublin perfect! The hotel is in a perfect location, within walking distance to everything. The staff was wonderful! They had helped us with everything from dinner reservations, taxis, to helping us purchase online tour tickets to save money. A special shout out to MateJ and Emma! Thank you for making us feel like we were a part of your family! I will definitely stay here on my next trip to Dublin! ",5,2018,08,01
227,Hen Party,"We stayed here 28th July. We were checked in by Matej who was fantastic he gave us plenty of info. Rooms were spotless and very spacious. 
Hotel is very central and would definitely stay again.
Plenty of Bars Restaurants round the hotel.",5,2018,07,30
227,Amazing apartments 5* !!,"Amazing appartments and location! The rooms were very clean and would definitely recommend. The only thing was that the WiFi broke and we reported this to reception and the staff were very apologetic and did their best to help us out. However, it had broke and they couldn’t get someone to fix it until the day we were leaving. However Dylan on reception was great and offered me and my family a free breakfast for the inconvenience which was lovely. It was great location just a 10 minute walk to temple bar which was great. Would definitely stay again ",5,2018,07,29
227,"Great location, value for 4, street noise.","This is the best place for the price for downtown accommodation if you need one room for a family of 4 without a car -- in walking distance of Stephen's Green, Dublin Castle, Trinity College, etc. It's a small hotel over a drinking establishment at night so try for a room facing the side street at the back if you need some quiet. (There are no views at this hotel.) A loud truck stopped here about 8 am daily during our stay (we faced the front street) and had street noise at night, even when on the 3rd floor. Go for higher floors if you need more quiet. Rooms are clean, roomy enough, fluffy towels, plenty of bath freebies. Staff here are excellent: always cheerful, helpful in recommendations and booking taxis. Breakfast for extra €10 is also excellent. All was great except for the small tv with twitchy remote and slammy doors. Recommend.",5,2018,07,28
227,Friendly staff! Nice location,"There is currently some construction going on next store but we did not have any issues with that. We were able to sleep just fine. There is a lift so no issues with the suitcases. I do not think that there was air conditioning but despite the warm summer, we were comfortable. The two best things about the hotel: the location, which is close to Grafton Street and St Stephens Green and the staff! The staff, especially Dylan, were very helpful and friendly. Close to pubs and some nice restaurants and not very close to Temple Bar areas so it was mostly quite.",4,2018,07,28
227,Sub par hotel in great location,"The hotel is old and lacks amenities. No fridge in the room and the beds are horribly uncomfortable. Towels and toilet paper are both cheap and scratchy. That being said, the location in Dublin 2 neighborhood and steps away from Grafton Street allows for easy walking to most visited places in Dublin.
Lots of bars and restaurants nearby. ",2,2018,07,25
227,this is so-so hotel that is overprice,"I guess the best thing that can be said about Drury Court is that it is centrally located. That's good. But: it is overpriced. Its bathrooms are small. Very small. Its amenities -- shampoo, etc -- are few and not particularly wonderful. And the noise level -- owing to building nearby of a possibly better hotel -- is huge. Don't know about breakfast, which is extra. But the place is cramped and the lobby is tiny.",2,2018,07,24
227,Great Location and Staff,"Hotel location was excellent and in walking distance to many major tourist sites, shopping, and places to eat. & drink.  Hairy Lemon just across the street! Staff was outstanding. and very helpful! Room was up to date and exceeded expectations.",5,2018,07,22
227,Loved this hotel ,"Excellent location. Close to good restaurants and Grafton Street. The room was small, but adequate and clean. The front desk staff are extremely helpful and welcoming. They really went the extra mile in making our stay a great one. I’d definitely stay here again.",4,2018,07,18
227,Irish ancestry,"Front desk was extremely helpful. They gave directions, always helpful with questions and worked to try and get lost baggage found.  

Some other people mentioned noise and it was true. Yet it did not change my rating since we wanted to be near things to do. ",5,2018,07,18
227,Wonderful,"This hotel had the best front desk staff - professional, friendly, knowledgeable.  The location is perfect - just two blocks off Grafton Street.  Lots of restaurants/pubs nearby. Easy to walk everywhere and we did.  Room was large, roomy, beds very comfortable and bathroom large.  Everything neat and clean.  Always love the in-room electric water pot for tea.   Would stay here again and recommend to others. ",5,2018,07,17
227,Friendly Staff,"Staff are friendly, provide information on sightseeing spots and also different means to go there. 
Hotel room is clean but is a bit stuffy as there is no air-cond. There is a construction site nearby so feeling safe to open the window. 
All in all, a hotel worth staying. ",4,2018,07,13
227,Great Location. Close to Everything. ,"This is quite a nice small hotel. The staff was wonderful and very helpful to us during our stay.  The room was very good and a comfortable size for two kids and two adults. This hotel was ideally situated for us. We walked all over town and were able to easily get to the historic sites with no problem. A few things to note for travelers: This hotel did not have a/c in the room and was a bit stuffy when we were there in the evening. There was a heatwave going on during our trip which was not typical for Ireland as we were told. The hotel did have extra fans for the room, which helped a good bit. The other thing to note is the nearby pub outside the room was pretty loud with club music thumping and went on late. This hotel is really a gem if you want to be close enough to walk to major attractions and areas but not be in a crazy and over-priced tourist zone. This was on a nice side street. There was a good pub the Hairy Lemon and a nice family owned coffee shop next door. Very nice people in and around the hotel. Convenient and worth a stay if you’re coming to visit the lovely city of Dublin. If you have time, grab a train or cab and head out to nearby Howth a little beachside town with some nice dining and great views of the waterfront. Not a far day trip from this hotel. ",3,2018,07,12
227,An excellent choice,"Fine rooms (we are family of 3 adults and stayed in two rooms), excellent staff, and a premier location. One suggestion: more fresh fruit at breakfast. Even better: include breakfast with the room cost. ",5,2018,07,11
227,Great option for family in Dublin,Not easy to find a reasonably priced room in central Dublin for a family.  Traveling with husband and 21 and 18 yr old--all very comfortable in the family room.  Clean and roomy.  Location is great.  Right in the heart of Dublin.  Highly recommend.,4,2018,07,11
227,Chet,"Right down town Dublin within walking distance to food entertainment & sight seeing.  Great staff comfortable rooms,clean and roomy.  Would stay again.
Staying two night in July. Easy ride by cab for 21 euros from Dublin airport.  Purchased two green bus tickets from hotel staff.  Hotel staff has a lot of knowledge about the area and made great recommendations for places and thing to see.",5,2018,07,09
227,Fabulous Location!,"Drury Court Hotel has the perfect location for your stay in Dublin.  The staff are very friendly, the rooms are clean and very comfortable.  We loved having tea/coffee and biscuits in the room too.  Would stay here again, highly recommend.",5,2018,07,09
227,Lovely place,The staff were cordial and helpful. The rooms were in excellent condition. The location was very convenient to popular sites in Dublin. The accompanying restaurant was of equal quality. We really enjoyed the friendly wait staff. The rates were reasonable. ,5,2018,07,09
227,Worst Hotel Experience Ever!,"-The room faced the main road and was almost directly above the hotel's corner bar. It was very loud each and every night; bright because of the street lights; and reeked of tobacco smoke from the smokers outside. The mornings were loud from construction next door and the incessant delivery and trash trucks. Trucks would idle right beneath the window and those diesel engines are quite loud. 

-The window needed to stay open to allow cool air inside, since there wasn't air conditioning. But, because of reasons listed above, the window had to stay open.  It was too stuffy and hot otherwise. 

-The green bed runner was filthy. I have photos of what looks like male body fluid. Totally disgusting. I was grossed out that it took me two days to notice it, so I probably sat on it the fluid stains. 

-The tub had black stains in it. 

-Some of the towels were dingy and need to be bleached or thrown out. 

I have traveled the world and even have lived in a third world country during my career. My stay at the Drury Hotel is the most unpleasant experience in all of my years.  The one positive were the friendly and very helpful front desk clerks.",1,2018,07,08
227,Great location!,"Perfect location right in the middle of everything you want to see! Comfy rooms, great showers, clean. Helpful staff. They reserved us a taxi, provided free maps and apples and helped solve any problems we had. Rates can be high, but the stay is worth it. ",5,2018,07,06
227,Apartments are Great Option for Families,"Our family of 5 recently stayed for two nights in a three bedroom apartment. One bedroom had a king size bed, one queen and one double.  The kitchen was well supplied and included a washer/dryer- when I asked for some help figuring it out as it has been 30 years since I last used a  European machine, the friendly staff immediately sent someone up.  They were extremely helpful with all requests.

It was a little noisy at night given it is in downtown Dublin and we had all the windows open due to the heat wave but that is to be expected.  The apartment was clean and well cared for and the price was very reasonable for the amount of space and the convenient location.  We would highly recommend it.",5,2018,07,04
227,Great stay,"This hotel was a great choice... Room was spacious and clean (corner room with windows on two sides was a bonus!), staff was friendly and helpful, and location was an A+.  We would definitely stay here again!",5,2018,07,04
227,Nice reasonable option,"Our family of 3 stayed here for 2 nights in a family suite room, which had a queen bed, single bed and sofa. The room was larger than we expected for something in Dublin. We were able to walk to Trinity College and St. Stephan's Green areas. Lots of restaurant options in the area. Breakfast was satisfactory. The hotel is a good basic option if you want to stay in the city.",4,2018,07,02
227,Centrally located lovely hotel,"I stayed at Drury's for several days in early June.  It's a lovely hotel and easy to walk to everything such as St. Stephen's Green, Grafton Street, Temple Bar, Trinity College, Ha'penny Bridge and the River Liffey, Dublin Castle, St. Patrick's Cathedral, etc.  I highly recommend a stay at the Drury Court Hotel at 28-30 Stephen Street Lower, Dublin 2, Ireland",5,2018,07,02
227,Drury court hotel dublin,"Myself and my relatives a party of 4 stayed here and have to say we were pleasently impressed. Staff were good especially Sofia. 

Rooms were clean and tidy and the breakfast is superb. Made fresh not like the usual buffet type english you get in most hotels. 

Good hotel and experience for the price. ",4,2018,07,01

227,"A Pleasant Surprise, Close to Many of Dublin's Most Popular Attractions in City Centre.","My travel friend and I spent a lot of time researching many hotels in Dublin. We kept coming back to this one because of the location, reviews and reasonable price.  It is well located, close to shopping, restaurants, pubs, attractions and transportation. It is not fancy, but it is clean, comfortable, nicely appointed, and reasonably quiet. It has all the amenities that most travelers will appreciate. The very pleasant staff is outstanding..  They answered our many questions and helped us book tours, reservations, make travel suggestions,get taxis. Our room was clean,quiet, well stocked with towels and cozy.  The neighborhood is nice. I would certainly  stay there again.",5,2018,06,29
227,First time in Dublin,Glad to have chosen this hotel.  Everything was very good.  Friendly staff.  Great choices for their breakfast.  Can't ask for a better location.  Close to various restaurants and shopping.  I would stay here again.,4,2018,06,27
227,One of the best hotels I’ve ever stayed in!!!,"Stayed at this hotel for my 21st birthday with the family and I can honestly say from start to finish it was perfect! The staff were incredibly friendly and knowledgeable about the area, and couldn’t do enough for us to ensure our stay was comfortable. The rooms were modern and stylish, with everything you needed for a short break. There was building works on the outside of the hotel, however this was never an issue. Location was excellent- only a 2 minute walk from the busy streets and tourist hotspots. Breakfast was also really enjoyable with a large option of items and a great help yourself buffet. On my actual birthday the reception staff bought me a bottle of wine with a lovely note wishing me a happy birthday- a really nice touch. Me and my cousin (after a big night out!) stumbled in at the early hours of the morning and the night porter was extremely kind and made sure we was ok. They even offered a taxi service from the hotel to the airport at a discounted price which was great, and also offered a 10% discount on our next stay (which I can assure you will be soon!!). Honesty for a city break to Dublin this hotel its perfect- thank you for making my birthday special!!",5,2018,06,27
227,One Night Stay,"Our stay was fine, rooms were clean, and staff was helpful and friendly.  If I were staying in Dublin any longer than one night I'd stay somewhere else (personally)... It was on a loud street and not as close as I would want if I were touring the city. ",4,2018,06,27
227,Staff is a gem and location is great!,"Cannot say enough about the staff and how helpful they are!  If you are a person who doesn't like to preplan (or even if you do) the staff's knowledge of attractions, restaurants, local transportation costs is really great.  The hotel is located in a great spot and many attractions are within walking distance.",5,2018,06,27

i definitely recommend the drury court hotel. 
all good overall. the staff are very helpful and friendly, the room was tidy and clean, the bed was really comfortable and the shower was good too (wich is quite important to me)
",4,2018,06,27
227,Good But Nothing Special,"I booked this hotel last November on the strength of the TA rating. While I was satisfied overall, there were a few issues where I was less than impressed. On the good side, the location of the hotel was a bonus with easy walking to many of Dublin's attractions (St Stephens Green, Trinity College, Grafton St, to name but a few). Hotel staff are excellent, very friendly and knowledgeable. The beds are so comfy and probably the best sleep I have had in a hotel for some years. On the down-side, we had a room towards the front (503) which was very noisy at night what with bars and revellers until the wee small hours (being very warm, the noise prevented us leaving windows open). There was also construction work going next door which added to the early morning noise. We did not take breakfast but had a meal on the last night in P Mac's. what a disappointment! I think the decor is supposed to be bohemian/shabby chic but in reality it's grotty crap with old furniture I would not pass on to a charity shop. As for our meal......it was pretty awful. I had the Italian sausage penne and my wife had the duck confit. My dish was cold around the edges and hot in the centre (microwave?) and the duck was completely dried up. I hope breakfast was an improvement. Would we return? Definitely not.",3,2018,06,26
227,Great location!,Close to everything. Very helpful and friendly staff.  Great breakfast. Would definitely return. We arrived early and were easily able to store my bags until check in. Very clean and comfortable rooms.,5,2018,06,25
227,"Great location, super staff","You can't find a better location for seeing the city. You can walk to most places of interest and the hotel is in an area with a lot of restaurants, bars and shopping. It's also quiet so when you're ready to crash, you can. The staff - Emma, Sophia and the young man from Croatia, in particular - were super helpful. They made great recommendations about what to do, where to eat and how to navigate the tourist attractions. The rooms are perfectly adequate and the cleaning crew is great. The breakfast is reasonably priced and convenient. A very pleasant place to stay.",4,2018,06,23
227,Great location,"Loved this hotel. We were greeted at reception by such wonderful receptionists, they were so friendly and really helped us with our stay. The location was perfect and we were able to walk everywhere. The food wasn’t great in my opinion but the rooms were lovely and we could hear very little noise.",4,2018,06,23
227,4 day stopover in Dublin,The reception staff at the Drury were very helpful and pleasant. Room was quite large and comfortable with great wifi. Was noisy at night with a room on 4th floor overlooking the pub next door. Only negative would be the bathroom toiletries (soap etc) were not replaced while we were there.,3,2018,06,22
227,An enjoyable break in Dublin,"We spent three days in this hotel which was placed for sightseeing. The staff were excellent , extremely helpful , personable and attentive. The room was clean and of a good size with good WiFi available.",5,2018,06,21
227,Great location and friendly staff,"The hotel was conveniently located in downtown Dublin.  The staff was friendly and courteous.  The room was clean, quiet and the bed was comfortable.  I found the duvet/ sheet to be inconvenient.  I would have appreciated a wash cloth.  Overall, I enjoyed our stay and would recommend this hotel.",4,2018,06,20
227,Great hotel for sightseeing in Dublin,Great stay .clean and convenient hotel .Very helpful friendly staff. The location is great. I only wish they would have at least provided coffee or tea to guests and maybe a muffin or scone. When you are traveling out of the country these little extras make a big difference when you are not familiar with the area. Also note that there are no vending machines in the hotel to buy a drink or snack late night so go prepared for that.,4,2018,06,20
227,Great hotel in Central Dublin,My wife and I stayed for two nights at Drury Court. It is centrally located close to Grafton Street. The staff are excellent. We were in a nicely appointed room. It was on the front first floor so noisy in the evening with the windows open. We had a great breakfast there. I would stay there again,4,2018,06,19
227,Proper hotel,We were in a bit of a bind and calked last minute. They had a twin room and a great price. It was very clean and large. I thought tge beds were comfortable. Our room did not have A/C but we didny need it. There was some noise from the bar. But once our windows were closed it didn't bother us. Also at this time there us construction next door which started sometime after 7 AM. Really nice people working here. Great location. Very clean. I would stay here again.,4,2018,06,18
227,Great location,"Comfortable room, clean, well equipped. Didn’t even need to use converter that I brought because they have USB outlets to charge our phones. Very helpful front desk staff.  Loved the location. Near tons of pubs and restaurants but not too noisy. ",4,2018,06,16
227,Fantastic Location for the right price!!!!,"The room was very well appointed. I had quite a few questions prior to checking in and the staff was prompt with responding to emails, they were even to quick to just call me to make sure everything was good to go. The beds were comfortable, the windows opened onto the street, which I appreciated because we in the city center and we were able to look down and see the up and down the street at night which was quite a beautiful site. Breakfast was included in the room rate and served downstairs in what I would liken to a speak easy of smoking room minus the smoke. Wonderful atmosphere and amazing service. We felt like kings and queens. We were walking distance to the corner store and many restaurants, we walked everywhere because of the location. The only time I needed a car was when I called upon Collins Travel (amazing btw) to take my kids and I on a countryside excursion. Will definitely return to this hotel.",5,2018,06,15
227,Great location and friendly staff,"I would't hesitate to stay again- staff was great about giving directions, organizing taxis for day trips and recommending wonderful restaurants. It was in a very central location and we could walk everywhere. ",4,2018,06,14
227,"Perfect location, great staff, excellent rooms","I haven't stayed in every hotel in Dublin, but I have no reason to try anyplace else.  The location is perfect.  Walking distance to all the great sites, restaurants and bars.  The rooms are clean and spacious.  Breakfast was excellent.  If you are in doubt, you should choose a rate plan that includes it.  Finally, best of all is that this is a family run hotel, and it shows.  The staff was uniformly helpful, knowledgeable, and they were all very intelligent.  When I come back, this place will be my first, second and third choice.",5,2018,06,14
227,Great Hotel in Dublin,"We tried to book the Brooks hotel but it had no availability so the Drury was our second choice.  It turned out that it very well should have been our 1st choice.  We could comfortably walk to virtually all major attractions, the room was very nice and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  Breakfast in associated next door pub was a great value.  For the price, you couldn't do better.",5,2018,06,13
227,Heart of Dublin,"Location is terrific you can walk to Trinity, Dublin castle St. Patrick’s cathedral St Stephens Green, Grafton St and any where else you wish to go. Lots of pubs and restaurants. Accommodations were very nice. Quite rooms and comfortable beds. Will stay here again. Check out Hairy Lemon pub across the street",5,2018,06,11
227,Not as Shown,"Although our room was not at all like the photos, it was clean and comfortable.  The street was very noisy but the double windows kept out all the noise.  Staff were friendly and helpful.  Breakfast (not included) was good.  Location was great.  Easy check-in and out.  A little pricey for the accomodations",4,2018,06,10
227,"Friendly staff, clean room and good breakfast.","In the middle of the city centre of Dublin. Very friendly staff, clean room, good breakfast. Fast check in and check out. From the Drury Court hotel it is very easy to walk to the shops, pubs and restaurants.",5,2018,06,09
227,"Great location , friendly helpful staff","Great location to everything, quiet, safe, staff very helpful in everyway.  Clean, beds very comfortable.

227,Wonderful hotel and lication,"The Drury Court Hotel is walking distance to quite a few restaurants and a lovely indoor shopping mall. Only a short walk (7 minutes) to a great Disney store and gelato. :)

The staff here are friendly and helpful. They booked a pub crawl for us and called taxi service when needed. Also, there is no air conditioning, but there is a fan in the closet that worked very well. 

The room is very comfortable and is a very nice size. Cleaning service was wonderful. The only difficult in the room is a very high sided tub, which might be difficult for an older person to step in and out. 

We would definitely stay here again!",5,2018,06,06
227,Comfortable Hotel in Great Location,"Seven of us stayed for 4 nights.  The reception desk is manned round the clock by staff who could not be more helpful and had an excellent knowledge of Dublin.  Bedrooms are large, comfortable and well equipped.  The adjacent bar bistro, P. Mac’s can be accessed directly from the hotel for breakfast which is charged to your room.  As a bar bistro it has a great atmosphere, including private booths, and amazing choice of drinks and an interesting menu provides a choice for tastes.  Apart from breakfast every day we ate twice in the restaurant as well.  The hotel location is ideal for central Dublin with most sites within an easy walk or accessible by bus.  It will be our first choice next time.",5,2018,06,05
227,Weekend stay,"We spent the weekend here and the rooms were fine. 

Rooms were clean and staff were very friendly.

227,One overnight in Dublin,Always love staying here. It’s always clean and mostly quiet. The staff are so friendly and helpful. Not to many places you find that in. It’s really near to St Stephens Green and Grafton Street. I have booked again for another overnight stay in the summer. ,5,2018,06,03
227,Positive Experience,"The staff were very helpful to individuals who are not familiar with the layout of the city by providing maps and tips on locations to visit. They even printed out our boarding passes. If there ever was an issue, they immediately addressed it until resolved. Greatly improved my first time experience in Dublin. I'm",5,2018,06,02
227,Great Location!,"Great location - walking distance to most things we wanted to see, yet not on a main street.  Friendly staff, large, clean room,  great breakfast in adjoining pub.  Highly recommend for those wanting to see Dublin by foot.  ",5,2018,06,01
227,We recommend the Drury Court Hotel,"We liked the Drury Court Hotel.  We were there from May 14 through May 20, 2018.  The location was perfect, central for us, and we could walk to many sites.  We reserved a family room for 6 nights. The hotel did not have a lobby, but a very small sitting area.  All the staff that we dealt with were helpful and courteous.  We sometimes asked for a cab to be called, but there were plenty of cabs coming down the narrow street.  Breakfast was served in the pub next door.  Breakfast was not luxurious but was more than adequate.  A hot cooked breakfast was included.  
We had a double bed, and a single bed, and a couch.  We enjoyed this room.  It was clean and well furnished.  We had an easy to use safe which was large enough for a laptop.  
The windows were wonderful.  They were triple glazed and kept the room quiet.  There was no excessive pub noise, even though we were next door to a pub.",4,2018,05,30
227,Ok visit,Location is good...however room was shabby. It really needs to be painted and maintenance on the room. There is also construction across the street which was very loud. Wasn't impressed with breakfast at pmacs...I'd suggest going elsewhere.,3,2018,05,30
227,Superb location,The Drury Hotel was a small boutique hotel in the center of Dublin.  Reception was accommodating and helpful.  Rooms are small but clean.  Coffee and tea provided in the room.  No refrigerator or mini bar but plenty of cafes in the area.,4,2018,05,30
227,"Friendly, Huge Room, Great staff","Very impressed with Dylan and Katarina so helpful and friendly, location was great and room was huge and very clean.

Opposite two pubs and great cafes nearby, windows are triple glazed so you don’t get any noise from street",5,2018,05,30

227,Four days in Dublin for the first time,Comfortable unpretentious hotel. Well placed for central Dublin. No lounge so use attached pub which is very popular at night. Good breakfast. Very helpful and friendly staff. Vending machine for extras on second? floor which we didn't find until leaving. (We should have walked down the stairs and seen it).,5,2018,05,25
227,Nice and Central,"First, our room had plenty of room for two, it was clean, and it was quiet. Secondly, it was in a good central location. We walked everywhere we wanted to go including Guinness after a couple other planned stops in that general direction. Lastly, I dealt with 3 different employees and each were polite and extremely helpful. I would have no problem staying here in the future.",4,2018,05,24
227,"Great boutique hotel, prime location",Couldn’t ask for more at this hotel. The location is amazing. It’s within walking distance to most things you want to see and do in downtown Dublin. It’s not fancy - but that’s okay for us - we’re barely in the room when we travel. Rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable. I would stay here again. The staff is amazing as well!,5,2018,05,19
227,Lovely Hotel,Lovely rooms and always our first choice when staying in Dublin. Very well located and very friendly reception staff. Always very quiet and seems very well run and managed.  The entrance and foyer are quite basic but it does what it is supposed to do. The Drury is definitely one of the most comfortable rooms we have stayed in Dublin.,5,2018,05,19
227,Great location,"Best thing about this apartment - the location. Walking distance to most places and just 5 mins from Temple Bar. A little noisy at night even on the 5th floor but had exceptionally good weather so windows were open. kitchenette had plenty of tea/coffee/sugar but could do with a revamp - looking a bit tired & hob c1980’s (not that we used it!). Plenty of room for 2 couples, nice lounge area. Interesting mesh type balcony that seems popular in Dublin / not for vertigo sufferers :-D ",4,2018,05,18
227,"Convenient location, friendly staff","Very helpful and considerate staff at this hotel.  Location is very convenient for walking around Dublin.  Downside is two taps (one hot, one cold) in bathroom sink which makes it difficult to wash hands or face without filling sink.  Room size very good and wifi worked very well.",4,2018,05,16

Room not large but neatly laid out, clean, and comfortable.  Staff very helpful and friendly.  Location very convenient to sites, shopping, and dining.  The full Irish breakfast was good and restaurant had other options as well. There is some street noise from an adjoining pub but nothing that interfered with my visit or sleep.  You can spend a lot more money for luxury hotels but this one is a great value for the cost.",5,2018,05,15
227,Best value hotel in Dublin,"We've stayed in Dublin a few times. This is definitely the best hotel so far and excellent value. A great location, nice rooms and very helpful staff, for whom nothing was too much trouble. They could even suggest an optician when my husband broke his glasses!  A lovely hotel and would recommend it.",5,2018,05,14
227,Good place to stay in Dublin.,"First stay in Dublin.  This place served my wife, adult daughter and I well.  We were sightseeing tourists from USA.  Staff was excellent.  Close to some good places to eat, and convenient to see Trinity’s Book of Kells, bar scene was not too far, but far enough away that we did not have any problems with the late night street crowd noise keeping us awake as we would have if we stayed right at the Temple Bar area. Would recommend this hotel.",4,2018,05,14
227,Dublin trip,"Good apartment, staff was attentive and nice. Room needs to be cleaner and to have room in the bathroom to keep hygiene stuff.
Location of the Hotel was good.
It would be nice to let the customers know that the apartments are located in a different building.",3,2018,05,14
227,Lovely hotel close to Trinity college,"Visited here with my family in May for a one night stay. The hotel is in an area with many pubs and nightlife also it is within a short walking distance of Trinity College. The rooms were spacious and beds were comfortable and the beds actually had top sheets which seems to be a rare thing in Dublin. The bathrooms were spacious ,clean ,modern and beautifully tiled . There is construction going on nearby but we did not hear it. 
Not sure if it has air conditioning it was bit warm so we opened our windows and used the  fan in our closet .
",5,2018,05,13
227,Great,Rooms were spacious and clean. Location was perfect for the city centre. Plenty of nice little cafes easily within walking distance for breakfast  too. A bargain stay in Dublin compared to other city hotels!,5,2018,05,11
227,Comfortable stay in the heart of Dublin,The hotel is in a central location with many pubs and restaurants around. It is also a short walk to the pick-up location for many day tours. The old city can be a bit noisy in the evenings but the hotel rooms have triple glazing that blocks most of the noise.,4,2018,05,09
227,Good for location and service,"The location of Drury Court is great as you are able to get to some pubs and restaurants within easy walking distance.

Check in was smooth and easy with no issues whatsoever.

The room has tea and coffee and a safe, shower water was hot, there was no alarm clock in my room but plenty of storage space and the bed was comfortable.

Heaters work fine and parking is at the garage just down and to the left out the door.

Service was friendly and helpful and the staff was great.It is pricey for what get as far as the room and some minor aging issues but location is great.",4,2018,05,09
227,Great location,"Staying in Dublin and want somewhere to stay at a reasonable price (compared to other hotels - Dublin hotels are not cheap) then this hotel is a great choice. Great location close to shops, bars, sights and restaurants. Very friendly and helpful staff. ",4,2018,05,06
227,"Great location, quiet rooms","Great Location, quiet room and size of bathroom is fabulous. Just a bit pricey as it's EUR 120/night

Nonetheless I would recommend this Hotel to anyone who wants to be directly in the City Center and Close to Grafton Street / great Shops / Bars / nightclubs",4,2018,05,02
227,Comfortable quiet hotel in perfect Dublin location!,"Drury Court is a comfortable quiet hotel in the perfect location in Dublin.  All attractions are easily walkable - from Guiness Storehouse to the EPIC Museum, shopping streets, Trinity College and more.  Terrific breakfast place around the corner - Sasha Petite and wonderful authentic Irish pub across the street - the Hairy Lemon.  ",5,2018,04,30
227,Great Hotel in City Center,"Only stayed for one night, but it was in the perfect location to all the touristy areas. Super close to Temple Bar, Trinity College, China Town, etc. The staff was extremely friendly and willing to help with any issue I had. The room was spotless clean, and was overall a very nice room. The price of the room was also very affordable compared to the other options in the area. I would stay here again anytime!",5,2018,04,30
227,Clean no luxury and right price hotel,"Due to a business trip I decided to go to for 2 days to the great city of Dublin. Since I was going to be a very short period of time and although the city is very small, location was important. Also, because I was gong to be almost all time outside, the hotel was not important in terms of quality of de place. 

Looking and looking and finally found Drury. The hotel was very well located really close from everywhere and also at a very convenient 89 Euro per night price so I decided for it. 

I got to tell you that it was a great decision. As soon as you enter the hotel you realize it is a very simple one, no luxury at all but all rooms have card access, no guest is allowed in the rooms area because there is a door in the main floor you can only pass with your room card so you feel it's a secure place. Dublin is a very secure city anyways.

Room pictures in the site I booked were exactly the same that they gave me so I felt very well knowing they show what they have.

Also the front desk person that received me was very friendly made me some good recommendations and that night I found myself having a good dinner in the HAIRY LEMON a very nice restaurant that serves typical Irish food that was recommended to me for the front desk lady.

I think the fastest and more convenient way to get to the hotel is by taking the Airlink Express Bus (747 Rute) and get off in College Green & Temple Bar station. You have a screen in the bus that tells you what bus station you are so all is very easy! Go to Drury, pay less for your stay and enjoy Dublin with a nice and cold Guinness in your hand.",4,2018,04,29
227,Vacation Hotel,"We went from Adare Manor to Drury Hotel and we do not live in Ireland so do not really know the standard for rooms. The rooms were clean. The beds were great and very comfortable. But the pillows were flat and hard to sleep on. The staff is amazing, helpful, courteous and responsive. We were close to everything and felt very safe. ",5,2018,04,25
227,"Excellent location, lovely staff, clean and comfortable rooms","Perfect location close to St Stephen's Green, King St, Dublin Castle, Grafton St and all the sights of Dublin. Parking available right next to the hotel at a discounted rate. Rooms not fancy, but very comfortable beds and clean. Staff is lovely. Hotel was very quiet at night. Temperature was easy to control. ",5,2018,04,23
227,Great Location,"Drury Court was the perfect location. Surrounded by pubs and restaurants, we were walking distance to anything we wanted to do. Great helpful staff too.  Felt safe at all times and room was your your typical European size.",5,2018,04,20
227,Great Hotel!,"This hotel was perfect location, the staff was friendly and  very helpful. Our room was on the small size (two singles) but is expected in a city location. Very comfortable beds and largish bathroom made it very comfortable. Right next to P.Mac's which was a great for a nightcap or breakfast. Will stay again and highly recommend. ",5,2018,04,19
227,Great location and find!,Loved the location and the hotel.  Old and very quaint.  Very accommodating staff and very secure building.  Lots of action around the hotel. Great pub underneath. Good breakfast and value. Parking was a reduced rate.  Easy walking to shopping and venues. ,5,2018,04,19
227,Drury Court Dublin 9-15 April,"Had a 1 week stay at the Drury Court for a business trip.

Overall 5 out of 5!",5,2018,04,17
227,"Excellent location, helpful staff",We were really pleased with our stay at the Drury Court. It is very close to King and Grafton and a short walk to Dublin Castle. Staff were very helpful. Car parking across the street as well as a great pub The Hairy Lemon. ,4,2018,04,16
227,Great all round,"This hotel was excellent. Service was friendly, location was excellent and the price was very reasonable considering the quality and location.
Went as a stag group so had two rooms and both were good size.
The area is spot on for this sort of trip, lots of drinking holes nearby which are reasobly priced and only a short walk to temple bar if that's what you want.",5,2018,04,15
227,Fab friendly hotel,Had a great stay in this fab hotel   Beautifully clean spacious room. Wonderfully comfortable bed. Had delicious breakfast in Pmacs.  Hotel perfectly situated for exploring Temple Bar. Staff very friendly and helpful Will definitely return ,5,2018,04,08
227,Great Find for a Place to Stay,"After looking at many reviews of different places, we decided on this hotel and are so happy we did!  

The location is great.  It is central enough to walk to just about everything.  The furthest we walked was to Guinness.  It was about 25 minutes but doable.  If you need parking, the lot they have a deal with is right next door.  Super easy.  There is a restaurant attached if you want (and they will do ""room service"" from it if you need) and the Hairy Lemon is right across the street and is a wonderful pub with great staff and prices.  

Matej at the front desk was AMAZING!!  He was so full of information and recommendations and really went above and beyond to help us find dinner when everything closed early on a bank holiday and we weren't prepared for that, when we needed something printed and had questions about things.  

The hotel is secure and we really liked that.  

The room was spacious.  We got the family room with 2 double beds and a sofa sleeper.  It was a large room in comparison to the rest of Europe.  The beds could stand to be replaced.  They were a little saggy and lumpy in some areas.  But overall the room as well appointed and clean and we were very happy with it. 

I did originally book on a different travel website but checked the hotel website a couple weeks prior to our trip and found he bigger room for about 100 euro less so I booked directly and cancelled our other reservation.  So I would suggest doing a price comparison as well to see if you can get a better value booking direct.  

When we go back to Dublin we will most likely stay here again, unless we want to try something different in a different area.  

Highly recommend.  It's a diamond in the rough and proves you don't have to always stay with the name brands to get a good place and service.",5,2018,04,08
227,Great pick for a few nights in Dublin,"This was a great find for a few days in Dublin. The rooms were clean, the staff was friendly and helpful with directions and reccomendations. My only issue, and it was small was that i ordered a wake up call and we never got it. But i would still reccomend and return if i ever come back to Dublin",5,2018,04,06
227,Nice Hotel,The room was really nice and the The staff was helpful and friendly. The location is excellent and the primary reason we chose to stay there in Dublin. The breakfast was nice and offered a variety of food. ,5,2018,04,06
227,One night stay.,"Had the pleasure of a night at Drury Court this week. I booked a 2 bedroom apartment, which is directly adjacent to the hotel. It was room 42, on the 4th floor with a view out over the city. The room itself was pretty modern and stylish, 2 bedrooms, a bathroom complete with walk in shower, a fully fitted kitchen with all appliances and a large lounge complete with Tv. No qualms whatsoever with room.
The Drury, is just a short 5 minute walk from Grafton Street and about 8 minutes from Temple Bar, so very convenient. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Check in was 3PM and they have a room to keep your luggage safe, if you arrive early or if check out is a few hours before your flight.
Would recommend Drury Court as a place to stay in Dublin. You won’t be disappointed. ",4,2018,03,30
227,Just average ,Smaller rooms and a older hotel. Rooms were very clean. The staff were very nice and helpful. Great location to shopping and pubs. Parking is available at cost but there is a car park in the building across the street from the hotel.,3,2018,03,28
227,Perfect!,"I travelled to Dublin with my mother and we stayed in this hotel for just one night. The girl at the reception was very kind and helpful, she gave a lot of informations about the city, where to eat, etc and she booked a cab for us the following morning. Our room was very wide, with two beds, everything was clean (inevitable the kettle and mugs for the/coffee with biscuits). Breakfast is served in a nice pub-like room, good service and plenty of choice for both continental and irish breakfast. Location in almost perfect, very close to most of the city attractions (we never took any bus/tram, just walked) and in a quiet street with a good pub at the nearest corner (Hairy Lemon pub)..truly recommended!!",5,2018,03,28
227,A short break in DUBLIN,"Hotel in the center but expensive for a weekend. The room was quiet The electrical equipments are sufficient to recharge the PC, camera and telephone. But the breakfast is not very good and not fresh for the price we paid (the fruits are not fresh, and little choice) ",3,2018,03,26
227,Great location,Had a nice stay with my daughter.  Front desk personnel were always friendly and helpful.  Location was great - close to shopping and sight seeing.  Took advantage of the 3 day Hop On/Off sight seeing bus that took us to places a little farther away.,4,2018,03,20
227,Great stay,"Very clean and modern, staff is very nice and it is in a great location. It was a bit pricey, but we were also there during St. Patty's Day so we fell victim to peak pricing which is unavoidable. A pretty close walk to popular attractions like Temple Bar and Trinity College",5,2018,03,20
227,Great location; excellent value for money,"Stayed here twice recently and would have to recommend this hotel given its location, value for money and extremely helpful, pleasant staff. Rooms clean and comfortable. Walking distance from many of the main attractions in Dublin and surrounded by a number of good pubs and eateries. Looking forward to our next stay.",5,2018,03,19
227,Helpful staff w a great location.,"Staff was eager to help in any way possible. They let us check in a little early.  They as gave us recommendations and directions to restaurants.

227,Satisfied.,Comfortable hotel with very friendly and helpful staff . Good location for centre of Dublin .Rooms are a good size and comfortable . If travelling from the airport AIRCOACH is a good cheap option for transport as they drop quite close to hotel. Would recommend .,4,2018,03,13
227,Perfect for a Birthday getaway!!,"loved this hotel! Great location in the Creative Quarter - plenty to see and do nearby or to explore the City and surrounding areas. Friendly, helpful staff - great customer service. Good choice of hotel rooms and apartments to accommodate different group sizes. Apartment was lovely - wish we could have stayed longer!",5,2018,03,13
227,It would be a 5 except for construction next door.,We enjoyed the stay and we will definitely stay there again. Hopefully the construction next door will be finished by then. It is located caddy corner across the street from the Harry lemon pub and about 3 blocks from St. Stephens green,4,2018,03,07
227,Great location and great hotel,"Stop your research and just book this hotel. It is in a great area, great price, decent size rooms, and the staff is super friendly and helpful. They do have a construction project next door but they were not working while we were there due to the storm. If you are a light sleeper then ask for a room that ends in 09. That will put you on the other side of the hotel. I never had the breakfast there. It didn't look that great, just the basics. Go around the corner to the Metro Cafe. Great food and friendly and funny staff. If you meet Niles or his wife they are hysterical. 
I could not have been happier with this hotel. I will definitely stay there anytime I am in Dublin.",5,2018,03,07
227,Little Gem in Central Dublin,"Drury Court is an excellent value. Centrally located in Dublin and within walking distance of shopping, dining and entertainment. It's small and unpretentious. Clean, comfortable rooms. Few amenities. Definitely worthwhile, ",4,2018,03,01
227,Gem of a hotel,Great hotel and excellent location. The hotel staff were helpful and friendly and the room was surprisingly roomy with a comfy bed. Great if you are on business or a few days away as location is central without it being noisy. One of the best night sleeps I’ve had in a hotel away,5,2018,02,27
227,Great Location,"Great location with many Pubs, restaurants, all convenience stores, and even a pharmacy within blocks of the Hotel.  I stayed here as a Solo Traveler and safety/security is a must.   This is a very safe area to walk around alone, during the day or even at night.   Rooms are quiet even with Pubs right next to the building.   Loved this hotel and the morning breakfast at PMacs !",5,2018,02,27
227,excellent staff,the staff were fast and responsive to all our needs. rooms clean and comfortable. the resturant was good and the bar across the street the hairly lemon was excellent. historic sites just down the street and shopping within walking distance.,4,2018,02,27
227,MOST.  COMFORTABLE.  BED.,"I gave this hotel 5 stars because:
1)  it had the most amazing bed.  I travel a lot for work, and stay in a lot of hotels.  This bed was the most comfortable bed I've ever spent in while traveling.  It was firmer, and didn't have any indentations from previous guest.  I slept so well
2)  Emma at the front desk was patient and very helpful.  She spent time giving us recommendations for restaurants and looked information up online for us.  We felt very welcome.

I'm the type of travel that is only in the room to shower and sleep.  The rest of the time, I'm out and about.  The room was mostly clean, although some things were a little dusty.  Bathroom was clean, and towels and sheets were clean.  Location was a little further away from the bars.  There was a pub a few steps away, (Hairy Lemon) that had great food and traditional Irish music on Sunday nights....which was wonderful.  

The one thing i didn't like, was that we asked not to be disturbed for the day (declined room service), and both days we were there, the maid came in anyway.  

I would stay here again in the future.  Location is close enough to walk everywhere, but far enough away that it wasn't too loud.",5,2018,02,26
227,Went the extra mile,"We very much enjoyed our stay at the Drury Court Hotel.  Convenient to Trinity College where our son is spending the Spring semester, the accommodations were excellent, if a little noisy (rugby crowd for the Wales-Ireland match.    Most impressive was the staff who made several phone calls to recover two lost suitcases, as if they were their own.  The bathroom was spotless, shower strong and simple to use, with luxurious towels.  I would stay here again and I indeed we will as we return at the end  of the week.   ",5,2018,02,25
227,Sept 2017 Trip for Pleasure,"We enjoyed our three night stay at the Drury Court hotel in early Sept. The location was quite central with many sites within walking distance. There was a little noise at night from the bar/club attached to the hotel.

We had an issue with the maid service not locking our door after a cleaning (we found out when we got back from touring). The front desk was apologetic and gave us a credit for the error (thankfully nothing was taken).",4,2018,02,22
227,Great Location ! ,"Stayed here for one night and couldn't be happier with the hotel.

 The location is fantastic. Within walking distance of all the major areas and transportation links. 

The room itself was very clean, spacious and very quiet. The hotel staff were also so lovely. 

Definitely nicer than hotels I've paid a much higher price for in Dublin! ",4,2018,02,21
227,Friendly staff and great location,"We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel.  Alexa and the other front desk staff were so friendly and helpful - we felt right at home!   Our room was very nice and clean, bed was comfortable, and it was great to have tea and coffee in the room.  We went with the breakfast package, and it was excellent.  On the day we left they packed a nice breakfast for us to take to the airport as we had to leave early.   The location was perfect - close to plenty of restaurants and pubs, St. Stephen's Green, the Little Museum of Dublin (fabulous), Temple Bar, Trinity College and lots of shops.   Highly recommend.",5,2018,02,20
227,Fitted the bill,Booked for a 2 night stay . Hotel is clean and quiet yet sat in a great central location with many sights within walking distance . For a budget hotel was very pleased to have tea and coffee/ hairdryer provided too .,4,2018,02,18
227,Excellent choice,"Stayed for 1 night as we were coming back from Killarney, and wanted to see Dublin.  Location was amazing.  Hotel staff accommodated any requests. 
Rooms were a decent size and amazingly clean.  
Wish we had a few more days in Dublin to spend here. ",5,2018,02,18
227,Fair hotel,Problem with bathroom extractor fan. Reception didn’t know what to do. Changed rooms after a sleepless night. Breakfast is not buffet if it’s a cooked one. Had to make own toast. Tables are too low to sit at and chairs really uncomfortable. No bottled water in the room. Beds are very comfy. Near to everything. Very secure. ,3,2018,02,17
227,GEM in Dublin that I hope stays s secret......,"Looking for a quick answer to a one night stay in Dublin. Usually stay at Jury’s Inn but they were asking €180 plus....this popped up and the reviews seemed ok and location ticked boxes.... what an amazing place, from the start I had issues booking with my card while in NY ( not the hotels fault but my card). The guy at the front desk unbelievably quick with all my emails. I sensed it was a good option. On checkin, the right decision, great location, easy to fond, amongst shops, restaurants and bars. Redevelopment of hotel next door seemed to be a problem, until I got to the room..TRIPLE GLAZED windows. The room is spotlessly clean, amazingly fresh. Credit to the house keeping team. Went out for dinner, within steps, the world is at your feet. Great controllable heating, nice firm but not hard beds. Will go down as the best, uninterrupted sleep I have ever had on a holiday. Bathroom is ok, not massive but extremely clean and great shower. Breakfast downstairs is a triumph of delights. What a great experience, just have the full Irish. Truly wonderful service,,,,,, I left an item on checkout and within minutes an email reply. This hotel is simply PERFECT. Staffed by very friendly and helpful people.... 

I would love to say this place is awful, just to keep it a secret.

Trust me. Stay here. True Irish hospitality.",5,2018,02,14
227,beautiful hotel in a beautiful city,"This hotel is just top draw, big rooms, comfy beds, powerful shower and a bath which is a bonus, located plum in the centre more a less walk to most places quite easily so much so we walked 35 miles in 4 days :), staff very friendly price very good, nearby there is a nice cocktail bar called capitol just up the road on the corner lovely cocktails there :), loved the city from the jail to the Guinness factory, to all the lovely walks, pubs are brilliant, all in all a fantastic city will be back. 

p.s if you like a drink take plenty of euro's average price for two pints was 11-14 euro's unless u went to the student/ dive bars alot cheaper there :)",5,2018,02,12
227,Fantastic stay!,"Hotel in a great location, 5 mins from lots of shops, restaurants and bars and a further 5 mins to temple bar area. Felt very secure as you have to use your key card to get to lift area. Room was lovely, very spacious and plush curtains/bedding. Bathroom nice size and shower always hot and powerful. Staff were so friendly and helpful, even left a bottle of wine and glasses in the room as it was my boyfriends birthday. Deffinately stay again when in Dublin and recommend to everyone.",5,2018,02,05
227,Great Find,"I booked this Hotel for a Travel Fair I was attending in Dublin. The Hotel is located in a very central position. The Staff were extremely helpful and I cannot praise them enough, very professional. My room was very comfortable and very, very clean. Good Breakfast selection with a huge variety of top quality items. Restaurant staff were very attentive and very helpful. I always worry about travelling on my own but this Hotel has an impressive security system and the area surrounding it appeared safe. I cannot praise this Hotel enough.",5,2018,02,01
227,Ok,"A bit of a mixed bag. On the plus side, friendly staff, very good location, clean, reasonably priced, and decent breakfast. And the bed was comfy. 

But some niggles which mean this scored lower for me than I would have expected - but they are niggles which wouldn’t bother everyone. Firstly, the bathroom was tired and needed updating, and had a fixed shower head which is just a big irritant of mine (I have lots of hair and don’t always want to wash it, which is difficult without a removable shower head). Secondly, there were three mirrors in the room. And none of them were in reach of the fixed-in-place hairdryer making it very difficult to get ready. Thirdly, I could hear music thudding from the bar until after eleven which kept me awake - with an early business meeting this wasn’t very welcome. 

As said, niggles that won’t bother everyone and if you can overlook them then this hotel is a good three star bet for the reasons I set out at the beginning of the review. ",3,2018,01,31
227,Wonderful hotel ,"Very impressed with this city centre hotel. The reception staff from the minute we arrived were very helpful, welcoming and friendly. The room was modern, comfortable and Spotlessly clean. The accommodation staff are very friendly and helpful. Full marks, we have already booked our next stay. ",5,2018,01,30
227,Great location and friendly/helpful staff,"A small, modest 3-star hotel that enjoys a perfect location just three minutes walk from Stephens Green and which is spotlessly clean. Parking is in a multi-story across the road that offers hotel patrons discount daily rates of €12 which is extremely good for central Dublin. They also have an unusual arrangement with the pub next door (unless they're both owned by the same company) which is where customers are served breakfast. The breakfast are also very good and great value for money.",5,2018,01,30
227,Cheap and very cheerful,Room was comfy and clean. Secure as well. The location is fantastic! The reception staff were really helpful and very friendly. They have an agreement with a taxi firm - flat rate of 27.50 to the airport which was a bonus. Would stay again ,5,2018,01,27
227,Lovely hotel,"Great hotel. Staff very friendly. No more than 20minutes to any where in the city and plenty of restaurants and bars in the area for food and drink.

Tours and reservations can be made at reception which is a great help and food from the bar is very nice. Would highly recommend.",5,2018,01,27
227,"Good location, clean hotel, welcoming staff","The location is awesome, right at the centre of south city centre with lots of restaurant, bars and cafe around. The staff are welcoming and helpful, the room is comfortable
no complain about the stay at all.",5,2018,01,25
227,"Amazing trip in Dublin, made perfect by our choice in hotel!","Had a wonderful time in Dublin and had was so pleased with Drury Court!

I sent a few requests to the consierge staff before we arrived, and they all responded very quickly and professionally. I have to say, I didn't expect much with it being a 3* hotel.. but this was so much nicer than some of the 4 or even 5* had stayed in!
First, the desk staff were really helpful stowing our luggage and even called me to say our room was ready to check in early,

We were lucky enough to have a high floor corner room, and it was amazing. The room was spotlessly clean, spacious enough to really relaxing with brilliant street views and a lovely big bathroom. We even were lucky enough to have a complimentary small bottle of wine which my other half was very impressed with! 
The bed was amazing too, so comfy.. slept really well, very quiet at night. The street noise from the pubs was dealt with by the triple glazing. 

The location was a short stroll from our aircoach drop off, so didn't take long to find and was so close everything we needed. Right near beautiful St Stephens Green, at the top of Grafton street (excellent shopping) with Temple bar being a 7min stroll away. So perfect if you are playing tourist. Its safe, and everything you need is on the doorstep

Its located near some wonderful pubs too. Temple bar is great if you like the party scene, but if you are looking to converse with real Irish people and enjoy the atmosphere, music along with a pint of the black stuff then there are lots of options close by. Personal faves, O'Neils on Grafton, the hairy lemon just opposite and of course P Macs which is attached to the hotel! 

P Macs breakfast was perfect. We were lucky to get it included with our stay (Deals are better if you book direct!) and all staff were friendly and helpful. 

Many thanks to staff that made our visit so memorable, we will be back!!

227,Female on work overnight.,As a female on my own I particularly wanted to feel safe in the hotel and surrounding areas. I found the hotel safe and comfortable and the location was ideally central and safe. The room was quiet and warm (apart from the bathroom window letting in some noise and cold). Overall very happy. ,4,2018,01,14
227,Great hotel central location,We stayed here for a mini break to dublin after booking it based on TripAdvisor reviews. It was perfect great location we walked everywhere only using the aircoach from airport. The room was large and clean and had everything we needed. The staff are fantastic helping with maps and printing boarding tickets very friendly. The hotel bar was always very busy. 100% recommend this hotel.,5,2018,01,14
227,"Functional Accommodations, pleasant-enough Experience","The hotel's accommodations were functional and luxurious enough.  Also, I had an experience as a guest of the hotel that was pleasant-enough and un-distressing.  Consequently, I would recommend staying at the Drury Court Hotel to a number of acquaintances of mine.",4,2018,01,13
227,Excellent experience!,"Very nice and spacious room, all new and comfortable furniture. Very nice and friendly personnel. The guy who checked us in took his time to show us everything we needed to see on the map. The location is great, 5/10 min walk to the most important attractions in Dublin!",5,2018,01,12
227,City Centre location,"I have stayed here in a number of occasions while travelling for work.
It is great value for such a well located hotel. Now there isn’t a big lobby or hotel amenities it is only 100m from Grafton Street and close to all the places worth visiting in the city centre (restaurants, theatres etc).
The rooms are well equipped and functional but as there is so much to do & see around I spend very little time in the room",5,2018,01,12
227,Excellent location,"Visited the hotel over new year as a group of 6 and was very pleased with what we had booked. 
Rooms were posh,spacious,clean even if we didn’t spend much time there

Would definitely come back!!!",4,2018,01,07
227,Very Friendly!,"We stayed here while in Dublin for New Year's Eve, and had a very nice experience. All the staff were very friendly and gave lots of helpful tips on museums and pubs.

227,"Good location, very helpful staff!","It was my first time to Dublin and my first stay in this hotel.  The room was clean and spacious.  The hotel staff were extremely helpful, including showing me the key attractions and directions on the tour map; and trying to offer help to solve my wifi connection problem.    This hotel was located centrally to almost all tourist spots and shopping areas, it was just 5 mins walk to Grafton Street.  You wouldnt have any problem in finding eateries nearby and it was safe!!  You wouldn't get lost...",4,2018,01,01
227,Will definitely stay here next time I'm in Dublin!,"The hotel is brilliantly situated - close to St Stephen's Green and Stephen's Green Shopping Centre, and within 10 minutes walk of the city centre. Day tours also depart from locations within 5-10 minutes walk. They offer loads of information on what to do in Dublin and day trips across Ireland. The room had plenty of storage space, as well as a safe. They do a great breakfast, both continental and full Irish. The staff were great, and the hotel even has one of only four copies of the Book of Kells, if you don't want to pay to see it at Trinity College. Do give the Hair Lemon bar across the road a try - it's absolutely brilliant with great food, homemade lager and Darren, the best host ever!

No bar fridge in the room, but it wasn't a great concern, as we didn't spend much time there. The wifi was a bit iffy at times, and from the photos, I expected a small sitting area, which we didn't have. However, the rest more than made up for that",5,2017,12,31
227,Great location,"I stayed two nights here in December and really enjoyed it. The location is excellent, with plenty of bars and restaurants near by. It is in the middle of the city, so not what I would call quiet outside, however it did not interrupt my sleep at all. The rooms were nicely decorated and the bed was very comfortable",4,2017,12,20
227,Brilliant Hotel and Staff,"We stayed at the hotel for my birthday, and had a wonderful time. The hotel is in a great location, very central, and when we arrived Alexa on reception gave us some fab recommendations of what to do and where to eat/drink. I would definitely recommend the Guinness Storehouse, and the traditional Irish food at the Hairy Lemon which is across the road from the hotel is amazing! I was given a complementary bottle of wine from the hotel for my birthday which was such a nice surpise, the staff really couldn't do enough to help. I had a fantastic time and would definitely return. ",5,2017,12,19
227,Pre Christmas shopping trip,Great location and very friendly staff. Room was not ready when we arrived as it was before 3pm but we were able to use the Internet in lobby to clear emails. Lots of local info leaflets available in lobby ,4,2017,12,15

Bathroom was very clean and a great shower.",5,2017,12,15
227,Great hotel in Dublin Centre,You’ll enjoy your stay at this hotel. The staff is friendly and super helpful. The location is convenient to most major sites and attractions. All are within walking distance ... even the Guinness Storehouse was about a one mile walk. The accommodations were comfortable and modern and we enjoyed a high speed WiFi signal.,5,2017,12,13
227,"Wonderful staff, great location","The staff here are excellent, room comfortable and clean. Bed very comfy and good tv. Immaculate bathroom, good towels etc. The reception staff make you feel really at home and are so genuinely friendly and helpful. The location is top notch in the heart of the city. Window in bathroom could be replaced and I just felt the breakfast menu could be a bit more exciting but you are beside loads of lovely cafes so not really a negative. I would definitely stay here again!",5,2017,12,12
227,Great Location and very Comfortable,The location is great. Very close to Temple bar area and right at the center of the city. The Room well furnished an the beds very comfortable. The staff very helpful and nice. Dublin is a great city for having fun with friends!!!,4,2017,12,10

227,Great Hotel in a perfect location,We stayed for one night in the hotel's apartment room. We were surprised at the large size! It was perfect for a family of 5. They even had a washer in the unit which was amazing. The girl at the front desk was extremely lovely and helpful! I definitely recommend to anyone staying in the Dublin area!,5,2017,11,30
227,Great central hotel,My wife and I stayed at the Drury Court Hotel last Sunday and I was particularly pleased with not only the location of the hotel (very central and close to St Stephens Green) but the reception staff who were extremely friendly and helpful. Check-in was seamless and our room was a good size and spotless. It had all the amenities you would want and there is discount parking from a car park close by. I would recommend this hotel without any hesitation.,4,2017,11,29
227,Fabulous Location and Moderate Prices!,"A return visit to the Drury Court Hotel cemented our opinions and appreciation for this city centre find. The location is fabulous, the rooms offer full amenities, the staff is helpful and gracious. Although they do not offer the previous on site parking accommodations, one can park in front for check in and unloading.  Discounted parking is available within a block in a car park. I consider this one a great value and am comfortable recommending it. I've stayed nearby in much higher priced hotels where I found the service and rooms lacking in comparison.",4,2017,11,28
227,"Great Hotel, great location!","Stayed at this Hotel for a week while in Dublin.  Staff was excellent with directions and helpful suggestions.  The Drury is within walking distance of Dublin castle, Trinity College, St Patrick's Cathedral, Christ's Church Cathedral, Guinness brewery and many Pubs.  Would definitely stay here again!",5,2017,11,26
227,Jaw dropping,"Perfect location, excellent rooms and Staff that will literally go out of its way to make your stay wonderful. I cannot thank them enough for their professionalism and kindness. When we return to Ireland many things might change but one thing is for sure: Unanimously and undoubtebly we are staying at the fantastic Drury Court Hotel!!!",5,2017,11,26
227,A great find.,"Excellent location, right in the city centre, close to Grafton Street. 
The hotel staff were welcoming and attentive and were helpful in printing out our boarding passes for our flight home. 
The room was clean, spacious and warm and the beds were comfy. 
We didn't try the breakfast as the hotel was so close to Bewleys. 
We will be sure to use this hotel again on a return to Dublin. ",5,2017,11,26
227,A Value in the Heart of Dublin,"Our second stay at the Drury Court Hotel—and the experience was great again.  My husband and I stayed one night on this trip. The hotel is conveniently centered so we could walk to St. Stephen’s Green, Grafton Street shopping, and the Book of Kells at Trinity College. The staff is helpful and the breakfast was good.  Best of all, a stay at the Drury Court Hotel is an excellent value for what you receive for the room and the service.  I would definitely stay here again.",4,2017,11,24
227,Great location and good value in Dublin,"The hotel is in a fantastic location for touring Dublin and there are great restaurants and shops nearby. We stayed in a two bedroom apartment located in a separate building. Unfortunately the people occupying the flat above us were having a rowdy party...yelling, loud music and a large group jumping on the balcony. The staff was able to get things settled in about an hour after our call to reception. We appreciate the help in getting the noise to an acceptable level but I probably will not stay at this hotel again. ",3,2017,11,24
227,"Visit of 4 Days in Dublin, staying in the Drury Court Hotel","Drury Court Hotel in the centre of Dublin, great location. You can walk to all important cultural options. Great pubs for eating and drinking in the centre. Live Music during the day and in the evening. Relaxed people, open for discussions.",4,2017,11,22
227,Budget friendly hotel in the heart of Dublin,This hotel has a fabulous location right in the heart of Dublin.  You can walk everywhere.  The room was clean and had a comfy bed and good sized bathroom.  The front desk women was extremely sweet and helpful.  I was staying by myself and felt safe and comfortable   I will stay at this hotel for all my future trips to Ireland.,5,2017,11,20
227,Perfect stay in the heart of Dublin,"The hotel is a gem in the centre of bustling and busy Temple Bar. Warm and friendly staff, bright and comfortable surroundings and welcoming aspect, the room had double glazing so the noise and entertainment of the area did not interfere with sleep! Lovely clean tiled bathroom with plenty of hot water to have a bath at midnight! The restaurant was old fashioned and atmospheric with helpful staff and a great breakfast. No hesitation in recommending it! Will stay again.",5,2017,11,18
227,Perfect for our trip,The hotel is situated in a great part of the city allowing for quick and easy walking access to the majority of the attractions my wife and I were keen on seeing. The rooms are clean and adequately spaced for our needs as we spent most of our time in the city. Breakfasts are good. The staff however was the difference as we were checked in no fuss and the provided with recommendations and guidance that all panned out. Will def stay here again. Thanks for the great hospitality. ,5,2017,11,16
227,"Very nice staff, clean, comfortable, good location","By far the best part of this place is staff and location. The room was roomy enough for us, the bathroom was clean, the hallways were a little small and the elevator was a bit tight, but the stairwell was nice and large. The breakfast was good. They checked us in early, like 9am. The staff had lots of information. Not related to the hotel - if you need a bus good luck, there are lots available for a fair price, but it is an ""Irish system"".",5,2017,11,15
227,Great choice! ,"Great front desk staff very friendly and helpful, prime location next to the hairy lemon(seriously the best pub of all time)

Safe area, affordable, great shower pressure, kettle in room

Close to the Starbucks pickup location for Wild Rover Tours, also near lots of grocery stores etc ",4,2017,11,14
227,A good choice,"Upon entering the small lobby, we met lovely and very helpful staff at front desk.  We had reserved five rooms for the night.   They were very clean and well laid out with definite charm.  We all slept well, with good beds and quiet rooms. 
Would highly recommend and felt price was reasonable.",4,2017,11,14
227,Wonderful,"This place is just fantastic. From location itself to the staff, just amazing. The room was cosy and very comfortable to the point we almost slept in. The amenities available also were superb. Next time we will stay a lot longer. ",5,2017,11,13
227,Central hotel in Dublin,This is a lovely hotel. Staff in reception were helpful and friendly. Theres a copy of the book of kells in the lobby for you to have a look at. The room was beautifully decorated and clean. The bathroom was quite large for a city centre hotel. The bed was exteremely comfortable. The street sounds are blocked out by a great set of windows. A fan was located in the wardrobe if needed it could be taken out and plugged in. Breakfast the next morning was freshly cooked and not small. Staff here were also very chatty. This hotel is very close to Grafton Street and many other tourist attractions. i would recommend this hotel. I have already booked for my next overnight!,4,2017,11,12
227,Seriously great,"A terrific hotel, the staff first and foremost made the stay for me, to say they couldn’t do enough is an understatement . 

From the call I made the day before to the moment I checked out I had amazing service. 

Clean comfortable rooms, amazing breakfast and perfectly located. 

If you are visiting Dublin I can tell you that this is a great place to stay, a minutes walk from Grafton Street, 3 minutes from Trinity College. 

It is brilliant value too. 10/10 to all at the Drury from a very happy guest. I will be back.  ",5,2017,11,09
227,"Excellent location, good breakfast and friendly staff","The location is excellent, right in the middle of the Dublin life. The hotel staff is extremely friendly and always willing to help and answer your questions. The breakfast, although a bit limited in variety, is pretty nice for a very competitive price. The bed was very comfortable which helped mitigating the only downside of this hotel, which is the street noise. This is of course beyond the control of the hotel. They do have dubble windows but if you are one of those people that need absolute silence to sleep, this is not your place. Otherwise I would definitely recommend it.",4,2017,11,06
227,Very nice,"The staff was wonderful and very accommodating. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The hotel was located within walking distance to most attractions, shopping and eateries. Discount parking was also close by. ",5,2017,11,05
227,Great location ,"We stayed here on a Saturday night recently, for a short city break. Location is great, you can drop the car at St.Stephen’s Green Centre car park, and just walk around the corner to the hotel. Grafton St. Is just a stones throw away but location is quiet enough to leave your street window open also. We didn’t choose the breakfast option, as Bewley’s Cafe was something we wanted to do in the morning. Nice rooms, great location and good value. What more do you need in the city centre ? ",4,2017,11,05
227,Super,"The hotel was lovely, comfortable, clean and very convenient. The breakfast was great and all staff were very helpful, particulate Nabil. The staff had a very good knowledge of Dublin. Will definitely be back. We loved our weekend at the hotel. ",5,2017,11,05
227,Very Good location,"Very good location, near to the most important turistic spots of Dublin (temple bar; castle; trinity college), you can get to any of this places in less than 5min walking. Kind staff and good rooms, clear and comfortable ",4,2017,11,05
227,Wonderful place to stay!,"Spent 5 days and 4 nights in Dublin at the Drury Court Hotel with 2 friends, and we couldn’t have been more pleased! The hotel was lovely and clean, and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The location was perfect - there were tons of restaurants within a 2 minute walk, and lots of major tourist sites within a 10 minute walk or less. The breakfast they offered was also delicious (though it would have been nice if it had been included in the price of the room, but even so, it was a really good value for the amount of food you got.) It was perfect for our first trip to Dublin, and I would definitely stay there again! ",5,2017,11,05
227,Basic hotel with great location,"I spent 4 nights in Drury hotel with my family and I Would say that the main advantage is his location close to Grafton Street, Georges Street, St Stephen's green etc.

The hotel is basic enough but clean and quiet. towels were changed everyday and coffee and tea bags added on a daily basis. Same for soaps, conditioner etc.

We didn't take breakfast at the hotel as the area is full of different coffee shops and Irish breakfast are at the same price everywhere and we like trying different spots.

I would say that Drury hotel is a safe choice if you want a central and simple hotel. If you are looking for more than 3 stars is definitely not the right choice.",3,2017,11,04
227,Great Hotel with Great Location,"If you want a hotel with great location and price look no further that the Drury Court Hotel. Across the street is the Hairy Lemon Bar. Great authentic Irish food with a great pint of Guinness. It is located near all amenities. Taxis are plenty. Shopping is great and close. Buses and trains within 5 minutes walking distance. 20 minutes walk to the Guinness Storehouse Brewery and Store. Same distance to go to the Whiskey Distillery tour. There are restaurant, pubs, barber shops, coffee shops, you name it, it is there. 

The Hotel

It doesn't look much from the inside. The reception and staff were really helpful and gave us tips on daily tours. The hotel has been in service for approximately for 10 years. There are single rooms, double bed with single bed room, and apartments that could sleep up to families of 4 - 5. The rooms are really clean, cosy with complimentary coffee. Power is 220 V so you will need an adapter. If you are from the US/Canada go to Best Buy. This hotel will also loan you one for a small fee. Bathroom were really clean, modern and finished marble sink. I am 6' 2"" and was able to fit under the shower head and not having to bend at the knees. Best hotel in town.",5,2017,10,29
227,Solid in all respects,"Great location and a clean, comfortable room - staff was very helpful steering us toward pubs that locals like rather than more touristy fare, and the location is great both for exploring the City and arriving off the 747 Airport Bus, which stops five minutes away. Really solid experience and glad we stayed with them.",5,2017,10,27
227,Centrally located basic accomodation,"I knew we were too early for check in but they went ahead a check us in anyway. When we went to our room it wasn't ready so we waited in the lobby until 3pm and check the room again and still wasn't ready so we informed the front desk and was told it will be another 5mins. We waited 23mins after 3pm check in to have access to our room and I wish the front desk should've let us know when the room was ready. We chose the hotel for its central location and convenience. Our room ?108? had 2 beds a double and a twin. American size bathroom. The TV was so tiny it's as big as my laptop screen. Beds were comfortable lots of pillows, however it is a bit noisy our room facing the street you can hear everything. Breakfast was okay not impressed with the food, you had to choose from the menu continental breakfast or cooked breakfast and for 2 extra Euros you can have both. Overall, the staff was polite. The decor inside looks old and worn out. It is a good base no frills hotel to just crash in for the night. The hotel lobby is so small there isn't really any space to hang out. WIFI was good easy to access. Not one of the best hotel I've stayed in but you can't beat the location.",3,2017,10,23
227,"Great location, rooms, staff and cost!","Thank you for the great service folks, you made the stay fantastic! I had a few special requests and questions and the very helpful staff helped / answered very quickly. Love the spot in general and will stay there again given the chance.",5,2017,10,22
227,Nice Hotel...Loud Bar Underneath...,"Regarding the property and staff - nothing but good things to say. I give it a 4/5.  Room is quite sizable and comfortable.  Bath towels are huge.  Staff is pleasant and eager to provide assistance.  There's a huge variety of places to eat and drink all around.  

However...

There is a LOUD bar under the hotel rooms.  If I wanted to be above a loud bar I could have stayed in Temple Bar.  If you're in rooms 103, 104 (my room) or 105 you hear the music from the bar coming through your floor.  

Then you have the people sitting & standing outside.  They are really loud too.  I can't have my windows open (and it's nice outside) because they're shouting.  Also the people outside smoke and that smell comes right up inside an open window.  

I'm not someone expecting total quiet staying in the city center.  I live in a loud city and sleep with my windows open.  But this is LOUD.  The bar closes on weeknights at midnight...so if you return to Drury after that this may not impact you.  But I've had 2 early mornings while in Dublin and it's hard to get to sleep with all the noise.  So the loud bar makes me unfortunately rate this property lower.",3,2017,10,19
227,Great little hotel in good location,Stayed for 3 nights mid-week. Friendly staff who are extremely helpful. Rooms are clean and decently furnished with plenty of space. Located about 10 minute walk from Temple Bar area and central area. ,4,2017,10,19
227,"Great Location, Helpful Staff",I would recommend this hotel.  Location was great -- walking distance to Temple Bar and Grafton Street.  Rooms were clean and staff was very helpful!  We were in Ireland during recent storm/hurricane Ophelia and could not get back to the hotel for one night due to entire transportation system being shut down.  Hotel staff was helpful in canceling the reservation and securing a refund.  Staff also provided restaurant recommendations and would arrange for cabs for us.  Only slight downside was street and construction noise in our room but it wasn't too disruptive to us and that was no fault of the staff.  I would stay there again for sure!,4,2017,10,19
227,"Quiet, Comfortable and Convenient","Hotel was small and cozy, service people were friendly and helpful, hotel was easily accessible to popular sights, restaurants and transportation of multiple kinds.  Everything you might need to know was available either by brochure or verbal explanation.   Friendly, friendly friendly service - loved it!",5,2017,10,15
227,Great location and service,"I have stayed in Dublin with business a few times in different hotels.  This was ideally located and I was very impressed with the staff on the front desk.  Great service and friendliness.
There is not a lounge as such, but the breakfast room and breakfast was lovely and the room was spot on.",5,2017,10,13
227,Good location fab breakfast ,"This hotel is in a great location for most parts of the city. There are a good selection of food and drink places close by. 
The bar is busy at night and very lively. 

The outside noise of bars and traffic can be quite loud if you have the windows open abs you are at the front of the hotel but with the windows shut it is not too bad at all. 

Breakfast was great. Great quality ingredients and well cooked. ",4,2017,10,12
227,Clean comfortable no-frills hotel in a great location.,"We recently spent two nights here, and were so pleased!  The staff (in particular Alexa) were so helpful and friendly.  The location is great.  Not in the noisy Temple Bar area, but close enough to walk to everything.  Not a new building, but a number of upgrades and very comfortable.  Triple glazed windows help keep noise out, and the rooms were decent sized for European standards.  Lots of dining options right in the area, and we were able to walk to all of our Dublin destinations from the hotel.  Great experience, and if in Dublin again would definitely stay there.  (Thanks again Alexa!)",5,2017,10,12
227,Comfy boutique hotel,"Hotel front desk staff went out of their way to make certain we could locate the places we wanted to visit. Also gave us helpful suggestions for lunch. Our room was large, beautiful bathroom and new carpeting in the bedroom.
Only negative was the hard pillows, otherwise a refreshing experience.",5,2017,10,11
227,Family visit to Dublin,"Rented 4 rooms for my family while we were in Dublin. Great location for all of the sites. Friendly, knowledgeable staff helped to secure early check in for 1 room so our granddaughter could get some sleep. Rooms were large by European city standards.  Will return!",5,2017,10,11
227,Excellent Location for a Great Value,"A great location within the city, clean and updated rooms, helpful and friendly staff, and totally worth it for the price. Bar next door will send over room service, but the Hairy Lemon is just across the street and a must-try while staying here.",5,2017,10,09
227,Perfect location fab hotel,"This hotel is unpretentious, clean, perfectly located. So much easier to stay in the hub of the city but this hotel was also quiet which you don’t often get so close to all the bars. Staff were helpful and very friendly ",5,2017,10,08
227,One night in Dublin,"Spending a week in Ireland traveling the country and met friends from Scotland in Dublin for dinner.  This hotel was in a perfect location for us and we were very happy with the hotel.  It is very close to some great pubs, no kidding it's Ireland!  The location also offered great restaurants close by.",5,2017,10,08
227,Great location for exploring Dublin,"The Drury Court Hotel is located within walking distance of numerous top Dublin attractions, sites, museums, etc, as well as endless food and drink establishments.
The rooms are very nice, big, comfortable, well appointed. With the windows open for cooling (no AC in room) there is some street noise, but has to be expected due to location. The staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful. The on site restaurant offered a very good breakfast did not try it for dinner.",4,2017,10,07
227,Gene,"The location of the hotel was perfect. We had easy access in walking distance to everywhere in Dublin. At night, the hotel was close to so many restaurants and bars.

The staff was excellent and friendly.",4,2017,10,07
227,Great location,"Delighted with my stay - if only Dublin was better value!

That said it is hard to fault this hotel - great staff and lovely central place to stay close to all amenities, food and great bars.

Strongly recommended.",5,2017,10,06
227,Good value,"I stayed here with my mom for 2 nights. The room was large and comfortable, as was the bathroom, and the front desk staff was helpful and attentive. Great value for the location. I saw similarly priced hotels in the same area with far worse reviews. The location can't be beat- it is walking distance to all the tourist attractions, yet far enough away from the Temple Bar area so it's a bit more quiet and less crowded. The attached restaurant had delicious food, a great beer selection, and good service, but seems to be geared toward a younger crowd. Nevertheless we very much enjoyed our meal there. Would recommend this hotel. ",4,2017,10,05
227,"Great location, apartment and staff","Very kind and helpful staff. We arrived a couple of hours early, left our luggage and the staff called us later to tell us the room was ready so we could check in 1 hr early. perfect location close to everything and nice apartment.  Good value for money.  We had a very nice 3 day stay with no problems.  The apartment was bigger than expected with spacious rooms.  The room  standard could have been higher, but everything worked as expected and an overall a positive experience.",5,2017,10,05
227,"Excellent staff, near Temple Bar","Staff was extremely helpful. Held our bags until checkin, recommended great restaurants, arranged for cab to take us to airport, all with a smile. Will stay again if ever visiting Dublin and I would recommend to anyone wishing to stay in this area of the city.",5,2017,10,04
227,Great hotel,"I hate to only give a three, but there were some things lacking.  The breakfast was terrible.  It really isn't the hotel's fault as they contract with the bar next door for support.  The food selection wasn't great and the food was stale.  However, the hotel recommended a really nice breakfast place that made up for it.  The rooms are nice, just small which makes sense for how old the building is.  The staff is what made it!  Super friendly and helpful.  It is a pricey neighbourhood, so your bobs don't go as far there, but overall a really nice place to stay.  ",3,2017,10,03
227,Clean and comfortable!!,Stayed in the 3bed apartment which is right next to the hotel!! The staff are very warm and welcoming. The hotel itself is very centrally located and walking distance to most of the places of interest. The rooms and bathrooms are clean with fresh crisp linen and the bed are very comfortable to sleep in. Well worth the money and definitely a place i'd recommend.,4,2017,10,03
227,"Clean nice rooms, and great staff.","My sister and I stayed here for four days in August.  The hotel is in a great location, walking distance to almost anything you would want to see in Dublin, the rooms were first rate given the price--they were clean and reasonably sized. The staff was super friendly, they recognized people and were very helpful when it came to looking for information and advice. I highly recommend this for a moderately priced hotel in Dublin.",4,2017,10,02
227,Nice hotel ,"Good location, great staff. Clean rooms. About a 20/25 minute taxi ride to the 3 Arena. Located in a lively part of Dublin. The rooms are a good size and clean. The staff are very helpful and friendly. Really nice place to stay to soak up Dublin's restaurants and bars.  ",5,2017,10,01
227,Warm and welcoming,"Friendly hotel with everything right on the doorstep, not for the early night people but the drury has made an effort to block noise outside. Rooms are immaculate albeit a little dark but very comfortable. ",5,2017,10,01
227,Visiting Dublin for pleasure,"Excellent hotel, well sited. We stayed there before and were able to enjoy our visit to the attractions of Dublin which are within walking distance of the hotel. Good breakfast and helpful staff, all round a good trip.",5,2017,09,29
227,Worth a return stay,"From the Drury Court hotel, It is easy to shop, dine, and visit most cultural institutions, the Gaiety theatre, National Library/Museum, Dublin Castle and the Chester Beatty Library,Trinity College, to name a few, on foot! The Stephens Green area and Shopping Centre are minutes away too, The hotel rooms are comfortable with triple glazed, opening windows. Staff are excellent.",4,2017,09,29
227,Great hotel in great location,"Slept there for 2 nights.
The location was very good.
5 min walk from everything!
We didn't try the breakfast. The hotel pub is local and much of fun. The reception and all the crew was very helpful.
I would stay there again!",5,2017,09,29
227,Great value,"I stayed in the one bedroom apartment and I love all the confinience of the location right in the center of everything from the bar,high end and low end shopping, restaurants, supermarket,you just name it...!!! Everything is just couple blocks away...!!! The stuff is super helpful and friendly from arranging my day trips outside Dublin to helping me with the washing machine inside my apartment, although the apartment is a bit old ....it is very practical, clean and spacey  I can't complain for the price I paid for... so yes....it's a great value....!",5,2017,09,27
227,Excellent location and price,Always stay here when I am in Dublin. Excellent location. Staff are lovely and friendly. Nothing is too much. Great bars and cafes around. You won't need to go far to have a good night out. Beds are super comfortable. ,5,2017,09,27
227,"Great location. Clean, Secure, and Fantastic Service","OK, so this review is overdue as three of us got back from our Ireland trip a few weeks ago.  In terms of location, this hotel puts you in the middle of everything; 3 min walk to Temple Bar (we thought being off the strip would be less noisy), 3 min walk to shopping and to Trinity college.  The pub connected to the hotel draws a pretty good crowd on the weekend and serves a decent Irish breakfast in the mornings.  The hotel itself was very clean as mentioned, with nice updated bathrooms.  While there is someone at the desk around the clock, entry to the elevator bank requires the use of a key card, so ladies, you are doubly-protected.  MOST IMPORTANTLY, I want to give kudos to the staff.  They were very friendly and extremely accommodative and helpful.  We accidentally left some electronics on the day of our departure, and before we got to the airport, we received a call from the hotel saying they would be happy to help mail the items back to the states.  It took me a week or so to line up the courier, but they were very, very honest, and helpful about the whole thing ---Dylan, Emma, Sofia and Matej --Thanks once again for all your help!",4,2017,09,25
227,A lovely little hotel,"Myself and 2 daughters stayed here for 4 nights dropping one of the girls off for a year at Trinity.  It was a perfect location to explore Dublin and easy walk to Grafton Street's areas's shopping and business - banks, Trinity, St. Stephen's Green and most central Dublin sights.  The hotel was able to accommodate the 3 of us in one room - not always easy to accomplish - at a reasonable rate.  They serve a wonderful breakfast in the bar area in the morning.  Either continental buffet style or cooked Irish breakfast or otherwise.  Really beautifully presented and reasonable.  We did not go to the bar in the evening as it was hopping, but we enjoyed our first Guinness there on the day we arrived too early for our room, which they still managed to have ready for us very quickly.  The BEST thing about the hotel however, once you are there and happy with everything else ... the staff.  They could not be nicer and incredibly helpful.  From dinner suggestions to directions to helping us when I lost my phone.  They are really exceptional. Thank you - Matej and one of the ladies behind reception were especially good.  This is a very good, classic, safe, clean hotel in a great location.  It's not super modernistic which is another reason we chose it.  We like comfy beds and cosy rooms and a good bathroom.  We will go back next visit.  ",5,2017,09,19
227,A Gem in Central Dublin,"Friendly, Professional and Accommodating Staff. Seriously Central Location,  Clean and Comfortable.
We have stayed here many times as a couple and with the family and would hope to do so in the future.",5,2017,09,19
227,Helped me enormously with regretful cancellation,"I was looking forward to staying here as friends say this hotel is excellent, but unfortunately I had to cancel at the last minute. The staff went above and beyond to help me out with the cancellation and I am very very grateful.",5,2017,09,19
227,Perfect location and great staff .,Great family accommodation and nice bathrooms . Very secure  and no worry about non guests entering. So close to everything and way walk to all the sights. Staff by far the highlight . So nice and helpful for anything we needed - true Irish hospitality. Parking close by is 12.5 euros per day. ,5,2017,09,17
227,Great hotel superb location,The staff was friendly and professional. Parking option at garage nearby was great. Very nice and clean hotel. The location was superb-exactly what I wanted so I can walk everywhere without having to drive. ,5,2017,09,12
227,Good,"A bit noisy because of the location, but there are double glass windows so it's not that bad.
We slept very well in the comfortable beds. Clean. Friendly staff. Good breakfast and nice pub. We would surely reconmend this hotel.",4,2017,09,11
227,Nice hotel and friendly staff,"Great location, everything in walking distanse, and very nice staff. We had a lovely room for 3 persons, my husband, daughter and my self. It was really spaciouse, clean and comfortable. We will definitly stay here again.",5,2017,09,08
227,Good Location for Decentt Price,"This hotel was centrally located which was a big plus.  Several bars and pubs around it, but the rooms weren't loud at all.  There was a minor issue where one of our rooms had some mold in the sink, but they relocated us to a different room.  The breakfast next door was also good and was both buffet and table service, depending on what you wanted.",4,2017,09,07
227,Comfortable and welcoming,"I'm not sure you can get it better than here. Staff are very helpful and welcoming. Room comfortable and clean - very nice beds. I can recommend the full Irish breakfast, but it is a good idea to be hungry, as they don't skimp on the portions.

Location is brilliant, in a reasonably quiet back street ten minute's walk from Trinity College - cheap parking just across the street. And for us in the rest of the world - even though these maniacs drive around on the wrong side of the road, it is quite easy to drive even in a large city as Dublin. The Irish are very forgiving if you make a mistake or stall the car...",5,2017,09,04
227,Ticks all the boxes,"I absolutely love staying at the Drury Court Hotel when I visit Dublin. The staff are amazing, the location is brilliant and the atmosphere is overall the most comfortable of any hotel that I have ever stayed in. I would recommend this hotel for any length of stay in the city.",5,2017,09,03
227,Great hotel in perfect location,"This is our second time at the Drury Court Hotel. Comfortable room, lovely and clean, nice bed linen, towels etc. The staff couldn't be nicer or more helpful. We love the breakfast in the ajoioning pub. Just stroll through the door in the foyer and there you are in a room which has now been transformed into an elegant dining room. Food completely delicious. The biggest plus for us is the location - it is right in the centre and so we just walked to all the main tourist sights. There is an excellent and frequent bus service too, so can hop on if need be. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,09,02
227,Small Hotel in a Great Location!,"My wife booked this hotel online for me as I was looking for a hotel that was near Grafton Street and St Stephen's Green. The hotel is literally minutes away from many of the interesting places to visit in Dublin with plenty of restaurant and food options. You could walk to places like Dublin Castle, Chester Beatty Library, Grafton Street, Temple Bar, Book of Kells and even the Guinness Storehouse (20 mins). Overall pleasant stay and the rooms are spacious.",4,2017,08,30
227,Fantastic hotel,"Beautiful room,  spotlessly clean,  spacious bathroom, extremely helpful staff and superb location. Will definitely recommend to friends and family and will plan to stay there again on return trips to Dublin.",5,2017,08,29
227,classic  hotel in the touristic center,"It is a classic old fashioned style of hotel in the center of Dublin close to the touristic hotspots : Trinity, Cathedral, Gaiety Theatre, Temple Bar and opposite  a charming pub called the ""Hairy Lemon"". 30 min walk from Guinness Storehouse and Jameson Distillery. Very friendly staff.",5,2017,08,25
227,short break,"excellent location, good value for money, staff very friendly and helpful. Area was quiet when we were there but can imagine it gets a bit louder at the weekend. Very humid during our trip, hotel provided a fan but air con would have been better, may be too much to ask for this price hotel.",4,2017,08,25
227,Would stay again,"Yes
Staff at reception very friendly and welcoming 
Fantastic location 
Parking close for reasonable rate
Great buzz in area at weekend 
Felt safe and secure 
Cleaning staff friendly and helpful 
Second elevator would be an advantage ",4,2017,08,21
227,Like all except carpet and breakfast,"Good and in center. Old furniture and carpet in the floor. Well cleaned.Continental breakfast medium with few choices.
Receptionist were efficient when we ask to rent a car. Between 3 and 4 stars in our opinion.",3,2017,08,21
227,Great service and location,"This is not a hotel with a big lobby. But the rooms were clean. The beds were very comfortable. The bathroom  and fixtures looked new. The staff at the front desk were helpful multiple times. A fridge in the room would have been nice. Also no air conditioning, so we kept the windows open which allowed in street noise.  Would stay there again.",4,2017,08,20
227,Deserves 4 Stars,"Impressed with this hotel from the moment I stepped in. I arrived on an early morning flight, I knew that check-in was at 2pm but they managed to get me a room for 10am which was appreciated. 

The hotel itself is a stones throw away from everything. For me, I chose it for it’s close proximity to The Gaiety Theatre. 

Amenities in the room were pleasant; soap, body wash, shampoo, tea and coffee etc.

I would stay hear again without a doubt.  ",5,2017,08,17
227,"Wonderful staff, great stay","Stayed in Drury Court for one night recently and really enjoyed our stay. From the moment we arrived we were greeted by friendly and helpful reception staff who made check-in very easy. Hotel is in a great location and while the area is busy and therefore noisy at night we had a comfortable nights sleep. Room was clean and tastefully decorated. We will definitely be back, well done Drury Court.",5,2017,08,16
227,Excellent location,"Very nice and comfortable hotel in the very heart of Dublin. Walking distance to all places you could be interested to see in Dublin, near bus and train station for trips to the countryside and sea areas. Small, but well equipped rooms, tasty breakfasts.",4,2017,08,16
227,Wonderful hotel!,"Great hotel in the heart of the Dublin tourist and nightlife scene. Loved our stay there, and staff was extremely helpful. One item for consideration - based on its location next to many pubs, there is a lot of nightlife noise which may make it hard to sleep if you have the windows open. Didn't bug us but if you're a light sleeper be aware. ",4,2017,08,15
227,In the middle of it all.,"Excellent location, in the middle of the ""creative quarter"", with plenty of good restaurants and pubs close-by.  Clean bath and comfortable beds in very clean room. The furnishings bordered ""no frills"" (certainly for the price range).  Staff VERY friendly and helpful.  The cooked breakfast v. good, the continental breakfast mediocre.  Breakfast is served in the pub attached to the hotel, which is quirky and may not be up to everyone's taste (did not bother me though!).  All in all a very pleasant stay, though I felt the room was overpriced for what it was.   However, I booked via  Booking.com, and later I noted that the prices are MUCH more reasonable if booked directly via the Hotel's own website:  Won't be making that mistake again!  Book directly with Drury!",4,2017,08,14
227,lovely hotel central to Grafton st. area of Dublin.,"lovely good size room ,spotless and well presented. hotel ideal location for shopping/ browsing around Grafton street.

227,Cozy little hotel,"My husband and I stayed here after a night mare stay at an air bnb down the street. We were honeymooning prior to our wedding and the sweet girls at the front desk brought us up a bottle of wine and some fancy soaps. The room we had was so comfy and we had a great stay. The bath tub in the room was amazing too, especially if you're a bath person! The neighborhood it's in is bustly in the evenings, but dead quite at night. Next to quite a few pubs and some little markets.",5,2017,08,10
227,Helpful,"It is a perfect location to be in Dublin. the staff was very helpful at the front desk, rooms were very comfortable and clean. Price of the rooms for that location of town was very reasonable. Only thing is the noise from the street in the late evening. ",3,2017,08,10
227,Unbeatable position,"Really helpful staff, only too ready to book excursions, tours and give advice. Position of the hotel was within easy walking distance of all the city attractions and shopping centres. At breakfast there was a very good choice with good coffee. Wi-Fi was good in the room. Bathrooms needed updating.",4,2017,08,10
227,Excellent location in Dublin,The location was excellent and the staff was wonderful. We could easily walk to most of the principal attractions in Dublin as well as dining and shopping. We asked for a room on an upper floor towards the back so we did not get street noise.,5,2017,08,09
227,Great small hotel,"Just returned from a 2 week stay in Ireland with my family of 5.  Looked at many hotels and for the 2 nights in Dublin  decided on the Drury because of the reviews and location. Location was great easy walking to everything sights and shopping.  The front dest was exceptional friendly helpful and so nice to talk to!! I think staying in a small property was the best choice we made. We needed a triple and double room both were huge, clean and comfortable.  It wasn't a deluxe property but beds were so comfy with nice sheets and pillows we had the best sleep!!!",4,2017,08,08
227,Will definitely come back,We had a great stay at Drury Court hotel. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The staff were also very helpful and helped us with a number of queries we had during our stay as well as letting us check in early. Highly recommend!,5,2017,08,08
227,Great Dublin Experience,"You can't beat the location.  It's easy walking distance to lots of Dublin sites, the AirLink bus from the airport, and the hop-on-hop-off busses.  The staff was very gracious and helpful.

There are a couple of pubs nearby.  We were there on a bank holiday weekend,with several huge sports events also going on.  The summertime crowd at the pubs were partially outside and noisy.  If you are sensitive to that kind of noise this might not be the place for you.",5,2017,08,06
227,In the heart of the Dublin,"Centrally located, clean, hospitable and helpful staff, and safe. This was a perfect landing pad for a family unfamiliar with the area. After walking the city and viewing many must see sites, we realized what a value and what a great hotel we had found!",5,2017,08,06
227,great little hotel right near creative quarter!!,"I loved this hotel! It was so close to great restaurants, bars and breakfast places. Plus the hotel has 24 hour desk people who are very helpful. Free newspaper, bar next door serves breakfast just for hotel guests and you can walk everywhere! Cabs are plentiful too. ",4,2017,07,31
227,"Great location, clean room","We wanted to stay in a higher-end hotel in Dublin but knew we'd be tired at the end of our two week trip and possibly out of travel funds. So we opted for this hotel with its good advanced-payment price and convenient location. The staff was very friendly and helpful despite being so busy. The room was clean and quiet (we faced inside). But the location is definitely the best part of staying here. It's so close to all of the restaurants, stores, and sites. We loved being in the heart of the action. The front desk arranged for an excellent cab driver to take us to the airport extremely early in the morning. As we drove out of the neighborhood, we couldn't believe how many people were still out partying and walking the streets (which reveals our age!). Our stay at the Drury was a great way to end our trip.",4,2017,07,30
227,Comfortabel and very well located hotel,"Highly recommendable for location. Nice hotel, people at the desk are helpful, room has everything you need. The pub next door is a bit loud but one is so tired in the evening that it doesn't really matter because you fall asleep right away.",4,2017,07,30
227,"Perfect location, staff and property!","Booked last minute by location and reading reviews and could not have chosen a better place. Staff incredibly welcoming and helpful, ideal location for all we wanted to see and do and beautiful, well maintained and clean property. Look forward to staying there again!",5,2017,07,26
227,Staff cannot do enough for you!!!!,"This hotel wasn't a ""sweep me off my feet"" kind of hotel mainly due to some wear and tear from people who generally abuse other people's property but THE SERVICE!!!!????!!!!  Out of this world for this little hotel!  5 floors with maybe 10-15 rooms per floor.  Clean, well staffed and the little restaurant which serves breakfast was great!  We generally stay in 4 or 5 star hotels however, due to the U2 concert and a late booking, things were tough to reserve!  We found ourselves at the Drury Court which on paper is more rated as a 3 star.  The staff at the hotel were super attentive and professional and what this hotel didn't have in the ""rating"" it certainly has in service!!!  We had a great stay and were very pleased with the overall experience!  We would return based solely on the service and attention which was paid to us as guests!!!  Very minor tweaks would easily make this a 4*.  Thanks everyone!!!",4,2017,07,25
227,Drury Court,"Good central location.  They only had twin beds which were not the most comfortable and odd mismatched heights so we couldn't even push them together...🤔
It was a bit loud so we couldn't open the windows at night and the AC was not spectacular for cooling.  Staff were nice.  In a pinch I would stay there again but it was by no means luxurious.   Location was the selling point for this hotel. ",3,2017,07,16
227,Great location,"I was referred to DCH by a local friend and was very impressed! The hotel has a great location and is near good coffee shops, shopping, and restaurants. The room was very nice and clean and the staff was outstanding! I needed help finding a good rental car company and the staff made sure I got the right one! ",5,2017,07,15
227,First days in Europe,"My husband and I stayed here for our first 3 nights on our honeymoon. Neither of us had ever been to Europe before so we looked for something close to all the sights when we booked this hotel.

The negatives:
Small tv
Loud at night due to multiple pubs right beside or across the street

The positives:
Great location
Helpful staff that made our first Europe experience so easy
Great pub attached to hotel 
Clean
Decently comfortable bed

It wasn't anything super fancy but it was exactly what we needed. We would definitely recommend staying here and if we ever came back we would stay here again. ",5,2017,07,15
227,Very comfortable stay,"The gentleman behind reception desk was very friendly and help, he helped us upgrade our room as we are four, and my son is 4 years old. The room is clean and has everything you need. The hotel recommended the multi-storey car park which is just one minute walk away. Great location in the centre of Dublin. Will recommend to friends. ",5,2017,07,14
227,well sited apartment,"very small apartment for 6 of us, but it worked well overall, with a large hall for 2 of the suitcases to be laid out there. Only 1 bathroom, but we managed. So convenient to site-see from here by foot, and good Shopping Malls too. It was the most reasonably priced for Inner Dublin, mostly prices were over $200 per night, but this was $185 per couple.  ",3,2017,07,13
227,comfortable hotel in a great location,"This hotel was very nice.  The room was clean and comfortable.  The room accommodated our family of four easily.  The location was great...short walk to many pubs and places of interest. They have a parking garage very close and easy to get to.  We enjoyed our stay here and we would stay here again.  The price was pretty good, so I felt it was a value.",5,2017,07,13
227,Great location,"Second time staying here. This hotel is in a great location, very central to restaurants, shopping and nightlife. Friendly staff and hassle free booking. Overall cleanliness was satisfactory, Great value for money.. would definitely stay here again.",4,2017,07,13
227,"Comftable, nice and central","a very clean comftable room. Very central and helpful receptionist. Looking forward for my next visit.
Just walking distance from the centre, a very nice bar with the hotel with a superb gothic style.

Rooms were clean, very quite and quite a nice style. ",4,2017,07,11
227,Great hotel and staff,"I stayed for only 1 night. The staff was amazingly helpful and cheerful. Rachel and Dylan, thank you soooo much for taking such good care of us!

The rooms are clean, pleasant, and the bathroom was luxurious. 

We ate breakfast in the pub next door. It was good food.

The location of the hotel is excellent. It was noisy in the streets at night , but we only heard it because we had the windows open. We were there during a heat wave- yep- seems strange to report that from Dublin, and needed fresh air. We did not mind the noise- it was good natured.",5,2017,07,09
227,Great boutique hotel near Grafton St/ St Stephen's Green,"Been to Dublin many times and this hotel offered something different  - good quality clean rooms, lovely breakfast and friendly, helpful staff. Great location - visited with my 11 year old nephew and we walked everywhere. Great base - sure there are noisy bars around but this is Dublin! Thick glazing and staying at back of hotel ensured sound sleep. Will definitely stay again. ",5,2017,07,06
227,Great location and hotel,"Room and location were fantastic. Ive been to Ireland twice before and would highly recomnend this place and location. Staff were very helpful and the, breakfast yummy. There is also a great  pub next door which has a fun atmosphere.
Room was large compared to many others. There is also someone on the front desk 24 hours a day so you always have someone to help. ",5,2017,07,06
227,Dublin stay,Front desk staff was very nice and helpful with everything.  They let us leave bags at desk on arrival early in the morning until our room was ready and helped us with maps to find things to do during the day.  Room was clean and safe. The location was close for walking to many Dublin attractions. I would recommend staying here.  ,5,2017,07,05
227,Excellent Hotel,"Very central. Clean. Comfy and pretty. It had all the shops and Temple Bar close by - I walked everywhere. Staff were very accommodating and helpful. The rooms were decorated beautifully with everything you would need. Had enough cupboard space, a safe, etc. the room wasn't small at all too.",5,2017,07,03
227,Loved this unpretentious place,"Drury Court Hotel has an unbeatable Dublin location, minutes from pretty much anything you want.  The front desk staff are welcoming and able to accommodate all requests efficiently and cheerfully.

Our room was sizable and carefully cleaned.  There is substantial street noise at night, but the dual windows ensured we nonetheless had all the quiet we needed to sleep. Ample storage and good lighting made the room comfortably functional.

This is a non-fancy, no bells or whistles place.  Just perfectly located, clean and a pleasure to return to on each day of our lengthy stay.  Would happily come back.",4,2017,07,01
227,Great Location,"The hotel and staff were great, the only challenge was parking.  The hotel has no parking so they have arranged a daily rate with a parking garage up the street.  You have to carry your luggage a block to the hotel, not convenient but manageable.  The hotel staff went above and beyond to meet our other needs.  We missed breakfast one morning because we overslept and they were able to get one for us anyway.   Nice!",4,2017,07,01
227,Valentines,"Great location, right in temple bar! Very clean & smart at affordable price. Lady on reception was so lovely, 5star service! They have a map on the wall & you have to add a pin where you are from, lovely touch made you feel very welcome! Would most definitely visit again if come back to Dublin",5,2017,06,30
227,Pretty good overall,"I'd definitely stay again! The staff was accommodating and friendly, the room was very nicely decorated and had a wonderful balcony view of the street level.  It was situated in a great part of town, near everything. ",4,2017,06,28
227,"Drury Court Hotel, June 2017","I am very happy I chose this hotel. It has one of the best locations in Dublin. In Dublin 2, within walking distance to St. Stephen's Green, Temple Bar, the museums, and center City. 
I'm a single woman in her twenties who visited while solo traveling for the first time. I felt very safe and comfortable during my week at this hotel. The staff is very friendly as we're the bartenders downstairs at P. Macs. It was very hard to leave.
I am most likely going to stay there again when I get a chance to return.",5,2017,06,27
227,"Great Stay, Great Location, Great Staff","The location was ideal. Close enough to tourist spots but also able to mingle well with locals. Short walk to St. Stephen's Green, Grafton Street, Molly Malone statue (tour pick-ups), etc. Reasonable walk to Trinity College/Book of Kells, Dublin Castle, St. Patrick's Cathedral, Christ Church Cathedral, Temple Bar. Great food near-by with friendly staff. Hotel staff were very helpful in recommending places to eat, answering questions, offering assistance, etc., and were also very responsive and pleasant in answering questions by e-mail prior to my trip. The hotel stored my large suitcase for 2 days while I went to Galway and took it to my room for me on my return before I checked in. The room was tiny but enough for my needs, and it even had USB wall ports so I didn't need converters to charge my electronics. The room was a bit warm (unusually lovely warm weather during my visit!) so a fan would have been nice in lieu of A/C. The windows opened over the street so the noise from the attached bar (hot spot) could be a distraction from sleep, but I found I tired myself out enough during the day that it was not even an issue. The price was more than I would normally pay for such a tiny room, but the location and the great staff left me with the sense that it was still good value for the money.",4,2017,06,26
227,"Excellent rooms, many places within walking distance",Our room was clean and in excellent condition. Bed may be hard for some visitors. Air conditioning works well but controller has 14 buttons and no documentation. Very friendly and helpful staff. Did not have hotel breakfast - lots to choose from next to the hotel. Location is excellent; many essential must-see places are within walking distance.,5,2017,06,25
227,Cozy Hotel in the Heart of Dublin,"We spent three nights at this downtown Dublin boutique hotel and could not have been happier.  The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful to the two of us who had just arrived for the first time in Dublin.  Our room was very cozy, comfortable and clean.  We could not have been happier staying there.  If in Dublin again, we will definitely seek it out.  ",4,2017,06,22
227,Early June trip,"Everything was great, helpful staff, friendly, clean hotel.  No AC or fan, had to keep windows open.  Some street noise with pubs below.  Otherwise all was great. Room was clean and very nice.  Comfy beds.  Great location.  Senior travelers.",5,2017,06,22
227,Another pleasant stay at Drury Court Hotel,"Overall very happy with experience. In the middle of Dublin city but heard no outside noise at night; a very comfortable sleep.
The staff are what made the visit enjoyable and stress free. Arrive early and they take your luggage until you return at book-in time. 
I will be back.",5,2017,06,21
227,Great,The staff  was GREAT . Very helpful . The room was very nice and central to everything. Rachel the front desk lady  was great fabulous and very helpful. It was easy talk walk to everything. Very close to the center of town.,5,2017,06,20
227,Very disappointing ,"Stayed at the Drury Court this month for the first time.  Heard good things about it.  Check-in was fast and staff were very friendly at the front desk.  My room was spacious and a modern enough design so it was s good start.  I like a clean room and usually prefer not to see too much dust, but this room seemed to not have a good cleaning in a long time( pic below) which was a pity as it's one thing I cannot stand, a very dirty room. The bathroom was spacious also, but as I got into shower , I discovered the metal all broke with screws hanging out of wall. They were rusty as picture shows below and I thought it was very dangerous furthermore , as if somebody had a cut and rust leaked from wall, need I say more.  But, it was just sad to see a decent bathroom but they just let it go like this and didn't seem to out residents safety first.  The location is good and close to St Stephens Green and Grafton St but with such conditions for a hotel that can charge hundreds of euro's a night , it was very very disappointing.  I did contact the manager who did put me in touch with operations manager and while said she was sorry about the room and dangerous conditions, she could only offer an 15% discount , I refused as I could get a 15% discount online anyhow , but she said it's all she's offering and I could take it or leave it , I thought this was not a manager or hotel that puts it's customers first at all or care about safety.  I found dealing with them very unprofessional and  I will not stay again after the way they treated me or recommend this hotel to anybody. Shame on Drury Court Hotel.  Look elsewhere folks😏😏",2,2017,06,20
227,Good hotel with friendly helpful staff. Well situated,"Close to city centre but if driving think carefully about options. Slow traffic, some tight streets in centre of Dublin, parking a nightmare and very expensive!!
Drury Court well situated room fine but cracked sink needs replacing. Breakfast superb!!!!",4,2017,06,16
227,Family Vaca in Dublin,"Great central location.  We were a family of five in a three bedroom apartment.  The amenities were good and the space was just right for all of us.  The washer/dryer was a great bonus.  There is a security door and the front desk next door helped with any questions we had, very nice folks at the desk.
Our rooms faced the back alley and the noise at night was very loud, the only drawback but to be expected in the middle of a city.  We would stay here again.",4,2017,06,15
227,Awesome location and fantastic staff,"I stayed here in May, 2017 and really loved the location, my room, and the extremely helpful staff.  In fact, I accidentally left my Patagonia down jacket in my room and they mailed it to me in the US for no charge -- I was totally surprised by their commitment to great service.
I did ask for a fan in my room and had to keep the windows shut to the noise on the street -- small trade-off for great location.",5,2017,06,14
227,city visit,I recently stayed with two friends in the Drury Court. I have stayed here a number of times before and have never been disappointed. Staff are courteous and helpful. The rooms are very comfortable and clean.  The hotel is ideally situated for shopping and dining as you are only a minutes away from Grafton St and Stephen's Green. We have used parking facility at times which is very useful. Would definitely stay again.,4,2017,06,14
227,"Good hotel, great location","We booked a small apartment for a week to do tourism in Dublin. The apartment was good, everything was clean and well located nearby several restaurants. 
Free wi-fi, friendly staff, great service. 
As we were in 4, the only cons was the shower, we had to ask for a boost in the water heater in order to be able to have a relaxing warm shower. In the overall definitely would come back. ",4,2017,06,13
227,Wonderful location and staff,"We stayed here for three nights and would definitely recommend this hotel.  We were a little nervous about the potential noise since we were located directly above the bar below, but even on a Friday night we had no issues once the windows were closed.  The hotel provided us with a large fan which made my husband very happy since he is a bigger guy.  The front desk staff was simply amazing, they recommended a number of pubs/restaurants that were more local and were happy to assist with anything we needed.  Location is absolutely perfect, walking distance to EVERYTHING!",5,2017,06,12
227,Suited out Needs Perfectly,This hotel is in a great location to walk all over the city.  We stayed here for 2 nights and were very happy.  The front desk staff was very helpful in recommending things to do or places to eat.  The room was clean and very comfortable.  It is located in a busy area so you will hear street noise but that did not bother us.,5,2017,06,11
227,Location and price can't be beat. Bad beds in room 504.,"We return from Drury Court with a mixture of high praise and constructive criticism. First, the location is perfect which made up for a couple failures on behalf of the hotel management. We intend to return and try out their apartments. Nothing can change how claustrophobic this hotel made me feel. We were on 5th floor (504) and our window was small. I'm nervous about fire & I was instantly wondering how we'd ever get rescued. A low floor with a bigger window would've been less nerve-wracking for me. That said then room was pretty. The bathroom was nice and had a nice, clean tub. The toiletries were nice. It's very noisy outside all night and we had to sleep with earplugs with the double windows shut. Room service, food, drinks were all excellent. The burger I had was probably the best burger I ever had in my life and I'm from a foodie, East Coast USA city. Front desk staff were all totally excellent at all times. Housekeeping apparently quit or got fired on our 2nd day, so our room did not get cleaned, though someone came in and made beds. Same night, we lost all lighting in the windowless bathroom, so we had to bathe & pack in complete darkness. Beds were pure hell. I slept on top of my blankets so it would be soft enough to sleep. Room was rather hot with no AC or fan. Could hear no one, however, in the hall or in other rooms, so that was really nice. Prices were surprisingly low for everything. Very good value over all, and if there'd been a single outlet in the bathroom, I could've plugged in a floor lamp & had light, which would've made all the difference. I recommend a few upgrades, like install a spare outlet in the bathroom, replace those mattresses immediately, and treat new housekeeping staff like angels so they'll stay and do a good job! Everyone who was employed during our stay deserves applause (and a raise!). If they had been mediocre we would've probably raised a stink about the other stuff. ",3,2017,06,06
227,Really enjoyed our stay here,"Would definitely recommend this hotel.  Location is perfect - plenty of pubs/restaurants around hotel, but far enough from Temple Bar, so it is not too crowded/noisy.  There is a pub in the bottom of the building, so if noise bothers you, ask for a higher floor.  We were on the top floor, and with the window closed, you could not hear a thing from outside.  While room was on the smaller side, it was very clean with a spacious bathroom.  Not cheap, but neither was anything else in Dublin.  Breakfast is served in pub downstairs with plenty of options on the buffet, as well as hot entrees on the menu.  Would stay here again if visiting Dublin.",5,2017,06,05
227,Lovely staff and location make this a great place to stay.,"It's a great 3 star hotel with great staff and a fantastic location. Just so expensive, but that's Dublin. I hate to introduce a negative at all but the cost is an issue. But if you want to be surrounded by lovely people, a great breakfast and Steph into a great area, then this is the place for you.",5,2017,06,04
227,Suburb location,"This small hotel is located near everything. Walking distance to great shopping on Grafton street, all the pubs and restaurants in Temple Bar district, Trinity College, St Stephens park and the Hairy Lemon pub right across the street. Rooms are basic and small but very clean and the staff is very friendly and helpful. Dublin is pricey and this hotel is no exception but the best value I could find to accommodate a family of 3. ",4,2017,06,04
227,Centrally located with friendly and helpful staff,"This hotel is located on the outside edge of the Temple Bar area and close to numerous attractions.    Reading some reviews people note noise of the Temple Bar area, but I sure didn't notice any noise from our room.   Staff is friendly and helpful and if in Dublin I would have no problem staying here again",4,2017,06,04
227,Great Dublin location,"Nice stay in a triple room in a great location.  Beds comfortable. Rooms well appointed. Service excellent.  Staff went above and beyond to have our room ready early for us. location is close to Grafton St shopping and good restaurant options.  Reasonable walking distance to Temple Bar and Dublin Castle.  Would definitely sat there again!  

",4,2017,06,02
227,Good stay,Great location being near the touristy spots and lots of good shopping and Irish pubs. The customer service was very good. Both in email before the stay and during our stay. They watched our luggage after our stay and were super kind. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was it was pricey.,4,2017,05,31
227,Excellent location and nice staff,"I'd definitely recommend this hotel, especially if you are looking for a lively area full of appealing pubs.
The only drawback was the price - too expensive - but it may have been related to the fact that Guns N Roses was playing near Dublin that weekend.",5,2017,05,29
227,Great hotel,"Lovely hotel in a great neighbourhood. The staff really takes time to give you information about the city. There was something broken in our room, when we told this at the reception they directly fixed it.",5,2017,05,29
227,very good,"friendly and helpful staff. provided excellent advice on transport and other matters. always available for inquiries. Central location, easy access to transport. Many places close by for dining and take away. ",4,2017,05,28
227,3 star D2 Dublin,"Great location for the sights of Dublin, friendly & professional staff, willing to help in any way. Expensive rate but probably due to a packed town that weekend, (Guns n Roses, Pro 12 final) the breakfast was great & varied,",4,2017,05,28
227,"Great location, secure and comfortable-","Really enjoyed our stay in one of the hotel apartments, located just a couple of doors down from the main hotel. Staff were friendly and helpful. It's a secure building with a lift and everything to make 2 couples comfortable. It was a 1 bedroom with fold out double bed in the lounge area which was quite comfortable. Full kitchen and the washing machine was a bonus at that stage of our trip. Some views of back streets and neighbourhood from balcony and windows. The views would be enhanced further if the garden area in view was tidied up. Can recommend.",4,2017,05,26
227,A gem in the rough,"Wasn't expecting a lot from this place (badged as a 3*) as I normally stay at the Fitzwilliam on SSG, but their Thursday night rate was frankly extortion - some £350+ My travel dept gave me this option as closest to SSG and took the chance. All started well with an absolutely excellent young lady on the front desk who seemed to work all hours. The highlight was the room service (picture below), again served by my front desk 😇, which comes in, I assume, from an outside restaurant. It was the best burger I've had in weeks! All in all a great wee spot and well worth a visit, business or pleasure.

Thanks folks.",4,2017,05,26
227,SMALL HOTEL WITH GOOD LOCATION,Good location with many restaurants around. Staffs was friendly too.  Size of room was acceptable but they don't replenish the toiletries daily. There was a bar at the ground level and its noisy at night...good for party goers.,3,2017,05,25
227,We'll be back😀,"Great location, friendly and extremely helpful staff. Rachel at reception was great, nothing was to much trouble. Room was a good size,  clean and tidy. It was great value for money. I will definitely pay this hotel another visit. ",5,2017,05,22
227,Great Hotel and Great Area.,"When I return to Dublin I will surely rebook the Drury Court Hotel.  It was clean, the bathroom was modern and large and the location was in the middle of everything.  The breakfast for the hotel guest in the pub next door was very nice and there was plenty and the service was good. ",5,2017,05,22
227,Couldn't be more helpful,"We had a small problem with the room on the first night, which the staff was keen to help with.  Overall, this place was one of the best places to stay for its location and helpfulness.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,05,22
227,"Great hotel, great location!","I had a great time exploring Dublin! I could easily pop in and out of the hotel whenever I wanted and it was never out of the way! The bar next store was fun and super close, so a win win! Also great nightlife without needing a cab! The staff was always pleasant and helpful! Especially the overnight guy that was there when I was! He even offered to bring up a cold pitcher and water and was SUPER prompt! I was very impressed that he offered the little extras, very accommodating and thoughtful! I had a wonderful stay, thank you all kindly!",4,2017,05,19
227,"Good sleep, location and very clean!","We booked the Drury Inn because of the reviews on location.  They were spot on.  Close enough to walk to EVERYTHING (including a longer walk to Guinness) with pubs, restaurants and everything close by.  We really enjoyed the Hairy Lemon Pub across the street and the hotel was very helpful in arranging transportation for us to another attraction and to airport.  I'd stay here again if we go back to Dublin.  Oh - and also slept real well in their beds which is a huge plus when on vacation!",4,2017,05,19
227,Drury Court stay - 5 star staff,"We stayed for three nights are Drury Court. While the venue is rated at three star, it certainly exceeds this score.  We then headed off on a 12 day tour.  The hotel allowed us to leave our excess baggage their for when we returned.  The staff could not have been better.  Had issues with our hire-car waiting to be delivered, and the staff couldn't have helped more; offering coffee etc  I rate the staff as a five star. *****",5,2017,05,19
227,Great Spot,"Loved this quiet little hotel that was amongst everything we needed, pubs, resturants,shops. St Stephens Green is on the doorstep..
Staff were helpful. Breakfast was really good.
We had twin beds as requested, rooms were a good size and you could open the windows.",5,2017,05,19
227,Amazing apartments ,Booked 3 bed apartment here . Amazing quality and big double rooms so cosy and affordable .5 people in apartment well maintained and a great location in city . Would highly recommend anyone to stay here .,5,2017,05,18
227,Friendly hotel in a great location.,"This hotel is located on the south side of Dublin in easy walking distance to Trinity College, Grafton Street, Temple Bar and other attractions. When we arrived exhausted at 6am, the staff was helpful in storing our  luggage, suggesting places to go and best of all, getting our room ready by noon instead of the 3pm check-in. When we checked out, they let us into the dining room for a continental breakfast because we had to leave at 7:30 to  meet a tour. The hotel is clean, comfortable and the staff couldn't be more helpful.",4,2017,05,10
227,Great location and value,The location was unbeatable. Perfectly located to both sites and public transportation. The bed was also so comfy!! Perfect after a busy day exploring. The front staff was extremely hospitable and gave great tips to make my trip special.,5,2017,05,08
227,Lovely hotel and staff in a fabulous location,"This was our second stay at Drury Court as we were so comfortable the first time around. The font desk staff is so friendly and accommodating. Sofia and Emma were working and we're kind enough to even print our boarding pass for us. Improvements were made since our last visit which were very nice. The rooms are clean, comfortable, and quiet (we were towards the back of the hotel).
Location is convenient to so many great areas such as Grafton St., St. Stephens Green Park, Trinity College.",5,2017,05,08
227,"A fourth visit - great staff, breakfast and location","Really handy for St.Stephens Green (also regular Air Coach stop from v.early in mornings), Drury Theatre, Dublin Castle, Grafton St etc. A really good breakfast at the conjoining pub for about 10 or 11 Euros. Comfortable beds and rooms but nothing flash - with windows closed you can't hear the Friday or Saturday night hullabaloo from the streets. Staff are friendly. I've tried a few hotels, but keep coming back here. My only complaint is that it's getting quite pricey, but there again so are most of Dublin's major hotels.",4,2017,05,07
227,Very good hotel,Very good hotel in a great location. Perfectly located for tours. Its staff were friendly and accommodating. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Only criticism is the cost of breakfast-seemed excessive.,4,2017,05,05
227,Revision of previous review,"This is a revision for a review that I had previously sent and I did not rate the hotel correctly in that review so,  I have to revise the ratings and apologize to the hotel.The Drury Court Hotel was the best.   The staff was extremely friendly and so very helpful.
It is a great location for everything to do and see in Dublin. It was my 8th trip to Ireland (the best place on earth) and this was the nicest hotel I stayed in Dublin because of the location and the staff.",5,2017,05,01
227,Amazing location!!,"A group of 10 of us stayed in two apartments for our girly Christmas night out back in early December! It was the perfect solution for all of us to stay! We had a great reception room in the apartment which was great for us all to meet up before we headed out on the tiles! It is really a great location only minutes walk from Grafton Street! The apartments were well equipped, very comfortable and clean! The staff were very welcoming and friendly! I would highly recommend!",5,2017,05,01
227,Great value for money,Great value for money and lovely friendly staff. Great location. Breakfast good. Clean rooms . Free newspaper all super . Booked for a friend and not disappointed . Stayed 2 nights would go back. Room clean and has all you want,5,2017,04,28
227,Outdated,"The security of hotel was excellent.  We had to use room card to get into elevator area.  The front staff was very helpful with suggestions and ordering a cab for us.  The location is good if you want to be by the Temple Bar area.  The room decor is very outdated--but who's in the room very long anyway.  The oddest thing was when we asked for more washcloths but were told they were out of them because they get them from ""a service.""  We we're showering late in the day, probably wouldn't have been a problem if it was earlier in the day.",3,2017,04,26
227,Easter in Dublin,"A few minutes walking from Temple Bar but far enough to be quiet for sleeping. Cozy and clean room, as shown in pictures. Comfortable bed and big bathroom. If you prefer to have breakfast outside the hotel, there is a Starbucks just round the corner!",5,2017,04,25
227,Decent Hotel,"I stayed here for for one night for the Dublin marathon and a stag night which was coincidentally on the same day.

This hotel is well located, within a short walking distance of Stephens Green and Grafton Street. No onsite parking but there is a nearby carpark but as it was a Sunday, we availed of nearby free street parking, just need to be aware that certain zones still charge for Sunday parking including the streets close to the hotel and Stephens Green so we parked about 5 minutes walk away, check the street signs to be sure.

Hotel itself was small but quaint, room was clean and well maintained. Staff were very friendly and welcoming.

We managed to get a last minute deal for €150 for one night but normally costs about €230 which is still not too expensive by Dublin standards.

Still, I would recommend this hotel, mainly due to the location",3,2017,04,25
227,Holiday,I was initially disappointed with the location. However it was a great location for walking without a suitcase. The rooms were nicely appointed and very clean. My greatest annoyance were the fire doors. If you had a room close to these they banged all night with people coming and going on the same floor. There were great places to eat around this hotel. So that was good. I caught 2 trains from different stations while here and I needed to get a taxi to both. But over all friendly helpful staff. ,3,2017,04,25
227,Very smart hotel,"A very nice hotel in the neighbourhood of Dublin Centre. The room was clean and very comfortable. Could be a bit loud during weekend, because some bars are next to the hotel. I certainly will book again, when I visit Dublin. I",4,2017,04,25
227,"Great location, friendly staff!","We loved this hotel, it was newly renovated with updated furniture and color scheme- very inviting!  The staff was incredibly helpful with recommending great places to eat/see.  We utilized their laundry service and it went perfectly smooth.  The location was perfect for walking around Dublin- would definitely recommend to travelers.",5,2017,04,24
227,Clean but uncomfortable,"The room was clean and the staff was polite but the shower head sprayed water all over the bathroom and made a mess, the show rod was flimsy and kept falling off the wall, and the pillows were flat and hard.",2,2017,04,22
227,Nice hotel with great location,"Hotel is only a couple of minutes walk from Grafton Street, St Stephen park and Dublin castle. Pretty close to the Temple Bar district too. Hotel staff very helpful and friendly. Rooms are nice, beds are comfortable and bathroom nice and neat.",5,2017,04,19
227,Siobhan's stay in the Drury Court Hotel,"This was the second year we visited this property and we stayed at the beginning and end of our trip this time around.  The hotel staff is super-friendly and helpful, the hotel is clean and safe and the location is absolutely perfect for touring.  We walked to many of the places we wanted to see around Dublin.  The attached restaurant had a delicious, authentic, reasonably-priced breakfast that we enjoyed each morning.  I highly recommend the Drury Court Hotel.",5,2017,04,14
227,Very convenient,"Clean room, great location, efficient service, reasonable price. Room a bit small but nice and comfortable. Breakfast in P macs next door was great. Hotel is right at the heart of Dublin nightlife so it can be a bit noisy outside.",4,2017,04,14
227,Ideal for a short stay,Very friendly and competent reception. Clean and tidy room with all amenities needed. Perfect location when visiting all the main tourist attractions in Dublin. Highly recommend the irish breakfast in the hotel!,4,2017,04,13
227,Three star hotel!? ,"Wow, this is without an exception the best three star hotel I've stayed in! Perfect location, staff is extremely friendly and helped every wish, room is also outstanding for three star. Just stay here, all I got to say! ",5,2017,04,11
227,Great location and great room!,"Fantastic location - you can walk to everything but are well away from the noise of Temple Bar and Grafton Street so you get a good night sleep. Room was immaculate and spacious - we had a triple with a full and a twin and it was perfect for 3 adults. Desk staff was lovely and helpful (maps, taxis, etc). There is an elevator as well.  Our only complaint was that the wifi was super slow.  If you are in Dublin for work, bring a mobile hotspot.",5,2017,04,11
227,"Small, but perfectly formed","I actually booked this hotel by mistake because for some reason, I got it into my head that it was Brookes hotel around the corner. When I discovered my error I was very tempted to change as I thought that the rate was perhaps a bit too competitive for a city centre hotel so figured there must be a catch. In the end, I decided to go ahead with the booking as it was only for one night and I was delighted that I did as it is a great little hotel and represents very good value for money — particularly when the rates are at their lowest. It doesn't have any facilities to speak of other than some meeting rooms in the basement but the bedrooms are well appointed; immaculately clean and very well soundproofed. Breakfast is served next door in the pub but is very good and the surroundings are quirky to say the least — quite European in some respects and it seems to specialize in craft beers. The only downside is that there is no onsite parking but there isa multi-story car park across the road and you get a discount when you stay at the hotel. The location is superb and is surrounded by dozens of quality restaurants and is just two or three minutes walok from Stephens Green shopping centre and the Gaiety theatre. 

A real find!",5,2017,04,08
227,Drury court,The Drury Court was very centrally located.  The staff were friendly and helpful. The room was comfortable and clean. Nice choice of breakfast.  Bar area was good with a good range of  boardgames. 😀😀😀😀😀😀😀,5,2017,04,08
227,Excellent Customer Service,"We recently stayed at the Drury Court Hotel for 2 nights during a trip to Dublin and it was fantastic. We arrived early, not expecting our room to be ready but we're told that it would be ready in half an hour so we went for a coffee and returned to check in shortly after. The reception staff were all extremely friendly and helpful and offered to mark places on a map that may be of interest. The girl who checked us in also pointed out that lots of museums are closed on a Monday so to make sure we visited these on the Sunday if we were interested. 
We had a corner room on the 3rd floor which was extremely clean and spacious for what we needed. It looked out to the front of the hotel's adjoining bar and was quite warm so on the 1st night we left some windows open and it was very noisy. However, the room did have triple glazing so when the windows were shut the noise was shut out well. Anyway, if we had wanted a quiet retreat we would not have booked a hotel in the city centre. 
Overall the location of the hotel was perfect for exploring the city and we wouldn't hesitate to book again. On check out a member of staff made sure that we knew how to get back to the bus for the airport. Excellent customer service! ",5,2017,04,07
227,Perfectly situated hotel and friendly staff!,"We had the most comfortable stay at this hotel.  Receptionists were very helpful and polite.  The hotel is perfectly situated in the centre of Dublin with easy access to most of Dublin.  Lovely cafe's and restaurants very close by, actually even across the road!  Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,04,04
227,Great location,"This hotel is in a great spot.  I was struggling to figure out the right location, but this fits the bill.  Close to shopping on Grafton Street an close to main attractions.  You can walk everywhere.  Super friendly and helpful staff at front desk.  We had a family from for four and it was perfect for our short overnight trip.  I would definitely recommend this hotel for families.",5,2017,04,03
227,"Decent, no frills accommodation","The best thing about the hotel is the location, a couple of minutes to Grafton Street and St Stephens Green and five minutes to Temple Bar. We stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment which was adequate for our needs as there were only two of us so plenty of space. Only one bedroom was usable as there was a missing blind at the window in the other bedroom. The apartment could have done with a bit of TLC (a gap in the floor going in to the kitchen, flaky paint, etc) and there was only a small shower with no bath, but nothing too much to complain about. The breakfast the hotel puts on at Pmacs next door was excellent (10euro per person), this bar was also very good at night - about 40 beers on tap. The staff at the hotel were all very friendly and a benefit to the hotel and the wifi was good.",3,2017,04,01
227,Short break ,"Great location to bars, restaurants and most attractions.  Very friendly and helpful staff,nothing was too much trouble. Clean and nicely furnished,  comfortable beds too. 10/10 would definitely recommend to friends and family.",5,2017,03,31
227,Nice Hotel in a Somewhat Quieter Area of Dublin,"We stayed at the Drury for two nights over the St. Patrick's Day festivities. We wanted something close enough to all the action yet not right on Temple Bar. The Drury Court Hotel fit the bill. It is a small, unassuming hotel just 6 minutes from Temple Bar and all the pubs and nightlife. Although a bit of a walk from there, Drury Court is still located in a nice area with pubs, cafes, and even a nice shopping mall just one block away. Grafton Street shopping area is also a short walk away. 

The hotel reception staff were warm and welcoming, and allowed us to stow our luggage until check-in time. Our triple room, though tight with a roll away added, was sufficiently large enough for us three old university chums. The room was about average size, maybe larger, for a double, compared to most stays I've had in Europe. The room and bathroom were both clean and met our needs. I would stay here again.",5,2017,03,31
227,Very Pleasant Stay....,"I arrived early at the hotel and was greeted by very pleasant reception stay who advised that my room would not be ready until the afternoon so I decided to do a spot of shopping and left my luggage at reception.  However, reception very kindly rang me before lunch to advise that my room was ready and I was allocated a room in a quiet part of the hotel as per my request.  The room was spacious and warm and had old world charm and I was delighted that the windows are treble glazed as I am a light sleeper!  I would definitely stay at the Drury Court again and found all members of staff to be courteous and helpful.  Also, a definite plus was it's location - only a few minutes stroll from Grafton Street.",4,2017,03,30
227,"Short stay, great location!","Stayed here recently during a short weekend to watch the international football. The location is excellent, only a very short walk to Temple Bar. The hotel we found slightly expensive for a three star but the cleanliness and presentation of the hotel was pretty good. Our only complaint would be that the shower was of a poor standard, the water pressure was a little low and very old fashioned with how to change the heat. Other than this, we enjoyed our stay and if the price was slightly cheaper next time, we will stay again. ",4,2017,03,26
227,Excellent City Centre Location,"Great value for money. Rooms comfortable and very clean. Breakfast cooked to order, which is a refreshing change from a buffet breakfast (hot and cold). Staff always friendly and helpful. If you need to avail of room service food there isn't a huge selection, and the tray charge of €6.50 is pretty steep. Apart from that, I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to visitors to Dublin.",4,2017,03,23
227,No Frills but Has Everything that you Need,"On entering, I was greeting by a very pleasant young gentleman at reception..Check-in was quick and easy.

Room was very clean and had everything required. Bed was comfortable, bathroom was of adequate size. Location cannot be beaten..right in the heart of everything.

This is a 3 star establishment and as a result doesn't have the Frills of the larger chains but it does have a certain charm.

I didn't eat there so cannot comment on food. I would stay there again without hesitation.",4,2017,03,16
227,Weekend break,"The location of this hotel is just perfect, everything within easy walking distance. The pubs local to the hotel are worth a visit for both a drink or a meal.  The breakfast at the hotel is worth having, without having to trek around to find a suitable cafe. We will diffinately use the hotel again with no hesitation.",5,2017,03,13
227,Valentines ,The hotel was near OConnell street and near buses to airport and had different restaurants within walking distances but beware slot of construction with the Lucas line and a lot of shady characters hang near by so mind your business and you'll be fine. But the hotel was grand . ,5,2017,03,10
227,Three wonderful days in Dublin,"I've stayed at the Drury Court Hotel a number of times now.  It is perfectly located just outside Temple Bar but really handy for some excellent pubs and restaurants.

Our room had been recently refurbished and has been done to a very high standard.  The décor is fresh and modern and the beds are very comfortable.

The staff are very helpful and friendly.  During my stay I had a minor issue which was professionally resolved by both duty staff and the hotel manager.

I always recommend the Drury Court Hotel to my family and friends and look forward to my next visit.",5,2017,03,10
227,One Day in Dublin,"I only had one afternoon in Dublin, so the location in the heart of the city made this hotel a perfect spot for me. I felt safe as a single female traveler, and the front desk staff were extremely helpful. ",5,2017,03,08
227,"Clean and functional, all you need for a weekend away!","We stayed from Saturday to Monday. Great location, far enough away from the real centre to be abit quieter but not so far as to be too far to walk. Saturday night stayed fairly noises until around 2, but wasn't really an issue. Room was clean and modern, all facilities worked. We paid 50% less than the advertised rate, as we booked through booking.com. We were very happy but may be would have been a little less satisfied if we paid full price. Perfect hotel for a weekend break for a couple (28yo)",4,2017,03,06
227,Reception Staff Are A Credit To The Hotel!,"We have recently stayed here for a long weekend (3rd-5th March) for a hen do. 
We booked 2 apartments and a family room to cater for 14 of us. The family room was within the hotel, and the apartments were next door but one to the hotel. 
Great location!!! Walking distance to the Temple Bar area. 
The family room was lovely, and the beds were comfy. The apartments were very nicely decorated and had the added bonus of the lounge area. The 2 bed apartment had a much bigger lounge/dining area than the 3 bed apartment. The apartments came well equipped with a small kitchen which was great for a self catering weekend. The beds in the apartments were not the comfiest. One of the beds in the 3 bed apartment was really squeaky and the mattress was solid...
That aside, we were so glad that we chose to stay at Drury Court Hotel. 
The Reception Staff are an absolute credit to the hotel!! We spoke to 3 women and a man on the Reception Desk throughout the weekend and each one was ever so friendly and helpful. They sorted us taxi's, sorted the mix up with booking and even printed our boarding passes. Nothing was too much for them. We thank you for being so lovely!!",5,2017,03,06
227,Love this hotel,"This is one of my favourite hotels because: helpful staff, not too big, clean, comfortable and spacious rooms, easy-to-work shower! So many hotels have complicated shower systems. Unassuming friendly hotel ",5,2017,03,06
227,Great Hotel,"We stayed here for just one night - St Valentines - a present from me to hubby. We flew in early morning and took the bus from the airport as described on the hotel's website.  It was only a short walk and helped us to find our bearings. We decided to drop our bags off at the hotel then go back to check in during the afternoon.  We arrived just before 11am so were delighted when the lady on reception said our room was ready and we could check in early (for no extra cost). The hotel looks better on the inside than on the outside and the whole ambience is clean and fresh with nice little touches of decoration.  Our room overlooked a rather busy (if narrow) road and a bar right next door and I did worry that we would suffer with noise during the night. However all our windows had triple glazing and we slept soundly. The room had everything you could want and we really liked the furniture which had character, and the king-sized comfy bed.  The bathroom was large with a shower over the bath. The location for us was perfect - in easy walking distance (bearing in mind my hubby is 73) of all the shops, bars and restaurants and Temple Bar itself. We decided that we preferred to be on this side of the river. Breakfast is served in the adjoining bar. It had a cold buffet from which you could choose from the enormous selection and hot food was cooked to order. This was one of the best breakfasts we have had (and we have eaten many hotel breakfasts!). The best aspect of this hotel is it's staff. We found every single person we spoke to was friendly, happy to help, seemed genuinely pleased to speak to you and interested in your small talk. As an example I asked the lady on reception if she would help me to print out our boarding passes for our flight home. When she saw that I wasn't quite following her she volunteered to check us in online, pick our seats and print out the boarding passes - there and then whilst we stood in reception.  What customer service! I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2017,03,06
227,So loud,"Bar next door is very loud. So much door banging as well. Woke up to drilling happening close by within the hotel or bar. Personally I wouldn't stay here again, but I do like to sleep. The staff were very friendly and helpful. ",3,2017,03,04
227,Dublin break,"Stayed two nights in this really well located hotel, handy for shopping and Temple Bar area etc.  Excellent accommodation. Bedroom clean and comfortable and staff very friendly. Really good bar attached to hotel which was evident by its popularity at night. Would definitely recommend/re-visit",4,2017,03,01
227,Had a GREAT stay!,"This was our first time at the Drury Court Hotel. We enjoyed the stay, and would definitely stay here again. The hotel itself is in a fabulous location! We were able to walk EVERYWHERE!! There's a fabulous pub & eatery kitty corner from the hotel, called the Hairy Lemon that's a MUST & you can walk to Grafton St, Trinity College, Dublin Castle, St. Patrick's Cathedral, Stephen's Green.....really almost anywhere in City Center!  The staff was very courteous and helpful and gave us some great tips for places to explore!  We booked a family room, as we were traveling with a child this trip. The room was a great size for the three of us to share! There were two beds, a larger one for the two of us, and a single for the child, along with a table and two chairs, a sofa, small chest of drawers, a closet & a television. There were some minor repairs that could be made here and there, but nothing that effected the enjoyment of our stay.  We had a great experience at the Drury Court Hotel!",5,2017,02,28
227,A very nice hotel with amazing location,"A perfect location in the Temple bar area! Lots of pubs nearby (especially P. Mac's on the corner). Spacious room, comfortable bed. Easy walk to everything in the city center. Cons: separate taps for hot and cold water like in UK, some problems with the key cards.",5,2017,02,27
227,dublin visit,"cost of room was quite high on this occasion, but stayed as we always done so in the past, but if rates remain so high may have to look at alternatives in the future. 
on the good side the hotel is very well located",4,2017,02,27
227,Great Experience,"I fully recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Dublin. I stayed there twice recently and would be very happy to return.

Superbly located close to everything without being right in it, rooms well sized, good bathrooms with plenty of hot water and reasonably priced.

At the end of my first visit I had an unfortunate incident with a rogue taxi driver from the company recommended by the hotel. I advised them of it, without any expectation, merely to inform them that things weren't as they had painted, and Emma went out of her way to rectify things with the taxi company and bring about a satisfying outcome. Excellent service, and in fact all of the reception staff were naturally warm and friendly and a credit to themselves and the hotel.",5,2017,02,24
227,Great location for a quick city break!,"Excellent location to enjoy a whirlwind break, the surrounding area was lovely and a short walk to lots of great bars, restaurants and shops, as well as the typical sightseeing hot-spots! The rooms were clean, comfortable and spacious. Bar next door has a great atmosphere! Staff were always friendly and helpful. Thank you for a lovely stay!",4,2017,02,24
227,Great value and location in Dublin,"We had a smaller twin room, but for the price it was excellent! We arrived on the Airlink 747 bus and it was a short walk from the stop. Every major attraction in Dublin city center is within walking distance. The Grafton street area has plenty of tasty and unique restaurants and it's much quieter than the Temple Bar area. The room was warm, dark, and quiet for sleeping.",5,2017,02,23
227,"Very central, friendly reception","Check-in and check-out were both extremely swift. We were a group of 6 in 2 triple rooms. The rooms were not very spacious, the rooms are purely for sleeping and not for hanging around in. However the location is superb, walking distance from everything: pubs, restaurants, shops, etc. For being so central, our rooms were surprisingly quiet at night, even on the first floor. The only noise we experienced was in the evenings when other groups were pre-partying in their rooms, but we did the same, so it did not bother us.",4,2017,02,21
227,Fab. Location - Centre City,"We stayed here early in January to see a 'Panto' in the Gaiety Theatre - literally two minutes walk away. Snow had been forcasted, so we went a day earlier than we had anticipated and that extra day was absolutely fabulous - We'll be doing the same every other time we take a 'quickie' break. Staff were very friendly, courteous and helpful. Lovely room, on a corner, so we had a view (city view) from two sides. 
the break fast was really tasty and 'piping hot' cooked fresh and served to your table. A meal that would 'keep you going all day'.
The only negative in the hotel was that, immediately inside the door there was a 'watery, dampish, bathroomy kind of smell - (I only mention it so that management are aware of it so that they can address it). But in the room proper that smell didn't exist - it wouldn't prevent me from returning. There are LOADS of restaurant in the area catering for all tastes.",4,2017,02,18
227,Great stay,"Myself my sister and my 7 year old stayed here for a night, we were attending the gaiety theatre so location was brilliant! extremely helpful friendly staff, could not do enough for the guests!
Rooms were nicely decorated, clean and spacious!
We did not avail of the food in the hotel but overheard that it was fab!
Overall a lovely hotel!",5,2017,02,18
227,Friendly and central,"Centrally located yet fairly quiet area of city centre, friendly staff, good wifi and clean ..
Shower could do with a bit of work .. It's a bit ridiculous to ask someone to write more in a review than they want to !!",4,2017,02,17
227,"John and Siobhan, Ireland",From the welcome by the night porter when we arrived at 6am to the friendliness of the bar staff at midnight the staff could not have been more helpful and pleasant. The reception staff got us into the first available room at 1100 instead of 1500. After coming home from dinner we had a drink in the great really Irish bar - not just another hotel bar - but as we had a room directly above with two external walls to the street we were worried about the noise. The room was silent - top marks for sound insulation! Over all the staff were brilliant the room was comfortable and clean and the atmosphere was spot on. Fully recommend it.,5,2017,02,17
227,stop searching.,"If you are looking for... 

Friendly  service, comfy bed, fab shower pressure, lovely breakfast, central location, walkable to the whole city?

A hotel who will let you leave your bags there for free on the day you arrive & the day you leave so you can enjoy those two days before & after check-in/out?

One that doesn't cost the earth? 

Stop searching. This is the one.

Thanks folks, & a spare bowl of apples in the bag store in case the 7 fresh ones on the front desk was just a bonus :-) .",5,2017,02,16
227,Great Stay,"This location was absolutely ideal and the front desk staff were amazing. We would definitely stay there again. Our room was quite large compared to other places we have stayed in Europe and the en suite bathroom was perfect. We had plenty of water pressure and hot water. The pillows were the only draw back, they were quite firm but we would still stay there again because everything else was lovely.",4,2017,02,15
227,A recomended hotel,"The location is excellent - near Grafton street and within a walking distance from most of the main attractions. Also, there are plenty of restaurants and cafes close by.
The beds were comfortable and the staff helpful.
It is reasonably priced.
Overall - a great hotel.",5,2017,02,14
227,I would return to this great hotel centrally located in Dublin,"I stayed for a ten days in this centrally located hotel in Dublin. Room was compact but well appointed on the fifth floor of the hotel. Beds were very comfortable and I had no difficulty sleeping though the hotel faces onto a busy street.

The hotel needs to be commended for its high quality service - staff only too willing to assist in what ever request was made, from helping to hire a car, call a taxi, locate a tourist site or lend a lighter when I misplaced mine.

One of the highlights was breakfast each morning in the adjoining dining room - a great variety of food at a reasonable price. I enjoyed the bay window view every morning gazing at the busy street whilst indulging in black pudding, a memory from my youth.

Highly recommend this quiet, charming and very comfortable hotel closely located to pubs, restaurants, ATMs, and shopping centres.",5,2017,02,14
227,Delightful Dublin stay,"Lovely clean hotel, apartments in a building 2 doors down - fabulous, easy walk to Temple Bar and lots of shops around and about. Staff very friendly and helpful. Lifts to all floors so easily accessible.",5,2017,02,13
227,Lovely!! Perfect location ,"This place was perfect, we were a hen do of 14. And we stayed in the apartments side of the hotel (slightly down the road) 
Perfect location, clean and everything you needed. We needed 3 apartments to sleep us all. All rooms were lovely and comfy. We're so quiet and well kept. Obvious there are people who live here during the year and I can see why. 
Planning our next trip (4 of us) with husband's and will definitely book here again!!

227,Fine for a business trip,"Absolutely fine for a brief business trip and a great location in the centre of Dublin. Didn't have breaky so can't comment on that, but loads of places to eat nearby. Wifi good, room comfy enough but not pristine. Might be a bit noisy if you wanted windows open. Only thing negative was it was really, really hot at the start. I killed all the heating but it only got down to not too hot levels.",4,2017,02,11
227,Excellent place to stay in Dublín,"It was an excellent stay in Dublín ! The recepcionist was very kind, lovely and she recommend us everything about Dublín must visit.

227,Great base to stay at in Dublin.,"Apartments are clean and tidy, lots of room.  Move the sofa from in front of the heater as this makes the rooms a little warmer.

227,Great spot in Dublin.,"If you're looking for a convenient, comfortable, least affordable spot this is it. The receptionists were so wonderful and attentive and it was easy to get everywhere from our hotel. There was a leak from the ceiling for a bit while we were there but they were right on it and sorted it out. At least that was downstairs.",4,2017,02,07
227,Helping us celebrate,"The incredibly kind and thoughtful staff made us feel so special as we celebrated our recent engagement.  Upon arrival, we found a bottle of champagne and a lovely note in our room.  Thank you for making our day extra special and memorable!",5,2017,02,06
227,A regular at this lovely and friendly hotel ,"I stayed here regularly over a 9 month period for business.  Staff are all very friendly and helpful and they will always help with any issue.
Rooms are a good size and very comfy.  Parking is available which is a big benefit and the bar, food and coffee are all all great.  The hotel is located in Central Dublin near all amenities and tourist attractions you could want. 
I highly recommend it and will be back anytime I'm in Dublin.",5,2017,02,06
227,Perfect Location & Great Value,"Being Irish living in the U.K. I make many visits to Dublin and have stayed in numerous hotels over the years, but this was my first time at Drury Court Hotel and certainly won't be the last. Normally I don't write reviews on hotels, however I feel that on this occasion, The Drury Court Hotel deserves a review.
The hotel is perfectly located for my needs, moments away from Stephen's Green Shopping Centre and Grafton Street, and in very close proximity to the sights, bars and restaurants Dublin has to offer.
The staff at check in were amazingly friendly and extremely helpful in suggesting vegetarian and Mexican restaurants to dine in. Check is was also speedy and smooth. I only wish I'd made a note of the ladies' names as they deserve a special mention for their exceptional service. 
The hotel itself was very clean and the room perfect for a city break with everything one would need. The guest rooms were comfortable and tastefully decorated and very clean.
We were only at the hotel one night before travelling to Kilkenny the next day and unfortunately didn't have time sample the hotel's food.
I would have no hesitation in choosing this hotel on my next visit to Dublin and would highly recommend it for its location, cleanliness, value for money and last, but by no means least, the exceptional service provided by its staff. My only regret is that we were only there one night. Next time I will certainly stay for longer and look forward to my next visit. Thank you Drury Court Hotel.",5,2017,02,06
227,Good  value,"Friendly  helpful  front desk staff, breakfast  very good  variety choice, location  perfect, bar area and choices  of drinks were amazing,no downside to note at all overall good value  for money  on my daughters  birthday  and 1st time in Dublin  made really welcome",5,2017,02,03

227,2 night stay,"Really enjoyed our 2 night stay here while visiting Dublin. Very clean, rooms were lovely decorated and the windows blocked out sound from the busy street below. Staff were friendly, on our arrival we had no idea how to get around but the receptionist gave us a map and showed us where to find the main things. Check out was 12 but our flight wasn't until 7pm, we were allowed to leave our luggage with reception so we could enjoy our last day around Dublin. Overall a fantastic stay, will definitely recommend to others! ",5,2017,02,03
227,Excellent Hotel,"We had a great experience from the moment we arrived.  We got into Dublin very early and they graciously kept our luggage and treated us to coffee until a room was available.  When they room was ready, they contacted us to let us know and we were able to get in and relax a bit before heading out to visit tourist attractions.  The room was large for a European hotel and very clean.  Above all, the staff assisted us with reservations, taxis, tips of things to see, and more.  Very friendly!
",5,2017,02,02
227,Excellent Location,"We stayed here in January 2017 on a long weekend visit to Dublin.  the hotel is in a fantastic location with seemingly everything you'd want to do within an easy walk (with the caveat that we took a taxi to Kilmainham Gaol to save a bit of time).  Rooms themselves were quite large by typical European standards and comfortable.  Desk clerks were always pleasant and helpful.  We did encounter a maintenance issue during our stay (we were told a radiator pipe had burst in a neighboring room), but the hotel was quick to cleanup and repair the problem.  Overall, good stay, would stay here again.",5,2017,02,02
227,Great location!,"Modern, clean rooms and nice and helpful staff. It's in a great location near Grafton street shopping and many restaurants and bars. It is a great choice if you like to be in the center of things. You might want to look for another area if you want quiet.",5,2017,02,01

227,Great location and excellent value,"Our first trip to Dublin, did not quite know where to book.  This is in the heart of Dublin, nice large apartment with 2 bedrooms for 4 of us.  The hotel itself is located in an area with nightlife, so can be a bit noisy.  We were 2 doors down in an apartment building, which was great, as we really did not hear any street noises.  Kitchen was a bit small, but there were pubs, restaurants, and supermarkets everywhere.  Bedrooms were comfortable, and all amenities provided.  Had a bit of a problem with wifi, but the staff was super friendly and fixed it.",5,2017,01,16
227,Great hotel,"Stayed here for 2 nites on a couples wkend away, lovely clean hotel, central location staff very helpful and friendly, great nitelfie around and within walking distance would definitely recommend and would stay here again",5,2017,01,15
227," Nice Hotel - can be loud at night",Thoroughly enjoyed a 2 night stay. Room was very large and well finished. Bathroom was also large and very good. Hotel staff were more than accommodating. Only small issue is that it can be quiet noisy at night being across the road as well as next door to pubs. That being said I'd happily stay here again,4,2017,01,12
227,Great location,"The hotel has excellent staff, always ready to help. It`s very clean, cozy, comfortable. The only disadvantage - different faucets for hot and cold water. A very good food was at the restaurant  ""Hairy lemon"" next to the hotel.",5,2017,01,12
227,Gaiety Family Break,"Myself, my partner and our 2 children (aged 5 and 1) stayed here on the 03/01/17. Prior to arriving I phoned ahead to request a cot for the youngest and also to ask about parking, reception staff could not have been more helpful.  

The hotel itself is fine, a bit tired looking but fine. The reception staff again were very friendly and efficient during check in. Provided milk for 2 bottles at no charge for the baby.  The location was excellent, a two minute walk from Grafton street, the Gaeity and Stephens Green. We parked in Stephens Green Q Car Park and with the hotel discount it only cost us €12.50 (as opposed to over €35) 

I was nervous about staying from reading some of the negative reviews but to be honest, you get what you pay for, it's a 3* hotel in Dublin City centre, for very reasonable money. I would highly recommend it, its clean, friendly staff, great shower and within walking distance from everything. ",4,2017,01,08
227,Good hotel location,"Hotel is close to Grafton Street and great shopping locations. Beds are very comfortable, and bathrooms are large and newly renovated. Free wifi! Staff attentive to needs. 

Huge size rooms for European hotel. Tea and biscuits provided in room after each cleaning. Each room has a safe attached to dresser. 

Spent five days here over New Years, and it was very fun! Safe area",4,2017,01,04
227,"Perfect Dublin base, especially for first timers","Hotel is perfectly located for enjoying Dublin!  I stayed a few days ahead of Christmas and was able to quickly join tours and go Christmas shopping along Grafton Street...I could easily shop and drop items back at the hotel.  The other big plus about this hotel was the incredibly friendly and helpful staff, when you are jetlagged in a new country, this is of utmost importance! Stayed in the small single room, and it was perfectly sized and very comfortable with a full-sized bed, a desk, sizeable closet and spacious bathroom.  There was some problem with hot and cold water in the shower, but not a big deal.  The hotel closed early ahead of Christmas and could not store luggage after checkout, but they made up for the inconvenience by providing information on storage at the Tourist Office...and now this tidbit of information will encourage more Dublin stopovers b/c it couldn't be easier to stop in!  P.Macs pub is located within the hotel building and frequented by locals and it was quite rowdy during the holidays, but I had noise-cancelling headphones so it wasn't a big deal.  But if you think this would bother you, ask for a quiet room location.  Personally, I loved my room!  Will be back, you can't get a better deal and with nicer people!",4,2017,01,04
227,Perfect 100%,I can't recommend this hotel enough. The location is perfect and the rooms are a great size and very clean. The one thing that made it extra special though was the brilliant customer service. All staff we came across were so friendly and helpful. We will definitely stay here again when we next visit Dublin & recommend to friends and family- perfect! ,5,2017,01,03
227,Great value,Booked a room for 3 great price a day lovely greeting on arrival great value in car park in Stephens green car park 24 hours for 12.50 rooms clean and quiet the location is great for sight seeing and shopping  .,5,2017,01,02
227,Good location and cool bar attached ,"Rooms and bathroom spacious enough for a few days.  Well appointed and very clean.

Reception staff were very friendly and offered great advice.

Location perfect for sightseeing and access to temple bar!!

P Mac's has a cool vibe, again staff great and good selection of food.  Quirky menu 🍴 

Would definitely book to stay here again. ",4,2017,01,01
227,Good value for money,Got a 120 euro deal for one nite stay on booking. Com. Place is ideally located for shopping and nite scene. Expected it to be really noisy with the location but wasn't.  You get what you pay for. Clean rooms and friendly staff. Would recommend for a short stay without hesitation.  ,3,2016,12,31
227,"Convenient, clean, outstanding customer service","Wonderful recent stay at the Drury Court. You couldn't get a better location if you want to be near city centre. The rooms are simple, but very clean and well-outfitted. The real highlight of staying at this hotel, however, was the customer service. All staff I encountered were very friendly and helpful, and made everything just so easy. Would definitely stay there again.",5,2016,12,30
227,3 Bed Apt - Wonderful Location,"Our family of 2 adults and 3 teenagers stayed on a 3 bedroom apartment that is part of this hotel. It was a great size and very clean and warm. There were plenty of towels for all. We received a warm welcome at check-in and were able to park in one of the hotels own parking spaces at the rear of the hotel. This is very handy and also very secure.
It is so well located for Grafton Street and has numerous cafes/ restaurants and bars within minutes of its front door. I have no complaints about this hotel but I do have one recommendation ...each of the bedrooms has a regular sized double bed (4ft 6inches) and I think that one of the bedrooms should have at least a kingsize (5ft) which is now the industry standard for a double room. The hotel doubles may have this size bed in its rooms but the apartment doesn't.
Thank you for a wonderful stay.",4,2016,12,20
227,Perfect for family ,Our family of 5 (with 3 children)had a wonderful stay at the Drury Court Hotel. Excellent location and good facilities. Good for families with children who get tired easily. Only gripe was that the internet was a bit slow (which was also true for our supposedly 3G sim). ,5,2016,12,19
227,Good for Price,"We stayed one night here and enjoyed it. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel itself needs a little work. Lamp shades, chairs, and the bathroom are a little dated, but for the price it's a fair trade. My only complaint is while it was clean, it didn't seem clean enough. I hope that makes sense. Overall if you are looking for a cheaper place to stay with friendly staff and a great central location then this is a great choice. ",3,2016,12,17
227,"Friendly, great location, clean and comfortable","I was looking for a hotel close to Trinity and to the National Library of Ireland. From previous reviews, I chose the Drury Court. Its been really good - the rooms are a good size and comfortable, wifi works well, and you are close to everything. Staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful. Only downside is that this is a really active area of bars and clubs (which explains a lot of its appeal), and street noise, despite triple glazing, can disturb your sleep.",4,2016,12,16
227,Overnight stay,"Perfect hotel for my requirements. Solo lady catching up with friends. Wouldn't hesitate to stay there again. Great location. Plenty of bars, shopping, restaurants, theatres close by. Friendly helpful staff. ",5,2016,12,14
227,Weekend with friends ,"Good place to stay if you need something in a centre near clubs and pubs. Good service, nice and clean room. All my best to Adrian at the reception very helpful. Luas stop just around the corner, which is very useful. ",4,2016,12,13
227,A great location for Dublin's bar scene,"Really friendly and helpful staff who welcomed us warmly and were extremely useful with recommending bars and places to eat.
The hotel itself is well worn and not luxury by any standard but it is super central for Dublin's bars and tourist attractions. If you just need somewhere central to enjoy the city, this hotel is well placed. Beware though, you will experience noise on busy bar/pub nights.
The staff are the best part of this hotel.",3,2016,12,13
227,Great location with the most helpful staff,"Good location within easy walking distance of most sites. The staff could not have been more helpful, providing us with our room early, advising on buses etc & even spending time  looking for  restaurants for us on what turned out to be a very busy weekend. Both restaurants were excellent for there class.
Room was comfortable & always clean.
Good breakfast in what the night before had been a very busy bar (though it did not disturb us on the 2nd floor).",5,2016,12,12
227,Dublin Gem Hotel,"Fantastic stay at the Drury Court Hotel, simple rooms with wonderful staff. This was our 7th year in a row staying here for our annual Christmas trip and could not praise it enough. Will be returning for Christmas 2017, can't wait.",4,2016,12,12
227,Great location,Stayed here twice over 12 month period. Both occasions were very comfortable with very helpful staff. The 2nd occasion was a last minute back up for a party of 4 after accommodation booked elsewhere proved misleading. Quiet location with great options for pubs and restaurants nearby,4,2016,12,09
227,Lovely hotel lovely staff,Very friendly and helpful staff. Hotel is perfectly located in the city. Room was quite large and warm. Hotel very secure also and parking was an added bonus at 7 euro for the night. Can't comment on food as didn't eat there as only on an overnight stay. Would recomend to anyone looking for place in the heart of the city ,5,2016,12,09
227,Best location,"This is a moderate, but totally satisfactory hotel, located in the heart of Dublin's shopping district.  It is not one of large gleaming, dazzling foyer types of hotel.  The foyer is very small as is the reception.  It is a great location for a short town visit where the hotel is needed for sleep and the basics.  Having said that, the room that I stayed in was very well presented, very clean and the bed was very comfortable.  All the usual facilities were provided - bath with shower (which was very good) wc, wash basin, safe, proper hairdryer, tea/coffee facilities.  A shaving/make-up mirror would be a good upgrade to the room.  The bathroom was well lit.  The 4th floor room was very quiet which is good after a day walking around Dublin!  There was adequate storage and wardrobe space and good, free Wi-Fi.  The room deal was room only.  Breakfast could have been purchased in P-Macs (a bar at any other time of the day) which did not appeal.  However, there are cafes (see other reviews) a couple of minutes towards Grafton Street.",4,2016,12,09
227,"Whirl wind weekend, but restful sleep","I have been staying in student housing while studying in Liverpool & the noise made sleeping difficult. Staying at the Drury Court was clean, warm, & QUIET which I & my friend much appreciated.  Best nights sleep since we arrived in Europe. The staff at check-in were friendly & even helped up find things to do in the city. We couldn't have covered as much (several tours: city and country side & a pub crawl) as we did had in the  weekend without their help!  Thanks Drury Court Hotel - we had a blast! ",5,2016,12,08
227,Central location and friendly staff,"My friend and I stayed in a twin room at this hotel (2 separate single-sized beds). The room size isn't large, but it's not cramped either. We had plenty of room to move around. We didn't experience any street noise as the windows are well-insulated and doubled up, with the older windows on the street side.
It is a wonderfully convenient location for visiting most of the Dublin city sights and shopping (souvenir and clothes shopping). Most sights were within 5-10 minutes walk and all of our tour bus pickup locations were less than a 20 minute walk, (usually across the bridge).
There are plenty of pubs and restaurants nearby to choose from if you'd like variety outside of the hotel restaurant, but the hotel restaurant itself is very good. They also provide room service, and if you have an early morning tour, they may be able to provide a small ""continental"" breakfast if the kitchen has opened. It's worth asking.
The Irish, vegetarian and continental breakfasts were all delicious. There's plenty to choose from, even for ""picky"" eaters. I do recommend stepping outside the hotel restaurant at least once to try breakfast at one of the nearby cafes as these also proved to be really delicious, affordable and a great way to experience more of the local lifestyle.
The staff are really lovemy and helpful. If you have an early flight out, the front desk cannarrange to have a taxi ready to pick you up in the morning at a very reasonable set rate.
I would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,12,08
227,Recommend to anyone!!!,"My second visit to Dublin, the first time we stayed far out of the centre of town so I was conscious to book somewhere close, this is an absolutely ideal location, just far enough for it not to be too expensive and rowdy but close enough to walk into temple bar and the shopping areas. Rooms and absolutely immaculate, we were in a 3 bedroom apartment and it was amazing. Only slight criticism is befween7 of us we were only provided with 1 key which was a problem when leaving at different times on a night out, on the first night we got knocked out of bed but the second night we realised how safe we felt and just left the door open (not so others would know). Would stay here again in a heartbeat ",5,2016,12,07
227,Fantastic hotel ,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights, and we could not fault it. The staff were so welcoming and informative, the rooms were lovely and we had everything we needed. It was clean and spacious and the maid came everyday. Very well located hotel, close to everything with lovely bars and restaurants all around. It's about an 8 minute walk away from the airport shuttle stop and to the hop on/off bus. Only downside was a workman banging into the walls at 7.30am and woke us up. As we are a working couple a lie in would have been nice. Apart from that, it's everything you could wish for. ",4,2016,12,05
227,Very secure comfortable hotel,Stayed one night and first appearance it has  quite a small lobby but clean and warm and welcoming. Secure access with card to lifts and rooms which make you feel safer. Rooms while a bit dated were very clean and warm with all the toiletries one would need. I had a problem with work related noise(drilling hammering) in the next door building at 7am so not a great start to the day. Staff were very apologetic and waived the cost of our breakfast which was served in PJ's next door. All in all a nice hotel in a good location with very friendly staff,4,2016,12,03
227,"Great location, comfortable rooms","The location of this hotel cannot be beat - walking distance from almost everything you want to see, and there are so many restaurants nearby.  Check out P.Mac's pub next door - one of my favorite pubs of the trip.

The rooms were also comfortable, and the desk staff was very friendly.  We were able to check in a few hours early, which was amazing after a red eye flight to Dublin.",5,2016,12,02
227,"Great location, good value","Fantastic location with restaurants, shopping, and major attractions within walking distance, convenient for the Airport Express 747 bus. Clean, comfortable hotel with triple glazing so surprisingly quiet in the room. Friendly and helpful front desk. Highly recommended.",5,2016,12,01
227,Would stay again ,Fantastic location with loads of restaurants and bars in close proximity. Room and bathroom were very clean and bed was comfortable. Staff were friendly and helpful. Was on the second floor and didn't have any problems with noise although that may be because it was mid-week. Would definitely stay again.,5,2016,11,30
227,Perfectly located hotel,"We stayed here for 1 night and the front desk staff were very lovely, couldn't do enough for you! Hotel is located in the heart of Dublin with the majority of attractions and shops within 10 minutes walk. Bathroom was a little bit dated but everything was clean and the bed was very comfy. Would definitely stay here again!",4,2016,11,28
227,Lovely little hotel in the heart of Dublin,"A short visit to Dublin, but the hotel was nice and friendly and the 'pub' as part of It is perfect, full in the evening so did not get the chance in the evening, but had breakfast in there with my three colleagues what a great oldie world setting and the food cooked to order was the best I've had and seen in many a year.  If you like this sort of small hotel then highly recommended..",4,2016,11,27
227,Didn't Love It...,"Pros:  Area around hotel is fun, lively; Bathroom is updated with great shower; Coffee in room; Clean; Secured access to rooms/elevator from lobby

Cons:  Rooms look like worn motel; Beds rock hard; Sink has two spigots so either hot or cold water; No computer access, front desk will print boarding passes if you email to them; Not as close as other hotels to Airlink to DUB, about 15 min walk

Other: Bfast at PMacs next door was OK, ate there once and then decided to go elsewhere next two mornings (go to Taste down the block!); 

Requested adjoining rooms and got them; Requested higher/quiet floor and did not get this

Rating of 3 for ""meh""... Just OK, but I would stay elsewhere next time in Dublin.",3,2016,11,27
227,Wonderful Hotel!,"Great Staff and location.  The parking deck was right down the street, restaurants and bar are all right there. We went in November and are room was warm and cozy. Bathrooms are up to date. The apartments are very spacious.",5,2016,11,21
227,Lovely,Clean rooms. Some reviewers said that it was noisy but it didn't bother me much. It is pretty close to the city center. Receptionists were very friendly and suggested us some places to visit. Recommended. ,5,2016,11,21
227,Dreary Court,"Shortly put the hotel didn't meet my expectations based on reviews. There's a busy and noisy bar on ground floor and I got a room on the 1st floor which to a light sleeper with an early morning followed by a busy day was terrible. Luckily it quieted down after midnight (on a weekday). I also was given a room on second floor for two following nights which helped. However, the rooms were dated with old decor, holes on walls, uncomfortable lighting and a spider greeting me on the bed upon arrival (mind you that the room rate was over 150 € per night).

For exploring the city center the location is great and I enjoyed a morning run in nearby St. Stephen's Green. The staff was also very friendly and helpful.

I guess it's the kind of hotel you might learn to love over time and could enjoy if partying and shopping is your thing, but for a business trip it was a poor choice.",2,2016,11,19
227,Ideal place,"Lovely clean good sized apartment with good facilities tidy and kitted out with plenty of kitchen items; cooker, microwave, fridges etc. In a central location with helpful staff. Very good standard of accommodation ",5,2016,11,18
227,Return visit,"This was not my first time to stay here.  As ever. the staff , from arrival to checkout, were fabulous. All smiles and nothing was too much trouble. Room was spotless and comfortable.Location is right in the city centre and within walking distance of shops, pubs, restaurants, cafes.Great location from which to see all the sights.",5,2016,11,18
227,"Last Minute, Great Find and Booking!","With tickets for the Gaiety on my last evening in Ireland recently, I made a last minute booking at the Drury Court Hotel, due to its proximity to the theatre and a special offer. It was a total surprise! I stay in the area yearly and had never known about or considered this one. I was lucky to secure one of their parking spaces, an added bonus. The staff was friendly and efficient. The room and bath were immaculate and offered every amenity I needed. Its location is superb and I hope to pay this one another visit. Based on my one experience, I can highly recommend the Drury Court Hotel as a great option in its price range! The lobby is small, rendering needed services and not much more, although there is a small seating area. If you are not in need of high-end luxury, give this one a look!",4,2016,11,18
227,not a thing to complain about,"Friendliest receptionist.  Clean room was ready.  Everything in top working condition.  Comfortable beds.
The receptionist circled Dublin downtown areas on a map, thus making sense of just a lot of streets. The hotel booked a day tour for us after helping us choose one.  I highly recommend this boutique hotel in an excellent location near restaurants, stores, transport.  
Tip:  phone the hotel itself to make your booking.",5,2016,11,17
227,Dublin for a night,"location, location! Everything we wanted to see was within walking distance for us ladies in need of their own space before flying back to the U.S. Although the majority of our stay was central Ireland, we were very glad to have spent our final day and night in Dublin.",4,2016,11,17
227,Weekend in Dublin with my daughter - Excellent experience staying at the Drury Court Hotel,"Our room was large and had a romantic feeling.  The location of the hotel is superb.  The breakfast was perfect.  The staff at the reception were outstanding and incredibly helpful with our many requests.  It was our first time at the Drury Court Hotel , we will stay there again and highly recommend staying there.",5,2016,11,16
227,Very nice place to stay,"The room was great and the staff was very accommodating. They recommended different places to go and restaurants to eat at. The room was clean and nice and the wall heaters worked very well. Also, when the hair drier didn't work, the front desk brought up a spare to use. Very good experience here.",4,2016,11,15
227,Fall in love with Dublin from this Hotel,"Excellent location, staff very friendly and helpful. Rooms clean, quiet, cosy & comfortable. Serves a great breakfast at a reasonable price. The breakfast will set you up nicely for a day of sightseeing and shopping",5,2016,11,15
227,Good Quality with Friendly staff,"We stayed at the Drury Court in August for 2 nights whilst visiting friends who live nearby.
On arrival if your room is not ready then there is a left luggage area so you can go off sightseeing without being hindered by your bags.
The front desk staff are extremely helpful and have advice and ideas of where to go and eat.
The rooms are a good size and very clean and quiet.  Its an ideal central location with good access to all the main attractions.
Breakfast is available at the bar next door for about 10 Euros.",4,2016,11,14
227,Great location,"It is a few minute walk from Temple Bar and has numerous restaurants and shops around it. The staff is great and the rooms were nice and clean. The airport express drops off 5-7 minutes away, Overall I really like the hotel.",5,2016,11,14
227,"Nice Rooms,  and Fantastic location.","The rooms are nice and clean,  the location is fantastic, coupled with a very  friendly and knowledgeable staff.  Highly recommend staying here.  Only downside is breakfast is extra and serviced through an adjoining restaurant but there are plenty of great eats around.",4,2016,11,14
227,Initially worried because of proximity to pub etc - no need to worry,"This hotel is not a luxury hotel, but it is clean (if slightly dated) and very well managed. The location is also excellent - very close to pub/theatre/crazy land and also within walking distance of St.Stephen's Green and Dublin Castle. The staff are very friendly and also helpful.
When I arrived and noticed that my hotel on the second floor was directly above M Pacs pub, I was really worried as I'd always suffered with noisy pubs in Dublin. There was nothing to worry about though - the double glazing etc was excellent and I slept very well. Comfortable firm bed, great pillows, large bath - although the room was queen sized. Very clean. What you don't have in the room e.g iron and ironing board you ask for (dial 9) and it arrives super quick.
Best thing of all though is the pub! You can access the pub in the morning straight from the hotel for breakfast - great value and great quality; nice leisurely breakfast and the papers. I also recommend the pub for lunch also - eclectic menu and great craft beers.
All in all, great little hotel (nothing fancy) and fantastic adjoining pub.",4,2016,11,14
227,A place to recommend,"Stayed here for two nights on a family celebration. This looked central and we got a very reasonable package. The taxi from the airport took a while as we got caught in some traffic, ended up paying more than expected. The hotel was in a central spot, friendly reception staff. It's on a busy street but the noise didn't bother us once inside the room. The vending machine on our floor was handy and the breakfast was a good one. We didn't use the hotel as much as normal because we were out and about so much, but the little we saw we liked. Very friendly,  pleasant staff and good value for Dublin.",5,2016,11,12
227,Very satisfied,"We appreciated this hotel. A three star more than worth it.
Very near to city centre with decent ans quiet rooms!
Breakfast is very good - espacially the Full Irish ...
And last but not least; all this comes with a very friendly and warm welcome and service during the stay!

",5,2016,11,11
227,Very welcoming!,This hotel was so cozy and clean and everyone of the staff members were so friendly and helpful. I felt like it was my home away from home and it was my first visit to Ireland. I surely would go back to this country and especially to this hotel. ,5,2016,11,10
227,Superb,After a mishap at a different hotel my friends and I quickly looked online n found this place and booked it. We ran across the city n checked into what was a friendly very helpful reception. Brilliant service and a fab apartment to stay in. We will be coming back for sure. Rooms could have been a bit warmer but other than that no faults at all. Thanks 👍🏻👍🏻,5,2016,11,08
227,Very quiet and comfortable,"The location of the hotel was wonderful and convenient to city centre. The staff was very helpful. My room was comfortable, quiet, clean and spacious. I would have liked a little more lighting by the desk area. Also, the only elevator was a bit slow. I would stay here again as it was overall very nice.",4,2016,11,07
227,Central Location ,We stayed for two nights and wanted a hotel that was at the heart of the city and the Drury Court fits the bill. The hotel is really well looked after and the reception staff are very helpful. Ideal for Temple Bar and many of the central attractions. Will definitely use the hotel again.,5,2016,11,07
227,I will be back,"Spend just the one night in the hotel. Convenient, secure, comfortable and very quiet. But THE most important thing for me was the fabulous staff at reception. Friendly, interesting and caring. The hotels greatest asset and the reason I will stay there again. ",5,2016,11,07
227,Excellent accommodation,Friendly and helpful staff. Comfortable and clean room. Located close to attractions and shopping. They were able to accommodate an early check in for us and recommended great local shops and designers.,5,2016,11,05
227,Super stay,"My husband & I with our 11 year old daughter stayed for 2 nights . Staff very helpful, put us at the back of the hotel as quieter without us asking . Great location, room a little tired but super clean and all you could need. Breakfast OK but lots of great places just on your door step. Would stay again . ",4,2016,11,05
227,great stay,"Great central location, decent room, comfortable bed. I arrived quite late and wanted to eat before restaurants close. The lovely lady at reception rang round looking for somewhere nice with the kitchen still open and reserved for me without me even asking. After a lovely meal I headed back but was disappointed to see the staff had changed. I needn't have worried the man now on reception was equally helpful sorting out my boarding pass, taxi, and early start efficiently and with a smile. Well done guys you turned a good hotel into a fantastic stay - I'll definitely come back",5,2016,11,04
227,halloweeen break,very friendly hotel convenient to city centre. Rooms are spacious and clean  . Lots of places  to visit within easy reach . We were able to leave our baggage and collect it when were were ready to leave. Good deal with nearby parking space. lots of nice places to have breakfast nearby ,5,2016,11,04
227,Good Location,It was ok. Beds a bit hard. Stayed in 2 different rooms. One had a/c the other did not. People were very friendly and very helpful with all our request. I picked it for location and price. It was close walking to all the old part of the city. ,3,2016,11,03
227,Fab stay,As always wonderful stay at Drury Court hotel. Brilliant location very friendly professional staff clean hotel  Have stayed here numerous times and it has never failed to please us always recommend this hotel,5,2016,11,03
227,A nice experience,"Central location, friendly staff, clean room, secured wifi connection. I did not have the time to try/taste their breakfast though. I appreciated the locked door separating the living quarters from the common rooms.",4,2016,11,03
227,"Fantastic Location, Dated Rooms","This hotel is in a fantastic location.  Our room was clean, large enough and while the neighborhood is lively the street noise is reasonable.  The bathroom is a bit small and the tub is rather high in fact so high that it would be difficult for anyone with knee problems, age or balance issues, etc. to get in and out of. 

We booked a three person room which had a double bed and a single twin.  The hotel is rather no frills.  The breakfast buffet which you can add to your room is nice and you get full access to the entire hot and cold menu including a small buffet.  This same restaurant turns into a lively locals bar in the evening and is a great spot.

This hotel is a three minute walk to the St. Stephens Green Mall, about 10 to Temple Bar or Trinity College.  The location is fantastic as it is out of the semi gross Temple Bar tourist area but close enough to get where you want.  It is in a higher end shopping area with cute local markets, boutique shops and some great local food.

I would absolutely recommend this hotel. I just wish they would repaint, carpet, and re-do the bathrooms.  Beds were also a bit tired.",4,2016,10,31
227,Awesome hotel!,We had a great experience. The hotel staff was very friendly.  There was someone at the front desk 24/7. The rooms were very clean. The location is great.  Right in the center of all the action in Dublin.,5,2016,10,31
227,3rd stay - marathon weekend,"This is our 3rd stay - always marathon weekend and we've had 3 great and different experiences. First time 1 night b&b with family, second time for 3 nights great value with family and food and this time just as a couple. Staff couldn't be more helpful and hotel perfect location for marathon and central to many attractions. We'll probably be back next year - hubby just needs to recover from this one first.

227,In the heart of it all,"Spent two weeks in this boutique hotel while working in Dublin.  The hotel is situated in the heart of it all...easy to walk to restaurants, bars, monuments and bus.  Hotel staff are very nice and accommodating",4,2016,10,28
227,Location is great,"The best 2 things about the Drury are the location and the people at the desk.  I am a seasoned traveler and know things can go wrong, but I've never had three things overlooked before - so avoidable.  There were no towels when I got to my room, the do not disturb sign on my door was ignored - I was surprised to find my room made up when I did not want anyone in there, and the hairdryer didn't work - of course that's something you don't know until you need it.  ",3,2016,10,27
227,Dublin visit Oct 2016,This hotel was located in Drury where locals gather and have dinner and pint or two. just about 2 minute walks will get you to S. William street with so many choices of restaurants. Drury hotel is close enough to all tourist activities but not in middle of it. Friendly staff and great service.,5,2016,10,27
227,great location/ can't be beat/ nice hotel,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. Felt that we got a good price, it was a very comfortable hotel and in walking distance in the heart of dublin to so many things.....great location. I highly recommend it for friends, couples.",5,2016,10,26
227,"Great location, good rooms at very reasonable cost!!","This hotel is great! Our room was large and clean, and staff so helpful! We asked for a crib for our 12month old- they brought it right away and were so sweet and had so much info about tours etc. There's an elevator which is much needed with a stroller. Amazing location right in TempleBar area- so many restaurants and shops and the St-Stephens park is about 5mins. Walk. All this for a very reasonable price. We are definitely staying here again. ",5,2016,10,23
227,Wonderful little hotel,"Drury Court is a little gem, well located with easy walking distance to major attractions in Dublin.  My room was clean, much bigger than I expected.  Even though there is a bar at ground floor, once my windows were shut I did not hear a thing. What surprised me the most is that I never heard anything from near by rooms or overhead rooms, even though I was told they were fully booked.  It was a pleasure to stay here.",5,2016,10,23
227,Home away from home!,Stayed at Drury while visiting our daughter studying abroad in Dublin. Perfect location and very comfortable clean rooms with excellent BR facilities. A must for us. Staff is wonderful! So hospitable and helpful. They even kept our large suitcases for while detoured to the countryside with our smaller more managable bags.  Great value!,4,2016,10,19
227,Great hotel walking distance to everything!,"We were very happy with our stay at the Drury Court Hotel.  Staff were very helpful and friendly. We were walking distance to everything (Temple Bar, Trinity College etc) Would hightly recommend this hotel and would definitely return:)",5,2016,10,18
227,Good nights stay,Stopped here when could not get into the Brooks Hotel. Was very comfortable and fitted the need for 1 nights accommodation in the area that i usually stay. Pleasant people on reception and at breakfast the next morning.,4,2016,10,18
227,The staff is the key.,"We stayed at Drury Court for 5 nights in September.  Our room was decent sized (I never expect a large room in a city).  The bathroom was quite large.   The room and common areas were very clean.  

The staff was very friendly and helpful with suggestions for places to eat, etc.  The hotel is well located with many attractions, dining and shopping within walking distance.

While we enjoyed our stay, it was the staff (and what happened after our stay) that cemented our review of the Drury Court:  On the way to the airport, my husband left a backpack with our passports, electronics, cash and other items in the taxi.  We quickly called the hotel from the airport.  Hannah, at the desk, was able to track down the driver but he'd ended his shift and turned off his phone.  We were able to leave Ireland without the passports and emailed the hotel when we got to Chicago.  They informed us they'd already spoken with the driver and he would return it.  I then communicated with Sorcha and she attempted to send it back, but due to specific regulations wasn't able to.   Sorcha assured me that it would be kept secure until arrangements were made.  One week later we received our backpack with all contents intact.  I cannot thank the staff of Drury Court (as well as the taxi driver) for going above and beyond.  The people of Ireland are wonderful and when we return, it will include a stay at Drury Court.",5,2016,10,15
227,Couldn't Be Any Better,"After a few days each in both London and Amsterdam followed by a Rhine River Cruise we could have gone home, however we had 4 more days scheduled in Dublin.

We arrived at the Drury Court a little after 1 PM and upon check in were happily advised our room (on the floor we requested) was ready. After 12 days of travel we had laundry to be attended to and left at front desk along with inquiring on restaurant recommendations which proved to be spot on. We were advised laundry would be back the next day and headed out for lunch and initial sight-seeing. When we got to the hotel a few hours later our clean laundry was waiting for us!

We enjoyed lovely full breakfasts each morning in the Pub adjoining and all questions/requests were immediately responded to by hotel staff. On our final evening we made arrangements with hotel staff for our departing travel home which was handled quite efficiently.

Once back home and settled in the US, I realized I had left a few items of clothing in our room's dresser and assumed they were gone for good, however I decided to email hotel on a hope they had been retrieved. I also wondered that if items were found would I be able to get them returned to me without it being necessary to return to Dublin, which was not cost effective. Within 2 hours I had a response from hotel staff that housekeeping did not have the items, but the room would be checked. Within 10 hours  staff informed me the items were where I had left them and via a few more email communications we arranged to have them sent back to me in San Francisco for a much more than reasonable cost. I also want to add that my communications with staff on this particular issue was handled so smoothly, although I dealt with different members, it was transparent. I, NOT ONCE had to repeat my issue and it was most certainly my issue, but they took the extra step to help me out.

We had a wonderful stay in Dublin in part for the Drury Court. I will not hesitate to stay there my next visit to Dublin. The location, cleanliness, staff accessibility and attention to detail was more than excellent.",5,2016,10,13
227,Excellent front desk staff,"We needed one additional night stay in Dublin last minute. Although they had no hotel rooms available, they did have a 3 bedroom apartment for rent right next door. The accommodations were OK and met our needs. 

What was particularly outstanding about this hotel was the front desk staff. They went above and beyond in a very sincere and friendly manner to take care of us. From printing event tickets, to check on reservations etc.. they were simply wonderful.",4,2016,10,13
227,downtown Dublin fun.,"Excellent service, quick response to requests for amenities like ice and ironing board. Staff was very pleasant and helpful.    Room  was spacious enough for the three of us, beds were comfortable, bath and room very clean.",5,2016,10,11
227,"Clean,Quiet,Comfortable and Centrally located","We received a very friendly and efficient welcome at reception
The beds were comfortable and room servicing was to a high standard
We would certainly Book here again
Our room was  located on the 4th floor",5,2016,10,09
227,Weekend for 2 fall in Dublin,"We had 3 great days in Dublin Drury Court hotel. The hotel is situated the best place in Dublin. Lots of shops bars and restaurants. In walking distance from attraktions like Guinness, Castle and Temple bar. The hotel i clean and average in regards of interiør. You can hear noise from street in the evening from bars nearby. For the prise you get god value. ",4,2016,10,09
227,Great Place to stay,Great location for doing things around Dublin.  The breakfast is worth having!  Great drinks and other food there also.  Staff were really nice. The rooms were great with comfortable bed and pillows and nice bathroom.,4,2016,10,06
227,Nice Hotel & Good Location,"Visited this place last December and going back here again next week with mates!

Nice, clean and tidy hotel, nothing to scream about, breakfast was nice without being anything amazing, its a 10 minute walk to the Guinness Factory and about 5/10 minutes to Temple Bar (where all the night life is) 

Would recommend for big groups looking to go out in Dublin and looking for something clean and well looked after without it being too flashy.

Just a heads up that you will not want to be sleeping in a room at the front of the hotel as the main road gets very busy and noisy!",4,2016,10,04
227,Drury,"Great hotel excellent staff, very helpful
and professional.we had the room over the bar which was noisy one night but the room was clean and the wine selections are good. Room was cleaned and renewed every day.",5,2016,09,29
227,Helpful staff and good location,We were able to walk to most locations and transportation hubs.  The staff were quite helpful as we chose locations for breakfast and dinner.  Also got personal service emailing with them as I planned our trip.,5,2016,09,28
227,"Very central, nice and quiet.  ","Perfect location for having a wander.  Beautiful reception area and a lovely warm welcome.  No it's not perfection but it has everything we need, quiet room, comfy bed, great shower.    Anything extra we have asked for has been provided with a smile.    Yes I'd stay here again and will recommend it to friends.   ",4,2016,09,28
227,Very clean accommodations ,"This is a basic hotel well located and priced fairly.  Stephen's Green,  the indoor mall (Stephen Greens Shopping Centre), and many more Dublin attractions and restaurants within walking distance 
 I cant say enough about the very friendly and helpful staff..they really are the best.
",5,2016,09,25
227,Good location ,"The hotel is very clean, it seems to have been recently refurbished as the decor and fittings were all of a very good standard. The reception staff are extremely helpful. Located very near to St Stephen's Green and Grafton Street it is great for visiting the various attractions. The one drawback is that it is very near to the pubs and one Pub is directly below the hotel, the result is that if you have your window open you will have to listen to the jovial drinkers below your room until the early morning which is a bit annoying after a couple of days. That said, that is a concession you have to live with for being so centrally located. We managed to ignore the noise after a few days. It is a good hotel and if you can live with the inner city noise it is perfect. The hotel is not fitted with Air conditioning, which I actually prefer, however, the result is that you have to open your windows in the warmer evenings.",4,2016,09,24
227,Great budget-friendly hotel,"The staff is amazing at this hotel. The hotel is clean, comfortable. It's in a fantastic location. The bed was somewhat uncomfortable as other reviews have suggested. Very loud if the windows are open but very quiet if closed. Can't hear the outside at all. You can ask for a fan if you get hot, as there is no a/c and it's impossible to sleep with the windows open due to noise. Overall, a great hotel for the price/location. Who goes to Dublin to sleep, anyways? If that's you, I suggest you look for another, more expensive hotel!",4,2016,09,23
227,Good hotel at excellent location and with a convenient price,Big and clean room and bathroom. Excellent location. All employees are kind and excellent professionals. Some of them speak also Spanish at recpetion which it is a big help. Excellent Irish breakfast in a very nice irish atmosphere.,4,2016,09,23
227,Nicely located but dreary,"Within easy walking distance of Grafton Street and St. Stephens Green, this facility has good location.  We had some difficulty locating it on foot because we were not familiar with the area.  It was clean but rather dowdy and seemed somewhat over-priced.  The staff was very good. Breakfast can be purchased but we did not do so. We would not object to staying here again but would likely try a different hotel in the area on our next Dublin trip.",3,2016,09,21
227,Good night's sleep,"We pent three nights at the Drury court.  The hotel is extremely well located near restaurants and close to St Stephen's Green, where we hung out with great pleasure.  The rooms were large, the beds comfortable, and the shower good.  The staff was extremely helpful, calling taxis and helping to book theater tickets.  We liked the place a lot and thought it contributed to a terrific first visit to Dublin.",5,2016,09,17
227,Short stay in September,"My husband and I visited Dublin for 2 nights and enjoyed our stay at Drury Court Hotel. The staff at the reception desk was super friendly and helpful. We arrived around noon, after traveling from SF and they were able to get us an early check-in. Much appreciated after a long day of travel. Other reviews mention the noise outside, and it's true but so long as you sleep with the windows closed you can't hear it. They also had a fan in our room which was nice to have in the absence of keeping the windows open while we slept. The only thing keeping me from rating a 5 is that the bed was pretty stiff and the room itself was a bit out-dated. No complaints though!",4,2016,09,15
227,Very central,The hotel was super clean.  Compared to other hotels in Dublin it has great prices.  Upon our arrival the staff was very helpful.  We originally booked another hotel and switched to this one because of its wonderful location!,5,2016,09,14
227,"Great stay, helpful staff","I stayed here with my mother for three nights and it was wonderful. I just want to highlight the staff at the front desk. They were the most helpful and delightful people that I've ever encountered at a concierge desk. They were wonderful. 

If you can, request a room in the back and that way you won't get any of the street noise. But the showers were lovely and the beds were comfortable. I will say the wifi was a bit spotty in the back of the hotel tho. For the best service we had to sit by the door to the hallway. ",5,2016,09,14
227,"Excellent service,  Great location!","We stayed here for a three night stay with family,  and had a wonderful time.   From the second we walked in the door the staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. Their assistance with restaurants,  theater tickets,  and taxis was greatly appreciated. 
The rooms themselves were fairly standard fare, but very clean and comfortable. The windows were triple paned,  so they could be soundproof if you desired. 
The location was outstanding,  pretty much walking distance to most of the tourist sights.  There were many restaurants in the vicinity.  The pub kitty corner from the hotel,  the Hairy Lemon,  was particularly good.  I wouldn't recommend the breakfast offered by the hotel (next door,  for a charge), but there were plenty of other options in the neighborhood. ",5,2016,09,14
227,Review,"Really friendly staff, nothing was too much trouble. Clean, modern room with every amenity you could need (TV, hair dryer, shower cap etc). Bathroom facilities were good. Very centrally located and most touristy things were within a 5-20 minute walking distance. ",4,2016,09,13
227,Very Good Lodging to Stay At While Exploring DUBLIN!,"I was with a group that all stayed at the Radisson Blu Royal up the street - which was, dare I say, fancy - but they were booked up and I had to find other lodging.  The Drury Court isn't as fancy as the Radisson, but I was surprised to find cost about the same.  I suppose you're paying for location.   Just as the Radisson does, the Drury Court provides clean and comfortable lodging close enough to Temple Bar, but far enough to not be in the middle of it all - which means something when the night's over and you're looking to sleep, but the rest of the town isn't.  That said, my room at the Drury Court was not without street sounds wafting up through my window - but I felt it was within a reasonable level considering the great location.  Being a short walk from the Temple Bar area also afforded me the opportunity to walk through more of the city, which was a treat and part of what I treasure about trips.  The room itself was a good size, clean and had a very comfortable bed.  The staff were all of good cheer and very helpful - I'd stay there again. ",4,2016,09,13
227,Nice low cost hotel,Room very clean. Staff could not have been nicer. However there is a bar downstairs but windows are triple glazed to reduce noise but some  noise could be heard. Location perfect for shopping and sightseeing,4,2016,09,11
227,A Diamond Hotel in Dublin,"Booked into Drury Court Hotel on a recent trip to Dublin. Mid-week prices were the best by far and we actually got a room with air conditioning which was a life saver given the recent humid weather. Double glazed windows facilitate absolutely no outside noise. The room was spacious, the furnishings top notch and a bed so comfortable that we both slept as soundly as if we were in our own beds at home. Reception staff are lovely and the hotel is a 5 minute walk to the attractions on Grafton Street which includes pubs, restaurants and so much more. An absolute gem of a family owned hotel and worth infinitely more than it's current 3 star rating. A definite top notch place to rest your head ehile  visiting Dublin! Enjoy",5,2016,09,09
227,A Tremendous Stay,"I stayed here with my partner last week and we had a wonderful time. The staff are exceptional! Very quiet for such a conveniently placed city center hotel, just a few minutes walk from all the shops and main attractions. Would absolutely stay here again, could not recommend it enough!",5,2016,09,09
227,Location,"The hotel is good 
The room is simple but quiet clean and big
The staff in the reception is very helpful and gave is good advice 
It's a walking distance to the center ,which is good 
There is parking to the car for a reasonable price !
I'll definitely return to this hotel ",4,2016,09,09
227,A Little Gem,Handy and 5 minute walk to grafton street. No street noise. Clean. Everything you need in room including hair dryer and tea/coffee. No hassle checking in. Card key at door entry to rooms so a feeling of security. Hate that price doubles on Friday night otherwise would stay again. Enjoyed theair conditioned room on a very hot and humid day. ,4,2016,09,08
227,Good hotel downtown,"Stayed here with my wife and 4 year old daughter for 4 nights.  Located downtown and easily walkable to most of the tourist sites in the area.  Hotel was clean and staff were very helpful.  No AC, but wasn't really a problem in late August with the window open.  Got a bit of noise from the restaurants outside, but nothing unbearable.",4,2016,09,03
227,Excellent location,"The location of the hotel is very central and close to a lot of attractions. The staff are also very nice and helpful.  The hotel is generally clean but my bathroom curtain had few spots on it. 
If you are staying there during the weekend make sure to ask for a room that is not on the street side. There are a number of pubs in the street and it was very noisy until very late.
I would definitely stay there again ;).",4,2016,09,03
227,Perfect hen party accommodation ,I paid for two appartments for my hen party of 11 and it was perfect for our 2 night trip to Dublin. Everything was clean including bathrooms. The rooms were big and had plenty of space to get ready for our day and nights out. We were able to enjoy the lounge area to play games. The balcony was small but find for a few of us to enjoy. The kitchen was great for making bacon sandwiches and cups of tea. Food was brought from the shop only one street away. The location was right near a shopping mall plenty of restaurants and walking distance to temple bar area. The check in and out was smooth and quick. Beds were comfortable and clean. Very happy and would defiantly stay here again for a trip to Dublin. If your looking for a place to bring your hen party this is perfect. 😀 ,5,2016,09,01
227,"Friendly Staff, good location","Wonderfully friendly, helpful staff and location was brilliant . Central Dublin within walking distance. Tea and coffee, hair dryer, toiletries etc - all on offer, although only a 3 star hotel. Beds were really comfortable and rooms were spotless.",5,2016,09,01
227,Great Location,"We enjoyed our stay at Drury Court. Our room was clean and comfortable. The hotel probably needs an update, but it was comfortable. I cannot say enough to how friendly the staff were! We were within easy walking distance of Temple Bar, Grafton Street, St. Stephen's Green, and many other hot spots. My only complaint is that the wifi was not great. ",4,2016,08,30
227,Wonderful first experience.,Fantastic service the whole time. Would definitely stay there again. Perfectly situated within walking distance or short cab ride to all main attractions.  Highly recommended for anyone wishing to experience such a great city. ,5,2016,08,30
227,Very good!,"The hotel is located close to the center of the city.
Rooms are clean and comfortable, staff is very helpfull.
Wi-Fi is the weak point, must be improved!
The hotel highlights is the PMacs pub!! Great beers, good food, staff nice, good atmosphere!
Would stay again.",4,2016,08,27
227,Great location ,"Excellent location....lots of great restaurants and bars nearby...
Clean
Comfy
Large room
Good value 
Parking opposite if required but I would advise the use of public transport.
All you need as a central base to explore Dublin city....",4,2016,08,27
227,Great Location - Helpful Staff,Stayed overnight on a very hot night.  Great location for touring the city.  The hotel has a deal on car parking but visitors need to use a specific car park which is one of 5 or 6 close to the hotel.  Great facilities and a top class breakfast.  No A/C so not ideal on a hot night.,5,2016,08,27
227,Nice Hotel in Dublin. Good Location!,"The Drury Court Hotel is nicely located within walking distance to many areas of Dublin that tourists want to see: Grafton Street, Temple Bar, St. Stephen's Green, etc. When I booked this hotel, I wasn't sure how far these attractions would be from the hotel, but they are easily only 5-10 minutes walk. 

The hotel itself is nice, although it was a little overpriced (but then all the hotels were while I was there). My room was pretty big, clean and comfortable. One thing about this hotel is that it is in a lively part of town. On the plus side, there are plenty of things to explore just outside the hotel, such as shops, restaurants and pubs. Not to worry at bedtime, though, as the hotel has windows that block the noise. 

The staff were very nice at check-in and through the my stay. I did not have breakfast in the hotel, but the pub was lively.

This hotel is in a great location, and if the price is right, it's definitely worth a stay here.",5,2016,08,24
227,Good location but apartments are poor.,"Booked two 3 bedroom apartments for a friends 30th birthday after reading fairly good reviews on here, however, I was extremely disappointed. The apartments were quite shabby with things falling apart, the bathroom door got stuck to the point of needing others to help us get out of the bathroom on occasions, the mattresses were lumpy, a dirty towel was left on the back of the bathroom door from the previous guests and the place wasn't that clean. 
The only good points (and the reason I generously gave 3/5) was because the staff at the front desk were friendly and the location was really useful.
Overall, this place is extremely overpriced for what you get.",3,2016,08,24
227,Good,I had a spacious room which was really nice (no fridge though). The location is close enough to walk to Temple Bar. The staff were really helpful. The wi-fi was good (as it is often not in many hotels). The room was clean and I had no problems.,4,2016,08,23
227,My room was spacious and comfortable.,"Overall I liked this hotel. My room was spacious and comfortable.
I’d say that hotel is rather on outdated side but I visited my friends  in a more modern place and her room was twice smaller but about 1,5 more expensive.
This hotel is conveniently located , but on the other hand everything in Dublin center is close by 
It is not residential area, but much quieter then temple bar district.",4,2016,08,22
227,Friendly Staff,The staff at the front desk was extremely friendly and helpful.  We arrived early in the morning from the States and they were wonderfully accommodating.  I will stay only at the Drury when in Dublin.  They made the trip very special.,5,2016,08,22
227,Dublin perfect location,Great stay. The staff is what really makes this hotel stand out. They were willing to help with everything. We enjoyed our stay. I would recommend a top floor if you like having a window open in the night. Otherwise there may be too much street noise. If you don't need an open window any room will work because their windows shut out all street noise.,4,2016,08,22
227,Business Stay,"I've stayed in the Drury Court before and happy to return for another visit, clean well furbished rooms, friendly helpful staff and a brilliant location. I will try and book every stay in Dublin at this hotel",5,2016,08,22
227,Great location,"Booked a last minute break at this hotel using internet suggestions.  The hotel is in a great location, right in the middle of a bustling nightlife.  Don't let this put you off.  Our room faced the bars and as long as you close the windows you won't hear a thing.  Strange set up with bar used for breakfast, but someone was busy cleaning overnight and it was clean in the morning and didn't smell too much of beer.   Breakfast was average and I would probably go out for breakfast if I had to do it again. The rooms, reception area and corridors are clean and bright.  Wouldn't book again, but all in all a good effort.  ",3,2016,08,20
227,"Nice hotel, superb staff","This hotel is located near Temple bar but it's on a quiet street. You can walk anywhere! Bus 16 from airport stops 50m from the hotel.

The hotel is a bit old and worn down, but the bed was super comfortable and the staff is great, they are willing to help with anything! I forgot my adapter home and they borrowed me one for 5 days. 

The breakfast is 10e. It was basic and tasty.",4,2016,08,19
227,"Nice three start hotel, great location, very quiet room and I am a light sleeper",Wife and I stayed there for two nights.  Upon arrival I asked for a couple extra towels and staff went and got them no problem.  He showed me where to park and the next day I was able to get a free spot behind the hotel.  I asked for a quiet room and he said they were all quiet.  We went to the room and their were two or three sets of windows.  When you close them you don't hear anything and we were above the bar.  The beds are hard but comfortable and this hotel is listed as a three star and I would agree with that.  All the staff was very friendly.  The breakfast is above average and the staff keeps it well stocked.  Hotel is very close to college and town.  Great spot to stay for Dublin.  I would stay here again.,5,2016,08,18
227,Great Location and excellent staff,"One of the best located hotels in Dublin, 2 minutes walk to Grafton Street and 5 minutes to Temple Bar. Staff are really friendly and helpful.Also the bar at the side of the hotel stock the biggest range of beer I have ever seen.",5,2016,08,18
227,"Drury Court, Great hotel, Great location",Couldn't ask for a better location to be able to walk to everything in Dublin. The employees are super accommodating and provide great recommendations of things to do and see to the coolest spots to eat/hidden gems. Great services and very friendly people working here. I sent my laundry out after backpacking for a week and a half and they returned it same day for a decent price. ,5,2016,08,16
227,Friendly and helpful staff,"Nice spot and centrally located 
Enjoyable stay in solid accommodations 
Near Grafton Street activity 
Close to museums and cathedrals
Near excellent restaurants and shops

Helpful and cheery team onsite with great advice

227,Good hotel in centre of Dublin,"If you need to be in the centre of town this hotel is great. Simple, clean rooms, with staff who are utterly charming and helpful. Nothing is too much trouble for them. As with all city hotels it can be noisy with late night revellers, so bring your ear plugs! The hotel provided a tight-squeeze parking space, but it is worth asking for this. You don't need a car in the centre - lots of trams, buses, horse drawn carriages!",4,2016,08,13
227,Very comfortable central hotel,"This is a renovated, comfortable and centrally located hotel in the older historic part of Dublin.  The staff is so very friendly, welcoming and full of advice if you need it. Places to eat and sites to see are an easy walking distance.",5,2016,08,11
227,Excellent Location,"We stayed in the Family En Suite room. The Hotel is in an excellent location (go to the Hairy Lemon across the street for yummy food and drinks!). There is an elevator so an upper floor was awesome. We should have asked for a fan because the room got kind of warm at night and we couldn't leave the windows open all night because of the street noise (there's a bar next door, and the vehicle traffic was a bit much to be able to leave the windows open but that's not a complaint, just an observation). The front desk staff was friendly and helpful when we asked for directions and recommendations for places to eat. We arrived super early from our flight and were able to leave our bags at the front desk and then start our vacation. ",4,2016,08,08
227,Welcoming atmosphere ,"I stayed in this hotel along with 3 friends, we arrived a good few hours before check in time to drop our bags off, while doing so the lady at the front desk said she could have us in our room in about half an hour (unexpected but excellent!) The room turned out to be very clean and of a good size. All front desk staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful, overall we had a brilliant stay!",5,2016,08,03
227,Very convenient and friendly place to stay.,"You really are right in the heart of Dublin city staying in the Dury Court. 
The hotel staff are very friendly and accommodating. 
Clean room. Our shower was great. 
We will be staying there again whenever we visit Dublin. ",4,2016,08,02
227,"Spacious rooms, good windows","I am not sure this was a good value given the room prices, but it was certainly comfortable and well located, just a few blocks from Stephen's Green.  Breakfast was good, and free onsite parking (available only if you book directly with the hotel) was very helpful.",4,2016,08,01
227,I Would Not Recommend This Hotel,"This hotel is in desperate need of updating.  Our room was clean, but the beds were extremely uncomfortable and lumpy (old mattresses that need replacing), and the cold facet didn't work in the sink so we could only use the hot water which became too hot.

The only good thing about this hotel was its front desk staff, they were extremely friendly and helpful.  I told them that we were checking out early in the morning so they arranged to have a taxi waiting for me at 7am and allowed me to do the check out that night instead of in the morning.

Thankfully we only stayed 1 night in this hotel, I would definitely not recommend it to anyone.",2,2016,07,31
227,"comfortable, friendly, good location","Stayed here with my 6 year old for one night after flying into Dublin late. All hotels in Dublin are expensive, really expensive, for what you get. This was no exception. It was a little rundown, with a touch of the hostel feeling about it, but it was clean, roomy and comfortable. The staff were great and the breakfast (served in atmospheric pub below) was excellent. I would definitely stay here again.",4,2016,07,31
227,Excellent location and fantastic bar,"The Drury is an excellent choice.  Friendly staff, clean rooms -- nothing fancy but perfectly acceptable.  Easy walking to all the sites, but far enough away from the madness of Temple Bar.  The attached bar/pub (P.Macs) is terrific, but not too loud to disturb sleeping.  Would probably make The Drury home-base for future Dublin visits",4,2016,07,30
227,Drury apartments ,Recently stayed with four friends in the apartment which was clean and comfortable had everything you need little kitchen off lounge and three double bed rooms staff on reception are 24/7 very friendly and helpful booked all our trips and taxis for us The apartments are centerally  located in walking distance of most things great pubs nearby Gaity theatre round the corner as well as a big shopping mall ,5,2016,07,29
227,Fair stay at best,"Stayed 3 nights, Fri- Mon.  Staff and location excellent.  However our room was dated - old furniture and carpet, uncomfortably soft twin beds, inadequate lighting in the bathroom, no free outlets near nightstands for phones, laptops etc.  The worst part was that the room was hot and the only ventilation was via an open window (no AC).  The problem with that is that the street is busy with partiers at all hours and there is an active pub and nightlife adjoining the hotel.  So you either choose to sweat in quiet or open the windows in hopes to get a breeze while enjoying the noise below.  The room was not cheap at close to $300, though Dublin is not cheap as a whole, but I would not rate this as a good value at all due to the comfort issues.",2,2016,07,27
227,Drury Court Hotel Stay,"We stayed at the Drury Court Hotel for 10 days and we had a great experience.
The hotel is clean and comfortable and the staff were all very helpful They gave us directions to all the sites we wanted to see and also obtained reservations and tickets that we needed. The hotel was in walking distance to all major attractions and public transportation. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,07,26
227,Second visit--and it's still great,"One key factor. for funding hotels in Dublin City Center is identifying a hotel with a central location-- but that is not noisy.
This is my second visit to Drury Court, and it meets both criteria very well. It's fairly straightforward, ie clean, comfortable, and not too fancy. But the location is excellent for access to shipping and transit, and it's quiet at night!

I'm sure I will be back again on a future trip.",5,2016,07,25
227,"Location, location, location (and friendly faces to boot!)","I booked this hotel for a gig in Iveagh Gardens and was so impressed I will most certainly use again.  Its a perfect location for a Dublin overnighter.  Rooms are comfortable, staff are absolutely wonderful and everything is on your doorstep.  A cheaper option than nearby Westbury and Shelbourne and of course not so fancy but definitely a good alternative!!",5,2016,07,24
227,Convenient Stay,"Nice, clean, and basic hotel.  The location is great and easily accessible to many of the popular tourist attractions.  There were three adults sharing a room and it was spacious and comfortable for all of us.  ",4,2016,07,24
227,Wonderful Pleasant Stay,"Friendly and helpful staff.  The room clean, well kept, a tad outdated, but definitely served our purposes.  Quiet location, within 10 minutes of everything.  Really recommend this place.  Would stay here again.",4,2016,07,23
227,Would Stay Here Again!,"Location...Location... Everyone here is so helpful, you can walk to everything! The beds are comfortable and the wifi is great. Traveled here with my 18 yr old daughter and we had a blast. Even though there are pubs down below, you can shut your windows and the sound disappears. 2 thumbs up!! :)",5,2016,07,20
227,Friendly hotel in a great location,"Great location just a few minutes from Grafton Street, and good value. Lovely staff who couldn't do enough to help. Our room was spacious and comfortable if a bit on the tired looking side. The bathroom was certainly a bit scruffy but still perfectly fit for purpose. Breakfast wasn't included and was served in the rather funky, gloomy bar next to reception, but was really reasonably priced and the full Irish was probably the best hotel breakfast I've ever had! Really fabulous. I'd happily recommend the Drury Court Hotel to anyone on a short trip to Dublin.",4,2016,07,18
227,"Great location, excellent staff","Would recommend these apartments as close to St Stephen's Green and Grafton Street. Staff were extremely helpful and friendly on arrival, check-out and throughout our stay. Beds not particularly comfortable but OK for a few nights stay. ",4,2016,07,16
227,WONDERFUL STAFF,"My cousin and I traveled to Dublin to attend a wedding at Luttrellstown Castle on July 4, 2016. Reservations were made at Drury Court well in advance and we were aware of the possible street noise in our room before arriving. There was only one night where the noise lasted into the wee hours and we assumed it was our own wedding group making the noise!! 
This hotel is ideally located in City Center. We, actually, arrived a week before the wedding and walked everywhere to see the sights...........River Liffey, Temple Bar, Guinness Storehouse, Grafton Street (close by), Jeannie Johnson Tall Ship, High Tea, and Trinity College. The room was clean with fresh towels every day and the staff was SO welcoming and helpful throughout our stay!! I would, definitely, stay here again!! ",4,2016,07,15
227,Good for a night's stay. Not for children.,"The front desk lady at early check in was very polite, friendly and hospitable. She engaged conservation not only to an adult but to my 7 yo child as well. She was very thoughtful and suggested tourist spots to visit due to our limited stay in the Dublin. I only wish there's a kids center/activities within the hotel for the younger travelers. Splendid experience overall!",4,2016,07,13
227,The Only Hotel I Am Willing to Stay Again in Dublin,"If I have a chance to visit Dublin again, I will try to re-book with this hotel.  The staff are the friendliness that I have ever encountered.  They not only helped with my hotel needs, but also provided information and the location of the tourist spots I had desired to see.  The location of the hotel is great.  It is very close to the busy section of Grafton Street.  Temple Bar region and St. Patrick's Cathedral are easy to get to by foot also.",5,2016,07,11
227,LOCATION,"I liked everything about this hotel. its location is perfect! Everything is at a walking distance 
The staff is super friendly and very helpful 
Great advice
It is one of the best really 
The pub in the hotel is really nice. 
Clean bathrooms which is very important",5,2016,07,10
227,Not the best,"Booked a room at what I thought was a 4 star hotel to find a very old establishment that obviously doesn't keep up to date, booking a room for two people after a long trip on the road to find it was two single beds instead of a double, very uncomfortable mattress and very loud from bars below and machinery. Staff were very professional and pleasant.",3,2016,07,09
227,"Great location but small room (we were in a triple), somewhat rundown and pricey.",Centrally located near St. Stephen's Green.  Staff was helpful and friendly.  Small room.  We had a triple which seemed cramped.  Hotel is somewhat run down.  Breakfast which was included seemed pretty ordinary.  Somewhat pricey.,3,2016,07,06
227,Drury Court Hotel,"Stayed  for four nghts in the Drury Court Hotel. Had a large room on the fourth floor. It was very quiet and very clean. Breakfasts were not included in the room price. Two types of breakfasts - Continental or Full Irish. Plenty to eat! Welcoming and friendly staff.Only one negative comment which was that the bathroom was poorly lit with only one dim centre light which made shaving and applying make up a bit difficult
The hotel is perfectly situated in a buzzy area full of pubs restaurants and interesting small shops. The Hop on Hop off  stops about five minutes away from the hotel.An ideal location.",4,2016,07,06
227,Great place. Highly recommend it,"Great place. Spacious room. Clean as well and everything worked well. Plenty of hot water and a clean shower. With the windows fully closed the room was very quiet. The staff, however is superb and so very friendly and helpful. They also have a fixed rate taxi agreement to the airport which is far less expansive than a regular taxi.  Walking distance to temple bar area and many fine pubs. Try the Hairy Lemon pub just across the street!",4,2016,07,05
227,Amazing return stay!,"We stayed in this lovely hotel last year and had the best time,so we decided to come back for a short citbreak; and werent dissapointed. Its right in the centre of everything, sightseeing hotspots, restaurants, bars and cafes, the rooms are spacious and the staff is incredibly helpul and friendly, we arrived very early in the morning so they kept our luggage and gave us a call when the room was ready for an early check in before 3pm.  
Thanks again!",5,2016,07,04
227,Great location. Great staff. Great stay.,"It took a while to find as there were so many roadworks and diversions with the new tram network being built. Should be great when finished. Small reception.  Excellent, helpful staff. Room was of a good size, well decorated and clean. This hotel is very convenient to most tourist attractions and plenty of good eating places. Excellent breakfast. 
Perhaps a little noisy late evening. Also a little pricey. However, hope to come again.",4,2016,06,29
227,"Mostly excellent, but..","Overall, I really liked this hotel. Great location, amenities, very friendly and helpful staff, wonderful breakfast on premises. 

The staff provided info on how to get to places, they printed out our boarding passes, and happily stored our baggage until room was ready on the morning we checked in.

We were able to walk to many locations from here, but had no trouble with noise (asked for a quieter room, got the top floor at the end of hallway - which perhaps impacted our wifi troubles).   Even walking with a cane, I was able to see many sights without getting on a bus. (And bus was close for other trips - highly recommend the Leap Visitor pass.)

Call for the extra discount - well worth it. 

Our biggest quibble is the wifi: it's bad. We had multiple devices and couldn't get any of them to connect regularly. Forget reviewing emails reliably, let alone checking Facebook or Twitter. And getting messages was particularly unreliable. I know, one doesn't go to Dublin for the purpose of getting on the 'net. But the hotel said free wifi included. Both of us (adults) expected to be able to triage emails from work to make returning workload less heinous - which didn't happen. And our teenagers like to communicate with friends back home but unexpectedly couldn't. Finally, we were relying on wifi to get directions from Google maps to bus or walk to the hotel and instead ended up having to using international data instead.

Other quibbles: the room keys kept failing. We had two rooms and for one of them, we replaced approximately 10 key cards in 4 days. (Also, the fire doors made me kind of queasy: the ""keep closed"" signed doors were not always closed and very rarely even had latching capabilities.)",4,2016,06,25
227,"Great hotel, Great price and Great location!","We stayed two nights at the Drury Court Hotel.  It took a while to find the hotel, but that's only because we're new to the area.  But once we got to the hotel, we realized it's perfectly situated within walking distance to many restaurants, delis, stores, shopping areas, a big park, public transportation, and much more.   We couldn't have asked for more and definitely plan to stay here again the next time we visit Ireland.  We are also recommending this hotel to friends and relatives.  Truly a good hotel in a great location!",4,2016,06,21
227,Good location! Friendly staff!,Pricey but given the location it is a very good place for your money! The staff at the reception were very friendly and helpful! They asked us many times during our stay if there was anything we needed and made sure we had a good stay when we left! They also have a very good breakfast for an additional €9.95 per person! This hotel definitely made our stay in Dublin very enjoyable!!,4,2016,06,19
227,transit stay - beyond expectations! service and location- a win-win!,"we spent a day at the hotel on the way in and another on the way out of Dublin. the location is amazing-extremely central and convenient for sightseeing/restuarants, etc. it is a 3 star but would rate it higher as the beds were comfy, service was impeccable- the front office staff-Hannah and her colleagues made us feel very welcome and were very helpful... would recommend it without hesitation to anyone not looking for * frills - only catch was the noise from the road-try and make sure you get a quiet room!",5,2016,06,18
227,Excellent service.,"Nice and helpful staff. Get good advices on food and transportation. Rooms are clean and comfortable. First time in Dublin but I feel like staying at own home. Location is 1 min away from high street, 5 min from Trinity college so it's convenient.",5,2016,06,16
227,Location!,"Very nice hotel and apartments) in the heart of Dublin.  Not sure what the occasion was, but our rooms were priced pretty high     very helpful staff  Other than the 'value' aspect, a nice place (albeit a bit loud)",4,2016,06,13
227,Haven in Downtown Dublin,Very nice hotel that is centrally located but just far enough away from the noise of Temple Bar. The room and bathroom were nice. The Irish Fry for breakfast was excellent. The only drawback was the wifi service. We were on the 4th floor and had intermittent disruptions. It worked great in the lobby and restaurant. Would stay there again.,4,2016,06,12
227,Centrally located hotel,"We stayed 3 nights in thre drury hotel. Its very close to temple park and trinity collrge. St stephens car park is very close to the hotels and offers special prices for hotel guests (12,5 € per day). The staff was very friendly and gave us good restaurant recommendation (brasserie). The hotel offers continental breakfast for 9,95€. All in all it was a great location for exploring Dublin southside and northside.",4,2016,06,09
227,"Reasonable, centrally located","The location of this hotel was great for all the sights and shopping, and it was reasonably priced and clean. Staff were helpful with maps and explaining how to get to places out of town. Nice cafes nearby for a quick breakfast, too.",5,2016,06,09
227,Depends on your preference,"While this hotel is not smack-dab in the middle of Temple Bar there is quite a bit of night-time activity.  We slept with the window open because we prefer a cool room at night - unfortunately there was a ""revue bar"" right under our window and it was really noisy until early in the morning.  We were there Thursday and Friday nights and NOT interested in partying at all.  HAVING SAID THAT, the hotel itself and the staff were very nice. The room was comfortable and well-appointed. A room in another part of the hotel may have been perfectly quiet or if we had been out partying ourselves, we wouldn't have cared!",4,2016,06,08
227,Nice central hotel,This is a comfortable well priced hotel in the centre of Dublin. Would stay again. It is located near st Stephan s green and was very quiet. The bed was very comfortable and the room had everything you could need.,4,2016,06,08
227,"Great location, Not for kids","Stayed here midweek with two children.  The hotel was fine, but nothing special.  The location is great, central to everything - especially a very vibrant night life.  The room was comfortable and clean but the bathroom was dated and could have been cleaned a bit better.  The adjoining bar where breakfast is served was a bit quirky, to say the least but the breakfast was okay.",3,2016,06,07
227,Perfect location ,"I've stayed here many times and become known to the staff. Always found me a car parking space although they are in short supply. However they have a discount arrangement with the public car park across the road.
Stayed in a wide variety of rooms, always comfortable beds and at least one comfortable chair to sit in. Great breakfasts and the evening bar food is okay. Although there is a plethora of nearby places to eat to suit all budgets. ",4,2016,06,04
227,Fantastic Find,"We stayed at the Drury Court hotel for a short break having chosen this hotel, mainly due to its good reviews on Trip Advisor and I have to say we were not disappointed.
We booked a triple room and as we had an early flight from Stansted, I contacted the hotel in advance to ask if we could deposit our luggage; which they responded saying it would be fine.
We arrived at the hotel after catching the Airbus from Dublin airport (very convenient way to get into the city – although rush hour traffic, combined with the installation of Luas on the south side of the city, proved a bit of a nightmare) at 9:30 and received a very warm welcome. Although we only wanted to drop off our luggage, the receptionist kindly checked with housekeeping and informed us that if we wanted to wait 30 minutes, our room would be available. However, we decided to just drop our luggage and went off sightseeing. 
The room was a good size, spotlessly clean and decorated to a very high standard; the bathroom had complimentary toiletries, spotless white soft towels and in the bedroom, there were tea and coffee making facilities, a hairdryer, safe, TV and free Wi-Fi. 
The beds and pillows were extremely comfortable and a welcome relief to get into after a long day on our feet and I had a very restful night’s sleep. 
My only constructive comment would be that the shower curtain in the bath would have benefitted from a curved shower rail. Due to the extractor fan being very efficient (a very unusual occurrence in hotels these days) the curtain blew into the bath, which proved a challenge to have a shower without it sticking to me.
We had breakfast included in our rate and this was fabulous. Meals were taken in the next door P.Mac’s, which could be accessed from outside, but was also accessible through a door in the main reception of the hotel. The ambience was wonderful, the staff very friendly and there was a terrific selection for the cold options and the quality of the produce for the cooked options (the “full Irish”) was very high; we left feeling very full and contented. 
This hotel is in a fabulous location, very close to all the major sights, but also far enough away and down a quiet side street for it to be an escape from the hustle and bustle of Dublin. There is a very secure feeling within the hotel, as to gain access to the bedrooms could only be done using the swipe card for the bedroom doors. 
The staff were all so friendly, welcoming and helpful, that I would have no hesitation whatsoever to return to the Drury Court Hotel if ever visiting Dublin again and I would highly recommend it to anyone as a great place to stay. Thank you for making out first trip to Dublin such an enjoyable one.
",5,2016,06,02
227,Ideal location if you don't mind a bit of noise.,"The hotel was clean and adequate for our needs. The staff were very friendly and helped us with all of us enquires; I asked for more tea and milk for the room and received a whole bag full! The bed was comfortable and the shower was hot, the decor was a bit tired but everything was clean which is more important. The location was perfect for seeing some of the best sights of Dublin, we only needed transport to and from the airport. However because it is central the noise from the bars/pubs below made it a bit noisy late into the night, the noise didn't bother us much but it may annoy light sleepers. ",4,2016,05,27
227,"Great location, great Staff, Cute Rooms!","We stayed here for three nights, and loved every night there. The staff was all unbelievably kind and helpful. The rooms were a really good size, clean and comfortable. The pub attached was so cute and a blast! We were close to several great bars and restaurants - and if we did have to take a cab, it wasn't pricey. I would say as far as location and quality this is a great place to stay in Dublin!",5,2016,05,25
227,.,"Welcoming receptionist, clean comfortable and quiet for such a busy location. We went for a girls weekend with a concert booked for the Sunday night at the Olympia which is 5 minutes Walk away (10 at the most) Fantastic location, close to concert hall, theatre, pubs and the shops!  Lovely area too which felt safe at night walking home from pubs & restaurants. Book restaurants, if you can, online before you go as the good ones get booked up. 
We didn't book for breakfast /dinner at the hotel as there are so many fabulous places to eat to choose from.",5,2016,05,18
227,Location,I loved the old style. The full sized bath tub was ideal to relax after a cold day walking the sights of Dublin. Check in at 3 pm might be a bit late but it is not such a huge problem as so many interesting buildings to see within walking distance and they store your luggage. The Breakfast room is the cosiest pub style restaurant I have seen for a long time. You can even open the windows to let fresh air in.,5,2016,05,17
227,Visit to Dublin,"We chose this hotel because it is very central. Our room was clean, comfortable and had a great bathroom. It did get very warm (we were on the 4th floor) but we asked for a fan on our way out one evening and when we got back it had been delivered and switched on so the room was much more comfortable. The dining area for breakfast was excellent, as was the breakfast. We were within walking distance of all the city's attractions.",4,2016,05,16
227,Good central place to stay,Only stayed 1 night as we were going to a show.  Was well pleased when we arrived as the receptionist was friendly and helpful and the room was clean and well decorated.  Bed was very comfortable and no problems with noise.  Breakfast was good and the waitress was delightful.  Would definitely go back.,4,2016,05,10
227,Perfect location and good value,"We chose Drury Court for its proximity to Grafton Street and Stephens Green and were not disappointed! The hotel is located in a great area with lots of independent cafes and bars nearby.
The room was great - spacious, clean and very quiet.
The lobby in the hotel was very small, so not much space to wait for friends or sit for a while, but this isn't a big deal.
Overall a great stay. ",4,2016,05,10
227,"Nice hotel, excellent location","Very nice hotel with very friendly staff. I really enjoyed my stay here.  I found nothing to fault at drury court, and it was one of the most pleasant welcomes i have received at any hotel.  Room was excellent and the hotel location is fantastic for the local pubs and restaurants around temple bar and just a few minutes away from grafton street for the shopping.  It was a pleasant 15 minute walk down through grafton street and over the bridge to oconnell street.  Well worth a visit.",5,2016,05,09
227,Central Location in Dublin and friendly staff,Drury Court is a cute little hotel centrally located in Dublin.  We did a ton of walking in Dublin but the location was close to the Temple Bar area as well as great sites like St. Stephens and pubs like The Hairy Lemon. It was also connected to a great bar called Pmacs. Try the Calypso beer! Couldnt find it anywhere else. We stayed two nights at Drury Court. We fit 4 in a room which was tight but worth it to squeeze with hotel prices in Dublin. This was the most expensive place we stayed on our trip and the smallest room but it's what i expected for the largest city in Ireland.  The woman who checked us in was beyond friendly and super helpful. They even gave us a bottle of wine for my birthday. We were able to leave our car rental in their parking lot which was one of the big things i was worried about in Dublin. I had heard it was very expensive to park but Drury Court was able to give us parking.  I'm very happy with our stay at the Drury Court Hotel. ,4,2016,05,08
227,Great location ,"Great location most things in walking distance. Breakfast great and meals/ bar food super! I recommend the burger! Hotel clean and quiet- we were on the 5th floor. Definitely recommended! We got the two day hop on hop off bus, can see most of the sights. Recommend a visit to glasnevin - really intetesting ",5,2016,05,08
227,Location location location,"It was great staying at the Drury Court Hotel. We loved being downtown near so many of the restaurants and pubs of the city. The staff was great and the room was big, spacious, clean, and had an awesome shower.",5,2016,05,07
227,wonderful stay,"we stayed at the Drury court hotel for 3 nights while in Dublin. The hotel is perfectly situated, its a short walk to the city center and some attractions, and there are plenty of pub and restaurants within a few blocks of hotel and  A short stroll over to Grafton st for shopping. The front desk was awesome, so friendly and helpful, we were thrilled when we arrived a little early our room was ready. we had the family suite and it was large enough to accommodate 3 adults without being crowded, very comfortable. but than again, you're not there to spend too much time in your room!  : )
They also were able to call us a taxi for the airport when were leaving for a lot less than on the street.Thank you !  so make sure you inquire at reception about a taxi.  
There is a restaurant attached to the hotel that served Irish breakfast, and continental which was quite good. we also had dinner there 1 night, food was very good.
they also have games on the tables for you to enjoy while having a pint. 
Would highly recommend. ",5,2016,05,04
227,Did the job,"Stayed here for one night in April 2016. Very welcoming and friendly staff, with plenty of helpful suggestions. 

The location of the hotel is very convenient for exploring Dublin.

The rooms are quite basic and the beds a bit stiff. Bathroom was in need of an upgrade.

A little overpriced for what youre getting, but a safe fall back.",3,2016,05,04
227,Nice tourist hotel.,The staff are very helpful and courteous.  Restaurant bar adequate.  A real Irish bar.  Very noisy but OK.  Noise from street is too much.  Rooms are adequate.  Good value.  Great location for seeing the historic sites. Lacks amenities I prefer to have.,4,2016,05,04
227,Perfect Hotel for getting to know Dublin,"Nice, friendly and clean hotel nearby everything. If you are a real city traveler and need hotel room only for staying overnight, this is the perfect choice for you. Room has enough space for even some luggage. It is clean. You can open the window (then you will have some noise, but at least I prefer fresh air). There is no minibar, but you can buy soft drinks in vending machine in corridor. What I didn't like was that there is only a bath tub with roof shower (no bidet etc), so you really have to be able to stand on your hands, if you want to wash your feet...  ",4,2016,05,03
227,Good Value for Money and Great Location!,"Visited for a Hen Weekend and stayed in the apartments which are very close to the hotel. It catered for 6 people per apartment which was ideal enough space for us all. The rooms were tidy, clean and the only thing I would say was a downfall was the bathroom as it was in need of some TLC but overall it was good value for money and in a good location. 
The food was also delicious. The hotel is located within walking distance to everything in Dublin, including Temple Bar, Shops, Restaurants and more. Ideal location for a hen party and how much time do you spend in the room (only to recover from a hangover! which this is more then adequate) 

I would definitely recommend it again to someone else!",4,2016,05,03
227,"Friendly staff, great showers and nice size rooms",We were welcomed by the desk staff and were shown our rooms right away. The rooms were large with comfy beds and had coffee service - perfect for us! We did not by use the bar or restaurant as we were here just one night on  our way back through Dublin to catch our flight. We did eat at a great restaurant at Stephens Green- called Harry's!! The front desk happily printed our boarding passes and called a txt for us to take to the airport- great stay!,5,2016,05,02
227,Great location & Value,"We chose the Drury Court Hotel for a two night stay while in Dublin.  The location was great, we were able to take public transportation from the airport all the way to the hotel...perfect! The Hotel is a little off the beating path, but was still close enough to walk everywhere.  Our stay included a full Irish breakfast at the adjacent pub; excellent service and food. The room was cozy and comfortable, not fancy but served its purpose for our stay. The front desk staff was very professional and friendly and were willing to answer our endless questions.",5,2016,04,30
227,Great stay,Very nice and attentive staff. Great location in City. Pleasant rooms. Clean and well managed. A bit larger rooms than a typical European Hotel. Nothing fancy. A good value. Nice pub attached to Hotel. ,4,2016,04,29
227,"Basic hotel, but great value for the money","This is a very, very nice 3-star hotel.  Clean, comfortable, and great location.  If you're looking for luxury, stay elsewhere, but Drury Court has all you need.  The staff was amazing, Chelsea at the front desk in particular. She made tons of suggestions and really helped us with deciding what to do and where to go.  We went to the breakfast for 2 days in the adjoining restaurant/bar, one day getting the Irish Breakfast and another getting the Continental Breakfast. Both were 10 EUR each, but I found it to be pretty reasonable. The food was also delicious.  The hotel is located within walking distance to everything in Dublin, including St. Patrick's, Guinness Storehouse, Temple Bar, and more.  This hotel was recommended to me by a friend and I would definitely recommend it again to someone else!",4,2016,04,27

227,A great location,"This was our first trip to Dublin and chose this place based on reviews and location. Not disappointed. Very clean and great staff. The beds were comfortable and no noise issues considering we were there on a weekend.  The staff helped us with all questions and gave us first class service. Big yes on the overall experience, but rooms were a bit small",4,2016,04,26
227,great hotel,"First time staying here but certainly not our last.Very central location for shopping or sightseeing. Very comfortable bedrooms with internal glazing to reduce street noise which was not a problem on the night we stayed.Comfortable beds, first class bathrooms and everything delivered by friendly helpful staff.There are higher graded hotels in Dublin but For me this one delivers the best all round package.",5,2016,04,25
227,Loved this hotel!,"The staff here are great, the location is perfect and the hotel is clean and LOVELY. Everyone went out of their way to be kind and helpful. The bathroom was FABULOUS. The neighborhood was perfect - across the street from a great pub across and excellent chip shop; easy to walk to anything in the city. Great price. Loved it all around.",5,2016,04,22
227,Another lovely stay,Just come back from another lovely stay at drury court. Staff as always so friendly and helpful. Rooms are spotless and comfortable and cleaned daily. Home from home. Will hopefully be back in july. Thanks drury court ,5,2016,04,22
227,Great location,Three friends and myself stayed in the 2 bedroomed apartment. Very comfortable. Location ideal for theatre and eating out.Car park across the road.Would highly recommend because of all of the above and value for money,5,2016,04,21
227,Good Hotel and Location,"We stayed here for 2 nights last week. We arrived at 11am and were very pleased to be able to get into our room (201) then. (We had been expecting to just drop off our luggage). The room was clean with a very  comfortable bed, tea/coffee making facilities, safe, good wifi, 2 chairs and a lovely bathroom with a good shower and plenty hot water.
Breakfast was included in our price and was very good. There was a huge choice of continental items and hot items were cooked to order. Breakfast was served in the bar attached to the hotel and the only thing we didn't like was that the room was very dark. 

The staff were helpful and friendly  are a credit to the hotel both in reception and at breakfast. 
The hotel was more than we would usually pay for a European city, but i think that is just Dublin prices as everything seemed a bit more expensive. My only  complaint would be the noise from the street late at night, not the hotels fault though, so if you are a light sleeper as for a high floor or a room at the back. One word of warning if you are going to Dublin, the traffic is a nightmare due to tram works and bus stops have been suspended and moved. If you use the airport bus make sure you ask the driver where you should get off.",4,2016,04,18
227,Dublin trip,"great centrally located hotel, friendly staff, clean, comfortable room. will stay there again on our next trip. plus a great bar directly next door. easy to travel around this terrific city and a short walk to the dart station",4,2016,04,18
227,cracking hotel,"this hotel not far from temple bar which is one of the social hubs of Dublin. but sorry to say a very expensive part. from the hotel its just a very short walk to less expensive bars and eating places .Would also say the people of Dublin are very  friendly.
",4,2016,04,15
227,Maltese at the Drury Court Hotel,"As most of you researching Dublin know, the city is best discovered on foot or by public transport, so we looked to book a centrally located hotel as fundamental for our holiday. Drury Court Hotel just fitted this request beautifully as it is just short minutes walk from St. Stephen’s Green, Grafton Street, St George Street, Dublin Castle, St. Patrick’s Cathedral and Temple Bar area. We booked this hotel for five adults for three nights just after last Easter, when the price had thankfully gone a bit down from its Easter price peak, so kindly monitor the fluctuating price of this hotel when researching. 

Ok, this hotel does need a furnishing and decor revamp and updating, yet the rooms were clean. Unfortunately, our room was the last room at the very end of the corridor at level 4. From the bed, at times I found difficulties connecting to the Wifi signal which was weak and had to, at times, need to sit on the carpet behind the entrance room’s door to stay connected. Otherwise, no complaints, the reception staff were ever so kind and helpful with their directions and recommendations. On the last day, we checked out but left our luggage safely at the reception for our later taxi pick-up to the airport.

So, as per another review of mine, this hotel does fir the location, location, location criteria that many travellers opt for. It served us well.",3,2016,04,14
227,Good location comfortable hotel,"We stayed here for 2 nights in room 108. Room was a good standard 3 star hotel room with comfortable bed, triple glazing, TV, hairdryer, safe, tea.coffee making and bathroom with shower over the bath. Clean and comfortable.
Front of house staff were friendly and helpful. Happy to keep luggage both before and after check in/out. Lobby area is a bit small however why do you want to wait around in the lobby.
We did not have breakfast here as there are lots of coffee bars/cafes just outside and unless you need a full Irish why pay 9.95 . 
Only issue was that we could hear the music from the bar/restaurant downstairs in our room (the bass sounds really travel) and although it did not go on late it was audible and a bit annoying for the light sleeper. Maybe those rooms on higher floors would have been quieter. 
Really good location for everything in central Dublin. Would certainly consider using it again.",4,2016,04,14
227,"A very pleasant place, though maybe slightly expensive","Nice, pleasant hotel, good location. Very nice staff, willing to be helpful. Very comfortable bed, good bathroom and shower, good breakfast. The only negative point could be that the price is maybe slightly too high for the kind of hotel it is, though I would recommend the place to anybody who wanted to spend a pleasant night in a good room and did not care too much for having a small reception with limited extra services.",4,2016,04,10
227,Good Central Based Hotel,Went to Dublin for a City Break a few weeks ago for the first time. The hotel was centrally situated for most of the sights. It was clean and room was spacious. The staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly. Nothing was too much for them. Would recommend.,4,2016,04,09
227,Nice Hotel,Nice Hotel in a very good location. Rooms very nice and clean. Bar quite loud with good atmosphere. Plenty of beers to choose from in the bar. Close to all amenities. Friendly staff who are very helpful.,4,2016,04,08
227,"Great location, nice room","I found this to be a very conveniently-located, comfortable hotel, reasonably-priced for its position. I asked for a quiet room so no view to speak of but that was to be expected. Breakfast was decent, the bed was comfortable and the room was clean. WiFi is free. The reception area is a little on the shabby side but the staff were friendly and I would stay here again, for sure.",3,2016,04,08
227,Very Pleased!  Lovely Hotel in Central Dublin!,"I stayed in the Drury Court Hotel for a 3 day weekend visit.  It is a great location that is central to everything in Dublin. The rooms are very clean, comfortable, and quiet.  The staff was super friendly with everything from making the reservation, checking in, helping with directions/restaurant recommendations, and general conversation.  I was lucky enough to even be able to reserve one of their limited availably parking spaces which was great considering the parking situation in Dublin can be difficult.  

On top of everything, I forgot my sunglasses in the room when I left the hotel, called them back up, and they found them immediately and sent them to me via post at no charge.  That is super customer service as far as I am concerned.  I will definitely be back there when I am in Dublin again.",5,2016,04,07
227,Conveniently Located,The hotel is conveniently located and all sites and the shopping belt of Dublin and within walking distance. The room and bed is of good size and comfortable enough and the staff are helpful and will be able to provide directions and recommendation for dinning.,4,2016,04,06
227,Absolutely Great!,"Clean and friendly .Located in the best way possible to walking to near by interests. We had a horrible experience at the Harcourt Russell Hotel ! They say on their site they are 3 Stars but in No Way are they! We moved over to Drury court hotel after 12hours ! Harcourt staff were rude and rooms are scary unsafe. Moving over to Drury Court Hotel was the Best feeling we wanted in a Hotel ...clean and friendly and safe and downtown. Just want to  say a big Thank you to Sofie for taking us in,in our time of need. We will be back. Mr and Mrs Hardie",5,2016,04,04
227,"Wonderful location, Great food, fab hotel and brilliant staff","Fab location, close to Grafton Street yet really quiet at night for sleeping.  Clean, well appointed room, staff were so friendly and helpful - the bar is wonderful, food excellent and really good value, I just wish we had eaten in it both nights instead of going to much more expensive (and not as good) restaurants.  The bar staff were brilliant and Sarah suggested my gin cocktails all night where were soooo good - can't recommend them enough.  Loved the friendly atmosphere in the bar with board games and lots of people just sitting chilling, chatting and having a good time, not too loud music which allowed us to have a good chat.  Breakfast was amazing, freshly cooked full Irish and loads of freshly cut fruit etc the coffee was also excellent.  Couldn't have faulted the hotel which I would recommend to anyone for value, staff, location etc.  You can also get a deal on local car park so make sure you ask as parking in Dublin can be very expensive - Sarah in the bar needs a special mention for being so friendly and helpful.",5,2016,04,04
227,Almost perfect ,"Good things:
- position: walking distance from everything 
- room was comfortable and spacious (we were 2 adults, one toddler and one baby in a triple bedroom)
- clean
- reception desk very efficient and nice
- shower is really good

Bad things:
- no fridge in the room, this sucks if you have little kids
- maybe a little bit noisy but not too much",4,2016,04,03
227,Clean and central,"Spent three nights at the Drury Court with two friends and collegues, in a room with one queen and one single bed. We thought that the hotel was perfectly located for a weekend visit to Dublin, within walking distance of everything. And a few minutes from the hustle and bustle of Temple Bar. We'd rather spend time in the pubs that the locals go to, and there are a lot of them in the area of the hotel.

Before arrival I asked the hotel to make sure we got a quiet room, since I'd read about some street noise from the ground floor bar. We got a room facing the back of the hotel on the top floor, perfect and very quiet! The people working there are really welcoming and nice. The room we got was also very clean and well equipped (refridgerator, coffe/tea options, blow dryer, etc.), with a simple decor.

We discovered the first morning that we'd only got two bath towels, and found that a bit strange since it was a room for three people. We made it work in the morning by using one of the smaller ones, but I had to ask twice to make sure we got a third towel that same day (housekeeping forgot it, so I had to ask again in the evening when we returned from walking the city all day)... Also, the wifi signals are really bad. You get disconnected all the time, and the service is generally unstable. Very frustrating. 

I also feel the need to inform others that come after us that the queen bed has one double duvet, so if you're travelling with friends, like I did, you better be comfortable sharing both the bed and duvet. Fortunately, the guys I travelled with have a sense of humor, so they managed just fine.",4,2016,04,03
227,Loved it,"From arrival the staff of this hotel made us feel welcome
I visited with a friend and we shared a twin room

The room was clean and comfortable and welcoming
The bathroom was brilliant, clean, warm, tiled, no dirty spots, no mould, perfect 
Shower worked brilliantly - lots of warm water and the sink and toilet were both spotless 

We had tea and coffee making facilities which we made full use of and fully enjoyed our stay ♡

We will be back next year!!!",5,2016,04,03
227,OK hotel....,"I really wanted to give this hotel a 4 star because of its location, but the stained carpets and scuffed walls indicated a lack of care for this very well located, decent at best,  hotel.  The tub also was stained from the bath mat, which was very unsightly (and sort of gross!).  The staff was friendly, but I would not stay here again.  While it was somewhat of a bargain for a good location, you get what you pay for.",3,2016,04,02
227,Pretty Good,"Stayed here for two nights with  my mum and found it really nice. The room was large and clean with a large bathroom. The staff were very helpful and went over and above to help in every way although they did tell us the wrong bus and we ended up lost (thankfully I had my iPhone and got ourselves where we needed to be). 
The only downsides of the hotel were that the wifi signal was weak and kept dropping out which wasn't ideal and the breakfast was a greasy mess. No taste, just everything dripping in grease.
The positives were the room (size and cleanliness), the beds were really comfy, there was no issue with noise and it was located in a great area close to shops, restaurants and attractions. 
A nice clean hotel, we will be back - would recommend to others.",4,2016,03,29
227,Great location,"Stayed for a couple of days here. Very centrally located. Easy to get around on foot. Very nice breakfast. Parking is expensive in Dublin, there are a few spaces available to guests nearby if you're lucky enough. ",4,2016,03,26
227,Get what you pay for,"Stayed here for 2 nights from the 26th-28th Feb for a hen party from the reviews and photos we were really looking forward to it. We were a party of 8 with 4 of us in the hotel and the other in the apartments. The apartments had a shower and big double/king bed and a sofa bed in the lounge and also a small balcony , the double bed was really comfy and the shower was powerful and warm too but in places the apartment lacked and could do with a refurb, so one of our doors was missing the handle, the lead for iron had wires exposed and the water hadn't been used in so long it was cloudy and although the main room was very warm with the heating on the rest of the apartment was freezing! And whilst our friends had tea and coffee making facilities we didn't, We also had work men next to us working on a room so when we came back to the room there was a lot of noise from them although this didn't bother us if it was a family staying im sure it would! Whilst our apartment wasn't the greatest the hotel rooms were absolutely lovely ( we had a peek at ours friends) and so were the bar area by the reception , amazing all you can eat breakfast for 12 euro! The location is good about a 5-10 min walk from the main town and about 10-15 mins to temple bar street. There was a hairy lemon across the road that we visited on the evening which was nice and decently priced about 5-6 euro for a drink .If you want to visit temple bar be prepared to spend a lot more money a double disaranno and Coke was 17 euros ,just to show how expensive it can be! Dublin itself is an amazing city and can't wait to come back but will proberly stay elsewhere with a bit more luxury but definately get what you pay for :)",3,2016,03,21
227,Still a Great Hotel,"I used to stay at this Hotel, when I worked in Dublin on a frequent basis.

The staff are always pleasant, and helpful even when you turn up soaked to the skin as we did on our recent visit.  The rooms are of an generous size, although in our room the bathroom is getting near to needing a refurbishment.

The hotel is situated a short walk from all the attraction of Dublin, and close to the Grafton street and St Stevens green shopping centres.  There are many good restaurants close by.

The breakfast at the hotel is excellent.",5,2016,03,15
227,Good Location,"Close to main shopping areas, plenty of choices for food  and bars around the hotel.
The room was a good size, clean and comfortable.
The staff at reception were friendly and helpful.
The hotel  is located on a busy street, yet our room was quiet.
I would return to this hotel in the future.
",4,2016,03,15
227,Great apartment in a great location with lovely staff,"3 double bedrooms in the apartment were perfect for a group. Great location, 5 mins walk from Grafton St and Trinity and 10 mins from Temple Bar. Reception staff were incredibly helpful, even offering to post home some DVDs that my son had left!",5,2016,03,14
227,Nombolazzaroni to see Six Nations ....,"Good Hotel , clean , the concierge were efficently and professional and very good breakfast . Close to Temple Bar and Others Pub , many good restaurants around , Dubli is incredible city , people
are very gent .",4,2016,03,14
227,Perfect location,Nicely maintained hotel. Room was spacious and clean. Receptionists very friendly and attentive. The hotel is right in the heart of activity and yet the hotel rooms are not affected by the outside noise. I would certainly consider staying here again when visiting the city.,4,2016,03,11
227,Good location ,"We visited here for our anniversary and was surprised with this hotel, not necessarily in a good way. The location is great, close to the city and close to all the nice bars and restaurants. 
However the rooms really let this hotel down and prevent it getting more than the average score! 
We paid a fair sum to stay here and was shocked at how basic, small  and 60's looking the rooms were, which is a shame. We paid maybe triple of that compared to a travel lodge yet this seems to be only for the location. The staff are really nice and the location is perfect. The pub below did not affect us regarding noise and is a nice retro bar which we enjoyed a fair few drinks in here prior to hitting the city. 
Modernise the rooms and you have a repeat visitor however we would not return the way they are at the minute unfortunately. ",3,2016,03,11
227,great location!,"I came to the hotel recommended by Irish friends. The room was of very good size , very clean , with TV and wi fi. I was able to make my coffee/tea  in the room whenever I wished . I was on my own and couldn't ask for more comfort, Nice bed , a good bath . Breakfast was varied and everybody made sure that things would be fine during my stay. The staff was helpful in anythiting I needed _ 

The hotel has got a perfect location, near  important historical places of interest _ e.g. The Gaiety, parks , National Gallery, , beautiful shops, nice restaurants , bars _all within walking distance.    
I used a blue bus from the airport to the hotel _ cost me7 Euros and  I used it again to go back to the airport a few days afterwards . Very convenient. 
I no doubt recommend Drury Court Hotel to anyone going to Dublin. I loved the city and I loved the hotel..Thanks",5,2016,03,10
227,Staff,"It's great to go to a hotel and be greeted by such friendly, and efficient staff cant say enough about them . Rooms clean and comfortable. Had a problem with the new tv sorted in less than five minutes. Nothing was a problem. Very central would have thought it would be noisey but was very quiet . Close to main shopping area, lots of restaurants around .",5,2016,03,06
227,Overnight Stay ,Stayed here for one night hotel with hubby. Hotel is so central to Grafton Street and Temple Bar area . The room was very spacious really cosy and warm and had all the necessary requirements for a good stay . Would recommend staff were very helpful and friendly. ,4,2016,03,06

227,Cozy and friendly,"At least for us the location was perfect. Close to everything but not too much in the middle of the bustle.

The hotel interior could do with a makeover but everything was working and clean. 

The staff at the front desk must have been the friendliest and most helpful hotel staff I have ever met.",5,2016,03,03
227,Excellent value for money,"Great location. (round the corner from Templebar) Great staff. Great Rooms. Fantastic Breakfast. Car parking available. I would highly recommend you give this hotel a try, I have stayed in many hotels in Dublin. This one will not disappoint. ",5,2016,03,02
227,Partners 50th,"Booked Drury Court Apartment for my partners 50th. On arrival the apartment we were told was having some repairs therefore not available.  However, it then transpired the previous guests (a stag party) had damaged the bathroom.  
We were given a hotel room as we waited but as they didn't think it would be ready both my partner got a room and my two daughters got a room!  The hotel staff were very apologetic and helpful. 
We got a fruit hamper a bottle of wine and complimentary breakfasts for all 4 of us for both nights 
I had wanted to be together in a apartment but the rooms were lovely and we very much enjoyed our stay. This hotel in perfectly situated to walk everywhere.
The only negative is the staff didn't tell us straight away about the damaged apartment but left it till later on in the day but other than that I would stay here again. Fab 👍🏻
",5,2016,02,29
227,Good location ,Good value for money. Good location. Parking was €20 for 2 days near by. Only niggle is if your a light sleeper the streets are quite loud. Fab stay overall. Staff very friendly. Would return again on our next visit. ,4,2016,02,27
227,"Great value, great location, why need/pay more?","Had to stay overnight in Dublin for an evening event and looked for a hotel nearby. Picked Drury Court as was excellent value on search website I used and location was spot on. Due to cost and 3* hotel rating, I was not expecting a lot, but was very pleasantly surprised. Comfortable large room, very clean and triple glazed for quiet night. Would stay here again for weekend trip to Dublin as it's a stones throw from Grafton St, Stephen's Green etc and is in the trendy Drury Street, South William Street area. Highly recommended.",4,2016,02,26
227,Great Hotel!,Very good hotel convenient to city centre. Great staff especially the German girl on reception. Stayed there for one night and really enjoyed everything about the hotel. The room was very comfortable. ,5,2016,02,25
227,Great location and great service at a great price,"Excellent location in the center of Dublin. Great walking access to Temple Bar, Trinity College, Dublinia, etc. It was very affordable.  Don't expect the Ritz, but it is adequate for the price.   I would definitely go back.  The apartments are a great option for families.",5,2016,02,24
227,Half-term getaway!,"Perfect place to stay for 2 teachers drained from the first half-term of the year! Fantastic staff (they kept our bags, as we arrived in Dublin 4 hours early for check-in, & again for another 6 hours before our flight home!) & a lovely, functional room. In a spot-on location for all things touristy, I'd recommend booking here for a reasonably-priced, comfortable & easy stay!",4,2016,02,23
227,The nicest staff ever!!,"The front of house staff were so lovely. Helpful, friendly and after a night out they went and got me and my sister a pint of water with ice to take up to bed. Very thoughtful. The room was fine too no complaints but the people made it for me",5,2016,02,23

227,Drury Court Hotel,"Excellent, good room, good food, location we couldn't have asked for better, The staff were so helpful, fantastic !  Only one downside not much on site parking, but the 24 hour car park with 24/7 staff on site was 2 minutes away, and the hotel has a deal which is about 80% of the parking cost.
",5,2016,02,17
227,Couldn't fault it.,"It was exactly what it said. There was 4 of us myself, my husband and another couple. We hire a 1 bedroom apartment.

Really well located near restaurants and bars. I would certainly stay here again.",5,2016,02,17
227,Pragmatic day to night transformation!,"The name first reminded me of a ""Management and Cost Accounting"" textbook author back in the business school! Location is excellent...for after business. Numberless pubs are scattered within 20 minutes of walk. The breakfast salon of the hotel turns into a pub for the night - a fantastic transformation which one senses in the morning, based on lighting and amenities. The rooms are a bit small and old-fashioned in design, nonetheless comfortable. Personnel at the reception is very kind and useful in making guests familiar with the place and surroundings. All in all a good experience!",4,2016,02,16
227,Good quality accommodation and great location ,"I spend just one night in the hotel but I can say all the best about my stay. Rooms are nice and clean. The hotel stuff is very friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel is excellent, close to lots of restaurants, pubs, shops, etc.

227,great location a staff,"Smallish hotel in a great location, near to all you would want to see in Dublin.   Rooms are average and hotel does not have any facilities as such but it is ideal for a weekend or short business trip.  Breakfast is served in the pub next door which I found slightly odd as I was eating in dim lighting, however, the breakfast was good and plentiful.  All the staff I met were pleasant and helpful.  There is nothing too fancy about this place but it is definately comfortable enough.",3,2016,02,12
227,Excellent Value,"The hotel is so centrally based in Dublin that all centre city activities are within a very short walk.

Our room was of good size and although street facing, was not noisy at all.  Most importantly, it was clean and well equipped.

Staff on reception were very helpful and pleasant at all times. Location is good, few minutes from temple bar and 2 minutes from Grafton Street Shopping.",5,2016,02,09
227,Surprisingly great!,"It wasn't the easiest to find, as it's tucked into an ally-like corner, so you can't really see it until you're right in front of it, if you approach from Drury st. Based on the pricey-ness of the neighborhood and the very good rate we received, admittedly our expectations weren't very high. However, we were pleasantly surprised at the level of service, the breakfast, the bathroom seemed to be recently upgraded, the size of the standard room was very adequate, and although our window faced the back of  building which was across from a nightclub, the double windows provided nice noise isolation. I was concerned when we arrived that it would be very cold in our room, as I could not get the heater to turn on, but fear not, it was toasty warm when we came back from dinner ( they must only turn it on in the evenings). My friend was hot the whole time and kept insisting we open the windows, which was possible in you were wondering (so whatever your temperature preference- you'll be fine). My only complaint was that bed wasn't comfortable, and the decor a bit warn, but the staff really went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable. The neighborhood is great! Close to all the action, but a few streets away from the main noise.  Loads of great cafes and pubs in the immediate neighborhood and close to public transport, and the airport bus stops 5 mins walk from the hotel. Would certainly consider staying there again.",5,2016,02,09
227,Great location,"The location of the hotel is excellent. The staff are friendly and helpful. The hotel is clean, although the decor is a little dated. The room was very spacious, but could upgrade the televisions. Satellite TV would be a great addition for the wind down after an eventful day/evening. I would recommend and definitely visit again ",4,2016,02,06
227,Incredible value,"Two night city break in a great location with a huge choice of restaurants, bars and cafe's, theatre and shopping all very close by. Hotel room was bigger than expected for the money with good tea and coffee facilities, hair drier with diffuser supplied and a bath that filled up in no time at all. Staff were very helpful, offered to look after our luggage after check out (12:00) due to our late flight (21:50) that evening.",5,2016,02,06
227,Great,"We spend 4 nights at the Drury Court Hotel and we don't regret our choice.
The hotel is in the perfect district to discover the city, near Grafton street. We didn't use the public transport, we did everything by walk. 
The hotel staff is very helpful and welcoming. ",4,2016,02,05

Reception are friendly and helpful, even offering us 10 percent discount next time we stay with them.  We will definitely stay there when we visit Dublin again... ",5,2016,02,04
227,"Great location, friendly staff, reasonably priced.","We stayed at Drury Court Hotel for two nights from the 1st - 3rd February and on arrival to the hotel even though we were a good few hours earlier than our check in time, two of our three rooms were already available. The girls on the reception were really friendly and informative of the local area. The hotel is in walking distance to Trinity College, Temple Bar and Grafton Street and has numerous pubs situated in the immediate vicinity if you are looking for that sort of thing. The restaurant for the hotel doubles up as a bar, we had breakfast on the first day which we hadn't booked with the room before we travelled but was able to get a full Irish breakfast with toast and tea/coffee for €8. The food was good and the restaurant staff very friendly and always on hand to offer more coffee or tea or to find out if we needed anything more.

I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone coming to Dublin and would definitely return here again. ",5,2016,02,04
227,Drury court hotel,"Stayed for 3 nights over Halloween weekend with some friends. Had a very nice stay. Polite and helpful staff. Nice room with comfortable bed. Full Irish breakfast, which was a nice start to the morning. Ideally located for a lot of things, including temple bar 5-10 minutes walk away. For the ladies, lots of shops within a 5 minute walk from the hotel. For the gents a bar I think was named sonnets which has the biggest sports screen I have ever seen and is only 3-4 minutes away. Also a very nice bar adjoining the hotel, which has a large selection of ales for the ale lovers out there. Overall, I would definitely stay there again",4,2016,02,04
227,Excellent stay,Went to Dublin for the panto in the gaiety and stayed here. Perfect location and reasonable room for the price. Staff were nice. We walked to the Panto from the hotel and it was very straight forward. ,5,2016,02,01

227,"Great hotel, great location","Just got back from a long weekend in Dublin, staying here, and all of us agreed, (3 couples) it was fantastic, great location, great place to stay, and will be back, thought it could be noisy (pub underneath) but didn't hear anything, just a short walk to the pubs and restaurants ",5,2016,01,31
227,Nice place to stay in central Dublin.,"I had a one bed room, small but convenient, a good bath room. Interiors are not worn out as I have seen at other Dublin hotels in this price level. And not as noisy as other hotels. Good internet connection at my room. Breakfast really good. Many sorts of cereals and bread, the ham was so tasty, fresh juice, hot meals, fruit. I had the feeling that the bar room where the breakfast was served basically had looked the same for around 300 years. Ceiling beautifully carved, amazing!",4,2016,01,30
227,Three Nights In Dublin.,"Perfect location.
Very friendly staff at reception.
VERY comfortable bed.
Very clean everywhere in the hotel.
All the facilities you could want including a hair dryer, and free safe.
I would recommend this Hotel to anyone wishing to stay in Central Dublin.
Simply 5 minute walk from Dame Street, 5 minutes from St. Stephen's Green, 5 minutes from Trinity College, 5 minute walk from Temple Bar, less than a 10 minute walk to Christ Church.
Having arrived in Dublin from Liverpool at 9 15am, we arrived at Drury Court at 11am, asking could we leave our bags, as we were so early. A room (507) was ready for us, being described - perfectly - as a quiet room on the top floor. We were delighted, and off into town before noon having hung up our clothes etc.
Excellent breakfasts.
I WILL return to stay at Drury Court again, and dont hesitate - book this hotel.",5,2016,01,29
227,Nice hotel - Great location,"We were staying for one night to attend a music event in the Olympia Theatre. The hotel was in a great location - Stephen's Green & Grafton St. are only a 1 minute walk away, Trinity College and Temple Bar a 5-10 minute walk. The hotel reception staff were very pleasant and welcoming. The room was comfortable and clean, with a double & single bed, tea/coffee making facilities and multichannel tv. Free WiFi in the room also. Excellent soundproofing provided by a dual window system.  A large selection of restaurants, cafes and bars in the immediate vicinity. ",4,2016,01,27
227,Great city centre hotel,We had a lovely stay in the hotel. The hotel was very central only a 3 minute walk to the main shopping streets of dublin and surrounded by loads of delicious restaurants. the staff were so helpful and accommodating. Will be back!,5,2016,01,27
227,"Great location, comfortable hotel","Ideal for overnight stay for work. Centrally located. Clean, tidy and comfortable room.   Breakfast was nice with a good selection.  I ordered from the cooked breakfast menu as well and although looked good unfortunately didn't taste all that nice.  Overall though good hotel at good price. Would stay again. ",4,2016,01,27
227,Everything what we needed,"As we arrived to Dublin quite early, we asked for an early check in and they allowed us in straight away. Which is great. Staff was really helpful and the room was nice and clean. Good location, near to many bars and main shopping area. Couldn't ask for anything else really. Thanks!",4,2016,01,26
227,Very Clean,"We only stayed one night and found the reception staff very friendly, the room was very clean as was the rest of the hotel. The location is in a excellent location walking distance to all location. Very good value will definitely stay again. Just one issue and maybe not a complaint for some but I found the room too warn for comfortable nights sleep but that just me.",4,2016,01,26
227,It was what it was....,"Can't think of anything negative to say about this hotel, as there isn't really much to it. Basic reception. No bar. In fact, nothing at all. Room was average, from the 1990s, but very clean and perfectly acceptable. Soundproofed, just about what you need, very nice. Bit bland, don't get over-excited, it is what it is. You won't leave feeling blown away, but you'll be happy with what you had, recommended",4,2016,01,24
227,"Great location, excellent value","Travelled to Dublin for a 3 night stay with friends.  Arrived at the hotel early and was immediately impressed by the friendliness and welcome of the staff - throughout my stay I could not fault any of the girls on reception!  They gladly took our luggage to store ahead of our room being ready.  

We had booked a room for 3 - 1 double and 1 single bed - and were not disappointed with the size of the room.  There was plenty of space for us not to be falling over each other and sufficient storage to be able to unpack and store our cases.  The most impressive thing was the cleanliness.  The room was immaculate and very well presented.  The only thing I would say was that the room was extremely warm even in December and without the radiator on!  The windows don't open very far (as you would expect) so it was difficult to cool down, particularly after 3 people had showered!  This, however, is not a complaint and would not put me off staying here again.

The location is fantastic - in the heart of the main attractions including Temple Bar (5 mins walk) and the shopping on Grafton Street etc.  We walked everywhere from this hotel and the reception staff are well informed should you need directions or advice.  

I will say this - do NOT book here if you are a light sleeper!  There is a lively bar and restaurant directly beneath the hotel and another across the road and the noise travels.  I found earplugs did a satisfactory job of blocking the noise but it can get quite rowdy and be particularly noisy when the pub is receiving a delivery of many many barrels!  

I stayed on a room only basis so can't comment on the food offered but there are plenty of cafés and restaurants literally a stones throw from the hotel offering ample choice for places to eat.  

When I return to Dublin this will be my first choice of hotel.",5,2016,01,24
227,Drury hotel,"Great location .great value . Only downside is room service finished at 10pm . Fantastic choice for breakfast . Fresh fruit and yogurt etc, hot .food freshly cooked while you wait .mins away from the gaiety and Stevens green shopping centre . ",4,2016,01,23
227,Nice Hotel in heart of city centre,"Booked into Drury Court Hotel just for one night meeting friends in city centre so booked room to be near grafton street area.

The reception staff were very polite and helpful when i arrived and checked in the room was very clean a little bit small and cramped i stayed in room with 2 single beds on 4th floor but it did the job and was comfy enough the bed was bit hard but hey again it did the job required (-:  €79.00 for one night with no breakfast is bit over the top but all other hotels similar were charging much more which is a problem with our Hotels they charge way over the top for staying in city centre and change their prices all to often when large gigs etc are on and then add even more on the price but that's rip of Ireland for you )-:",4,2016,01,23
227,Dublin 2016,"Fantastic hotel,ideal central location with bars and restaurants all around.The staff are very polite and helpful, the rooms are spacious and well decorated, if I had one little negative it would be the bed was a bit hard.

227,The  frendliest people!,"The hotel is centrally located - you can get anywhere easily from there. The staff is really friendly and willing to help with everyting.) Rooms are small, but clean and have everything. I found that it was quite chilly in the room, but I believe it is everywhere in Doublin. In our conference room in other place it was quite cold as well.) The blankets are vry warm, so you won't be cold at night. 
There is a lot of places to eat around.",4,2016,01,18
227,Comfortable & Friendly,"We were staying in Dublin for two nights and selected the Drury Court Hotel because of its proximity to the places that we wanted to visit. We received a warm welcome and throughout our short stay the staff could not have been more friendly and helpful, especially to my wife who is in a wheelchair. The disabled-access room - bizarrely on the top floor but accessible by lift - was spacious and easy for her to move around in. 
The hotel is situated in a pleasant street with a bar next door (where residents can also eat an excellent Irish breakfast) and one across the street. Temple Bar, Trinity College, St Stephen Green etc are all within a very easy walk - even pushing a wheelchair!
We will certainly use this hotel again when we are next in Dublin.",4,2016,01,17
227,"Excellent location, friendly staff","Excellent location within easy walking distance to most sights, good restaurants, shopping in Dublin.  Staff at reception were friendly and very helpful - allowed us early check-in, made several good recommendations for restaurants, arranged a car to the airport for us (family of 4) for 30euros which is essentially what it would have cost us to take public transport.  Rooms was average but clean and bed was comfortable.  Great value for money.",4,2016,01,17
227,Excellent location and value. Right in the heart of Dublin.,"Rented the 3 bedroom apartment and was very pleased with the location and quality of the bedrooms. Helpful staff and lots of restaurants located near by. Go check out the Hairy Lemon on the corner for a good meal and pint. Short walk to Temple, Trinity, Guinness, or anything else you are interested in. Only 1 bathroom which wasn't a problem for us but they should add a little table in there so you have some place to put toiletries. Good wifi.",4,2016,01,16

227,Two night city break,I stayed with my husband for two nights and the location of the hotel is absolutely perfect! The rooms were very clean and comfortable and we had a lovely stay. Our only gripe was the noise outside which obviously couldn't be helped by the staff but it was loud at times and the walls within the hotel are very thin. The staff were very friendly throughout our stay. Thank you! ,4,2016,01,05
227,Excellent,"Really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The service was excellent from staff, and the room was high quality and really clean. Breakfast was also excellent. Would definitely stay here again and highly recommend to others ",5,2016,01,03

227,Great family run hotel,"Myself and my partner booked a last minute night away in the Drury Court Hotel. The location is amazing, just a few minutes walk from Stephens Green. Due to the central location (and our front facing room,101) we expected noise but we slept soundly! Staff were extremely friendly and even dropped up extra goodies when we requested some more milk! It offers a return discount to customers and we would have no hesitation returning. ",5,2015,12,30
227,Super hotel,"Decided to stay overnight at the last minute. Got a room for 70 euro - two single beds. Very friendly and helpful staff. Superb location, very central but not noisy. Room was big, clean and very comfortable. Definitely going back here.",5,2015,12,30
227,Shopping trip,Second time staying here and was just as good as last time. Very central and staff very helpful. Breakfast good and served to you with small buffet if you wish extra so nice rather than cold food. Would stay again.,5,2015,12,29

We were given Room 503, at the top of the house. Room was spacious and spotless. Some steet noise but hey,, it was the weekend before Xmas and Dublin was buzzing. Would recommend the Drury Court without hesitation. Brilliant location, good value and very clean.",5,2015,12,21
227,Central and good,"My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights B&B.  The hotel is very central to St Stephen's Green and Grafton Street - only a few minutes walk.  Although the hotel had a lively bar within the building, we heard nothing of its activities at night.  The room was small, well presented and had all the usual facilities.  No air conditioning.  The shower was good, plenty of hot water.  The absence of a shaving/make-up mirror in the bathroom was disappointing.  Whoever fitted the assist handle in the shower area over the bath did so at a critical, elbow-bashing height!  There was no safe.  The TV was fine.  Breakfast was as expected and quite reasonable; the 'dining room' was the bar; this felt and smelled like a bar the morning after and was poorly lit.  If it does not suite your taste, there are plenty of cafes within 100m of the door!",4,2015,12,21
227,Great location,"Very nice, clean room. Told it was a quiet room, but there was a lot of noise from the bar downstairs, especially of furniture being moved in the early hours of the morning. It would be fine for those who were in Dublin to experience the nightlife, we were on a shopping trip and would have preferred a good nights sleep. We didn't feel any need to complain as it was out of the reception staff's control. The staff were very nice and courteous. Checking in and out was easy and the parking in St Stephen's Green SC was great value. ",3,2015,12,17
227,Great location,"This is a great location right in the heart of the action in Dublin. There are several pubs right around the hotel, so if you are a light sleeper this is not the place for you on the weekends. Also, it's not fancy, but it's clean. The price is all about location and it worked perfectly for my trip. The breakfast was terrible- I would suggest you opt out.",4,2015,12,16
227,"Wonderful hotel, ideal location","I chose it because of it’s central position – it is probably the best located hotel in Cork if you want to be right in the heart of the city. This hotel is ideal for shopping as it is just a few minutes walk from all the best shops. Lovely comfortable rooms and the staff make you feel very welcome and to be honest it is like home from home. I stayed many times at the Drury Court Hotel - great location, great staff, great rooms.... would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,12,16
227,great location for the city centre,"we booked here for one night only and found this hotel right in the heart of the city,the hotel staff were very nice and willing to help,the room was a double and was spotless.there is a kettle in the room with tea bags and coffee if you fancy a brew. the bathroom has a bath and shower with the usual soaps and shampoos,also nice fluffy towels  and again everything is spotless,this is a small hotel and does not let itself down like some others,i will be going back to this hotel,we booked in on a monday and paid 62 euro great value.

227,Couldn't fault the Drury Court,"Stayed recently at the Drury Court Hotel with a toddler and have to say we had a fantastic stay. The room we were given was spacious and clean.

227,dublin hot spot,"This hotel is smack bang in the middle of a very lively part of Dublin surrounded by a plethora of pubs, restaurants shopping centers and theaters. It is also close to Stephen's Green, Dublin Castle, The National Museum, Trinity College and many other must see icons of the city. The only grumble would be the bathroom which, obviously once grand, now needs a little attention. A highlight of our night out visiting the local watering holes was being pedalled home in a rickshaw complete with sat nav. Such luxury! ",4,2015,12,09
227,"Fantastic location, lovely staff",Stayed here for 1 night on Dec 7th. 2 adults and 2 kids. Location is brilliant. Centre of Dublin. Shops and restaurants on doorstep. Breakfast served in adjoining pub and it was lovely. Would definitely stay here again. ,5,2015,12,08

227,Good location ,"We booked for a couple of nights whilst in Dublin for Simply Red and a visit for a couple of days. The location is excellent, room ticks all the boxes and the staff are friendly and helpful.

Only down side for us was despite being in the 3rd floor the room was a little loud. We could hear the bar downstairs and the people outside smoking etc. This did not go on too late, but we were there on a Monday and Tuesday. It could well be an issue at the weekend. 

Despite this still recommending the hotel. ",4,2015,12,02

The room wasn't fancy, but it was clean. The hotel is surrounded by restaurants, pubs and shops. We stayed there in November and slept with the windows closed. I am not sure if street noise would be an issue during warmer months. I would stay there again.",5,2015,11,30

227,"Location,location,location","Have just returned after my third visit this year. Great rate & free parking. Reception staff couldn't have been more helpful. Always enjoy staying here as guests are met with a smile & a friendly welcome. Perfect location, close to stephen's green centre, gaiety theatre, grafton st & plenty of nice eateries! The green luas line stop is just past the main entrance to the stephen's green shopping centre, it takes approx 20mins to get to the Dundrum Town Centre. The room itself was spacious & clean, as was the bathroom. Free WiFi.Good towels. Comfortable bed. Plenty of tea/coffee etc. Windows can be opened & have double glazing which works well (even on the second floor facing the street). Air con would be a nice addition. Some rooms are short of sockets which, in this age of technology, is not great if more than one item at a time needs charging. One negative is the hot water in the bathroom washbasin gets dangerously hot, it might be an idea to replace the  taps with a mixer tap. Some of the grout was missing from around the tiles. Would highly recommend this hotel & look forward to my next visit.",4,2015,11,27

227,"Super location, free parking, great staff,","I've stayed at the Drury Court a number of times because of their amazing location, right at the top of Sth William St, and around the corner from St Stephens Green and Grafton Street. Despite their central location, the rooms have good soundproofing so there's no disturbance from the busy street outside. They provide limited free car parking spaces so ring ahead of you need one.
It's a 3 star hotel so the rooms are basic but have everything you need and are very clean. 
Our room was ready when we arrived and the staff allowed us to leave our car there while we hit the shops on the day of departure.
We'll definitely stay again",5,2015,11,24

227,Shopping with daughter,"Hotel was so much more than I hoped for, very safe central location just 5 min to Luas, for the Dundrum shopping center.  Reception very helpful, parking was free.  Returning customers get 10% so already planning next years trip. ",5,2015,11,19
227,Excellent 3 star hotel.,"Very nice helpful staff, good sized comfortable room and a fantastic location. I had to stay in Dublin for business on the night of a big football match (soccer) which was on in Dublin, so most hotels were sold out and the few that had rooms available were charging ridiculous prices. I then found the Drury court which was by far the cheapest and as it turns out it is probably the best 3 star I have stayed in, in Dublin! It certainly is in the best location. Oh and the wifi was pretty good in the room too!",5,2015,11,19
227,Thank you Drury Court!,"Stayed here for two nights. Lovely clean room, pretty large by European standards. Above a pub so if you like silence, won't get it at the Drury. However what you do get is fantastic helpful staff, very central location and many amenities. We will be back!",5,2015,11,18
227,A breath of fresh air...,"I originally had a different hotel booked in Dublin for the night and when I arrived to it there was no way I could stay there. It was disgusting and they booked my boyfriend and I into 2 different rooms on 2 different floors when I booked one room! And they gave us twin beds when my boyfriend is 6ft 5in. 
We immediately got onto Hotwire and were assigned to the Drury Court Hotel.
May I just say this was a blessing in disguise.
First off, the location was amazing. There is a bar accross the street called the Hairy Lemon that is a hoot! Everywhere we went was walking distance (even the Guinness Storehouse). 
Second, from the moment I arrived I felt as though I was in a safe haven compared to the last place! I was greeted with a smile and warm welcome and was accepted right away even though I had just booked the room about 10 minutes prior. We were early for check in but they took our bags and held on to them for us as we went out and ventured.
As I booked one double room, I explained to them that I needed one bed (not twin beds) as my boyfriends height needs. She immediately assured us we would get this and indeed we did! We got a beautiful room (101) on the first floor street side. The view was cute and having the window slightly open and hearing the sounds from below was peaceful (never noisy). The room was gorgeous with comfortable and classic room decor with just enough room for us. Not too big not too small. I was happy and impressed for it being listed as a 3 star.
The price was more than fair (although I did book on Hotwire so I may have gotten it cheaper but when all other hotels were full I still think we got a great deal). 
Definitely stay here if you want cozy, great service and just a normal hotel experience.
I have NOTHING bad to say about my stay and since I work in the travel industry I will be recommending this hotel to my own clients. 
Thank you so so much for a wonderful stay!",5,2015,11,18
227,Excellent hotel,"Brilliant stay, close to main shopping area. Fantastic staff. Clean and quiet. For the location this hotel is excellent value for money. Breakfast was top quality and service was excellent. Will definitely return.",5,2015,11,16
227,"central location, great value","We stayed in a 3BR apartment in the center of Dublin for only 140 Euro.  The place was spacious; they gave us free parking (hint: because we booked direct!); check in and out was easy; friendly staff; etc.

Just a great overall value in central Dublin",5,2015,11,16
227,Helpful staff make stay pleasant,"We were greeted by very helpful and pleasant young staff. Got our room at the back of the hotel. I expected it to be quiet but was noisy early morning with bottles, etc being dumped, Double windows didn't help quell the noise. Decent room size, overall very pleasant. Expensive enough for room only.
FYI: If visiting again contact hotel reception directly as they offer a  discount for subsequent visits.",3,2015,11,13
227,Lovely helpful staff,"My Family and I stayed two night and found the hotel to be in a perfect location, room was clean and the staff very helpful,
The only moan was that the rooms were very warm and if you left the windows open too noisy. So turn the radiators down if you like a cool room as soon as you arrive. One radiator we couldn't turn of, but the staff sorted it for us and even offered an electric fan! (so warm for unseasonable November !!   would defiantly use this hotel if visiting Dublin again.",4,2015,11,09
227,Disappointed!,"I bought my elderly parents a gift voucher from the hotels website, due to its location and reviews on tripadvisor.  I then booked their room, again on the hotels website for Thursday past.  When my parents, who are pensioners, arrived they were informed by the lady on reception that they could not use their voucher as they had not booked directly with the hotel (I had booked on the hotels website, in my opinion, directly with the hotel).  This obviously caused my parents distress, the receptionist said she would look into it and let them know before she went off duty if there was anything she could do.  When they were leaving the hotel for dinner later, she did say that they could use the voucher, however, as they were only there for one night (my father is recovering from treatment and is very tired) this had already spoilt what should have been a relaxing time.  The both said the rooms were ok, however there was no iron or trouser press, but the location is good. Breakfast is not included and as I stay in Dublin regularly, I think this hotel is overpriced for a nights sleep.  I will not be using this hotel again.",2,2015,11,03
227,Friendly Staff Great Location,"Pro's- Great location in Temple Bar area. Plenty of bars, restaurants & shops on your door step. Very friendly, helpful staff, reception, breakfast, cleaners...everyone. Good sized room with great double bed, bath & shower. TV. Safe & Wi-Fi. Decent full Irish and/or Continental breakfast's.

Con's- Only one actually...Noise. We knew it would be lively being in Temple Bar area. But bottle banks being emptied at 5.45am, along with early morning traffic, a lie in was difficult. With windows and curtains closed it was better, but with no air con' the room became warm and stuffy.

That aside, a great hotel that I would and have recommended .",4,2015,11,02
227,"Unfortunately didn't get chance to stay, but still had a very good experience","I had booked rooms at the Drury Court Hotel for a hen weekend and I had booked this through booking.com on a deal which meant that you couldn't cancel. Unfortunately i had to cancel the hen weekend, the hotel were so understanding and helpful, as were booking.com. They agreed to refund the full amount i had paid, including the non sterling transaction fee and not charge a cancellation fee. They did this with completely no hassle. Thank you for making this so easy for me. If i book another trip to Dublin i will definitely be staying here.",5,2015,11,01
227,"Fantastic Irish breakfast, Decent room","Centrally located hotel with decent pricing. Hotels in Dublin, specially in center are very expensive to compare for other cities. 
The hotel seems not belong to any hotel chain thus for business traveller many amenities might be missing.
The photo of the hotel as shown should be more honest ... 
Staff is very friendly and helpful, hotel is nicely managed.
Fantastic full Irish breakfast.
Comfortable beds, pillows might improve.",4,2015,10,30
227,Overall - it was ok,"We stayed just for one night. I chose the hotel due to is proximity to center area. 
It's very well located, close to Grafton Street, Temple Bar....
Hotel - nice room, quite big and comfortable. 
Staff - so and so. sometimes not as nice as I was used to in other hotels. 
I was disappointed about the parking. Because we did the booking on another platform and not drectly at the hotel location we did not had a spot in their parking lot assured so we were redirected to a nearby parking lot where with their discount we were assured to pay only 12 E/ 24 h and not the regular parking price. At the hotel parking would have been 7 Euro. 
At the check-out we had to pay 2 Euro t the parking place, for sure there was a mistake but nobody could do anything about it. They all had rules prior to checking-out not afterwards. 
It's  a good hotel but take special attention to additional costs you might pay.",3,2015,10,26
227,Wonderful small hotel,"Great hotel!   Great staff!!    Nothing was too much trouble!   Pub was attached so you just had to go through the lobby for your breakfast, which was also excellent!   Pub staff were also great!    Beds and pillows were comfortable.   When the pubs starting closing, the streets below could get quite noisy....but if you close the windows you heard nothing.   But then, if you close the windows, the room got quite stuffy.....so it was an interesting balancing act.....keep in mind, the noise is short lived.   We suggested a fan in the room, just to keep the air moving if it got too noisy.    The street noise is of course not the hotels fault, you just need to be aware before booking if that would bother you.   The hotel is perfectly located within walking distance to just about everything and the buses were right down the road.   Dublin's public transportation is excellent!!   Would highly recommend staying here!",4,2015,10,25
227,"Great hotel in quiet area close to Temple Bar, Trinity College, St Stepehen's Green","Great hotel with good size rooms that are clean, roomy, with desk and table and chair.  Nice size bathroom - with tub/shower.  Friendly staff and close to Trinity College, St Stephen's Green, and Temple Bar area.  Restaurants and pubs in area and close to shopping",5,2015,10,22
227,Loved the Drury Court,"Went here for a girls night away booked a double room and got upgraded to an apartment, lovely hotel, very friendly and helpful staff and a great location, I wiil definately be returning to this hotel ",4,2015,10,21
227,"Great location, comfortable hotel","My father and I stayed at the Drury Court in early October 2015 while on a one week vacation in Dublin. 
We very much enjoyed our stay. The desk staff and maids were wonderful and very helpful with our endless questioning. 
The hotel is attached to P Macs, which was a wonderful little pub with a great selection of draught beers. Fun place, got very busy later in the day. We were on the fourth floor and it was fairly quiet- although some rowdier weekend nights we could definitely hear the pub-goers below. But not too bad.
The rooms could use some renovating/refurbishing but were very comfortable and spacious by European standards. The décor and the lack of a top sheet was the only thing that stops me from giving it five stars. The duvet got way too warm and the heat was hard to adjust.

I would for sure stay here again! The location cannot be beat. My Dad is 77 and yet we walked to ALL the sights from here- Trinity, Christchurch, Temple Bar, Grafton street, all the museums, St. Stephen's Green park, and St. Patrick's Cathedral. The only time we took a bus all week was to the gaol.

Our other choice had been Jury's Inn Christchurch and when we saw that area we were SO happy we chose the Drury Court- far more pubs and great restaurants close by!",4,2015,10,20
227,The perfect charm of Temple Bar,"The location couldn't be better – so close the heart of Temple Bar. Everything's there within walking distance. The staff at Drury Court is very friendly, especially those in charge of the breakfast, which is served in the integrated Pub. Breakfast buffet is of good quality, Irish breakfast was delicious, too. Overall, the rooms are  nice, and at night it is – given to the nightlife neighborhood – quiet, thanks to double-glazed windows. I only recognized some muggy odors in the room, which was the only thing I wasn't so happy with. ",5,2015,10,20
227,Clean and close to Grafton Street ,"After one night in the Hilton on the edge of town, I could not bear the thought of more time in a soulless hotel. So I hit the Trip Advisor and looked for something more authentic. 

Location was important as was cost and the Drury Court delivered both. Just a few blocks from Dublin's main pedestrian thoroughfare and right in the middle of the action sits this gem. 

The service was exceptional - the front desk provided excellent recommendations on local pubs and music and was more than patient with my endless questions. 

The concern I had was noise and that is definitely a risk. Although what they called triple glazed Windows - actually two separate Windows did a good enough job - along with a few Irish Whiskeys - to set me sound asleep. 

The rooms were clean - but don't expect soulless corporate hotel sanitized. 

The bed was quite comfortable but the pillows super firm. Omg- I have become such a prima Donna. 

I am really torn as to whether this is five stars or four. It's a great locations and great price. The girls up front are amazing. But it could be loud and could use some updating. 

However I am going 5 based on the price and music advice. ",5,2015,10,18
227,Drury Court Hotel,"This is a small hotel with the nicest staff in the world. I enjoyed my stay in Dublin very much, in part because I could ask them anything and they were infinitely patient. The pub attached, where I breakfasted each day, had excellent food and was very accommodating and comfortable. It is perfectly located and easy to maneuver, even for someone directionally impaired.  I had come in early from the US and they had my room ready so much earlier than expected. It was safe and comfortable for a woman traveling alone. And there were many good restaurants all around. All this was wonderful. 

As others have noted, the beds are VERY firm. And if you open the windows, which I did, you hear quite a lot of street noise coming up from the pubs. I ran a ""noise"" app to keep the street noise from bothering me and that took care of it. My aircon was stuck in the on position and they fixed it upon first call. (In the 60s so definitely didn't need it). I was in a small room that needed airing out--no vent in the bathroom. Finally, there's no real place to ""hang out"" and have a visitor, which I missed. When you're there, you're in your room. Since I was staying a week doing business, it would have been nice. The attached pub got loud and busy with young people after about 4 pm....

All told, it was a good value. And really, the people made the stay. ",4,2015,10,14
227,Large rooms easy walking distance to most attractions,Clean spacious rooms. comfortable beds and quality linen. Definitely no smell of smoke a definite plus for us. Welcoming staff. Good option for breakfast. Shot walking distance to shopping and Grafton Street.,5,2015,10,14
227,Great hotel with friendly and efficient service,"We were there just prior to a wedding and they couldn't have been more helpful with all our different and varied needs. Just seemed a little on the expensive side, but apparently that is normal for Dublin!",5,2015,10,13
227,"Great Location, Helpful Staff","Spacious room for a group of three friends visiting the city.  Location is fantastic -- easy walking distance to Grafton Street, Trinity College, the Irish Whiskey Museum, St. Stevens Square, and many other Dublin attractions. The room was clean and well maintained.  The front desk staff--no matter what time of day or night--were friendly, helpful and accommodating.",5,2015,10,12
227,Small and well located hotel,Everything about this small hotel suited our needs. The staff gave us a very warm reception and good advice on restaurants. Breakfast in the adjoining pub was good value though a cafetière would not go amiss - the beds were comfortable and the room very cleN,5,2015,10,12
227,Super shower,Great hotel with a fabulous shower and a good comfy and spacious room. Right in the center of Dublin therfore great location. 5min walk to temple bar and trinity college. Good parking oposit with 8 pounds overnight charge (17.30 h to 10),5,2015,10,12
227,Fantastic value for money ,Really enjoy staying at this hotel. I have been a guest about 4 times and each visit the rooms are all spotless and checking in and out is seamless. The front desk is always very helpful and the location is perfect. I stay for business so I like the fact their windows are so thick you cannot hear he noise from the street below. Would recommend this hotel for all types of travelers. ,5,2015,10,12
227,Very Pleasant Stay,"This hotel is in a very good location, close to St. Stevens Square. It is on a small street in a quaint part of town. It is also far enough from Temple Bar to avoid all of the craziness.

Our room was large, nicely appointed and was very clean. Our bathroom was also a very good size but the lighting was inadequate for shaving or applying make up. There is no safe in the room but there is tea and coffee provided in the room. We were in the front of the hotel and right over the adjoining pub so it was a little noisy one night but not terrible.

We opted for the breakfast plan which was OK but not great. It was served in the adjoining pub. Our breakfast was cooked to order but we could also help ourselves to the buffet. Service at breakfast was not terrific and I got the impression the servers were also servers in the pub. They were actually straightening up things from the night before while we ate. I would go somewhere else for breakfast on a return trip.

The front desk staff were terrific. They were very helpful and caring. They were very resourceful in helping us out with a minor emergency. They are on duty 24 hours.",4,2015,10,02
227,Nice hotel,"Nice hotel. Friendly staff. Clean room. Comfortable bed. Lots of carpet. Nice bar. Decent breakfast. Coffee... well, it's still the British Isles. Located walking distance from all the nice pubs and bars.

227,Perfect,"Went to Dublin for the first time for 2 nights with my best friend. Stayed at this hotel and couldn't fault it. The staff were so friendly and helpful especially the girl who helped with my boarding pass when we left. It was a really enjoyable stay.

227,Disappointing Two Bedroom Apartment.,"I booked an overpriced two bedroom apartment which had the following issues:
.Strong smell of vomit coming from one of the bedrooms
.Television was not working.
.The hot water tap in the bathroom is faulty and when turned on it shoots very hot water across the bathroom which is dangerous.
.The electric heater in the living room was very poor and did not heat the room.
.Dirty Shower
.Mattress is old, springs gone, sank into it.
.The leather couches are old and worn.

I rang the hotel reception on the night I was staying about the smell of vomit and the television not working and unfortunately they did not do anything to fix these issues. I was not offered a refund nor was I offered another apartment or room. I was only offered a free breakfast as an apology but I was unable to attend due to a business meeting. I was told by the manager if I ever wanted to book the apartment again they would give me some sort of deal.

If they fixed the above issues and updated the apartment then it would be a good place to stay as the location is great and the apartment is quiet.",2,2015,10,01
227,Great staff & location,"The hotel is clean and slightly dated but the staff and location are first class. The rooms are standard European size but comfortable. Just a short walk from the tourist spots of Temple Bar an Grafton St Mall, it is well positioned amongst  good cafes and St Stephen's Green.",4,2015,09,30
227,Perfect Location,"We found the location of this hotel perfect for our needs.  It was only a short walk to Grafton Street, Temple Bar, Trinity University, restaurants and a Hop on Hop of Bus stop. 

The room was exceptionally clean and the staff were so friendly.  The ladies at the reception desk helped us with securing a reservation at F.X. Buckley and arranging our cab the morning of our departure to the airport.  

The breakfast in the attached restaurant was a tasty continental breakfast that also contained cheese and ham.  Also they had amazing croissants!  The staff were welcoming and helpful.

We enjoyed our stay and would recommend this hotel for those looking for a  central location in the city.",4,2015,09,28
227,Apartment rooms in great location,"Our young family stayed four nights in a one-bedroom unit in the attached apartment complex serviced by the hotel and couldn't be happier with our decision. Having a bedroom, bathroom, full kitchen, living room and dining area for our stay in Dublin was so nice, especially with two children 2 years old and under. The hotel's location in South City Centre made it convenient for us to walk everywhere we wanted to go, from Grafton Street and Trinity College to Temple Bar and Christ Church. It was 15 minutes or less on foot to all of those locations, along with the Jervis Shopping Centre and Tara Street railway station. The hotel staff was also very friendly and helpful. All in all, we can't say enough good things about this hotel!",5,2015,09,27
227,Nice hotel,"The hotel was nice, and perfectly located for my stay. The staff were also friendly. The room featured a bathtub, which is always a plus. The breakfast was a bit dull, but it´s not included in the fare, so you could just eat somewhere else instead!
      ",4,2015,09,25
227,"Great location, average rooms","Perhaps my average rating of the Drury Court Hotel is a result of being able to compare it to another Dublin hotel that we stayed at the start of our trip and is only slightly above it in the TripAdvisor ratings.  We much preferred the other hotel but there were no vacancies available for our return to Dublin at the end of our trip.

If location to the city center is your only concern, the Drury Court would be a great choice.  The hotel is a five-minute walk to nearly any place you want to go in the city center.  The hotel staff was extremely helpful.

Breakfast is available in the attached adjacent bar/club.  The cold breakfast is limited mostly to juice, cereal, and croissants.  The hot breakfast offers a full Irish breakfast.  The scrambled eggs and bacon were good.

Our room was average, at best.  It appeared to be a handicap-accessible room, which is strange since it was on the top floor and as far away from the elevator as any room on the floor.  The rubber bath mat had mold on it, so we didn't use it.  When we arrived the staff had left the windows open.  A quick glance out the bathroom window revealed a discarded disposable razor in the gutter a few inches below the window.  It was quite off-putting and was surprising that the staff would not have cleaned it up as it would be in full view when they opened the window.  The bathroom sink had separate hot and cold taps which makes washing hands difficult.  You either have to tolerate the scolding hot water or just use the cold water.

There is no air conditioning available, so you have to open the windows to cool down the room at night.  However, the bar below plays loud music in the evening and patrons of the neighboring bars/clubs are quite noisy.  So you either have to deal with a stuffy room with closed windows or external noise with them open.  Bed was quite firm.",3,2015,09,24
227,Nice city location,"Hotel was convenient and close to the action but because of that our room was quite noisy although the front desk said it was a ""quiet"" room! All the smokers were hanging outside the bars talking,laughing",4,2015,09,24
227,"You won't be sorry, very comfortable!","The 3 bedroom apartment was very comfortable for us all (5), its in a great location. The staff was very accommodating when we asked any questions or for recommendations, they even helped us print our boarding passes the night before we left, also Sophia went above and beyond to mail a package for us! The beds, bedding, towels and maid service everyday were very nice for the apartment also! When we asked for coffee, tea and cream they brought it up right away.  We had a wonderful holiday!",5,2015,09,24
227,very noisy on street below/no views/no air conditioning,"I would stay able but never in the summer, too loud and no AC.  Hotel itself was clean and staff very friendly and helpful.

227,"A perfectly nice, city center hotel","We booked Drury Court blind not knowing anything about it or where it was located in Dublin.  We were pleasantly surprised at our good fortune on both counts.

On all counts DC met our expectations.  Staff were invariably welcoming, helpful and friendly - reception, bar, room service, breakfast - every person we met was outwardly friendly and accommodating.  Our room was thoroughly satisfactory, spotlessly clean and fresh.  The bathroom was the same, well appointed with the best shower we encountered in two weeks travelling around Ireland.  I'm tall but, the shower head was taller.  Other tall people out there will know that that is not always the case.  

The hotel's breakfast restaurant is a pub in the evening.  I amused myself by counting 33 draught taps along the bar.  The nice breakfast waiter told me he works there in the evening as well and explained how the system works.  We dropped in one evening around 9:00 and the place was busy.  Breakfast buffet was a completely normal affair with a selection of fruits, yoghurt, cereals, juice, pastries, toast and all the rest.  A variety of cooked breakfast options was available in addition to the buffet.  Perfectly good with very good coffee.

One thing we liked in particular was Drury Court's location.  It's exactly where you likely want to be in Dublin:  surrounded by dozens of pubs and restaurants, multiple shopping and browsing options minutes away in every direction, Trinity College about ten minutes away, The Hairy Lemon, a lovely old pub right across the street.  Temple Bar is about ten minutes away also but you won't want to go there unless you're looking for rowdy crowds or perhaps a tattoo.

One thing we didn't like about DC was their pillows but, to be fair, they were no worse than any others we found in our two weeks in Ireland.  Ireland may be the land of the shamrock and Guinness and Irish stew but it's also the land of terrible pillows.

All in all, a good choice for your Dublin stay.",4,2015,09,23
227,Perfect Hotel Near City Center,"I stayed in Drury Court Hotel in Dublin for 3 nights in early September, 2015. It was within walking distance to many points of interest. I arrived at the hotel at noon and was allowed into my room without delay. The room was very clean and spacious. The staff was very polite and helpful. They told me that if I ever get lost and need directions back to the hotel, just ask for Hairy Lemons, a famous pub just around the corner. I had to use it one night after a music pub crawl, when I could not find my way back and took a taxi. I had lunch in Hairy Lemons, good Irish food, not too expensive. The breakfasts provided for the hotel guest were delicious, the cooked full Irish Breakfast or the continental breakfast from the buffet. I highly recommend Drury Court Hotel in Dublin.",5,2015,09,22
227,Perfect boutique hotel.  ,"We spent a few days in Dublin and stayed at the Drury Court Hotel.  It is now one of our favorites.  From the friendly greeting to the equally friendly goodbye, the staff couldn't have been. Ore welcoming.  The location is perfect and the breakfast great.  The bed was one of the best I've tried.  I couldn't think of a thing that I would change!",5,2015,09,21

227,Dublin Walking Gem,"This hotel is near a lot of activities within walking distance of the hotel.  The staff was very courteous and helpful.  We arrived at about 6am after a long trip from JFK airport in New York.  We had two rooms and check in wasn't until 3pm.  They got us one room to place our luggage in and rest until their restaurant opened for breakfast.  They also were very helpful in helping plan our activities for the day.  Since we had just one day to spend in Dublin, it made the tours around the city very efficient.  Thank you to the staff for making our stay in Dublin extremely enjoyable.",4,2015,09,20
227,Restful Stay,"There were 6 people in our group. It was our first time in Dublin, in Ireland in fact.  Although we enjoyed the city hustle and bustle we worried that the noise would make it difficult to sleep.  No need to worry. The rooms were quiet and comfortable and we all slept very well.  The reception staff was very cheerful and helpful.  It was a lovely stay overall.  ",4,2015,09,20
227,"Great location, quiet and clean ... my kind of place","I stayed at the Drury Court for one night on September 2, 2015. I stay here on the first night of my two week vacation in Ireland. I arrived from the United States around 7:00 a.m. By the time I got my suitcase, cleared customs and got to the hotel via taxi it was around 9:00 a.m. Like most Americans I was worn out from the long flight and the difference in time so I was hoping that the hotel would allow me to check in early – they did! 

The woman at the front desk was friendly, professional and quick. I was in my room within 15 minutes of arriving at the hotel. My room was clean and quiet which are the two main things I look for in a hotel room. The Wi-Fi was free and the signal strength was decent. 

Once I got into my room I wanted to get something to eat. The hotel has a buffet style breakfast which I took advantage. I am not a big breakfast eater so cereal with some fruit and bread was all I wanted. I did have some trouble figuring out how to use the toaster. One of the staff members saw me struggling with the device so he quickly came over and gave me a quick lesson without making me feel like a stupid American. While I was eating I saw three other people have the same problem I had so that made me feel a little better.

After I finished eating I took about a 30 minute walk. The hotel is just a few blocks from the Temple Bar area, St. Stephen’s Green Park and Trinity College. There are plenty of restaurants and Starbucks in the area. Guinness is about 1.5 miles away. There is a Tesco within about a 10 minute walk. The hotel is located on a city street but traffic noise was not an issue. 

I called the front desk to request an iron and ironing board. They told me that it would be arrive in a few minutes but after 25 minutes I had to call back. After my second call the equipment arrived in less than five minutes. 

There was a safe in the room that was large enough for my laptop and iPad. There were plenty of outlets in the room for all the electronics. The water pressure was good and there was plenty of hot water. It did take a few minutes to figure out how to turn on the shower. The facet was very unique. 

The taxi ride from the Dublin airport was €35 Euros. 

Overall … I had a good experience and I would stay here again. The fact that they let me check in early is almost worth five stars.",5,2015,09,19

227,"Very helpful staff, good location, cardboard pillows","The staff members at Drury Court are wonderful. A desk clerk went far out of her way to help me twice in just two days. She was always a delight to talk with -- makes me smile still to think of her. And the morning manager at the attached restaurant also went out of his way to accommodate me too.
The location is in the center of everything. Very convenient. Can be noisy at night because of everything around, but it didn't bother us.
My only complaint is the pillows. They felt like thick cardboard. Perhaps I should have asked for something else. Wish I had!",4,2015,09,15
227,"Large spacious hotel rooms, courteous staff","The Drury Court was a very nice hotel with a very spacious room.  The staff were all very courteous and professional. Our flight arrived at 6:30 am so we were at the hotel by 9:00 am.  We were able to leave our luggage securely with the front desk while we went for breakfast, and they had a room ready for us by 10:00 am for early check-in.  Very much appreciated as we had not slept on the flight over from Toronto.  The only downside to this hotel was that neither my husband nor I found the beds to be very comfortable - otherwise this would be a 4 star rating. ",3,2015,09,15
227,Late summer stay,"A lovely stay from 5 to 9/9. We had a lovely clean room on the 5th floor, 507. There was only a view of the properties opposite, however the room was quieter for not facing a major road. The hotel is ideally situated for the majority of Dublin's attractions and close to the tourist hop on hop off bus for those attractions further away. The reception staff were friendly and helpful even though we were not able to check in much earlier than stated and they did direct us to nearby eateries for a late breakfast, the Metro cafe just around the corner. Excellent food and friendly staff, especially Rosie from New Zealand, who always made us feel welcome. All in all a lovely stay in a fabulous city!!",4,2015,09,13

Nearest Hop-on.hop-off-bus Station is ca. 500 away. The staff is very friendly and the rooms are good. Breakfast is served in the bar area as buffet and they offer many cooked dishes as well and well-tasting smoked salmon.,4,2015,09,13

227,Excellent hotel with Irish hospitality,"I have been coming here since 2007 and have always enjoyed this property across from the big stadium and canals. Very friendly and helpful staff, the rooms are comfortable with percolator, iron/ironing board and even a pant press. The Hop on and Hop off bus stops nearby and the breakfast in the main restaurant is awesome! The beds are so comfortable and I always have to set an alarm after flying in if I want to get up and do something because once you snuggle in, it's so hard to get out of bed! My colleague walked all the way to Trinity College from here to see the Book of Kells and it took him all of 20 minutes. There are grocery stores nearby(Spear) and the Bank of Ireland is within waking distance as well.",5,2015,09,12
227,Perfect for business in a great part of the city,"Staff are very helpful and greeted with a warm welcoming smile.

227,Friendliest hotel ever!,"I've just returned from a 2 night stay here and have to say that it was excellent. The staff on reception were the friendliest I've ever encountered anywhere, ever!!  Check in wasn't until 3pm Friday but when we arrived just before 10am they apologised for our room not being ready! They were happy for us to leave our cases there & answered our endless questions about where to eat and drink which humour and enthusiasm. 
Our rooms were spacious and spotlessly clean. The only criticism would be the grubby grouting in the bathroom but the fabulous water pressure and a shower to knock your socks up more than made up for that. The bed was really comfortable & there were ample sockets for the three of us to charge phones etc. 
The position of the hotel makes it unbelievably easy to get around this beautiful and vibrant city. I will definitely be returning! ",5,2015,09,07
227,"Great location, great welcome, some quirks","Reception staff couldn't have been nicer, and the hotel is close to so many of the things tourists want to see and do. Lots of pubs and cafes nearby, and they'll help with recommendations. Room was basically fine, clean and reasonable size. Mattress was very firm, bordering on hard. Duvet was too warm, but I forgot to ask for a top sheet to use instead. Hotel is on a somewhat noisy street and the adjacent pub has loud bass thumping music, at least on Saturday night, which fortunately doesn't permeate too much with the windows closed. If you need the windows open for cool air, though, don't expect to sleep until after midnight. In terms of selection, there's nothing special about the continental breakfast, but the croissants are fabulous -- and I've had lots of croissants in France. Maybe it's the Irish butter! There's a hot Irish breakfast option as well, but I can't speak to that.",3,2015,09,07
227,Brief stay but perfect,We stayed here for 1 night in August on a busy Saturday when the bars and streets were heaving with people but the triple glazing in our street facing room blocked out ALL noise.   We walked to the Guinness storehouse in 25 mins from here and it seemed to be pretty central. Wish we'd had longer there... Had breakfast next morning which included full Irish AND continental. ,4,2015,09,07

The room is a good size and the bathroom is also quite large.    The bed was very comfortable.
There are pubs and clubs nearly.   A good thing if you want to to go to them.    You can open/ close windows also a good thing.   
It can be loud at night but windows are double glazed and keep out the noise when closed.     Fresh air a bit harder.   There doesn't appear to be cooling in the building.   Not sure how it works in hot weather.    Ireland must have hot weather sometime.    14 degrees here at the minute during the day.",4,2015,09,03
227,Central and convenient in Dublin,"We spent 5 nights here with our son, his wife and our three young granddaughters. The apartment was clean, serviced daily and more than adequate for our needs.The office staff were delightful and very helpful and attended to any request promptly. On our first night we had tickets for 'Riverdance' at the famous Gaiety Theatre which was less than 5 minutes walk away. There are numerous places to eat just a stone's throw away and our favourite was  the 'Hairy Lemon' which has an excellent children's menu.",4,2015,09,01

227,Hmmmm,"A last minute booking for work in an obviously teaming Dublin city. It was only a ten minute walk to the office and the sun was shining so that was a saving grace.

The Drury Court is located right in the heart of the action so to speak, the pubs were full and at full throttle until late at night, overflowing on to the road below the hotel windows, no aircon in the rooms meant you could choose between open window and noise or closed and airless muggy rooms.

The decor was dated and shabby, just not the chic variety, in the bar this was fine and added to the charm, in the communal areas and the rooms it just felt in need of modernisation, maybe a good bet for a hen or stag weekend but if you are here for culture or relaxation I suggest finding somewhere 15 minutes further walk away.

The central location also affected the price, paying more per night than central london and then no breakfast included seemed steep.

At a price of 9.50 for continental, 13.50 for cooked or 17.50 for both (euro's) the breakfast was actually pretty good and I enjoyed the quirk factor of throwing table cloths over bar tables and laying it out for breakfast amongst the pumps and the optics, able to pick out a few beers I would try later.

I would visit the bar again, but probably endeavor to find a different hotel.",3,2015,08,29
227,"A miss-rated apartment hotel in Dublin, Ireland","We could not understand where the 8.9/10 (as for 2015) TripAdvisor rating came from! The major issues with Drury Court Hotel in Dublin, Ireland are the following: 1. It is very old with torn down furniture, the surfaces of the two couches in the living room are absolutely worn with black residues coming  out of the surface and sticking to clothes (photo 1 and 2); the side board of the bath tub fell off (we place it back and did not take picture); the stove tops are basically 4 very ancient type of metal blocks,  with grease stains that have been there probably  for a long time and cannot be cleaned easily (photo 3); and the so called kitchen is literally  4x9 feet at best, with no kitchen towels, clean sponges, and cups with coffee or tea stain. 2. The apartment is dirty: The two rugs are covered by dirt and hairs- blond,  brown,  black, white, long and short; hairs are also on the dirty hard wood floor and in the bath tub- even after vacuum there are still hairs on the mopping towel; the windows in my bedroom were so covered with a thick layer of dust at the opening; and a white wet towel became black and red after wiping the surface of the couches-  perhaps from cumulative dusts or dried up juices.",1,2015,08,25

Was out on the town for the night and no hassles come back late at night/early in the morning.

With regards the street noise comments I've seen other people make: What are you expecting? It's a city centre hotel in one of the busiest and liveliest parts of Dublin. Bring earplugs... I personally slept with the window opened during the night and the didn't mind the noise in the slightest.

Everything was clean and comfortable and was plenty big for a family.  The breakfast was okay, nothing special, but certainly not bad, and the staff were always super kind and always willing to help.  Overall, I would recommend the Drury Court hotel.",4,2015,07,30

They guided us through the city, helped us arrange our tours, and even secured wash cloths for our room. Apparently this is not something usually found in all hotels. 

The hotel was centrally located to restaurants in easy walking distance. I would say that it was a good value.",5,2015,07,29
227,Recommended ,"We strongly recommend this hotel. It is v central with loads of bars and restaurants within easy walking distance, a few minutes from Grafton Street and only 15 mins or so from the castle and cathedrals. The only downside to this is that it is in quite a busy, noisy area. However, the hotel have installed triple glazing (and v thick/thermal curtains) so you can block out most of the noise. Our room was very comfortable with everything we needed. The hotel staff were really friendly and helpful - couldn't ask for more! Didn't have breakfast so can't comment on food. ",5,2015,07,28
227,Location & Excellent service,"Services; at front desk was welcoming and fast, when checking in and out. There was always pleasant and warm welcoming feeling when passing lobby. We got advices and guidance from personnel; every time we passed by they asked how they can assist us when leaving out and how our day was when returning. 

Room; was bit bigger than expected, double bed and one single bed plenty of space in room. Our room was at fourth floor window was facing towards back side. In bathroom there is a bathtub and large skink table.  Maintenance and cleaning is done well, nothing that I could hope for more. Sound isolation was great; no noise was heard from surrounding rooms or outside.

Breakfast; we had breakfast only at one morning. There was plenty of free tables available. Continental breakfast is buffet style, there is also Irish breakfast available. Service was excellent, pleasant and working. Breakfast was not included in room price. 

Location; hotel is located center of shopping district. Temple Bar area at walking distance (5 to 10 min). Also other areas and sites can be reached walking (example; Dublin Castle, Trinity College, Liffey River, Guinness Storehouse). There is plenty of small shops, cafes, pubs and restaurants close to hotel. It’s simple to get here from airport by bus.

There is an excellent bar attached to the hotel too. The rooms are spacious enough for Dublin even if they are a tad expensive.
Probably has some of the nicest staff of any hotel that I've stayed in.

The reason it gets an average rating though is not necessarily because of the noise (because it is a noisy hotel) but because it is suffocatingly hot, like super hot. Obviously you can't have the window open on a night though because of the noise. Also, on the third floor there is a very noisy door to the entrance to the main hallway which keeps you awake all night as people come and go.

Probably wont stay there again.,",3,2015,07,23
227,Disappointing,"Pleasant staff but apart from this the hotel is noisy - not least from the very loud bar just next to reception, the noise from which permeates the whole of the first floor above.  I would certainly refuse any room above this bar.  To compound this Room 109 suffers from a fan or similar somewhere nearby which drones on all night and makes sleep difficult.  A room to avoid at all costs.  This is certainly not a business hotel - I did not like being asked if I would like to pay in advance on arrival for a 2 night stay.  Nice breakfast however, but I would not like to take my chances of finding somewhere to sit if it was busy as not many tables relative to the number of rooms in the hotel.",3,2015,07,22
227,Noisy Hotel,"Stayed in this hotel 20-7-15.

They suggested breakfast next door at the hotel pub (restaurant by day) and kept my luggage for me. I was checked in couple hours after that. The rooms was clean, comfortable and quiet. I slept for awhile and then wandered the area in the late afternoon. It is very conveniently located with restaurants, shops and pubs. The staff are amazing.

The location is so convenient - you are within a 5 minute's walk to: Grafton Street, Stephen's Green, Gaiety Theatre, Dublin Castle, St. Patrick's Cathedral, Trinity College among other highlights as well as countless fantastic restaurants, bars and pubs. The adjoining bar/restaurant, P.Mac's, is very unique in the best way and serves a gorgeous breakfast, in addition to fabulous lunch & dinner.

Great breakfast and well priced for the location.  The staff was outstanding.  Very friendly and helpful.  We really enjoyed our four night stay.",5,2015,06,29
227,3 bedded Apt,"I have just returned from a weekend away staying in the 3 bedded apt at Drury Court. The apartment was amazing! ideally positioned for the centre of Dublin. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly and reception is manned 24hrs. (They even reply to emails in the evening). 
The apartment was clean, beautifully decorated and furnished. It contained plenty of clean towels, toiletries and tea and coffee. It was everything you could ask for. Quiet too. Definitely stay here again. ",5,2015,06,29
227,Excellent hotel/ apartment in the heart of the city!! A**,Great Hotel in very short distance from Grafton st and St. Stephens green plus temple bar. Stayed in apartment that had 3 good size bedrooms. All very clean and comfortable. Excellent apartment and quiet. Brilliant breakfast. Staff was very helpful and friendly.,4,2015,06,29
227,Comfortable and good location in Dublin,I stayed at the Drury Court Hotel in March 2015. It's a great location in Dublin and it's very comfortable.  The rooms are a really good size as are the bathrooms. It's not luxury and it is not a hostel. Good budget.,3,2015,06,24
227,Exceptional front desk service,"Sophie at the front desk was amazing. We were staying for two non-consecutive days, with a two day break in between.  She made it easy to store our luggage and welcomed us back like we'd been staying there for weeks.  She was so helpful with getting us around Dublin and beyond, giving us directions, booking train tickets, printing out helpful information and more.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,06,23
227,Great find in the centre of the action,"This is a pleasant hotel that is clean and fresh, dressed in a classical style. I had a well-sized double room at the corner at the front of the property. Staff are friendly and the restaurant is a bohemian looking pub!",5,2015,06,23
227,City break,"A little gem of a hotel close to Grafton St and city centre attractions. We had a pleasant check-in, and room was adequate for our needs. Bathroom was well equipped and shower worked well with plenty hot water. We stayed on a Sunday night and though the city was busy, we were not disturbed by any outside noise and so enjoyed a comfortable nights sleep. We chose a twin room as bed in double room seemed small but can't be certain of that. I prefer a King size or else I choose twin beds. The lift worked efficiently. We had full Irish breakfast for €10 pp and was good quality. Continental breakfast was also available for less. Though the hotel has only a tiny carpark of its own, there are two multi-storey car parks in the local vicinity and they offer discounted prices. Worth noting also was that bar remained open til 12 midnight on Sunday which is later than usual bars. I will definitely book this hotel again as it was great value for money. 
      ",5,2015,06,22
227,Very nice location,"Stayed on business for 2 nights. Room was clean and comfortable but common areas like the reception could do with a lick of paint. They have updated the decor but daily life has left some marks and that just made the place look bit run down.

Breakfast was bit of a disappointment as was not in a mood for fry up. It did look good what other guest had but I could have done with bit more continental choice.",4,2015,06,22
227,Great Value for stay in Dublin,"I had a short visit to Dublin to visit the National Archives and National Library and the Drury Court Hotel was a great choice, conveniently located to visit both sites. The single room I had was excellent, reasonably priced, well maintained, perfect for my visit. Staff was very courteous, helpful in recommending an excellent restaurant, and efficient is getting me a taxi very early in the morning. Would definitely come again next time to Dublin.",4,2015,06,21
227,Brilliant Location - Dublin,"My wife and I stayed 2 weeks in this wonderful hotel.  Our stay was at the beginning of 'peak' season in Ireland, therefore, many tourists in the city.  The location is absolutely brilliant being only 300 yards from the best restaurants, pubs, shopping and attractions.

We were lucky to get a room located on the 5th (top) floor and was quieter - Nice!  We extended our stay at this hotel because of the comfort of the beds.  Luxurious; nicer than expected! Big bathrooms and nice amenities.  Elevators/lifts were an additional convenience after daily activities.

The hotel staff was friendly and eager to please. VERY pleased with the quality, affordability of the hotel and the efficient service we received.

Overall a great find and great stay...highly recommended!!",5,2015,06,21
227,A true gem in Dublin!,"My husband and I recently stayed at the Drury Court Hotel for 13 consecutive nights. Each of the reception staff were consistently professional and helpful, plus they are on hand 24 hrs. a day to assist if needed! We had the pleasure of meeting them all due to our extended stay. Location is prime in Dublin's City Centre with many restaurants, pubs, local sites to see and excellent shopping. Our room was lovely with very comfortable beds and nice amenities. Housekeeping staff was extremely prompt and efficient. The adjacent pub and restaurant, P. Mac's, offers delicious dining. We most definitely will stay again! Highly recommended!!",5,2015,06,21
227,location and good room,"We found this place at the last minute on a Saturday night - great find.   Price was great.  The rooms were clean, comfortable and quiet.  The location is prime !   There is a LOT to do all around the hotel.",4,2015,06,17

227,Good for single traveller,"Stayed one night in a single room... price was reasonable and room was perfect for my needs.. I stayed on a Sunday night and was directly above the bars below... if this was a Thursday-Saturday night I am quite sure my review would be different but hey, Sunday night was quiet.",4,2015,06,15
227,Great little hotel in city centre,"Lovely hotel with all amenities needed including good wifi. Fabulous location behind St. Stephen's Green and South William Street and Grafton etc. 
Warm and friendly staff typical of Dublin. Large elevator and good sized rooms and bathrooms.
Also easy to get taxis in front of hotel.
Located next to shops and restaurants galore.",4,2015,06,13
227,Great hotel for a quick visit!,"We stayed at the Drury Court for three days. Our flight arrived in Dublin at 5:00am and were at the hotel by 7:00am.  We figured our room wouldn't be ready, but were able to store our luggage and begin our adventure.  The lady at the front desk told us she would call as soon as our room was ready.  We returned to the hotel to take a rest at around 10:00am and were pleasantly surprised that our room was going to be ready in the next ten minutes.  The hotel staff took care of our room first because we were already there.  great service!  The hotel is in a perfect location for all tourist activities.  We did not take a single taxi!  There were no smaller rags for washing your face, so we called the front desk to request them. They did not have any, but by the time we came back to our room for the evening, they had gone out and purchased us some!  talk about great service!  The pub connected to our hotel was great, and they had a section reserved off for guests of the hotel.  I would definitely recommend staying at the Drury Court when in Dublin!",5,2015,06,12
227,Great Location Great Value,"Couldn't  imagine you'd get better value for money in Dublin. Charming rooms, well furnished, good breakfast plus you are right in the middle of the action. Hotel Mangement to be congratulated as all staff from cleaners to reception have a great attitude!",5,2015,06,12
227,Great location,"We stayed in the apartment building which is next door and part of the hotel.  Good security. Great location and very clean, bathroom was a bit small but manageable for 5 people.  Right in the heart of shopping area. Breakfast was amazing. Lots of pubs and restaurants close by.
      ",5,2015,06,11
227,Dublin Conference,"I was in Dublin for a conference which was being held in another hotel on the other side of town.  Booked for the conference late so all of the rooms at that hotel were fully booked.  I found the Drury Court using Google Maps, it was just over a mile from the conference but very well placed for enjoying Dublin.  The hotel is clean and tidy, the staff are very friendly and helpful, and the Full Irish breakfast was excellent  The only thing I would change is the bl***y shower curtain, but that might just be me.  :-)",4,2015,06,11
227,Loved It,"We started our Ireland trip with three days in Dublin (in another hotel) and ended it with another three days in Dublin.  Walking around on the first three days, we decided to book a place that was convenient and looked nice.  Dublin was heavily booked for the weekend we needed (bank holiday) but the Drury Court had a room.  I would return there over and over.  Very convenient to restaurants, night life and shopping (Grafton Street in a five minute walk).  But what bowled us over was the courtesy of the desk staff.  When they discovered that breakfast wasn't included in our booking at the rate we had booked for, they added it as a ""comp.""  If you've ever had a full Irish breakfast, this is no mean gesture.  The breakfasts were always delicious and filling.  The room was entirely adequate.  The location was fantastic for us, including being a 9-minute walk from the airport shuttle (7 euros instead of a 25-euro taxi).",4,2015,06,10
227,"Drury Court Hotel - Dublin, Ireland","Central location.  Safe, clean, quiet and very comfortable.  Nice bed and pillows, strong shower, nice flat screen TV.  Windows are triple-paned. Did not hear any noise from outside (very happy). Staff are sweet.

227,Very good location with excellent service,"Stayed at this hotel with my family of two young children. Hotel is well located near the Stephen Greens area and other locations near city center. Very convenient. Rooms were clean and functional.  Excellent staff and customer service. There was something wrong with a Wi Fi router, the manager and desk staff stayed on the service provider till it was fixed. Highly recommend this hotel",4,2015,06,09
227,Wonderful Location,"The Hotel by itself is nice cozy and Clean. Free Wifi and Parking, and the best art in the heart of Dublin...temple bar area a 10 minute walk...eateries, Pubs, shopping, night clubs restaurants all within a 10 minute walk, the front office staff very courteous and warm.

We were there during the referendum weekend , hence the whole city had come alive, the Party mongers were u till the wee hours and it was a fun weekend....would highly recommend this hotel for Location, convenience, cleanliness and warmth of the staff. Would definitely to visit again....",5,2015,06,03
227,Nice and service minded with good location,"Good location in Dublin and very helpful and service minded personnel, but the bed were from my size 195 cm to short. Continental breakfast were average. 
The minor streets of Dublin is hard to find your way around and finding the hotel were difficult first time. 
      
      ",3,2015,06,03
227,Good spot but not good value,"Well located to nearby St Stephens Green shopping centre, park and cafes and only a short walk to Temple Bar, Dublin Castle and Trinity College( Book of Kells) but super overpriced at $400 Australian dollars for nothing but a room! Dublin was booked out due to a UK bank holiday weekend and we had little choice but for this price I would have expected Breakfast at least! There's a raging nightclub below but luckily rooms have double glazed windows so it is not too noisy. Front desk staff are friendly but my swipe card to access rooms consistently did not work so a few glitches!",4,2015,06,02
227,Central Location. Good facilities & helpful staff.,"Centrally located for attractions, shopping & dining out. Rooms large and well equipped. Very comfortable.

      ",5,2015,06,02
227,Lovely central hotel,"Stayed in the Drury Court again recently. As usual the staff were most helpful, professional & friendly. The room was clean & comfortable with good supply of tea, coffee etc. Wifi worked ok. Good breakfast. Was able to park onsite which is a major advantage. Hotel is only a minutes walk away from the Stephen's Green shopping centre & the Gaiety Theatre. Grafton St. is about a five min. walk away. The Luas green line starts from Stephen's Green, from here it takes 15 to 20 mins. to get to the Dundrum Town Centre (shopping centre). Would definitely recommend this hotel for either the leisure or business traveller & will be staying here again.",4,2015,06,01
227,"""Wonderful Stay in Dublin!""","Great location in the heart of Dublin!  Easy walk to so many places. Helpful, attentive, friendly hotel staff.  Clean, quiet, comfortable room (ask for one away from the pub).  Definitely recommend!  Perfect spot for me and my husband!",5,2015,06,01
227,Business Stay,"Very friendly and helpful staff. Clean and tidy room. All facilities worked great for me...internet, tv, bathroom. Comfortable bed. Great bar attached to the hotel with a fine choice of real ales and well thought out and prepared food.
I had no problem sleeping but I could hear some low level noise from the bar as my room was on the second floor and directly above the bar. Those wanting an even quieter night should request a room on 3rd - 5th floor or not over the bar.
I travelled on business but would recommend the hotel to all ages and types of traveller. It's in a convenient location a bit away from the centre but easy to get to on foot.

227,"Drury Court Hotel, Dublin","Just got back from a wonderful 2 night stay at the Drury.  Excellent location.  Very friendly staff.  Stayed in a three bedroom apartment - 3 adults, 3 children and cannot fault it.  Plenty of room for all of us and so nice to find somewhere to accommodate us all in a central location.  Wish more hotels would do this.  Well done Drury Hotel!  Highly recommended.",5,2015,05,30
227,wonderful a great hotel right in the centre of Dublin,"Arrived at 8.45 Sunday, to a great smiling welcome , nothing was too much trouble . all staff we met were polite and very helpful .Even though the room was over looking the main road it was very quite , very clean and very comfortable , possibly the best bed we have slept in  a hotel .",5,2015,05,28
227,"Great Service, Central Location, Highly Recommend!","We were delighted with this apartment offered by the hotel. We were able to check in two hours before the regular check-in time. The hotel had honored our special request to have the sofa bed made into a bed so that we could sleep in different rooms, even though we were two people and the bedroom had a double bed. We found the apartment to be clean and comfortable and it was serviced daily. We slept like babies in the quiet rooms. WiFi was free of charge and worked well. We got a late check out for free and a flat-rate taxi was booked for us all the way to the airport. We highly recommend this hotel and plan to stay there in the future when we're next in Dublin. It's near lots of restaurants, cafes and pubs, so you're not short of good food to try.",5,2015,05,26
227,Excellent experience,"My wife, my son and I spent 3 days at the Drury Court upon our arrival to Dublin, and an additional 2 days before leaving Ireland.  We had booked a stay at another hotel and decided to return to the Drury instead.  The hotel is well situated, close to many attractions, excellent restaurants and pubs.  Although the surrounding streets are quite lively, the area is not as noisy as the core of Temple Bar where buskers are fighting for attention.  The staff at the Drury was super nice and helpful.  They went out of their way to assist us.  The room was very clean and the beds were comfortable.  Overall, an excellent experience, and we would choose the Drury Court Hotel again.",5,2015,05,24
227,Good stay,"Nice and central! Friendly and clean, not my first stay! Won't be my last!!
You should try a frequent/loyalty card - it may surprise you how well received 
such a incentive would be received! I would definitely make use of a loyalty card!",4,2015,05,23
227,Excellent location,"The Drury Court Hotel provided us with very convenient access to the city center, Trinity College, and places to eat.  This is not an extravagant hotel.  However, it provides everything any visitor could want.  It's neat and clean with plenty of space in the room.  Also, the staff was very helpful and courteous. If you're going to stay in Dublin, consider The Drury Court.",4,2015,05,22
227,Perfect,"This was a great hotel to stay at, it's in the middle of everything. If you are traveling to ireland, this is a good place to stay at. It's simple, close to EVERYTHING - you can walk around dublin and explore the town and yet not be too far from your room.",5,2015,05,20
227,Drury Court Hotel Stay,"We found Drury Court Hotel from the reviews on Trip Advisor, thank you to fellow travelers.  We were in Dublin only two days and wanted to be centrally located in somewhere comfortable. Drury Court was perfect for our needs. It is comfortable, well-appointed, the staff is friendly and knowledgeable and it is indeed centrally located.

We arrived early so they kept our bags for us, gave us directions and recommendations and off we went and came back hours later to our very comfortable room.  We would recommend it.",5,2015,05,20
227,Great accommodations in central locale,"This hotel is within walking distance of Dublin Castle, Chester Beatty Library, National Museum of Archaeology, great restaurants and stores and the Temple Bar area.  The staff is friendly, knowledgeable and eager to help.  The rooms are a good size and clean, but ask for a room away from the street as even the double pane windows can't keep out noise from nightclub nearby.",5,2015,05,20
227,Great for couples/friends looking for fun,"The hotel is in a great location.  Close to bars, restaurants , shops and local tourist attractions.  The bar is not owned by the hotel and is a very popular local spot. I could not get a meal here, the bar was packed and there was no separate restaurant - noise continued until 2am, although it was Friday night when I stayed . Breakfast was also served in the bar area and was mediocre.  The bedroom  was very clean and comfortable,  with controllable heating. This hotels staff are extremely friendly, knowledgeable and are genuinely interested in your stay. ",4,2015,05,17

227,"Good location, nice apartments","We booked a 2 bedroom apartment for a girls' weekend in Dublin at the Drury Court. The hotel is in a great location in the centre of Dublin, with the apartments in the building next door. We were on the top (5th floor), so there was no street noise.
The apartment was a good size for 3 of us (it sleeps 4). The bedrooms aren't huge and would have benefited from being able to change the bed configuration from a double to 2 single beds in each room for groups of friends, but we managed OK. The lounge was a good size, with comfortable sofas, a large TV, dining table and chairs and a little balcony. Not much of a view, but the balcony doors let a lot of natural light in.
There is a small kitchen, which was absolutely fine for a couple of nights. There is only one bathroom, so careful planning for mornings and nights out is a must.
The staff at the hotel are lovely and responded quickly when we had a minor problem. They were also very helpful with directions and tips on great places to eat.
I'd stay here again on a trip to Dublin.",4,2015,04,26
227,Excellent Location,"I stayed at this hotel for two nights while on a business trip.

The location is brilliant. It's close to Grafton Street and St Stephen's Green, and only 10 minutes' walk from Temple Bar.

The check-in was fast, and the receptionist helpful.

The room was a good enough size with two double beds. It was comfortable. There was tea and coffee making facilities in the room, with biscuits too. The bathroom wasn't the most modern, but it was fine.

The hotel is above a bar, and while I couldn't really hear any music, I could hear some of the chatter coming up from the street. My room was near the back of the hotel, but only on the first floor. It could have been noisier near the front. It certainly didn't keep me awake, although I wonder if it might be worse on a Friday or Saturday night.

The hotel was a decent price, and I wold consider staying here again.",3,2015,04,25
227,Brilliant ,"Was warmly welcomed to the hotel by the friendly reception staff and given directions.

227,A well-located and comfortable hotel,"Stayed here for one night on a visit to family in Dublin.  A very comfortable hotel with excellent reception staff - welcoming and helpful.  We had a large comfortable room with a well-equipped en suite.  We thought that it would be noisy (we were on the first floor over the bar) but the double glazing was effective at keeping most of the noise out.  We couldn't manage a cooked breakfast but the continental selection was good with nice fresh croissants. The hotel is well located for the city centre - close to the Grafton Street shops, with plenty of choice of restaurants and bars just a stroll away.  We got the airport bus to Trinity College - the hotel is an easy 5-10 minute walk from there.  We'd definitely stay there again.",4,2015,04,07
227,"Decent hotel, with a few exceptions","I stayed here as part of a large group for the St Patrick's Day celebrations - Monday 16th March - Wednesday 18th March and stayed for 2 nights. 

My first and only setback was the price we paid for this hotel (and I know it was only due to it being St Patrick's day, but still - £100pppn is a bit over the top, don't you think?!)

It isn't the Ritz, or anything fancy, but it does the job well.

I stayed in a twin room on the 2nd floor. The rooms were spacious and clean, the beds were comfortable and the bathroom was modern and updated, albeit the showers could be a little bit more powerful. 

Lighting in the rooms was slightly on the dim side, so when us girls were getting ready in the mornings and evenings it was a little difficult. Maybe there could be a light or lamp on the desks next to the wall mirrors perhaps? 

Our room was provided with teas, coffees and wine (free of charge!) a hair dryer, plenty of towels, and a decent television to pop on quickly whilst getting ready. 

The staff I find are the real deal breakers when it comes to hotels. Here at the Drury Court we could not fault them at all. From the moment we stepped foot in the hotel they were ever so friendly, and it wasn't put on at all. It was genuine friendly mannerisms which made us a a group feel comfortable and relaxed. If there were any issues there wasn't any problem with it sorted. We needed one of our room key cards changing and there wasn't any problems with that. The maids/cleaners for the rooms were friendly and always gave a smile and a hello as we walked by. 

There is also a good wifi connection too.

The restaurant joining the hotel next door was brilliant. To me, the rustic olde worlde vibe was perfect, and I loved the authenticity of it. We only ever drank here, and the bar staff were very accommodating to our large group moving tables and chairs around so we could sit altogether. You can have breakfast here for less than 9 euros each, whether it's a full Irish breakfast or a continental. We didn't eat here as we got up too late both mornings (breakfast finishes at 10am, I think) but if the food is anything as good as the service and drinks, then you're guaranteed a great breakfast.

Location wise, this hotel is fantastic. Couldn't have picked a better place to stay. It's at the centre of everything and walking distance to O'Connell Street and Trinity College is only 15 minutes tops. The streets in between the main attractions are beautiful, packed full of cafes, restaurants, little bars - all with their own identities. 

You can get the Airbus link too from the airport to O'Connell Street to then walk up towards the hotel too. It's 6 euros for a single, or 10 euros for a return. Comes along every 10-15 minutes and has room downstairs for your luggage.

If I was to visit Dublin again (and I hope I do) I'll most definitely be staying at the Drury Court again. 

Excellent location.
Excellent staff.
Excellent restaurant/bar.
Good facilities. 
Good value for money.",4,2015,04,07
227,Best Location,"Fabulous location - walk to everything. We stayed one night at Drury Court.  It was wet, so the fact that it was SO central made it a real winner. Our room was a little tired, but clean and quiet.  The parking was handy, although a little tricky to find (we had to park the car on the street and go in and ask how to get in to their car park). Reception staff were really friendly - they deserve a special mention. I'd agree with other reviews that it's probably 3.5 stars. Would stay here again given the location.",4,2015,04,07
227,Good hotel. Well located.,"A good hotel that is well located in Dublin. Clean, although not the most modern. A little outdated, but well taken care of. Good staff. 

The wifi was not great. Decently priced. 

More 3.5 star than 3 star to be honest, but not a 4 star.",3,2015,04,04
227,Nice hotel with a few minor problems,"We only stayed in this hotel one night. The location is nice and close to a variety of attractions, bars and restaurants. The noise from the downstairs pub didn't bother us at all. Our neighboring rooms were another story. When our neighboring visitors left early in the morning they woke us up; there was no sound barrier so it sounded like they were in our room. 

The room itself was a good size but it was quite old. The bed was decent but the toilets need to be updated. They were loud and broke once while we were there. 

The best part about the hotel was the service. Everyone at the front desk was friendly and helpful.",3,2015,04,03
227,Comfortable stay in a brilliant location,"This was a really pleasant surprise after having stayed in a good few other 3 star rated Dublin Hotels in recent times. Such a pleasure to be greeted by Irish staff at the front desk, who were pleasant and helpful. The room was a good size for a city-centre hotel, very clean, comfortable and amazingly quiet. I got an unbeatable mid-week rate for this superbly located hotel, which has such a great bar attached that you needn't venture too far in the evening if you don't wish to, but dozens of great eateries and pubs are minutes walk away. The only possible downside I could see would be the problem of parking (cost and location) if I'd happened to be in my car on this trip, but that would be the same for any centrally located Dublin city hotel. I'll be keeping Drury Court on the top of my list for future stays and would highly recommend it for great value for money.",4,2015,04,03
227,Fantastic location!!!!,"The hotel was in a great location, really central to all the splices we wanted to visit.  The room was very clean, we stayed on the top floor and it wash very quiet.  The staff were exceptionally helpful. I had emailed prior to our arrival re travelling from the airport To the hotel and received an  instant and comprehensive reply. The breakfast was excellent and vegetarians were well catered for. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,04,01
227,Highly recommended,This hotel is very centrally located with easy access to all the city has to offer. You would expect a lot of noise in a city centre hotel but that is not the case with the Drury Court. We slept soundly each night of our stay. The staff are very friendly & accommodating. We are looking forward to staying here again on our next trip to Dublin.,5,2015,03,30
227,Will stay again!,"Had a one night stay on business last Thursday. Very friendly & helpful staff at reception. Had a slight problem with heating in my room and was sorted promptly and was given complimentary breakfast the next morning to compensate me!
Left my phone charger in my room the next morning & Emma posted it to my home within a few days. 
Thanks Drury Court I definitely will be back when in Dublin 
Brian",5,2015,03,26
227,Very welcoming staff,"The location was great, very near to the temple bar area, restaurants and the nightclubs. The staff was very pleasant and competent, the room was clean but otherwise average, nothing in particular about it.",4,2015,03,26
227,welcoming & friendly hotel,"Stayed in apartments with a large group of girls on a hen weekend. Staff were so welcoming and friendly, offered us a complimentary drink in adjoining bar, brought milk and tea bags to room, and advised on areas to visit. Hotel is in amazing location near restaurants, bars, shops and attractions. Would definitely stay here again. Fab!",5,2015,03,24
227,"Good location, very pleasant staff","My first time in Dublin and the Drury hotel is nicely situated in the heart of the city only 10mins walking distance from the Grafton street aircoach drop off. On arrival the staff were very helpful and answered all my questions!
Breakfast was ok and the room was adequate for what I paid!
Bonus: After a day of interviews I was allowed to use the facilities to fetch aged etc.!!!",5,2015,03,23
227,BEST STAY!!,I was so so so impressed with everything about this place. The location is excellent. The staff are the most lovely friendly people you can get. I would not hestitate to stay here again. I'm actually back again in april and will be booking without hesitaiton.,5,2015,03,23
227,The warmest welcome I've ever had.,"What a great little hotel, right in the centre of Dublin. We had a lovely big room, very clean and comfortable. The best thing about this hotel though is the friendly and helpful reception staff. they made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived to the time we had to leave, I've stayed in many, many hotels but never known such genuine warmth, they are a credit to the hotel.",5,2015,03,22
227,Great place to stay,"location excellent, you are within walking distance of most of the attractions, there are numerous bars and restaurants within 5 min walk. the hotel is clean and the staff are very friendly. Our room was on the second floor overlooking the main street the windows are triple glazed so no problems sleeping, will definitely stay here again",5,2015,03,22
227,Lovely 3 bedroomed apartment,Stayed here for 2 nights but would be quite happy to stay longer the next time I visit. Staff very helpful. Don't expect a good view from the room but we were not in it that long so it didn't matter. Ideal for Grafton Street or Temple Bar. Great pubs and eateries very close to hotel but adequate facilities if you prefer to self cater.,5,2015,03,21
227,It's all about the location,"We booked this last minute for St. Patty's Day.  The hotel has a great location on the south side of the river.  You can walk to most of all of the tourist sites.  It's close enough to the Temple Bar area without being right in the middle.  The room was good and clean.  It has a water cooker, hair dryer (cleverly in one of the desk drawers), the shower had great water pressure.  The room isn't too fancy, but everything was fine.  We read earlier reviews about noise, so we took our ear plugs.  Once the windows are closed, it cut most of the noise even on St. Patty's Day.  Our room faced the street and I didn't think it was that loud.  The front desk staff were so nice.  They gave us great recommendations of places to eat and helped with checking on reservations.  I would stay at this hotel again just because of the front desk staff!

We stayed 4 nights and had the breakfast downstairs each day.  It was a good value for what you get.  We had the Full Irish which has meat meat meat, eggs, etc and that comes with the buffet table as well that has bread, meat, cheese, yogurt, cereal, juice and water.  The coffee was very good as well.  And again the staff in the restaurant were also very nice. 
 
We took a taxi from the airport which was about 33 euro's.  We used the Airlink bus to take us back to the airport for 6 euro's a person.  It's bus 747.  You can buy tickets at any tourist office and the pick-up location closest is on College Green right in front of the Starbucks.  It's about a 5 minute walk from the hotel.

The bar/restaurant right next door (and the place where the breakfast is served) PMac's was a fun bar to hang out in at night.  Seemed loaded with locals.

The Hairy Lemon just down the street is also a great place for some pub grub.  Simon was our waiter and was awesome.  

I thought it being St. Patty's day things might be crazy, but we had a great time and people were very friendly.",4,2015,03,21
227,No faults!,"I stayed here with my Mom and sister for one night. We were going to a concert in vicar street and wanted to stay somewhere central for shopping/restaurants etc! The location is great,  just at the bottom of St Stephens Green, walking distance to the main attractions.

The ladies in reception were lovely,  so friendly and welcoming!

The hotel reception is a little drab-could do with an upgrade but the room was lovely. The beds were very comfortable,  the room itself was spotless and loads of hot water there. Free wifi also.  The room itself was very spacious for a triple!

P Macs is literally right next door to the hotel,  lovely quaint pub.

I'd recommend to anyone,  will definitely be back ☺",4,2015,03,17
227,very good hotel in excellent location for us,"in Dublin for two nights last week. We stayed in Drurys and found it to be a great location, five minutes walk from all central locations that we wanted to visit. buses and transport stops nearby. Only drawback was the attached pub/restaurant would not be our choice and did not use it--but there are plenty of choices available in nearby streets and even just across the road",4,2015,03,17
227,Great value for money,"The hotel is right in the middle of Dublin and close to where everything happens. The room was clean, very quiet. Best of all is the friendliness of the staff. They were unbelievably helpful and obliging. Thank you very much!",5,2015,03,17
227,Business Trip,"Only stayed one night midweek for a business trip. Large room. I had a double bed and single bed. For the price all in all good value. Convenient location for shops i.e. Grafton Street, Theatres etc. Only issue was loud banging hotel room doors as guests leaving early morning exited their rooms (always a hotel problem so not specific to the Drury Court) Wish room info explained that food in the bar attached finishes at 8pm was looking forward to the salad in the room listing but they had just stopped serving food. Staff welcoming and happy to store suitcase past checkout time.",4,2015,03,05
227,Excellent stay at Drury Court Hotel,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Drury court on Friday Night. We welcomed with a really warm and friendly greeting by Emma on Reception. It was late when we checked in as we had travelled from Kilkenny and when we checked into our room, we were pleasantly surprised by the size of our bedroom. The bathroom was spotless and our bed was extremly comforfortable, just what i wanted after a long week of work. The following morning, we actually missed breakfast, but were yet again greeted by the llovely Emma and Sofia on Reception. They were so friendly, even after we were a few minute late checking out. i would highly recommend Drury Court Hotel and will definitely be back again myself! The Location was absolutely perfect as we were up in Dublin to visit friends and i couldnt believe how central we were.",5,2015,03,03
227,"Good position, but a little noisy","Stayed in this hotel for the Ireland v England Rugby weekend. The city was busy and the hotel full but everything was still as you would expect from a good hotel.

The position is great for the shopping and Temple Bar areas, however our room on the first floor was affected by late night noise from the bar below and from dustbin and delivery trucks in the road outside the window.

This being said overall I'd be happy to return.",4,2015,03,02
227,Highly recommended,"Hotel location is excellent (restaurants, pubs, shops are really nearby). Staff member were friendly and they helped us providing directions and assistance. Room was very comfortable, clean, tea and coffee machine in room very useful. Continental and Irish breakfast was of a very good standard.",5,2015,03,01
227,Very friendly,"A big welcome, comfortable room, modern bathroom and a tasty breakfast made this a great place to stay. The location is excellent for visiting the city centre and main attractions.
The girls on Reception were very friendly and welcoming. They were also extremely helpful, not only in giving directions, but also in sorting out the mess I made of my return flight!
Breakfast was served in the bar next door. There was an excellent choice of food from continental to full Irish, which set us up well for the day ahead.",5,2015,03,01
227,Highly recommended,"I had an excellent room, which was comfortable and clean.  The staff were very helpful and friendly.  The cooked breakfast was of a very high standard.  The hotel is also very well-located for the city centre.",5,2015,02,28
227,Drury Court Hotel very good stay,Hotel is located only a few minutes walk from St. Stephen's Green Shopping Centre and car parks nearby(Q park). Rooms very clean and comfortable. Air con fine. Bed very comfortable. Tea and coffeee facilities in room. Double windows very effective at blocking street noise. Light switch beside bed pushed in through socket but still worked. Did not have breakfast. Staff did not have an electrical extension lead available so bring your own if needed.,4,2015,02,25
227,Fantastic,the location of the hotel was fantastic and in walking distance of most central attractions.The staff here were friendly and really helpful as they also helped us sort out the bus for the next part of our trip. Would definitely stay here again. ,5,2015,02,24
227,Great time in Dublin!,"First time staying here and would definitely come back. Staff was welcoming (even let us in early after our red-eye flight from the US), rooms were clean and tidy, and the LOCATION WAS SUPER! We had many walks home from dinner to the hotel, shops were close, and everything was great. One thing to ask for is a room off of the front of building. (Connected bar was a little disruptive at night.)",5,2015,02,21
227,1st time on Dublin,"The hotel location is good not much of a walk to town, shops,night life,cafes and restaurants. The rooms are very clean, beds are comfortable,linen and towels are Fresh and crisp, staff are very helpful and welcoming. I would recommend staying at the hotel as you can see from my ratings. Unfortunately The pub attached to the hotel does not welcome hen or stag party's and are quite blunt about it! 
I'm not sure what the connection to the hotel is with regards to this pub but don't let that put you off staying here just don't bother with the pub if you are planning this kind of activity ",5,2015,02,19
227,Perfect location for city break with excellent staff and clean rooms.,A wonderful experience. The rooms were perfect with daily clean towels during our stay and hot drink facilities in rooms plus vending machines on the floors. The only downside was the bar attached were not very hen party friendly and asked us to leave. Valued accommodation though. ,5,2015,02,19
227,short break,lovely hotel friendly and helpful staff had a great stay great location breakfast was lovely would stay at the hotel again rooms a nice size clean and comfy over all no complaints reception staff very friendly on arrival,4,2015,02,18
227,"Perfect stay, great value hotel right in city centre","We got a really good deal for this hotel and did not have very high expectations. However it was perfect. It's two minutes walk from St Stephen's Green & Grafton St, there's a public car park across the road - cost less than €10 from 5pm until midday. Our room did not have a particularly good view but was really quiet, beds were so comfortable, really powerful shower and air conditioning worked well. Staff were so friendly on check in and check out- they were really helpful and recommended lovely restaurants and bars nearby. i would highly recommend this hotel and plan to stay again in near future. ",5,2015,02,16
227,Overall wonderful.,"We were very comfortable at the Drury Court Hotel. It's a superb location with many of the great sights of Dublin within easy walking distance or public transport. There are many wonderful restaurants and pubs close by as well as the shopping hub of Grafton Street. They serve a good full Irish in the morning at the pub on the ground floor. Our room was nicely furnished and the beds very comfortable. Our only complaint was that the heat was sporadic and we were occasionally chilly (but were forewarned that that could be the case when traveling in Ireland in February!) The staff overall were outstanding: friendly, helpful, accommodating and always cheerful. The price was also very reasonable. We would definitely recommend to friends and stay again in the future.",5,2015,02,15
227,Hotel and service both were good,"Need to improve in Wifi service.. Very slow internet connection. Rest of the services are perfect, nice welcoming staff, Hotel room was clean and tidy. Breakfast was good and served in time. 
There were some issues with entry card, but staff was very welcoming to help. All over good.",4,2015,02,15
227,Ideal for theatre visit or Grafton st shops,"Very central location, clean, helpful pleasant staff, good size double room and decent breakfast. Nearby multi-storey carpark convenient and good value overnight rate. Be sure to map your route as the area has many one way streets.",4,2015,02,13
227,Pleasant surprise!,"This was a great hotel to stay in while exploring Dublin.

Check in was very easy and super friendly receptionist staff.  

Room was clean and comfortable and bed was very comfy.

Staff were very helpful with booking a restaurant for us - nothing is too much trouble for them.  And the best part about this hotel - it is an excellent price!",4,2015,02,12
227,Will be bookmaking this as my new Dublin trip hotel,"I stayed in The Drury Court Hotel last week, and I was pleasantly surprised.
I would normally book a particular 4 star level hotel in the same area, so when booking this 3 star I wasn't expecting what I got.
Not only is the hotel in a brilliant location, but the price was fantastic.
Our double room was of a good size, lovely decor and a very comfy bed.
The staff were very friendly and were lovely to deal with.
We stayed on the 2nd floor facing the street but there was no problem with noise.
I visit Dublin a good few times over the year, and this hotel will now replace my regular 4 star choice (which is normally 3 times the price) and I will be recommending it to everyone.",5,2015,02,10
227,Very central and terrific price.,"Booked in here on a Monday for a gig in the Academy. The room including B&B and parking was €65 for me and my wife which when we were leaving was such great value. First of all to get to it from the motorway, take route for City, look out for signs for Long Mile Road, it will be on your left hand side, go onto Long Mile Road, pass by Crumlin Children's Hospital until you get to canal, go over bridge and then you will prepare to swing right at church, carry on straight till you get to top of Camden St. Turn left and keep straight till you get to top of Georges St. Take right at Diggs Lane and go past Brookes hotel swing left back onto Georges St and then take left at  traffic lights into Drury Hotel. Sounds complicated but that's because of all the one way streets. Chelsea the receptionist was terrific and the rooms were fine. Total sound proof very important. Again bathroom had a bath and shower head...my pet hate. Great sleep quality and the breakfast in the bar part of the hotel was super cool. Regretted not going for pints there the previous night. Will definitely stay there again as it is as central as you can get at a great price.",4,2015,02,06
227,Great value and a very comfortable hotel in the heart of Dublin City.,I stayed in this hotel on the 26th Jan for business in the city.  I requested a quiet room and didn't hear a sound all night.  The location of the hotel is superb and the staff were very helpful and pleasant.,4,2015,02,05
227,"Amazing location, comfortable beds & great value","I loved this hotel.  It is in the perfect location to explore Dublin.  I wasn't sure what to expect when the price was so reasonable for that location but chose it based on other TA reviews and I was not disappointed!  The beds were amazing, could have stayed in there all day!  The staff were so friendly and helpful and the rooms were spotless.  Sure there are more luxurious places but for the price, the location, and the experience, I will be staying here again and recommending to others.",5,2015,02,04
227,Excellent value,Staff are so friendly. It was my boyfriends birthday and they left a complimentary bottle if wine in our room. I would Definitely stay here again.  Location is brilliant so close to grafton street. The staff are great. Very helpful if you need suggestions for where to go etc,5,2015,02,04
227,Lovely Friendy Very Central Hotel,"My husband and I stayed last night in this lovely hotel which has private parking.We got a superduper rate being a Monday night with brekkie and free parking.The very efficient and lovely Chelsea at reception made us feel right at home.The breakfast is soo nice and is served in the uber cool P.Macs bar part of the hotel by great waiting staff.Our bedroom was quiet, great windows shutting out noise with a comfy bed and bathroom with bath, shower and plenty of bathroom products etc etc There's Bewleys tea,coffee ,bickies provided in the room.Location is AMAZING,  2 mins from top of Grafton Street. We would definitely stay here again in a heartbeat and maybe bring our 2 lovely kiddies next time and stay in a suite or their apartments.",5,2015,02,03
227,One night City centre break with hubby,"Hubby and I decided on this hotel as it was in an Ideal location near Grafton st, there were two female staff members on checking in and we found them to be very friendly and helpful. There was parking (extra charge) close by. Would use again if up in the city centre.",4,2015,02,03
227,Great value with a friendly staff in a perfect location!!,"I recently stayed 4 nights at the Drury Court and couldn't have been more pleased with this hotel.  The front desk staff was so friendly and helpful with great recommendations for tours, restaurants and directions.  My room on the 5th floor was very clean, quiet, and comfortable.  The bathroom was equally clean and spacious with a great shower.  The best part of this hotel is it's location as it is within an easy walk to all of Dublin's city center sites and shopping.  Next time I am in Dublin it will be definitely be the Drury Court Hotel!",5,2015,02,02

227,Good value in city centre,"I stayed here on two occasions.  The hotel is very central,  close to lots of restaurants.    The staff were very pleasant and helpful and the rooms were comfortable.    I couldn't fault this hotel at all and it is very reasonably priced.  It may not have the services of larger hotels but I was very impressed with it and would stay again.",5,2015,01,29

227,Excellent,drury court is such a friendly hotel is recommend it to anyone who wants to be central to everything.we simply cannot fault it. When we return to Dublin we will Defo be staying here again!  The bar attached to the hotel's so cosy and perfect to chill out in with a few drinks with your loved one or friends.... Food gorge also!! Overall fabulous experience... My husband really enjoyed his 30tH Cannot wait to return.,4,2015,01,27
227,Weekend Break in Dublin,"Spent two nights in the Drury Court Hotel January 2015.  The location was perfect for Dublin City Centre, Grafton Street, Dame Street, Olympia Theatre etc, everything in walking distance, loads of bars, shops and restaurants.  The hotel was spotlessly clean and the room spacious (we had a 5th floor room).  Although there was a bit of noise at night when the windows were open, once closed the triple glazing shut out everything leading to a comfortable cosy night's sleep.  Unfortunately we didn't have the opportunity to eat at the hotel so I can't comment on that.  I will say though that the front desk staff were excellent, so friendly and so helpful.  I would definitely recommend this little (almost hidden) gem for a city break.",5,2015,01,26
227,Well done we had an excellent overnight stay!,"We really enjoyed the accommodation at Drury Court during our overnight stay.  The hotel foyer and our bedroom/bathroom were extremely clean and the Reception staff on our arrival were very welcoming and helpful, as were the dining room staff.  Breakfast was excellent - in particular my wife said that the cooked Irish breakfast was freshly cooked with lovely sausages and mushroom and couldn't have been bettered!

We would not add any negative comments whatsoever.  The hotel and staff were lovely and it was very convenient as a base to explore central Dublin.  Also the price was very competitive for us as a senior citizen couple.  We will definitely return for further visits.

Well done. 10/10

227,A surprise break in Dublin.,Just back from a few days at this hotel and what a pleasant experience it was. A very clean comfy hotel with very pleasant staff throughout. Breakfast was excellent with plenty choice for all. I would recommend this hotel and would visit it again no problem. All in all a brilliant stay !,5,2015,01,22
227,excellent,"Room was clean, fresh white sheets on bed. Lots of fluffy towels and toiletries in the bathroom. Shower nice and powerful. Staff very friendly and helpful and food was tasty! If you want clean, comfortable and friendly and very good value for money then stay here! Simples :)",5,2015,01,22
227,Excellent location,"We stayed for one night for a catch up with friends in Dublin. Could not have asked for a better location for such a reasonable price. Rooms were huge with extremely comfy beds. Staff were really friendly and helpful. 
If you are driving up phone ahead maybe the day before as they have a few parking spaces for free in a secure car park. I was lucky to get one and it saved on having to pay for parking. 
Excellent stay would higher recommend! ",5,2015,01,19
227,Good stay,The beds are amazing. I had no sleep Monday and Tuesday the second I hit the bed I was asleep. The room was so clean and I found the bathroom to be super cute. My night was the best stay I have in a hotel.,5,2015,01,16
227,Outstanding,Stayed for 4 nights for college business and it was fab. Rooms spacious and quiet. Mugs instead of cups on the coffee tray which was a big winner for me. Overall fab hotel and the friendliest staff I have met in a long time,5,2015,01,15
227,Dublin visit,"This was the 2nd time I stayed at the Drury Court Hotel. After traveling from the north I wanted to be close to the airport for an early morning flight.It is a perfect location to Grafton street 
 (2 blocks) with all its shops and pubs. It is within walking distance to Trinity College. The Drury is a modest and inexpensive hotel.It is clean and comfortable. The breakfast at the attached restaurant is 9 euro and well worth it.  The front desk is very helpful and pleasant. You can't be it for the price and location",4,2015,01,14
227,Brilliant location,"Just the perfect hotel to visit Dublin city. Well priced, spotless, helpful staff. I will definitely use this hotel again. I would recommend it. 
Parking and it can be a little noisy from the street, are the only down sides.",4,2015,01,12
227,Great place to stay in Dublin,"The location of Drury Court is excellent -- you can easily walk to Temple Bar, Chester Beatty Library, Book of Kells, Grafton Street, National Museum of Archeology,etc. yet it is a quiet location for sleeping.  The room was large and the bed was comfortable.  It's a bit far to lug your luggage if you are riding the aircoach from the airport --about  a 5-minute walk--but that's about the only drawback.",5,2015,01,11
227,Bit noisy in rooms but great location and friendly staff,"Good overall friendly staff good location. Can hear other guests in rooms though. Big rooms. TV was small and unwatchable as was very fuzzy reception. Large room, clean enough. Short walk to everything really",4,2015,01,11
227,"Fabulous location, terrific staff, comfy","Great 3 star in a very central location - beds were comfy, room is clean - only hotel of all the 3 and 4 star hotels we stayed in in Ireland that offered hair conditioner in the bathroom. The staff were super friendly and super helpful with bag storage, flight check-in to helping us get a doctor on a medical emergency. Small entrance, tiny lobby, but staff and comfort made up for it. Double windows to eliminate noise - we were there on New Years and able to cut the noise when required.",4,2015,01,11
227,Great location,Great little hotel in a great location. So close to aTemple Bar and easy walking distance most other attractions.  The staff are friendly and very helpful.   Rooms are very tidy and comfortable.   The only small negative I have is that it was quite noisy outside the hotel and although our room had double glass windows you could still hear noise.   I would certainly stay again next time in Dublin.   Great value for money. ,5,2015,01,11
227,"Very Noisy, Could be Cleaner","I don't know about the hotel rooms, but the apartment was like staying in a college apartment (sparsely furnished and not very nice), and the loud weekend partying from the street below added to the college town atmosphere. I think students on a budget would like this place. Not good for families or older people.On the positive side, it is in a great location (just very, very noisy).",3,2015,01,10
227,Very accommodating family friendly hotel,Fair play to all the staff in this wonderful hotel for making yet another very memorable stay. Keep up the good work folks. The food was fantastic as always and we can certainly recommend this hotel to anyone with young kids.  Mine are 10&13.  They loved  the room and insist on staying there anytime we are in Dublin.  ,5,2015,01,10
227,Location,"Great Location but trying to find this hotel is abit of a maze but once you have its location is brilliant. Breakfast however was a disaster in a dark pub with no light .. we couldn't eat it and felt really ripped off with the price that was charged on check out for breakfast even though on check in the receptionist had said that it was inclusive but on check out we were charged again very disappointing, I would recommend the hotel but not the breakfast and just clear all costs on check in.",4,2015,01,10
227,Spot on location!!,"We stayed here for NYE 2014. We booked a double and ended up in triple (double and single) so was spacious. Shower was powerful which helped us wake up after the crazy nights out. For around 100 euros a night it was worth the money (cheaper rates out of holiday times) Location was amazing, walking distance to most attractions. Temple bar 5 mins walk if you want some madness but it's just far enough not to have that toursity feel. Lots of bars and restaurants around and a wicked adjoining bar/restaurant next door called P.macs which have a huge selection of craft beers and play a good selection of tunes - they serve breakfast here too which was cooked well with fresh ingredients. Also lunch and dinner served at same place and everything we ate was amazing (chef from 5 star establishment we were told). Staff gave some good tips and super friendly. Would stay here again when we come back. Enjoy Dublin!",4,2015,01,08
227,Ooh I loved it!,"Last minute booking to bring in NYE! It was brilliant, right in the centre of Dublin with all the Irish attractions within easy walking distance..

The staff in typical Irish manner were so lovely and helpful.. We stayed for 3 nights then checked back in for our last night. The rooms were spacious and the beds were really comfy! The bathroom was large as well with a great shower! 

The best part for me was the breakfast bar - P Macs next door was awesome! All over this was a superb hotel, good value and luckily stumbling distance from the surrounding pubs..",5,2015,01,08
227,Good value,"Stayed here in early December 2014.  Good value at around €100 a night.  Very well located close to city centre and lots of restaurants, bars etc.  Room was fairly small but well appointed  Bathroom was fine.  Both were very clean.  Reception staff were very friendly and helpful.  Downstairs bar was popular and friendly and had lots of unusual beers.  Breakfast was good in the morning.  Only issues were that I had a room over the front street which was quite noisy with the bar (and somebody seemed to be banging on the front door a number of times - that's probably an inevitable downside of it being city centre located) and there didn't appear to be a way to turn down the heat in the room (ended up opening the window after the noise had died down).  But overall a good spot!",4,2015,01,07
227,"Great location, friendly helpful staff.","Stayed at DCH in January 2015. Centrally located to shop, sites, pubs and restaurants. The rooms were spacious, clean.  Staff were friendly and helpful.. We walked to all sites mentioned on hop on bus, easily over 2 days. Across the road was the hairy lemon hotel, great food and atmosphere. Staff at hotel recommended this and other restaurants.  They did not disappoint. Would return without hesitation.",5,2015,01,07
227,So Good!!,"Just back from the weekend in the Drury after getting a fantastic price for 2 couples, honestly after paying such a great price we didn't expect much but from booking with a helful girl Lizzy to checking out there wasn't 1 fault!
Rooms were spacious clean and very cozy so the initial reaction was well impressed,,no banging of doors all night,,no kids running up and down at 7am in the morning and slept until check out!! Also a call out to the chipper across the road,,the best chicken fillet burgers EVER!! Thanks you everybody for an enjoyable stay and look forward to returning...",3,2015,01,06
227,Outstanding!,"Was here on a short break with my partner visiting family and from start to finish everything was exceptional! The rooms look like they've recently been done up, clean, tastefully decorated and have all the basics you'd need. The hotel is smack bang in the city centre, so perfect for sightseeing and visiting the city as nearly everything is within walking distance. Our room had (what I was told was) triple glazing so nearly no noise from outside gets in. The breakfast was delicious and had everything you would want, served in a quirky little bar joining onto the hotel. The best part of it all though was the staff. They were all so lovely. Friendly, happy to help and generally chat to! I found myself standing in reception for half an hour one evening talking to Emma, who, along with Sophia and Hannah made the visit absolutely perfect. Thank you all so much once again and we will be back as soon as possible!",5,2015,01,06

227,"Great location, considerate staff.","Great location, very helpful staff. Apartment clean , well equipped and great for kids. Needs doors oiled and bulbs checked but these are small things. We will definitely stay there again. They were great at reception, very friendly and considerate with regards to our kids(8 & 5 yrs ) which is truly such a plus! We will definitely be back.",5,2015,01,05
227,Good location and excellent service,"We stayed at Drury Court Hotel over New Year, and had a very good stay. We were most satisfied with the staff and their effort to make our stay as pleasant as possible. 
Quiet room, clean and nice. And of course the very good location; walking distance to everything.",4,2015,01,05
227,4 day city break over the new year,"Lovely big room, great people, and all clean and tidy as you would expect.  Great pubs in the vicinity and The Hairy Lemon was the best food for the trip.  Just a bit noisy at night if you had your windows open.",4,2015,01,05
227,Ideally located,"I have stayed at this hotel 3 times on visits to Dublin. It is ideally located only few minutes walk from Grafton Street. The rooms are a good size, clean with all amenities you require. The staff are helpful and friendly. They have limited car park & if you get space here there is no charge. I would highly recommend this hotel ",4,2015,01,03
227,Ideal in every sense of the word!,"Stayed here just before Christmas overnight with my husband and three adult children. 3 bed apartment ideal, plenty towels etc, tea bags and coffee, they even had cooking oil salt and pepper if you needed! 
As everyone else says the location is superb, out the door and you are in the heart of it, pub next door lovely atmosphere and we ate in the Whitefriar grill a few minutes walk, great for meat lovers and nice staff. The staff at Drury Court were extremely pleasant, definetly will be back, for two nights next time hopefully, unreal value.",5,2014,12,30
227,"Location, location, location.",This was my second time to stay at the Drury Court hotel and again I was not disappointed. Lovely hotel with very friendly staff. The location is fantastic just a short walk to Grafton Street. Surrounded by lovely restaurants and bars. Will definitely stay again.  ,4,2014,12,29
227,Pleasantly surprised,"Booked a 1 night break with my wife and 3 teenagers for a shopping trip in dublin, 2 nights before Christmas. This hotel seemed to be very reasonably priced for such a location, so I wasn't expecting much, just a place to lay my head. I was really surprised by such a central location, surrounded by restaurants, coffee shops and bars and a great atmosphere. The girls on reception were one of the friendliest i have come across and i travel a lot worldwide. The bar attached to the hotel was hopping (pmacs) and the drink was reasonably priced. The rooms were large with nice decor and spotless. Overall, i was very surprised and will certainly be back again and will recommend to others.",5,2014,12,26
227,"Friendly staff, great location","Stayed one night before christmas with my ten year old son, we were going to the gaiety panto which was just 2 minutes around the corner. Great location for Stephen's Green shopping centre and Grafton Street. Staff on reception were very friendly and helpful, we were given a room on the fifth floor so that the noise from the bars wouldn't be a nuisance, which we appreciated. Would stay here again. ",4,2014,12,26
227,No hassle no problems.,"The Hotel had friendly welcoming staff. The Price was reasonable, The room very clean and comfortable. What more can I say. The place was as expected. Even though it was center city it was quiet and I slept great.",4,2014,12,23
227,"second time in drury, first love","this was the second time for me at Drury Court Hotel and like the first one all was perfect.
we were in 6 and the apartment was amazing, ad the courtesy of the staff (due a strike of the flight company our check in was in late but there was no problem at all)
i will surely return :)
thanks!

227,"Nice, friendly Hotel in a great location","We were welcomed by warm, friendly and knowledgeable staff and were delighted by the location we found ourselves in. The hotel is situated within a short walk of the vibrant Temple Bar and Grafton Street areas. The room was clean and pleasantly presented, although not outstanding. This hotel represents good value-for-money accommodation for a short city break. Perfect for couples. Breakfast doesn't come included but Metro/Tastes cafes are a stones throw away and both really nice. Brewleys on Grafton St. is excellent too! I doubt anyone who just wants to explore this wonderful city would be disappointed with the Drury Court!",4,2014,12,22
227,Very pleasant & central hotel,We agreed we would be happy to stay in the Drury Court Hotel again. The staff are extremely friendly & helpful and try to ensure that our stay was very pleasant. Parking facilities are very close by and are offered at a reduced rate to hotel guests. The location is excellent both for daytime & nighttime activities. ,4,2014,12,22
227,Very friendly,"Stayed here with young children. Excellent location (near Grafton Street), very friendly and courteous staff and a big (triple) room, to which an extra fold-out bed was added on request. It was clean and comfortable and the wi-fi worked even though the room was on the top floor. Will stay there again.",5,2014,12,21
227,"Perfect location, very friendly staff, spotless rooms and great value","Had a lovely stay in Drury Court. The girl on reception was very friendly , free car parking a big bonus. The room we had was nice and spacious and spotlessly clean. Would definitely recommend this hotel and will be staying again I'm the neat future . ",5,2014,12,21
227,My Happy Place,"As most travelers, we arrived in Dublin on a red eye flight. It has been our experience that the hotels are sticklers for the 2 or 3pm checkin...not this hotel. We were warmly greeted and the professional lady at the front desk offered to store our bags for a half hour while we waited for our room. It was only 10:30am. A short time later we fell fast asleep in our cozy room. It was quiet and exactly what we'd hoped for. Close to the CityScape pick up location and pubs. We wanted to be near action but not the crazy scene of Temple Bar. Our room was clean and comfortable...we will most definitely return!",5,2014,12,21
227,another great visit,"Just back from a short break to Dublin. 
Drury Court  is in an excellent position to get the most out of the City and is very well managed.
We received a very warm welcome from the manager, Emma and Sophie at reception. They were extremely helpful with nothing being a bother to them. 
Rooms are of a good standard. Comfortable beds. Good bathrooms.
The bar attached to the hotel has undergone a make-over and is a lively place to have a pint or two (I counted up more than 20 draft beers at the bar!)- a great way to start or end a night in Dublin!
Good access from the airport with the aircoach stop only 5 mins walk away.",5,2014,12,18
227,Excellent location,"If you're looking for a reasonably priced, centrally located hotel then look no further.  I stumbled across this hotel when looking for somewhere within walking distance of the National Concert Hall, and Drury Court is close to so many of Dublin's top attractions and is right beside the main shopping district too.  

We stayed in room 401 which overlooks the street, but there was minimal noise from below.  The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable, and it was nicely decorated for a 3 star hotel.  The reception staff were very welcoming and helpful, and there is free parking if you request it when booking.  The pub adjoining the hotel was absolutely jammed on a Sunday night.  It has a very relaxed atmosphere and a great range of beers.  

The location is brilliant.  The streets surrounding it are quiet enough that you don't have to deal with drunk revellers outside your window all night.  I've only ever stayed in hotels around Temple Bar, which are usually not the best places for a good nights sleep.  There are many great bars and restaurants within walking distance, and the St Stephen's Green park is only a few streets away too if you fancy a wander.  We will definitely stay here again on our next weekend in Dublin.",4,2014,12,15
227,"Great location, horrible wi-fi","I stayed at the Drury Court Hotel for two weeks...  The room itself was a bit dated, but clean, warm, comfortable and (mostly) quiet.  The location is exceptional - very near the Luas station at St. Stephen's Green, Grafton Street shopping, Trinity College Dublin, the Gaiety Theater and numerous pubs and restaurants.  Staff were extremely friendly and helpful.  Didn't try the breakfast, but there are many places nearby where you can get a very good cooked breakfast for just about the same price as at the hotel.

The only reason I can't give this hotel five stars is that the wi-fi in my room was often extremely slow, to the point where it would take tens of seconds for pages to load.  This seemed to be particularly the case in the evenings, when I guessing many other guests are using the Internet...",4,2014,12,15

227,Best located Hotel in Dublin,"Drury Court Hotel is well located near Stephens Green and Grafton Street. Rooms are a good size , clean , quiet and comfortable. Staff of the hotel are top class; Very friendly , helpfull and well organised. There are good resteraunts, pubs and  cafes for all your needs.",5,2014,12,10
227,"Nice, Clean, Comfortable Hotel in Dublin Centre","We stayed in room 304, overlooking the street, for 2 nights. The room was clean, quiet, and comfortable, with a very large bathroom.  We had a double and a single bed in our room. An Irish Breakfast was included in the price of the room.  Breakfast was excellent!

This hotel is central in Dublin, 10 minutes walking to Trinity College, St Stephen's Green, Dublin Castle and Temple Bar area.  There are many restaurants and bars in the area.

We would definitely stay here again.",4,2014,12,09
227,Bellow average,"Good location .
Warm and friendly receptionists but not much more to recommend.
Room was clean but was very poor, w a basic decoration, without one single picture on d walls. 
Bathroom very old and cold.
Reception area was very poorly decorated.
Price expensive.",2,2014,12,08
227,Nice basic hotel,"It's a good choice to visit the center area of Dublin. I stayed here to visit the Chester Beatty Library, and needded just four minutes there. Nearby this hotel we have so many nice Pubs like ""Hearly Lemon"" and ""Long Hall"".",4,2014,12,06
227,Great location and very friendly staff!,"Very clean basic hotel with very friendly staff and great location.  Plenty of restaurants and shops nearby, and very safe street.  My college age boys were able to walk to nightclubs late at night (no need for taxis).  Would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,12,06
227,Lovely Staff and Super Central,I checked into the hotel about 3pm and the girls at reception couldnt have been nicer.  I chatted to them for a few mins and said how i needed to freshen up. I came down stairs about 30mins later ready for off and they commented on how nice i looked. I thought that was so nice. Room was perfect for just myself. It had a double and a single bed. When checking out the next day again everyone was super nice. For such a central location it was such good value and also the discount on the Car Park is Great. Its not often you can park up in dublin for 24 hrs for €12. I would most Definitely stay here again. The Pub Downstairs P-Macs is a really cool Funky Bar!,4,2014,12,05
227,"Great hotel, helpful staff","Stayed one night in room 106. We initially asked for an upper floor room at the rear of the building as per the reviews. We arrived early and this room was ready so we took it.  It was a lovely big cosy room with a big bathroom and for Dublin it was very quiet. The staff on reception were really friendly and helpful and the hotel is in a great location, central to most places. We really enjoyed our stay and thought it was great value for money. Would certainly recommend.",5,2014,12,03
227,Lovely little gem ,"We were very pleased with our stay.
Our bedroom 302 was a fine size and we couldn't have chosen a better one ourselves. 
It was lovely and warm upon arrival unlike previous places we've stayed.
The sound proofed windows were brilliant thus aided a great sleep. The receptionists were fantastic help. 
The pub attached to the hotel called P Macs have a great feel to it. 
Would highly recommend.

227,Very helpful staff,"Great Location near Grafton Street, pubs, Stephen's Green and easy to walk to all the sites that Dublin -  even in the rain.  The staff, especially Emma was incredibly helpful.  We arrived at the hotel at 8:30 am, Emma gave us suggestions for breakfast - before we were finished with breakfast, our room was ready.  She also helped our daughter surprise us - Thanks Emma!  The pub downstairs was great. The hotel was clean, beds comfortable and we would definetly go back.",4,2014,11,29
227,Great hotel in a great location,"I was in Dublin for 2 days for 2 meetings and chose the Drury Court and I'm very glad I did.  The staff on Reception were all very friendly and extremely helpful and I was lucky enough to get on of the few parking spaces on site.  There are more at a discounted rate in Stephen's Green which isn't far.  

The room was perfectly clean and comfortable.  The hotel is fantastically situated too - a stones through from Stephen's Green with lots of shops, restaurants & bars - great for a weekend visit to Dublin.  The bar in the hotel itself was absolutely hopping the night I stayed (Tuesday).  It has a really quirky interior so different from the hotel itself - with mismatched chairs and tables and board games and little snug areas.  A proper old fashioned Dublin pub and really nicely done.  

Breakfast was great, with a good selection of cereals, juices and mini danishs.  I will admit the service here wasn't up to the same standard as reception.  This was all redeemed when they asked me if I would like a cooked breakfast and it was cooked fresh to order which I love.  Can't stand hotel breakfasts that are sat in bain maries to keep warm for ages - so this is a massive plus for me.

If you are looking for a good value hotel bang slap in the centre of Dublin - you couldn't do better.",5,2014,11,29
227,Good location,Located a stones throw away from St. Stephens Green where you are spoilt for choice with  restaurants and good pubs. The hotel was was good and the staff were brilliant (they laughed at my jokes) no seriously the girls behind reception were really friendly and efficient. only one thing i will say is that i had had to park my car at St. Stephens Green shopping centre @ €12.50 per day which was not made clear when I booked on the experian  website.,4,2014,11,25
227,Brilliant find - Lovely Hotel - Really friendly staff,"Had a fantastic stay here at the weekend - Stayed in a family room; very spacious - Location couldn't have been better. Staff really friendly, we arrived very early and our room was ready so they let us go on up. Bar downstairs great craic. Beds were brilliant. Will definitely be back.",5,2014,11,24
227,Good value for price,"The hotel is situated in the hart of the city. Restaurants and nice bars are just next door. The room was big and the bed was great. The bathroom was a little ""old"" (shower curtains, no hair dryer). I would definitely come back to this hotel.",4,2014,11,22
227,"Charming staff, great location and  good facilities.","Lets start first with the price, its reasonable.  We have stayed there on a number of occasions and have always left feeling we well treated and had got good value.The location is excellent and while the facilities match the star rating the reception staff really do lift it to a higher level. This is our first review on Tripadvisor after lots of ""we must""s. Rock on.",5,2014,11,21
227,"A great location and friendly, helpful staff on reception.",I stayed last night in the Drury Court. It was so reasonable for a city centre location that I was a little worried!

The apartment is surrounded by wonderful restaurants and shopping. The apartment itself is beautifully furnished.",5,2014,11,17
227,"Great hotel, great location!","First trip to Dublin was certainly made better by this hotel.  Very friendly staff, the accommodations were good and the location was perfect.  Short walk (2-3 blocks) to Grafton street, great pubs all around the hotel and a 10 minute walk to Temple Bar.  We would definitely stay here again!",5,2014,11,17
227,Fantastic Find in the Center of Dublin,"I stayed at Drury Court Hotel for eight consecutive nights at the end of October 2014. To be honest, I was forced to choose this hotel, as many of my other choices were already booked and no rooms were available at those hotels. 

Drury Court Hotel features an American-style booking system on their website, where you are free to choose the type of room that you desire. Even though I was a single traveler, I chose a Double Room because I wanted more space and a larger bed. Although given the option, I did not choose to add breakfast in the mornings to my stay. After entering my credit card details to guarantee my reservation, I received a confirmation e-mail which included several methods on how to travel from Dublin Airport to the hotel. 

When I arrived in Dublin, I took the Airlink shuttle bus from the airport to the College Green bus stop (6 Euros, about 30 minutes). It was then only a 5 to 10 minute walk from this bus stop to Drury Court Hotel. 

Although I arrived around noon, I was allowed to check-in 3 hours early due to the fact that my room was ready. I really appreciated reception allowing this, as I hadn't slept much on the overnight flight from the United States. 

The next morning (and every morning after that one), I decided to have breakfast at the hotel. Breakfast was served in P.Macs, the pub that is attached to the hotel and accessible via a door in the lobby of the hotel. 

For breakfast, you are given several choices: 1) The Continental (5.95 Euros), which consists of sliced meat (ham) and cheese, fresh and dried fruit, yogurt with honey, pastries, cereals, juices, and coffee, 2) The Full Irish (8.95 Euros), which consists of mushrooms, tomatoes, eggs cooked to your choice, bacon, sausage links, blood and white pudding (sausage), and coffee, 3) The Full Vegetarian (8.95 Euros), which consists of hash browns, grilled tomato, field mushroom, baked beans, eggs, and coffee, or 4) Smoked salmon and eggs. Every morning, I chose the Full Irish breakfast, and since I didn't select the breakfast option when I made my reservation, all I had to do was tell the P.Macs employee my room number and sign the receipt that she gave me. What is really nice about breakfast is that if you select The Full Irish or Full Vegetarian breakfast, you are allowed to have items from the Continental breakfast for free. I cannot emphasize enough how delicious and filling breakfast was every morning, and there were many days where I didn't eat lunch until the late afternoon. 

In the bedroom, the double bed was firm but comfortable with four pillows and clean, crisp sheets. A small round table and chair, work desk with chair, tea kettle, satellite television with channels in english, and telephone were also located in the bedroom. The room did not have a security safe, but I was told at reception that one was available for use downstairs. My room did not feature air conditioning, but the two large interior glass windows slid open and the two small exterior glass windows swung open to allow plenty of fresh and cool air to vent into the room. 

The bathroom was tasetfully tiled throughout, with an ample supply of clean, fluffy towels. The water pressure in the shower was good with plenty of hot water. A soap dispenser and bottled shampoo/conditioner was in the shower, with another soap dispenser in the bathroom above the sink. The side of the tub seemed a little high, and I imagine it could be an issue for elderly travelers with limited mobility. However, there were no less than 3 handrails in the shower to help you get in and out. 

Housekeeping did a great job freshening the bedroom and bathroom each day, and both were very clean at check-in and during my stay. 

A computer was not available for guest use in the hotel, but for travelers like myself who don't bring a laptop on vacation, an internet cafe (about 2 Euros per hour) was located about a block from the hotel (with a much better internet cafe on Grafton Street and another on College Green). For those of you who own laptops, the hotel does have WiFi, and you are provided with the password at check-in. 

The front desk personnel were very friendly and provided helpful advice on transportation, directions, and restaurants. If you are an American, be sure to say hello to Chelsea, who is from Florida and is studying at Trinity College! 

Some TripAdvisor members who have stayed at Drury Court Hotel in the past have stated that some noise emanates from P.Macs downstairs at night. Staying in Room #101 (at the front of the hotel, facing the street, and nearly directly above P.Macs) for eight nights, yes I found this to be true also. However, whenever I closed both the exterior and interior glass windows at night, this eliminated 90% of the P.Macs noise, and my room remained at a comfortable temperature. 

For eight nights in a Double Room at Drury Court Hotel, I paid 1102 Euros. Since I also had the Full Irish breakfast for eight mornings, this added 71.60 Euros to the bill for a total of 1173.60 Euros for my entire stay. Unfortunately, the hotel does not accept US Dollars (I brought $100 bills), so I had to exchange my Dollars for Euros at nearby Ulster Bank. This was the only inconvenience that I experienced while staying at the hotel. 

Although Drury Court Hotel was not my first choice for lodging for a last-minute trip to Dublin, I'm glad it was the hotel that I was forced to choose! The excellent location of this hotel in Dublin, the proximity of the hotel to the local sights, the delicious and filling breakfasts, excellent staff, and quality of the rooms would cause me to choose this hotel once again for a future trip to Dublin.",5,2014,11,16
227,One night in dublin,"We stayed in drury court for one night and I must say it was a lovely hotel.room was perfect lovely big comfy bed,large room and bathroom,we stayed on 5th floor,and was very quite,we also had free parking which was great for a city centre hotel.staff where so nice,we will be back soon",5,2014,11,14

227,"Friendly staff, nice facilities, wifi was lacking.","I was in town for the Dublin Web Summit conference, and enjoyed my stay at the Drury Court Hotel. All of the staff were incredibly friendly and the room was spacious and clean.

My only complaint is that the wifi was very unreliable. It made work very difficult as I often needed to make video calls with my office back in the U.S.

That aside, I would totally stay at Drury Court Hotel again.",4,2014,11,14
227,"Lovely staff, great location, great price","On arrival we were greeted by a friendly receptionist Who made us feel so welcome.

We were pleasantly surprised how great the decor and facilities were in the room for such a reasonable price. 

Only stayed for one night and didn't spend much time in the room so we didn't mind the noise at the front of the hotel at night time from the pub below. 

It's in a nice area of Dublin so close to temple bar and Stevens green. 

Would definitely stay here again for the unbeatable price and fab location

227,Good Option,"The price may be better. The location is good, but not excellent (you have to climb a slope). The room is good, but the tub in the bathroom was not so good. It was difficult to stand in the tub to bathe. The staff is friendlly and helpful. The pub in the bar wasn't a problem.

227,easy excess to everwhere,"We stayed in a family room, queen bed and a single bed. the location of the hotel is very strategic. Easy excess to ""halal"" food perhaps just opposite the hotel. Walking distance to the city centre and shopping area. Walking distance to sightseeing as well. ",4,2014,11,09
227,Fantastic staff and location,"Drury Court is ideally located for visiting Dublin and being in the scene. The best part about the hotel though was the reception staff. This was my first visit to Ireland and they were all incredibly helpful, attentive and kind. People like Emma went out of their way to make me comfortable and acclimated. It was some of the best customer service I've experienced as a world traveler who lives in New York City. I'd happily stay here again.",5,2014,11,06
227,Great location,We stayed here in a 3 bed apartment for my husband 65th birthday. Great location close to everything. Comfortable and clean and warm. Staff were very helpful and pleasant. Would definitely recommend and will be returning in the future.,4,2014,11,05
227,Great Localtion & Great Welcome!,"It was a group of 16 of us staying in the Drury Court Hotel. The Location is Superb, for shopping & a night out. The staff are friendly and helpful and nothing is any trouble. With such a large group of us, from booking it to staying there, the staff were always there to help! Rooms are clean & tidy. Excellent price for such a great location and a great welcome.",5,2014,11,05
227,"A review of the Drury Court Hotel in Dublin, Ireland","The front desk staff members were all very friendly and helpful.  They helped make our (my wife and I) trip to Dublin a wonderful experience.  The hotel room was basic--but very nice and clean.  The breakfast included in our package deal was really outstanding!  We both agree that we would definitely like to get a chance to vacation in Dublin again, and that we would like to stay at the Drury Court Hotel again if and when we go.",5,2014,11,04
227,Great city centre hotel,"Hotel is very clean and tidy and a perfect location to wander around this great city. Although I checked in late the staff were very accommodating to my needs and were very helpful and efficient getting me checked in.
Hotel is above a pub, but hey, your in Dublin so that's fine by me. So take a trip down stairs and have a pint of Guinness.

This part of the city is very busy and a lot of hustle and bustle going on into the early morning. Once your in the hotel room itself you do not hear much from street level.

Room itself was very well appointed, spacious clean and tidy.

Hotel had wifi in the room which is always needed.",5,2014,11,04
227,Stay here and be near to all amenities.,"Enjoyed our stay in Drury Court Hotel. It was clean tidy and suited all our needs. 
Emma (I'm sure that I'd her name) the receptionist was extremely helpful and went out her to help us. All amenities were close to by to hotel. Excellent price. Would definitely return to Drury Court Hotel.",5,2014,11,03
227,City Break,"I stayed in Drury Court hotel for a city break and found the hotel very clean and in excellent condition. The interior was nicely done for a 3* Hotel. The only downside I would say is the music from the bar below the hotel can be loud on a Saturday night but the bar closes at 1am, so if you are looking for a quiet weekend this hotel wouldn't be the best place even with their triple glaze window you could still hear the music.

I will definitely go back as staff at reception was very friendly and it is in the centre of Dublin city.",4,2014,11,03
227,Great location,"Stayed here for 2 nights midweek. The location is unbeatable,we walked everywhere. Great selection of pubs and restaurants on the doorstep! Any staff we met were very friendly and pleasant.  It's quite basic but clean and has all the necessities. Will return again.",4,2014,11,01
227,Senior Shopping Ladies,"I stayed with two friends for a 2 night shopping trip . The reception staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Our rooms were lovely  the beds were very comfortable and there was tea/coffee facilities and free wifi .We  found the location excellent  2 minutes to Grafton St.and also within walking distance to very good restaurants.
However we would have liked a bigger reception area where we could have a drink as we were 3 senior ladies who did not wish to go to the pub next door. 
But having said that I would definitely stay there again",4,2014,10,29
227,"Great location, soiled mattress and linens.","Overall great location and very nice staff, although had an unpleasant surprise when I accidentally lifted the sheets off of the bed while turning down the covers.  The mattress protector and mattress were both soiled.  Unacceptable for a hotel to try to hide something this unsanitary with clean sheets. There is no way that cleaning staff could have missed this. Additionally, bathtub drained extremely slowly. 

Overall, the room we were staying in required some much needed renovating, in particular the bathroom. The hotel has great potential with it's location but the condition of the bed (being central to a hotel room) ruined our experience. 
",3,2014,10,29
227,Extremely impressed,"Stayed here for one night on a bank holiday and have to say I wasn't expecting much given the price and star rating but was more than impressed.  The location was excellent. Round the corner from Grafton Street and the Temple Bar area with lots of bars, cafes and restaurants right outside the door.  They don't actually have their own parking facilities but do however offer a discounted rate on a nearby multi storey which was located right beside the hotel.  The staff at reception were exceptionally friendly and welcoming and offered information on a nearby landmark we were planning on visiting as well as a map.  The room itself was really nice.  We ended up with a triple room having only booked a double so it was larger and the bathroom was equally nice.  It was very clean and I ended up having a great nights sleep.  the triple glazing also meant you were unable to hear any of the traffic outside.  The bin in the room wasn't emptied but I didn't feel the need to complain as it didn't affect my stay.  The WiFi was also very fast.  My only criticism would be the breakfast in the morning.  Having paid 9 euro each I was half expecting quite a large cooked breakfast.  Instead I was offered as much toast, cereal and juice as I wanted but was restricted to only a few rashers and egg.  It was disappointing as I have stayed in hotels before at this price with a buffet breakfast on offer.  But all in all I would definitely stay at this hotel again.",5,2014,10,29
227,Fabulous getaway to Dublin wonderful hotel and staff,"My husband and I had the privledge of staying at the Drury Court Hotel in Dublin.  The location could not have been better.  It was literally across the street to what became our favorite pub the Hairy Lemon, it was walking distance to mostly all the sites.  It is extremely close to the Trinity College and the Temple bar area.  They have a very unique bar attached that was very fun and energetic during the weekend.  The breakfast there was very good.  The room we had was very large and over looked the street.  House keeping kept everything spotless.  During the weekend it was a bit loud, but that is what happens when you stay at the best location for entertainment.  What was most appealing and what has me giving this hotel an excellent rating was the staff.  They were outstanding.  Any question was not a dumb question they always had an answer and if not, they found the answer.  They helped out with arranging day trips and gave advice for places to eat and things to see.  They even remembered it was our 25th anniversary trip and had a very nice bottle of wine waiting in the room.  Great value great place.  Highly reccommend it,  Also be sure to stop Hairy Lemon.  The beer is great, great food and staff and management are so wonderful there.  Were very willing to put on any sports game you like as long as they had the ability to help out.",5,2014,10,28
227,Good clean apt in central location.,"Stayed with family for the marathon,nice clean 1 bed  apartment which is close to the hotel and  central to everything  , helpful staff , I would  return  and stay here again. Local restaurants and pubs  make it a great choice.",4,2014,10,28
227,amazing week at Drury Court Hotel,"I stayed for one week at the Drudry court hotel with my Mther and 8 year old Daughter.  The staff was amazing.  They set up tours for us, provided babysitters, helped us book tours and were down right lovely.  The pub in the hotel was super fun.  The barenteders were top notch.  I would never sty anywhere else in Dublin.  Great location!",5,2014,10,27
227,comfortable hotel in excellent location,"Excellent hotel in the heart of the city and within easy walking distance of the shops and temple bar - what more could you ask for. The rooms were cosy and soundproofed so an excellent nights sleep was enjoyed. Staff at reception and bar were friendly, pleasant and efficient in every respect. We will return.",4,2014,10,27
227,Very good experience,"The hotel is extremely quiet despite being really central. We booked a triple room which was absolutely comfortable and very clean. The location is great and satisfies pretty much any needs: plenty of shops around, main touristical sites very close (just 5 minutes walk from St. Patrick's Cathedral and Castle) and ideal to enjoy Dublin's nightlife. The staff is also lovely, genuinely friendly and very helpful!",4,2014,10,26
227,Best hotel ever!,"I stayed here recently with my partner. The location is brilliant for all of the attractions, bars and restaurants. Our room was very clean and quiet although it was a very busy weekend and a lively atmosphere outside. Our special thanks to the fabulous staff who left a bottle of wine and a very friendly card for my partners birthday! Their friendliness and enthusiasm really added to our stay. Thanks again!",5,2014,10,26
227,"Great location, great staff","I stayed here in July for one night, we got a good deal directly with the hotel and were able to avail of their free car park at the back of the hotel which was very handy.  Hotel is in a great location near loads of bars and restaurant.  We only dealt with the two reception staff but they were lovely, very helpful and friendly. The room was average size but clean and quiet, which I wasn't expecting. Didn't get a chance to go to the hotel bar due to an early start but it was very busy and seemed to be buzzing. I will stay here again, great value for such a good location.",5,2014,10,25
227,Very Good Location.  Excellent front desk service,"My friend and I were in Dublin for three days and wanted a hotel close to Grafton, Nassau and Stephen's Green, which this was.  We had a large room with twin beds, flat screen TV, desk and fairly good size bathroom with an elevated narrow counter area.   We like the fresh air so left the windows open and did hear early morning, pub-closing folks, but did not last long.  Only suggestion for room is to have a lamp on the desk for additional lighting.
All the women who manned front desk were more than helpful and very professional and very friendly. Next door pub was a plus and food was delicious, although we did not have breakfast(surcharge) there, only dinner.  Hotel also had secured entrance to elevator and private entrance to pub.",4,2014,10,24
227,Overall a very good experience,"A warm welcome when we arrived,room very spacious and comfortable , hotel right at the center of Dublin and easy access to most amenities. Full Irish breakfast was great( toaster little slow) plenty of good restaurants close by. Lighting not good enough in the bathroom, one central light in middle of bathroom . Corridors narrow and when they clean in the morning there stuff/ junk everywhere, not pleasant to see.",4,2014,10,24
227,Dublin Stop Over,"My daughter and I stayed here on the 19th October after a weekend in Galway.  The staff were super friendly and very helpful and our room was lovely.  We were expecting it to be noisy, but the staff had made sure to put us at the top back of the hotel, so we both had a good nights sleep. The beds were comfortable and there were lovely fluffy towels and even hair conditioner included in the toiletries.   There are lots of lovely restaurants, bars and cafes just outside the hotel.  Our room rate was very good as we booked online in advance.  We would certainly stay here again.",4,2014,10,24
227,Premium Location,"I think it will be hard to find another hotel with the location and installations at this price in this area of Dublin. The hotel is within walking distance of everything you need to see within the city, and at a fair distance of what you need to see not that close to the center. In fact, we took a nice walk from the hotel to St James' Gate (a stop in the Brazen Head for lunch and a pint or two of Smithwick's is a must) and it didn't feel far at all. I cannot count with my fingers and toes all the nice places, restaurants and pubs surrounding the area. In fact, the hotel has its own pub where breakfast is served and nights are happy, while great food (white pudding highly recommended) and service are delivered

We got a nice comfortable room for my wife, my two kids and me, good beds, a nice shower, clean and all. We just used it for sleeping as we spent the day outside, and for the price there is no match, you cannot go wrong staying here

My only complain and the reason for only four stars is the noise coming up from the pub downstairs. If you have been in Dublin, in Summer time, with 65 degrees F, clear skies and NO RAIN AT ALL (yes, you read it right) you know that people just go crazy and flock to the pubs and restaurants, but they don't stay inside of course, they pour into the streets while drinking, smoking, laughing and chatting, and not at low tones, thing they do until 3-4 am in the morning or later. We were in the 4th floor, and because it was 65F we had to sleep with the windows opens (no AC in Dublin, normal unless you go to a very high end hotel) and you get the picture. We had to endure three days of torture, mostly torture for having to stay in the room with the kids and not being able to go down and party, but torture nonetheless. The price for the nice weather, I guess.

But don't expect this to happen to you, 65F degree days, clears skies and no rain for many days in Dublin only happens once in a 100 years. You missed your chance, but feel good for the lack of noise while you enjoy your room at the Drury Court",4,2014,10,22
227,"Friendly staff, excellent location! Lovely stay!","Just spent 4 nights at the DCH and really enjoyed it. The front desk staff is very welcoming, always friendly and smiling, which is becoming more and more rare... Onsite parking is a real bonus, our room was large, well-appointed (except there is no mirror within reach of the 'built-in' hairdryer!), windiw block out the street noise completely, location is excellent within 10' if Temple Bar, O'Connell Str, Trinity, Dublin Castle/cathedrals, 2 min to Grafton Str shopping... The breakfast in P.macs pub downstairs (cool location) was ok, choice limited, esp fresh fruit. Will definitely return when visiting our daughter in Dublin again soon!",5,2014,10,22
227,Bnb,"I stayed here for the first time a few months before..about May 2013.I didnt know the hotel was even there and when I saw it first I thought it would not be nice as it was right beside the dart line but surprise surprise..you CANNOT hear a single sound from the train.Well I didnt anyway.The breakfast is served in a coffee type shop attached to the hotel and I found the breakfast enjoyable.Personally I dont agree with having eastern europeans seving guests in an Irish hotel as they didnt seem to fully understand the language and they are not as friendly as Irish staff.However.they were courtious and clean and efficient.
I have stayed there since so it must be good!",4,2014,10,21
227,Will return,"Per Visa requirements I needed a few days out of the UK.and I wanted to meet my adult son for a mom/son visit, Dublin was suggested. Quick search on Tripadvisor and the Drury Court popped up. Those initially hesitant as the cost was below average I decided to take a chance as the Hotel is within the city centre and the sights I wanted to visit were all walk-able. 

From the minute we arrived at the desk to departing (myself at 0500, my son at 1200) the staff were cheerful and most helpful, facilitating eateries, ATMs, taxi's, etc. The Hotel is in the centre of pubs galore so there is a bit of street noise, but nothing to interfere with sleep. We were front street side, (501)  there is not much view, but, oh well more incentive to get moving in the morning. 
I had requested two single beds, got them. Room was spotless, there was coffee/tea facilities in room, lots of towels, serviceable beds (I am picky, picky about mattresses so don't let this comment put you off). 

I've already told my partner, he and I WILL return. 

We did not use the restaurant so I can't comment.",5,2014,10,19
227,Terrific location and superb hotel staff.,"We enjoyed a two night stay with our three children. The concierge was top notch, offering excellent recommendations for dining and sightseeing. The hotel is walking distance from Dublin Castle and other tourist destinations. It's a can't miss location in the heart of Dublin!",5,2014,10,17
227,Good hotel,"This hotel was in a great location, within walking distance of Trinity College and other key sites, as well as lots of restaurants and pubs. The room we had was very large, clean and comfortable. The staff were very friendly and able to accommodate our requests and also offer advice about things to see and do and transport options. Highly recommend.",4,2014,10,17
227,perfect location,"The location of this hotel cannot be beat.  we spent 4 nights at Drury Court.  We were able to walk everywhere, even though I am somewhat disabled.  The staff is lovely and very helpful. The room was quite spacious.  On the down side, it can be very noisy from the street below. The maid service was less than perfect. The bed was straightened, the bathroom cleaned and the towels replaced daily, but that was about it.  I had a partially eaten apple that I left on the night stand.  The apple was removed, but not the sticky residue it left behind. Despite this, we would stay here again because of the location and because of the staff.",4,2014,10,16
227,Ideal for Dublin's night life,"It's a nice hotel. The rooms are clean, calm and comfortable. The staff is very friendly and tries to fulfill every wish. The famous Dublin nightlife starts directly in the hotel bar, which is a public bar at night and a breakfast room for the hotel guests in the morning. It has a lot of charme and the breakfast is very good. The hotel is rather close to the Temple Bar quarter, the river Liffey and a shopping mall but there are also lots of good bars and restaurants in the near (reservations recommend on Friday and Saturday nights). The hotel has only a very small free parking for guests but there is also a public parking 30 meters away with special hotel rates. I can only recommend this hotel for a stay in Dublin.",5,2014,10,12
227,Love love love this hotel,Have stayed here many times. Never anything to complain about they make your stay one to remember. I recently stayed for my birthday and had wine cupcakes and a balloon in my room with a note from staff. Really friendly :) ,5,2014,10,10
227,Employees make all the difference,"We spent 4 nights at the Drury Court Hotel in October, 2014. We were aware of the wide variety of reviews related to this property, primarily related to noise related to weekend revelers. Because our first night on the property was this past Saturday, we can speak to the noise issue. There is no doubt that the area is VERY noisy on weekend nights, but this is no fault of the hotel's. (Weeknights are quite quiet) The issues are related to revelers passing through the area back towards Trinity College and other neighborhoods close by. Book early and ask for a room away from the front of the building and this should solve much of the problem. 

Now on to the real story, the employees. From manager Sofia Aguilar Del Toro through the rest of the staff, we could not have been treated more kindly and professionally. We arrived Saturday, (10/4) prior to check in. It was clear to Sofia and her staff that we were exhausted from an extremely long night of travel and she quickly had our room ready for us to check in and squeeze in a nap so we didn't lose the whole day. Our room was quite attractive and comfortable. The beds were terrific as well. The location of this hotel to shopping, entertainment, historical sites and a wide selection of restaurants and bars is worth noting as well. We consistently were able to walk to various sightseeing locations, saving quite a bit of money on transportation. 

All in all, we highly recommend this hotel. Book a room and make sure to get breakfast included. The pub on the first floor handles breakfast for the Drury Court and they do a nice job as well. Overall, one of the nicest hotel experiences we have had in years. Quaint, old world charm with modern amenities such as wifi and a caring staff. What more can you ask for on vacation?",5,2014,10,08
227,Very Nice Hotel Close to Everything,"We stayed here for two main reasons. We wanted to be in the heart of the city and wanted a hotel offering spacious accomodation. Drury Court offered both. Our room was very large, almost the size of two rooms. Although not high end, it was very comfortable. .There was a separate couch/TV area which was something we appreciate.Hotel staff were very friendly offering helpful advice on where to go and how to best get there .The Hotel bar was great. Atmosphere was very interesting and food was good and reasonably priced.
Drury Court is right within the main eateries and shopping areas. There was so much to see and do from this hotel location.
All in all a nice hotel experience.",4,2014,10,08
227,Great place to stay in Dublin,"Booked a day or two in advance and were unclear about parking arrangements - all sorted by incredibly efficient reception staff.
Interior looks a bit dated, but rooms have been refurbed and are great. Had a room over the street which could have been noisy but triple glazing sorted that. For the price, its a real gem.",4,2014,10,06
227,"Great location , clean ","Great location for us visiting family  and being a tourist. 

Friendly reception and very clean rooms.  

Close to grafton street and st Stephens green.

Breakfast in hotel was very good value and pleasant chilled atmosphere.  We didn't stay at a weekend though so not sure how noisy at the weekend? ",4,2014,09,30
227,Nice Hotel,We had a really pleasant stay at the Drury Court.  Much bigger than normal European rooms.  Air conditioning.  Great!.  Double glass windows cancel almost all noise from the street (and with a craft beer bar next door that is a big deal).  The location is really close to many interesting things.  Two blocks to St. Stephens green.  Close to several pubs and restaurants.  Walking distance to Guinness and Jameson.  The staff is really the highlight though.  Friendly and extremely helpful.  From booking to directions and suggestions of things to do and see.  I can't speak highly enough of them.  When I go back I'll be staying there again.,5,2014,09,28
227,Lovely Centrally-locate did Hotel,We had a fantastic 3-night stay at the Drury Court Hotel. The staff were so kind and helpful. Our room was lovely - clean and a good size for three adults. We paid for breakfast one day in the adjoining pub. Breakfast was cheap but quite basic. We used the laundry opportunity which was most reasonably-priced and returned to us beautifully folded and on time. Security is good with a door to the elevator which required the room card. The hotel is centrally located but we had no trouble with noise. We felt that the cost was reasonable. We would thoroughly recommend this lovely hotel and hope to return one day.,4,2014,09,27
227,Perfect Location,Great Location and clean and well presented rooms. Not sure how noisy it would be at the front if you wanted to open a window as situated in a lively area.Full Irish breakfast was good value shame the rashers weren't warm!,4,2014,09,27
227,Weekend in Dublin,"Excellent hotel at a fantastic location in Dublin.  Reception staff very friendly and helpful.  Stayed in room 206 at the back of the hotel which was quiet.  As the hotel has a pub next door which actually do the hotels breakfast, we thought it might be noisy but our room had triple glazing and we didn't hear a thing.  Lovely large twin room with exceptionally comfortable beds.  Hotel is right opposite the famous Hairy Lemon which you must have a drink in while you are there. Lovely full Irish breakfast included in the price with a vegeterian option. Would definitely recommend this hotel and would certainly book again if I go back to Dublin.",5,2014,09,23
227,Great location,"Generally the hotel was very good for a city centre location. Very close to all Dublin has to offer, with good facilities. We had asked for a quiet room on an upper floor in advance, due to being light sleepers, but were given floor 3 of 5. Triple glazing was installed which cut out the majority of the noise, but the downside was that the room was very hot with the windows closed. There was no air conditioning, but we were offered a fan which went some way to assisting sleeping. The bar at ground level was very noisy. The hotel is generally a bit tired and dated, and lighting levels are extremely low (shaving in the bathroom was a challenge in the low light). A bit on the pricey side for the facilities and quality of hotel, but despite some reservations I would stay again.",4,2014,09,22
227,excellent apartment,"great location, we had an apartment which was great for us 4 girls, had everything you would expect, lounge really comfy for relaxing in after a night out dancing/ or lounging about in the morning, getting own breakfast. Was noisy with window open- but that is to be expected in a busy city, would definetly stay there again",4,2014,09,21
227,"Great rooms, Great Service Amazing Location.","Ok I have to start by saying thank you Emma and thank you Sophia. So after a terrible night at the travelodge Stephen Green I walked around the area where I found this hotel. I asked if they had a room for 13 nights the lady  said no we are fully booked on the 3rd of September and again on the 7th but if I can wait for few minutes for her to see if she can switch things around and I did. Few minutes later she said ok I have a room for you. The rate was actually a fraction more but the standard of the room was 100 times better. The location was amazing the the wireless internet was free and she also gave me the parking at no extra charge. Our daughter is going to be there for 6 years studying in Dublin. They told her to reach for them if she ever needs anything. Thanks ladies you were great. We will see you next year. 
Oh you have to try this fish and chip across the road also the Hairy Lemon restaurant for Irish food. ",5,2014,09,21
227,Excellent,"An excellent location, room, clean, elevator, staff, free wifi.
Little bit noisy, but there's a double glazing which improve it.
No aircondition at room. Can be unconvenient in summer.
The staff were very helpful for any request.",5,2014,09,21
227,If you're looking for a hotel in Dublin then you've just found it!,"If you're looking for a hotel in Dublin then you've just found it.
we stayed there for 9 nights and it really felt like home and it was by far the best European hotel we've ever been to. We already miss the place. the hotel is located in the center and all the city attractions are in walking distance. 
The room we were given is very nice and much larger than most hotel rooms you find for this price. At nights it was really quite since our room faced the back of the hotel and not the crowded street, so be sure to ask for one if you're a light sleeper. The beds were comfy and everything was really clean and looked renovated + A/C. The breakfast was at P.Macs, a Pub located next door and since we don't usually hang out in that sort of places it was really interesting to look at. The buffet breakfast costs about 6 euro and consists of cereal, pastries, toasts, jams,juices, cheese and ham, and we could pay another 3 euros or so if we wanted the full Irish breakfast or other choices they offer. There was WiFi at our room on the third floor but only for one or two devices, so if you're traveling with more than that, maybe consider asking for a room on the lower floors. 

Special thanks to the welcoming staff who helped solve our every problem and answer every question, and particularly the lovely Eimear who helped us tremendously and moved mountains to get back an Item we've lost on a tour bus! Thank you Eimear! All of them were really happy to book tickets for tours and events, consult and give walking directions and I can't stress enough how that made us feel really welcome in the hotel. 
Rita and Asya.",5,2014,09,21
227,excellent Dublin hotel,"This a lovely hotel with an excellent location,  within 5-10 minutes of attractions on the south side of the river, but on a relatively quiet street. Room 507 was very quiet, but I did meet people whose room must have overlooked the street or was over the bar, because they complained of noise. Dublin really IS a noisy city.  

The front desk staff were incredibly helpful and delightful.  The rooms are contemporary, good sized, and with a nice bathroom & excellent shower.  Breakfast was excellent--try the porridge here, if no where else (recommend a half-serving), the eggs are organic and very good.  Cheeses, breads, meat & cereal are on the continental table.  The coffee is really good & strong.  It is served in the pub/bar downstairs and the music can be a little odd for breakfast, but no big deal.  Fresh fruit is limited to apples & oranges.",5,2014,09,20
227,Great Location but will never return,"Booked into this hotel for weekend so overpriced for what you get.  Very small hotel, staff were friendly and very helpful.
 I have stayed in many hotel throughout Ireland Europe and I am not fussy but this hotel is not suitable for a couple who live in Ireland and wanted a nice weekend together.  The reception are is so small with no personal touch,  the rooms were clean yes,  but where we had to eat breakfast I was disgusted, it was in  bar next door  with mix and match furniture which was sol old and not in good order which at night does be busy and to eat your breakfast there nearly made me green..... the staff in bar was no help whatsoever I had to ask for everything I.,e, fresh bread, fresh cereal there was nothing left on plates and they weren't going to put new items out...   This hotel is fine for backpackers or someone who is not looking luxuries but for the price of £460.00 2 nights with no breakfast im still in shock for what we got, its more like a house than a hotel...",3,2014,09,15
227,Great location,"This hotel is a short walk to many of the sites to see in Dublin, such as Dublin Castle, the Temple Bar area, Grafton Street, St. Stephens Green to name a few.  Also a short walk to the pickup location for the hop-on hop-off Green Bus.  Hotel is also air conditioned, which was important during our stay due to the unusually warm weather at that time.  Plenty of dining locations within a short distance.

The staff was extremely friendly and also helpful in staying in contact with the airline when our luggage was lost on our arrival at the airport. 

I would definitely recommend this hotel.",4,2014,09,13
227,****Brilliant location and most helpful pleasant staff,"*****Perfect location and on site parking, lovely clean room, staff are so pleasant and helpful........ would highly recommend and will definitely stay here again.......... 5 stars for customer care******",5,2014,09,10
227,Pleasant Stay,Overall it's great. However will share for those light sleepers to request for rooms away from the pub below especially on Sat nites. It can get really an earful. Great spacious room for ours triple room. Very close to our son's admission to RCSI as his Mercer Court accommodation is only behind Drury Court. Bfast good enough with very tasty and mouth watering Irish Bfast sets even though the pastry could do with a refill especially on busy morning. Late comers have to be content with only the white bread and condiments. I would surely make this our yearly stop whenever we are here in Dublin.,4,2014,09,09
227,Fair City,"We stayed for 3 nights at the end of a 2 week holiday and had a nice stay in DCH.  Like ""Go for it"" we had a noise problem - sounded like emptying empty bottles/waste bins at 3.00am!!  We had the window open too since the AC min. temp. setting was 16 degC.  On the plus side, the location is very convenient for site-seeing and going out in the evenings - short walks to St Stephens Green, Temple Bar and other great areas.  The staff were really nice and friendly, giving us lots of useful tips and advice as ""Dublin first-timers"", and the room was fine.  It was a hassle printing off boarding passes for our flight home, but a minor gripe.",4,2014,09,09
227,personal and central,"Set in an interesting city centre street full of restaurants and pubs, the hotel manages to be central but also secluded.
Reception staff set a great first impression; helpful and personalised service.
The room was spacious with comfortable beds (and a trouser press that didn't work), and I was able to open the windows for some fresh air.
Bathroom was well equipped and clean with a lovely powerful shower.
One problem was the noise at night: despite being promised a quiet room it sounded like a street party took place both nights, enough to have to close the windows and double glazing.
Breakfast a bit hit-and-miss too; served in the poorly-lit bar attached to the hotel. On the first day there was a selection of breads and cereals left on the bar itself; on the second it was on a table but not prepared yet by 07:30.
I would recommend and will stay here again when next in Dublin",4,2014,09,09
227,Great stay,"We stayed here just one night but it was great. The hotel staff were really accommodating and helpful. The hotel is in a perfect location, close to everything and we were surprised that we didn't hear any noise from the streets outside. Would stay here again when visiting Dublin.",4,2014,09,08
227,Go for it.,"Pleasant room, very pleasant and helpful people at the desk, delightful breakfasts. What's not to like? Well, the first night, a Saturday, was quite noisy, but the rest were fine. Only way to get cool enough was to open the windows, which worked very well, but they let in the noise too, of course. A minor issue, but a real one.",5,2014,09,03
227,night out in Dublin,"Great location, friendly staff, good service, clean comfortable apartment. 
I would highly recommend this hotel.

227,"Location, location, location","A lovely little gem, right in the city centre. Friendly staff, comfortable-silent room. Double windows ensure no noise and a great night's sleep. Breakfast excellent! Secure parking. With shopping, shows resturants etc. on the door step!!! Excellent!",5,2014,08,31
227,Lovely hotel but wouldn't stay there again,"The hotel we fonund to be really nice with very friendly and halpful staff. The room was clean and tidy with free toiletries in the room. The localtion is just about perfect which is a short 5-10 mins walk to the Temple Bar area and O'connel Street areas. Breakfast was served in P Macs bar & restaurant which is attached to the hotel on the ground floor and the breakfast was fine at 9 Euros a person but it would have been nice to have some beans but overall it was fine.

Now the downside. We were on the top floor in room 503 which we were told was a quiet room even though we had all the windows shut we could hear the thump thump thump of music unti gone 02:30am. We got back in from an evening out around 11pm and the thump of the music we could hear coming up through the floor and we were on the top floor so no idea what it was like on the lower floors. Managed to drift off to sleep but was woken at 02:30 and the noise was still going. P Macs is a lively, noisy bar attached to the hotel which is where we think the noise was coming from although there was another noisy bar close by. If it wasn't for the noise and the broken sleep we would probably have given this 4 1/2 out of 5.",3,2014,08,31
227,Excellent location,"What do you need to know? 
Excellent city centre location. 
Exceptional value for money. 
Limited car parking available on a first come, first served basis at the time of booking. There are, however, discounted rates available through the hotel at 2 adjacent car parks. 
Staff were all exceptionally friendly and helpful. 
The rooms are clean and the beds comfortable. 

I stayed here initially on a last minute booking at the start of July. I arrived early morning and got to check in as soon as a room was available, even though it was only perhaps 11am. That room was on the second floor. 
I was undisturbed by the street noise others had mentioned and got an excellent sleep. 

So impressed was I by the hotel, that a few weeks later, I made a return stay. This time, I arrived very late and had a room on the first floor. My heart sank. The noise from the bar below seemed impossibly loud. I closed all the windows, and it really made a surprising difference. Half an hour later, by midnight, the music had stopped and I heard no more and again slept well. 

I really can't complain about anything here. It's unbelievably good value for money and in an excellent location. The wifi service was faultless in both rooms.",5,2014,08,28
227,Very good and sweet hotel in the heart of dublin.,Very kind and at most young personal (multilanguage). Cool modern bar. Clean rooms. Secure parking space at the back of the hotel. And a good location in Dublin. You can reach every important point by foot in less than 20 minutes.,5,2014,08,28
227,Dublin city break,"If there is a group of 6 of you planning a trip to Dublin for the weekend or longer you must stay here! I arranged a weekend trip with 5 friends for my birthday 15th august till the 17th. this is the 3rd time ive visited Dublin and I preferred staying here then any of the hotels. you cant check in until 3 but the helpful staff took all our bags and we went to the local super market which is 3 minute walk and did our shopping (full breakfast, tea bags and pizzas) the apartment is lovely and clean, and we soon got unpacked and ready for our night out. it was nice not to be told our music was to loud which you get constantly if your in a hotel! it was also nice to have all my friends just a door away rather then running down the corridor in a hotel. The staff at Drurys are amazing! so helpful and just a phone call away. the iron didn't work but we had a replacement within minutes, the hot water stopped working but we had a plumber there within 10 minutes, there wasn't a plug in the kitchen sink and someone brought one up straight away (it didn't actually fit the sink so washing pots was very difficult) that's the only thing that I would say needed fixing for my next stay here. I will 100% stay here again! 3 minute walk to temple bar. perfect stay!!!!",5,2014,08,27
227,lovely minmoon !!,"We went to drury court hotel for a 3 day break after our wedding.We arrived early in the morning after a flight over and on arrival at the hotel mentioned we had just got married.The receptionist was lovely congratulated us and upgraded our room and said it was available immediately.
We had a lovely big suite and were more than pleased with everything.The carpets were spotless and the room also , I have never know such a supply of hot water and water pressure that filled the bath in seconds. we loved staying here ! breakfast was great and the bar where it is served is very unusual with all odd furniture etc but added to the atmosphere,
the hotel is ideally situated for all of the city just far enough away from temple bar but can get there in under 10 mins on foot no problem.
on checking out the staff were more than happy to store our luggage till we picked it up late in the after noon for our departing flight.
thank you for everything if we return to Dublin we know where we will be staying !!!",5,2014,08,24
227,Good Central Location ,"Knowing that I would be arriving early I contacted the hotel and they were only too happy to store my bags until the room was ready. 
We arrived early and decided to use the hotel restaurant for breakfast (Dublin doesn't come alive early in Sundays so our choice was limited). The welcome from the staff was great and they went and booked us into our room so that the meal could be added to our stay. 
According to my husband  The continental breakfast was very good. I decided to have the full Irish. This was disappointing, the sausages were very poor quality and the bacon could have been cooked longer and didn't have much taste. As our booking was room only we decided to eat elsewhere. 
I cannot fault the room. It was clean, comfortable and spacious. I was anxious about noise at night as our room faced the street. Though we had the windows open at night as it was warm the noise was bearable and all was quiet by 1am. 
The hotel is very close to the majority of tourist sights, most being walkable. The reception staff were very pleasant and knowledgeable about the places to visit. 
I would definitely recommend the hotel for your City Break holiday in Dublin. ",4,2014,08,22
227,Fantastic central location,"Last week  I spent 2 nights at the Drury Court Hotel located near the city center in an amazing position and it was my first experience in Ireland. I loved it! Apart from that, the service of the hotel was good and in general the room was comfortable and clean. The only problem was the WiFi service that is not that bad, but it could be improved.",4,2014,08,21
227,Great central location,Lovely hotel.  Kind staff and very clean.  Centre of Dublin and so really perfect for us.  Decided to have breakfast out at the Petit Parisien for fresh coffee and baguettes as utilising the bar as breakfast room meant it was still smoky and grimy from the night before - would be good if they sectioned the bit off behind the curtain for guests but only a small criticism and easily resolved.  We will return.,4,2014,08,19
227,"Fantastic apartment, will return!","I have just returned from staying at the Drury Court Hotel for 2 nights. As a party of 5 we booked to stay in the apartment block which joins onto the hotel. The apartment was lovely with 3 nicely decorated double rooms and a comfortable living area and kitchen. 
    The staff were extremely helpful and on-call 24 hours a day. On our second day the shower didn't appear to be heating up and the water pressure was low but a maintenance man was with us and the problem fixed within half an hour of us reporting the problem. 
   The apartment was self-catering and had all of the facilities needed to eat in and cook- however, being so close to Grafton Street and pubs and restaurants we didn't have much need for this (except for bacon sandwiches for breakfast!).
   The location of the hotel and apartments is central and only a 4-5 minute walk to Temple Bar and other main attractions. Our group has stayed in other hotels in Dublin and we agreed that we will definitely return to Drury Court on our next trip. I would recommend for anyone staying with a large group looking for a good weekend away drinking and having a laugh to stay here 100%! ",5,2014,08,18
227,Nice central location,"My sister and I spent 3 nights at the Drury at the beginning of our Ireland adventure.  We felt this hotel was a good home base because of the location.  It was perfect!  Central, yet quiet.  Nothing fancy about it, but the staff was friendly and helpful, everything was clean and comfortable.",4,2014,08,17
227,Great base to see Dublin,"We stayed here for two nights as a base for a day in Dublin before we caught the ferry home. 
It's a lovely hotel in a great location. 
It's a family-run hotel and, unlike in some chains (even  big ones), the staff were fantastically helpful and irrepressibly cheerful at all times.
The room, bed and bathroom were comfortable and clean. We didn't eat there in the evening but the breakfast was excellent.
I'd recommend this hotel as a place to stay if you want to see Dublin and we will certainly use it again.",5,2014,08,17
227,My Weekend Break,What a wonderful I had at Drury Court Hotel. Very comfortable rooms and the staff in reception were so friendly. I was there as part of a group of 3 guys. We had an extra bed delivered to our room on request.,5,2014,08,12
227,Great location great price,"Will definitely stay there again. Excellent location. Staff were friendly. Very good value. Room was nice but we were given a large room as it was just ready. Security is good there also. The bar appeared to be very lively, however we didn't get a chance to try it this time. ",4,2014,08,11
227,Worth a revisit!,"Excellent hospitality and courteous staff. Special mention of Emma who ensured a late night booking for a on demand AC room. 
Location of the hotel is central to Grafton Street and loads of options to eat and grab a pint.

Got a tastefully decorated room offering a quite peaceful sleep away from the buzz of the pubs on a busy road. 

Worthy of a longer stay the next time around!!!",5,2014,08,05
227,"Nice, with great location ","The Drury Court is ideally located for exploring the city center. The rooms are modern and clean, and the bathrooms are exceptional.  Granted, space is limited and there's no wow factor here. But the staff are great and really cater to tourists. As always in a big city, try to get a high room toward the back, and with AC. Not all rooms have AC, so I was fortunate. The price is high compared to what you pay for nicer hotels in the states, but it was in line with similar properties in Dublin. ",4,2014,08,04
227,Girly night in Dublin,Excellent location. Really exceptionally friendly and helpful staff. Best I've ever experienced. Very central and ideal location for a night out. Staff were great and beds really comfy. Wud recommend for defo,5,2014,08,04
227,Fantastic hotel,"Great hotel! We were on the first floor right above a fun bar and, thanks to triple glazing, couldn't hear anything once the window was shut. They had air conditioning, the best wifi we experienced in Ireland and unbelievably helpful people working reception! I'd definitely recommend this place! 

The location couldn't be better either!",4,2014,08,03
227,Perfect location!,"I cannot recommend this hotel more. It is really in the perfect location, close enough to walk to any place you'll want to visit in Dublin (yet not smack in the middle of the overinundated touristy areas). The location is also very safe. The rooms themselves were great, the staff very friendly and helpful. I will definitely be staying here when i return to Dublin and i would urge any other traveller to do so as well, you wont be sorry!",5,2014,08,03
227,Great location,"Really enjoyed our stay here. Finally found a hotel in Dublin that's reasonably priced and yet is comfortable. Newly renovated in the last 9 months. Great location, very central. Parked in Stephens green car park and got a great rate for the 48 hours, courtesy of the hotel, €25. 
Quirky bar adjoining the hotel, may not be appealing to older residents. ",5,2014,08,02
227,Drury Court Hotel 7/23/14,The customer service was awesome at this hotel.  Very accommodating and very informative.  The location is perfect and within walking distance of all the major attractions in downtown Dublin.  The restaurant connected to the hotel was amazing and had many beers on tap including some craft beers.  Some of the rooms are not air conditioned so definitely ask for a room with air conditioning if that is important to you.  The only negative thing would be the beds were not that comfortable and it would have been nice to have a safe in the room.  Other than that the Drury Court is definitely worth the money and I would stay here again.,4,2014,08,01
227,Apartment stay,"The apartment was clean and tidy and the bedrooms were of a good size.  The kitchen was quite small and could be used by only one person at a time. The bathroom which also included the only toilet was adequate. With 5 adults staying in the apartment scheduling of the bathroom and toilet was difficult. 

Seating in the small lounge area was also limited to four seats and additional chairs had to be brought in from the bedrooms. There was also no table or chairs to enable us all to sit together for any meals.

The apartment wracked out onto a small lane which was noisy late at night and early in the morning.",4,2014,08,01
227,Great location - wonderful staff,"First off - some of the best customer service I've had at any Dublin hotel!  The location is perfect for walking to almost anyplace downtown Dublin city centre.  There are any number of restaurants, pubs and cafes nearby.  The only negative I can say is not about the hotel itself as much as its neighbors.  When we first checked in we were given a lovely corner room, spacious, comfortable, clean and cross ventilated.  The staff offered us a room fan as the weather was quite warm.  However, the noise later that evening from the pub downstairs which was competing with loud music from the restaurant across the street was quite unbearable.  The staff did their best to get the music turned down and offered us a different room for our second night.  They upgraded us to a quieter room, moved our belongings (with our permission) while we were out.  I would definitely book this hotel again.",5,2014,08,01
227,Great staff!!,"The staff was absolutely wonderful. Sofia and Heather made our check in easy and helped us find my Mom's walker, which had not arrived on our flight. Everyone was helpful. The location is wonderful--close to the Gaiety Theatre, Trinity College, pubs, and shopping. We will definitely stay here again.",5,2014,07,31
227,Lovely staff & great location,"Early checkin was made possible.
Room was spacious, clean, a wee leak on the floor into the bathroom, but nothing to be bothered about.
Very good breakfast.
Nice helpful staff.
I would definitely return.",4,2014,07,31
227,Great location -- Great service,"Super location.  I was able to walk everywhere.  The room was clean and the staff was very helpful.  I was up early one day before breakfast and they prepared something for me to take along.  That is real customer service.  
Would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,07,29

local pubs and cafes all around u",5,2014,07,28
227,Beer Budget hotel with Champagne prices,"Initially booked this hotel through trip advisor (Expedia).  Received an email a week before arriving asking me to confirm the booking at the cost of over $800!  No way had I booked this hotel for that price - so I cancelled the booking.  I tried looking at other options & eventually booked with the hotel directly.  There were price reductions as the Garth Brooks concerts had been cancelled & they were obviously trying to recoup their potential losses.
Arrived at close to 2pm & was told that the room wasn't ready but that we could leave our bags & go for a walk.  Was told that they would call when the room was ready.  Left my phone number (Aust mobile #) & off we went.
Wandered around Grafton Street for close to 2 hours before we decided to go back & wait in the lobby.  We were tired & it was starting to rain.  When we walked in the reception staff said they would check, & that the room should be ready by now.  No call to let us know..  
No bell staff, we had to take our own luggage up.  Very basic rooms.  No safe. Comfy beds.  Wifi is free, but very poor - hard to connect & keeps dropping out - am turning myself into a pretzel right now trying to get/maintain coverage!  If you had to pay for it, I can guarantee you wouldn't be a happy camper!
I have absolutely no problems staying in budget accommodation, however had I had to pay the original price, this rating would not have been as high as it is.  If you are going to charge 4-5 star prices, make sure you can deliver the goods.   This hotel doesn't.",3,2014,07,27
227,super location with brilliant service,"Quiet little hotel. 
Good location - Grafton street  and temple bar in walking distance. Local pubs, cafés and shops in same or neighbouring streets.
Free wifi.
Staff were very friendly and helpful.
Perfect location for sightseeing.",5,2014,07,26
227,Brilliant place to stay!,"We booked this hotel because we wanted to be near the Gaity theatre. The location of hotel is perfect. (Riverdance was brilliant too!) lots of bars and shops very close by. Room was a family room and was very large and clean/comfortable. The full irish breakfast was massive and hot, tasty and very filling. Will be returning to this hotel very soon.",5,2014,07,25
227,Small hotel with high quality in the senter of town,"This small hotel is in the center of town, south of the river Liffey. It is only 5-10 minutes walking distance to different areas such as

•	Sentral walking/pedestrian area as Grafton Streeet
•	Tourist attractions such as The Castle of Dublin, St Patrick Cathedral, Trinity College, The Wax Museum and more.
•	Temple area with many bars, restauras og theaters
•	Recreationsareas (parks) som St Stephen’s Green and Merrion Square Park.

The atmosphere in the hotel is relaxed, and it is easy to have a nice time in this hotel. The staff is very nice and pleasant. They know very well what a tourist in Dublin should do and see. They did a very good job, thanks a lot.",4,2014,07,25
227,Good hotel in a great location .,"Good hotel in a great location.

227,Outstanding,"my wife an i had an anniversary trip away in Dublin at Drury Court. not only did the hotel staff upgrade us to a suite free of charge, but also got room service breakfast in the morning free of charge. the staff were very friendly, yet professional and we could not have wished for a better stay. excellent location and great wee pubs(check out the Hairy Lemon for food, great experience). will def stay at this hotel again and again.",5,2014,07,23
227,"“Awesome place , lovely staff”","If you are looking to have some amazing days in dublin , then this is the right place for you. The location is probably the best possible , you will reach almost all the main attractions in less than 10 minutes by walk ! In the evening , the high amount of pubs and bars near the hotel will entertain every different kind of people . Rooms are excellent and also very clean , i particularly appreciated the tea kit , refilled every day . The breakfast is great and also very rich .There is also a free wi-fi connection which is really fast.  An important note goes to the staff , i never found such a lovely and helpful staff before! I met them all . Giulia, Jason , Emma and Hannah , all of them so kind that i felt sad when i had to come home . They will make you feel at home for all your accomodation , one more reason to come back again!!",5,2014,07,22
227,"Great value, clean, large and comfortable room","I came for a one-night stay and got a great last-minute deal (about $65 for a night). I wasn't looking for anything fancy, so I was happy to see that the room was a pretty decent size. No conditioner, just shampoo, for your planning purposes. The area can be somewhat noisy at night, even on a Sunday evening. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Great location.",4,2014,07,22
227,Great Place For Seeing Dublin,"Location is wonderful. Easy walk to just about everything in central Dublin. Hotel is not large or fancy, but it is attractive and clean with good-sized rooms, decently large bathroom and a very good shower. The hotel seems as if it should be noisy, considering the location, but is actually very quiet. Not a B&B, but the attached pub is also a restaurant where breakfast and other meals are available.  But the neighborhood is full of choices from cute little tea/coffee shops to full-fledged restaurants. We stayed for 3 days before doing a driving tour of Ireland, and liked it so much we booked three more days when we returned to Dublin.  But the best thing about the hotel?  The staff!  Friendly, personable, helpful and ready to answer any question.  Can't say enough about how helpful they were. Highly recommend the hotel.",5,2014,07,20
227,"Great hotel, amazing location","Stayed there for a week, room was nice (a mini bar or a fridge would be even nicer!). Hotel staff were very helpful and friendly and had great recommendations. 
But most important is LOCATION! The neighborhood where the hotel is, has all the bars, restaurants and shops one can ask for. Vibrant and party atmosphere all around.
10 minutes walk from the Temple Bar if you insist, but IMO, an even better area.",4,2014,07,17
227,Great for family,Having stayed here last year we ...all 9 of us ... stayed again in June of 2014.... we had two apartments and it was just perfect. We ...3... had to stay in the hotel for one night as the apartment was no vacant until the following day.... For our needs the apartments work much better. The weather was very very warm  the hotel did not have any air condition and the window did not open very wide. The staff have always been very helpful .Should we have another week in Dublin we ..all .. this would be our first choice...Marvelous having wifi in both the hotel and the apartment.,4,2014,07,16
227,An excellent 05 days in Dublin,"I found Drury Court Hotel very clean, staff very helpful and accommodating. I stayed there for 05 week days and they made me feel at home. I will have no hesitation in choosing Drury Court Hotel next time when visit Dublin.",5,2014,07,11
227,Family room - quite room and very friendly staff !,"I booked a room for 3 (family) only a few days before travelling. It was a surprise for us: centrally located, but no noise from the street - clean room - a very helpful and friendly staff - and a convenient opportunity to get a breakfast is right next to the hotel. 
Great location , looking forward to our next stay in Dublin!",4,2014,07,11
227,Fantastic hotel experience!,"The staff was one of the friendliest I have ever encountered. The manager, Sofia, was so accommodating and went out of her way to help us. The room was great and we heard no noise from the busy street below. Dublin was our last stop on our 2 week self-guided tour. Thankfully this hotel was pretty central to everything we wanted to see. I think the furthest away we had to venture was maybe 15 minutes. Great location, great staff, and very clean!",5,2014,07,09
227,Apartment stay - Fantastic,"We stayed in an apartment which is right beside the hotel. There were 4 of us. One double bedroom and a sofa bed in the living room. The room was huge, 2 two seater sofas, a dining table and a great kitchen with a combined washing machine and tumble dryer!!! Almost like being at home as there was almost everything already there, hairdryer, washing powder etc. As for location, wow, amazing! 2 mins away from Grafton St, beside Temple Bar area and College Green. The reception staff were friendly and helpful too. You will not be disappointed if you book this apartment! ",4,2014,07,08
227,Great result for a last minute booking!!,"Central, clean, very helpful and friendly staff!! I booked this the day before, as I wasn't expecting to be staying in Dublin. The bus link to the airport was close by, which was great. It was all I needed for a business trip. Despite my room overlooking the Main Street, there was no noise. That said it was a Monday night.",4,2014,07,08
227,"Great Service, Great Location","Keep in mind, the room we stayed at was medium to small sized. That's the closest I could come to a negative critique. The room was very clean and modern with a good wifi connection. The location itself was near lots of restaurants and cafes in a lively part of town. The value is great.
In addition, all of the staff were kind and attentive. Special kudos to Emma and Hannah at the front desk who were very sweet and welcoming to my wife and I while we were on our honeymoon. Their service was unexpected and very appreciated.",5,2014,07,08
227,Great location for shopping and sight seeing.,"We stayed in the hotel for three nights this June and were very satisfied with the experience - grandparents, children and young grandchildren.  The hotel was very convenient to all the shops around Grafton Street as well as the galleries, museums and Guinness Brewery. The hotel was very clean, the staff very helpful with taxis/phone calls etc., the beds very comfortable and most importantly, the windows ensured that it was very quiet at night even though the neighborhood has lots of restaurants and bars - I especially wanted a quiet hotel.  We spent two weeks traveling around Ireland and for the price this was one of the best value and comfort hotels we stayed in.  The car park is a little difficult to get into with a large 9 seater van but it did fit - call ahead to ensure a reservation as the park is not that big though there is additional parking quite near by. Overall i would very gladly stay at the Drury court again.",5,2014,07,02
227,great location,This hotel has a fabulous location just minutes away from Grafton street. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful and nothing seemed too much trouble. The room was comfortable but a bit too hot as opening the window meant traffic noise. The bar downstairs was very busy with a very small residents area. The breakfast was served in the bar area and was more than ample.,4,2014,07,01
227,Very good location indeed and nice people serving,"Drury Court Hotel is a nice play to stay and know the best of Dublin. Its privileged location puts you among lots of restaurants, cafes and stores in Dublin centre. Room and bathroom were absolutely clean. People serving at the restaurant, for the breakfast, were nice, as well as, people on the front desk that were very helpful and gentle. ",4,2014,07,01
227,"Superb location, excellent staff","This hotel is ideally located on the edge of all the entertainment and eating venues in Dublin. All are a short walk away, but being on the edge means it is relatively quiet. The staff are pleasant cheerful and extremely helpful with any request or problem. Good rooms kept very clean. Breakfast is in the bar next door, nice food unusual surroundings. One small gripe safes in the rooms would be good.",5,2014,07,01
227,A most pleasant stay.,"We stayed in the Drury Court hotel on the 29th of June and had a wonderful time there. The location couldn’t be better; the rooms are clean and comfortable. The bar has a great vibe with brilliant selection of craft beers. I must add that the staff are exceptional and a credit to the Hotel, friendly and helpful, we left a bag of presents for our daughters in the hotel and the staff located the bag and posted it down to us. 

We highly recommend staying here and we are looking forward to returning to Drury court very soon. Once again thank you so much for a great stay!",5,2014,07,01

227,Amazing ,"Great hotel, not too expensive, clean rooms of great sizes, great cleaning and reception service and a great staff, everything you could ask for located in a great spot of the city because you have easy access to a lot of local stores,  shopping malls and in a walking distance to many museums and main attractions (like St. Patrick's Cathedral and Dublin's Castle), and close to all the bus lines like the hop-on hop-off buses. Definitely a great option to stay in Dublin!  ",5,2014,06,26
227,"Fantastic Location, Easy to find by car and Carpark close by.","If you are coming by car there is a car park directly opposite the Hotel offering discounted rates for overnight parking.

I booked a double room through booking.com but would have liked a triple as my daughter was travelling with us. The option was not available through the web so she decided to stay with friends at the Radisson.  When my Mother and I checked in we discovered a large room with a single and a double, perfect for three.  I asked the reception if we could add my daughter to the booking, no problem , I was told.

they only charged an extra 20 Euro.  perfect.
Staff were very hlpful and most accommodating.  
The bar below the hotel (P Macs ) was very interesting and welcoming.  great indi rock kind of place.  very relaxed and visited mostly by the Irish people.  not many tourists.

The hotel has food outlets on the doorstep of all kinds and the rooms are well sound proofed.
We did not hear anything from the bar or street once the windows were closed.

A great breakfast was served and we all left feeling very happy.  I would recommend.",5,2014,06,24
227,Great little hotel,"It may not be the Ritz but for location and friendly staff its hard to beat. The rooms are medium sized and very clean, with ""retro fit triple glazing""so its quiet for a city center hotel. TV is very limited. Very convenient for Grafton St. shopping and city restaurants (the hotel restaurant guide is excellent). The reception area could do with a makeover.",4,2014,06,24
227,Great location and friendly staff,"This hotel is very centrally located.  Easy walking distance to the Temple Bar area, which has a lot of places to eat and drink.  We could also walk to most of the sights in Dublin such as Trinity College, the General Post Office, St Patrick's Cathedral etc.

The rooms were clean and with the double window setup they have, we didn't find noise from the nearby pubs an issue at all.

The staff were really friendly and helpful.  They also send you an email when you book with instructions for getting there from the airport using the Airlink Shuttle Bus - I'd recommend using this if there are only a couple of you as it is 6 euros a person rather than 25 ish for a taxi.  The bus was very easy to get using the instructions they put in the email - much appreciated!",4,2014,06,23
227,Fantastic location,An awesome location at a really great price.  The staff was so pleasant and helpful.  The windows in the room were a set of inner and outer windows.  When both were closed the sound from the pub below was virtually erased.  Wish I could have stayed more than one night.,5,2014,06,22
227,Absoutely Amazing,"Found this hotel last minute booking! All employees were awesome. The nice employee checking us in was patient with us answered all our questions. They let us keep our luggage there for the day after check out! We went back that night and they helped us get to airport easily! Very Very helpful! Would recommend to anyone! Great, fantastic place! The room was clean, so was the bathroom :-) ",5,2014,06,22
227,Great Hotel near center of Dublin,"Great location within walking distance of most Dublin attractions, pubs, and restaurants. We stayed in a nicely furnished 3 Bedroom apartment with basic necessities. Was definitely big enough for a family of 5 adults. The staff were extremely helpful and nice, providing suggestions and directions for local favorites. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,06,21
227,Great hotel close to everything.,"We stayed for three nights in a one bedroom apartment. It was clean and had a small refrigerator to use. It was centrally located so we could walk to Temple Bar area, Grafton Street, and many others. The front desk was open 24-7, so we could stop by anytime to ask a question. They were always helpful and accommodating.  I would stay here again.",4,2014,06,18
227,Ideal!,"Went to Dublin for 1 night with the wife to the Taste of Dublin festival. Stayed in the Drury Court Hotel and from start to finish everything was great. 24hr reception if needed, pleasent staff, spacious room and bathroom.

We had a room only rate as we had breakfast booked elsewhere but they do have a B&B rate if needed.

Perfect for a quick 1 night stay in the City, close to Grafton Street, Stephen's Green, and Trinity College as well as a very accessible Luas line.

One thing I would say and it certainly is to my taste but not others, when the windows were open the noises on the street were quite loud as there are several bars around the area including 1 right next door. Now, there was no issue eg. fights or singing or anything like that, just people chatting over one another. 

I would wholeheartedly recommend Drury Court Hotel",4,2014,06,16
227,"A great stay at the Drury Court Hotel in Dublin, Ireland","Our family of four stayed in one of the family rooms at the Drury and loved it!  Lot's of room and very quiet (despite the adjacent Bia Bar).  The hotel is very centrally located, which made access very easy by foot (we did not have a vehicle).  The staff was also very friendly and accommodating.  Book without worry.",5,2014,06,15
227,Great location,"Great location close to everything, large bedroom and bathroom with good facilities. Friendly and helpful  staff. Local people so helpful, if you stopped to look at a map someone would ask if they could help.",4,2014,06,15
227,Great for a quick overnight trip!,"Stayed for one night with my husband and was pleasantly surprised.  Very central and easy to find.  The Air Coach drops you off a 5 minute walk away! The room was ready for us when we arrived at 11 which was a great surprise. When we checked out the staff were happy to hold our bag most of the day before we left for our flight home.  The desk staff were kind and courteous, the hotel and room were bright and clean. We had windows that allowed plenty of fresh air into our room during these warm days.  The only two negatives were the extreme temperature swings while taking a shower and the very noisy street traffic (glass collection was Wednesday early morning!).  Not a deal breaker for the price we paid.  Would definitely stay again.",4,2014,06,12
227,The staff was extremely helpful and hospitable.,We are a middle aged couple and it more than met all our needs and expectations. We would stay at Drury Court Hotel again. It is walking distance to all the tourist sites and night life. Our room was on the back side of the building and nicely quiet. The room also had a window that could be fully opened for fresh air. It was a pleasant stay with very friendly and efficient staff that made up the rooms. ,5,2014,06,11
227,Perfect for a tourist in Dublin,"I stayed one night in this hotel and would highly recommend it.  The location is perfect - very close to Grafton St, Temple Bar,  St. Stephen's green, Trinity College, Gaiety Theatre,  10 min walk to the AirLink bus to airport.   The staff was great, the room was nicely decorated and very clean.  Great value for the money - I would definitely choose this hotel again.",5,2014,06,10
227,Perfect location,"Drury Court Hotel is perfectly located for all sightseeing, shopping, restaurants, pubs, entertainment, and a nearby car park if you rent a car. It's easy walking distance to Grafton Street, Trinity College, St. Stephen's Green, Temple Bar, Dublin Castle, St. Patrick's Cathedral, Christ Church, and the waterfront. Our room was comfortable and clean. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. One suggestion when booking - Not all rooms have air conditioning. This was not too challenging in latter May but could be uncomfortable in warmer months. So, depending on when you're traveling, you might want to consider specifically requesting a room with air conditioning.",4,2014,06,09
227,"Smack, bang in the middle.","My fiancee and I booked this hotel literally hours before we went down and managed to get one of the last apartments available. We could not have asked for a better location in one of our favourite spots in the city. The hotel is roughly two minutes away from St Stephen's Green and five minutes from Grafton street. Right next door to the hotel is P.Macs, one of the best bars in Dublin with a great atmosphere and an unrivalled selection of drinks for trying.

The apartment itself was homey, clean and comfortable. Not much to talk about in the way of views but we were only really interested in somewhere to lay our heads. The room was cleaned when we were out and there was no issues at all with cleanliness. Staff at the desk were very polite, helpful and made us feel at ease. The apartment came with all the neccessary essentials in the kitchen and bathroom. Comfortable sitting area equipped with a respectable TV. One tiny, small issue was that whenever the bathoom was used for either the sink, shower or toilet the pipes would make noise for 5-10 minutes not an issue during the day but if you're a light sleeper it might unsettle you. Again, this was just a tiny issue in an otherwise flawless stay.

I really can't stress how brilliant this place is in terms of location/value for money. Getting somewhere nice and central in Dublin can be very costly. I would certainly stay here again.",4,2014,06,09
227,"Drury Court, Dublin","I stayed in this hotel on June 3rd when in Dublin on business.  I was only there for one night but can recommend it.  The room was clean, the bed was comfortable and the staff were friendly and helpful.  The location was perfect for me as it was a little over 5 minutes walk to my office but it is also an excellent location from a social point of view.  It is only minutes from the shops on Grafton Street and in the course of a ten minute ramble I came across, Spanish, Italian, French, Japanese and Indian restaurants and numerous pubs. I would certainly use it again.",4,2014,06,06
227,I enjoyed the Drury Court,"Extremely friendly staff helped with directions and getting me sorted with a power adapter, Rooms where clean, succinct, most of all, affordable. Location was perfect.  I was able to walk to my evening destination and back with no issues.  Hotel staff secured my cab in the early morning hours so that I could catch the bus.  I would definitely stay here again.",4,2014,06,05
227,well recommended,"We had a lovely stay, received a warm welcome,  were delighted to have carparking on site,  a real bonus, large room, speedy wifi, everything within walking distance, perfect for small children and tired adults on a quick city break.",5,2014,06,04
227,Very friendly staff,"We stayed here recently for 2 nights, and we had an OK stay. 

The pros: the staff was very friendly and accommodating; the location is perfect, centrally located to nearly everything; the rooms were fairly clean; free WiFi.

The cons: the shower was not great, just a sad little stream of water, no water pressure; the shower curtain had mildew on it; the hotel bar/restaurant is a major hotspot, which could be great if you want to party all night, but if you want a hotel where you can go have a relaxing nightcap and wind down, this is not it; and finally, because of the bar scene, it's very loud, even in the rooms, until the early hours of the morning.

It wasn't a bad stay, and I appreciate the staff's friendliness, but for the cost, we'll probably stay elsewhere next time we're in Dublin. However, if you are looking for a centrally located hotel where you can just leave your things while going out to explore the city and nightlife, this hotel wouldn't be a bad choice.",3,2014,06,03
227,loved Drury Court,"We chose Drury Court due to its central location to the main sites of Dublin.  We only had a couple days and wanted to maximize our time there. We had a lovely room,  roomy and impeccably clean.  The windows minimize Street noise,  which makes a great night's sleep on the comfortable bed.  If it was hot,  and Windows need to be open,  the noise would be a problem... thankfully Dublin's weather shouldn't have this problem.  The reception staff are incredibly helpful and always friendly and welcoming.  We had the breakfast which was quite good,  although my first walk into a bar for breakfast was a trifle strange until welcomed by the staff.  I think you'll enjoy your stay at Drury Court and find it quite competitively priced.",4,2014,06,03
227,"So-so hotel, great location","My mom and I recently spent 10 days traveling throughout Ireland, and since we flew into the Dublin airport we figured we'd spend our first night there. Although we had a car, we wanted a hotel in a central area so we could walk to everything we wanted to do (see some castles, go shopping, eat, hit some bars) since driving/parking in any city you're unfamiliar with is always a pain.

We chose the Drury Court Hotel because of its prime location and its cost. It was one of the more expensive hotels we stayed in ($160/night), but it was probably the worst in terms of amenities and cleanliness. 

The staff was really nice and helpful—we got lost trying to find them and their carpark but when we called they gave us some tips on how to find them (hint: the hotel is sort of hidden among one-way streets and alleys). They also gave us some recommendations on restaurants in the area, and were overall super friendly.

Unfortunately, the room resembled more of a cheap motel than a hotel in a decent size city. It was dank and dingy, the bathroom shower curtain was pink with mold for its entire bottom half, and because the shower was so narrow it was inevitable that we'd end up touching this gross curtain at some point during the shower (and I say this as a relatively thin person, so unless you are a baby you're going to get some skin-to-shower-curtain action). The toilet would only flush once every 15 minutes or so, so if you're traveling with more than one person, you guys better space out your pee breaks or go one after another and then flush. 

The walls were swiped with dirt in a few areas and there were pieces of the baseboards missing, signs of a well-worn and not-quite-kept-up-with hotel. 

Honestly, though, the area was so great and we were only staying for one night so I really didn't care that much. If I ever go back to Dublin, though, I'll look for a different hotel in the same area. Even if I have to pay quite a bit more, it would be worth it.",3,2014,06,03
227,"lovely modern hotel, great central location.","The reception may be small, but the welcome from the receptionist was warm and friendly.
My room was beautifully modern and cleaned to high standards.
I arrived back at my room exhausted and wondered if I was going to be able to sleep with the noise from the street below. Thankfully to the soundproofed windows I slept extremely well.",5,2014,06,03
227,High standards for a 3 stars in the UK,"Girls at the reception are fantastic, the room is properly clean and the bed is very comfortable as I was sleeping like a log, while normally i have problems falling asleep.
Location wise, well, in 1 minute you are in Grafton Street, so what else may you desire?

I highly recommend this place.",4,2014,06,02
227,"Functional place, very nice and gentle staff","The position is very good to go and visit the city centre of Dublin and all around walking...the staff is always helpful. The quality/price report is good. There is also a powerful hairdryer. I think It is important to say that cause girls (or, why not, men) who has long hair (as I have) can leave their hairdryer at home avoiding to fill their luggage unecessarily. The room had been cleaned every day, and every day towels had been changed. You can get there catching the bus number 16 from the airport. Very convenient. My friends and I liked it. We are from Italy so We care about cleaning, so you can trust us :P",4,2014,05,27
227,Amazing location and wonderful staff,"My boyfriend and I had originally planned on staying in Dublin for the first 4 nights and then traveling around to other parts of the country. We booked the hotel for the 4 nights and by the 2nd we decided that we liked it and the area so much that we wanted to just stay the entire 10 days here. The staff was very accommodating and offered a discount for booking the extra days with them. 
The location was fantastic. A short walk to the Temple Bar area, all of the tourist attractions and all the restaurants and pubs you could ever want. 
I was nervous about staying here because there were many reviews about the noise being too much to sleep, but we had no problems at all. We stayed on the 4th floor that faced out onto the street and were right above the bar. 
I think the best part about our stay was the staff. Everyone we spoke to at the front desk were very friendly and helpful. They recommended some fantastic places to eat and always had a cheerful hello and goodbye when we arrived or left. We lost our camera in a taxi the third day we were in Dublin and mentioned it to Jason at the front desk and he went out of his way to call around and try to locate it for us. 
I would definitely recommend this hotel and plan on staying here again if we make it back to Dublin again.",5,2014,05,26
227,very Convenient Hotel..,"First stay at the Hotel in Dublin as I usually stay at the Grafton Capitol next door.For the first time this was Cheaper and was very near to my meeting pplace,about 200 Yards only.Very much in the City centre and conveniently Located near the Stephens Green and all the Small eating Joints on Grafton Street.The Breakfast is served in the Pub but a basic one but worth the money defintely.
The reception looks small but the Rooms are quite Big and much more TV channels then Grafton capitol and also free WiFi.
Would stay here the next time also.
Lots of eating options close by with a Thai Noodle Bar opposite and there is a Tea Lounge right next door which serves all types and concotions of Tea which we would have never heard of but very vitalising.",4,2014,05,26
227,Great location for everything to see and do in downtown Dublin,Great spot and walking distance to most attractions.  Not sure we would include breakfast again as it wasn't worth the cost in our opinion.  The hotel staff were very helpful and the rooms were spacious and well presented.,4,2014,05,25
227,wonderful place,My husband and I stayed here on our amazing 3 week vacation in Ireland. We ended our vacation the last week in Dublin. We stayed here and it was just fantastic! the people that work here are so kind and friendly and go out of their way to make sure that your stay with them is top notch! I really look forward to going back some day and staying here again.!,5,2014,05,18
227,A good choice,"We stayed at this hotel for five nights. We booked through the hotel website and because of the length of our stay we got a 15% discount. This meant that we got a very good deal for the quality and location of this hotel. From our experience, there was little to fault in this hotel - its location is absolutely brilliant - most sights, attractions and restaurants are a short, leisurely stroll from the hotel. Our room was really nice - big, comfortable and very clean. In spite of a bar located right next to the hotel, our room (which, admittedly was on the top floor) was quiet and peaceful. Our only snag during our stay was that there was not enough hot water and the water pressure was too low. We spoke to the (very attentive and very friendly) reception staff and they kindly reserved another room for us where we could go shower until the problems in our room were fixed. The problem with hot water was largely resolved but the low water pressure still largely remained. This did not however detract from our overall positive view of this hotel. One final remark regarding breakfast - we booked on a bed only basis and did not regret it. The hotel is close to several pubs and bistros serving breakfasts at largely the same price at the hotel. We never had breakfast in the same place twice!",4,2014,05,14
227,Great Value,"Great location, great staff. Rooms are clean good size comfortable beds good size bathroom fantastic value for such a great location. We walked to great bars and restaurants in the area and originally booked as it was close to the beautiful Gaiety Theatre where we had booked to see a show",5,2014,05,12
227,"Central located, nice rooms, great service","Nicely located hotel with walking distance to all major Dublin attractions. Nice and comfortable rooms, good service in advance (how to get there, nice things to see) and very friendly personnel.
I'll make sure I book this hotel again next time I'm in Dublin!",5,2014,05,12
227,Drury Court Hotel,Stayed on a Tuesday & Wednesday night. Got a very reasonable rate. Had asked for a quiet room and got a quiet room. Staff very helpful and friendly. Loved the bar which I only used for breakfast - quite quirky. Continental breakfast was fine but nothing unusual. Room very clean & spacious. Location is fantastic - very close to Grafton Street and South Great Georges Street. Ate in a lovely Tapas place on South Great Georges street.,5,2014,05,10
227,Great Stay,Great location! Enjoyed walking around Stephen's Green and shopping on the surrounding streets. The staff was very helpful and friendly. Rooms were clean and comfortable. We enjoyed going to Taste (around the corner) for breakfast.,4,2014,05,10
227,Perfect location,"We stayed for a week and found it to be perfect for us. Very comfortable bed. It can get VERY loud what with 3 bars just below. The 4am clean up of the beer bottles was jarring at first, but we slept right through it after the first night. The restaurant/bar just below has great breakfast and coffee. Our flight arrived in the morning and the front desk held our luggage for us until the room was ready while we explored the area.",5,2014,05,09
227,Great place to stay!,"Loved my experience at Drury. The prices are reasonable, the location is great, the staff was super friendly, and the rooms were clean. The staff even made phone calls for us to arrange dinner reservations, tours, etc. I stayed for 5 nights.",5,2014,05,08
227,Welcome to Dublin,"We recently stayed at Drury Court for 3 nights. It was really very good, great central location, just 5 minutes walk to Grafton St, with lots of shops, entertainment, and eating places. Only a short walk to Temple Bar and the river. Room was excellent and very clean, staff really friendly, good breakfast. Hairy Lemon pub across the road was a fantastic place to eat. We'd definitely stay there again.",5,2014,05,07
227,"Nothing to complain about, good location","The location of the hotel is excellent - it is in a really nice and happening area in the centre of town with lots of restaurants, bars, pubs, shops and cafes nearby. It's close enough to Temple Bar if you want to spend time there (an easy walk over), but far away enough if you don't. The hotel is next to a busy pub so it may be noisy for some people, although we were in a room on the 5th floor and we could sleep with the windows open with no problems. The room itself was a standard hotel room and was comfortable enough with a TV, kettle, comfortable bed etc. There was no safe in the room though. We booked a parking spot in advance and that was really good as it's free if it's available. The staff were friendly and efficient and I would definitely stay here again.",4,2014,05,06
227,"Brilliant hotel, amazing staff and relaxing stay!","I stayed at the Drury Court in Dublin for a nice little break over Easter. I found the hotel very easily when given directions by the helpful reception staff. The staff were from first meeting very friendly- very knowledgeable about the local area, and extremely helpful. Once we checked in, the room was very comfortable, spacious and clean- just what we wanted, and for a great price! The beds were so comfortable and the bathroom and toiletries were above expectation! 
The hotel is located within easy walking distance of everything we needed; shops, restaurants, bars etc- and downstairs next to the hotel there is a splendid little Irish pub, full of the Irish charm we expected to find in Dublin and they serve a great apple crumble too :)
When checking out we had a nice chat with the staff, both Emma the manager and Mauve the receptionist demonstrated outstanding customer service- they were as helpful and as friendly as can be.
All in all I had a great experience- for the price and the location, it really was ideal for us. Would definitely recommend!!",5,2014,05,06
227,"Great location, staff where fab","The hotel was really central. 15 mins walk to oconnell bridge which meant we where close to everything. 
The bar in the hotel was very friendly an great fun. 
Room service was prompt an very friendly staff. 
Emma on reception was absolutely fab an went the extra mile she made our stay great nothin was to much trouble for her. Room was great big enough just for two clean enough. 
Would defo stay again",4,2014,05,06
227,Average stay ... convenient location and nice breakfast!,"Located in the heart of Dublin, Drury court is hardly a few minutes (walkable) away from Dublin's tourist areas like temple bar, O'Connell street, Ilac center. The overall experience was average because the rooms are not very up-to-date. The breakfast was awesome as the chef prepared really nice mushrooms quickly on request .... and the reception staff was nice and courteous too. 

Rooms and the interiors don't have the modern look and require minor upgrades. Stayed here for just two nights but the smell in the room made me feel a bit uncomfortable. ",3,2014,05,06
227,Cheap if you are just looking for a bed for the night!,"Cheap and Cheerful if you are just looking for a weekend stay and just want a bed. Lift was broken when we were there (Level 5 we were placed on and not that I have objections to walking the stairs as it is good exercise) but I wouldn't like to be an older person having to do this.  It was advertised on the website that the lift would be broken so we were well aware of this when booking the room.  We stayed 2 nights and I think our bill was a little over 100 euros for the 2 of us so you can not go wrong with price if you are just looking for a room.  Staff were extremely friendly when checking in and rooms are very clean. There was a noise coming from the roof, a tap leaking and we were put beside the staff room so could be a bit noisy at times. Parking is accessible and cheap enough if you are with the hotel.",3,2014,05,06
227,"Great Location, Clean and Friendly Apartment Stay","We visited Dublin and stayed at the Drury Court Hotel for 2 nights, we chose to stay in one of the 3 bedroom apartments they have to offer.
The apartments rooms were all double beds and decent sizes for what you need.
Best idea staying in the apaprtment as we were able to sit and have a drink together while people pottered around getting ready.
We thought the one bathroom situation would be a struggle but it wasnt bad at all. Only problem was that the l;ast one in the shower got a nice cold shock. We didnt know how to change the timer for the hot water so we just let one of the lads suffer the cold.
I would definatley go back and stay here!",5,2014,05,06
227,Good hotel in city center,"Good hotel in the city center. From there you can get to any touristic object in a city by walk (and which is really important to return from Temple Bar area at night)
Noise isolation is not perfect, so at night you still hear the sounds from the bar downstairs and the transport, but it is at acceptable level, at least on 4th floor",4,2014,05,05
227,Three Nighter,"We picked the Drury Court rather by chance and were a bit worried whether we had done the right thing.  But we had no reason to be - we were made very welcome when we arrived and left our car in the secure parking area (make sure you pre-book as it is not very large).  The room was large and comfortable with plenty of space to hang clothes etc.  Also a proper bathroom and not just a showeroom.  Breakfast is in the bar below which also does other meals but there is so much to choose from round about we did not use it.  Yes, slap bang in the middle of Dublin with all the tourist attractions in easy walking distance.  Would we go back - you bet we would!",5,2014,05,04
227,Good central location,Great location on the south side of Dublin. Close to a great variety of quality shops. Restaurants are all close by and suit all budgets. Some lovely traditional Dublin pubs are also in the area. Great overall for a night in Dublin. ,4,2014,05,02
227,over night stay,"Went up to Dublin for a weekend night out to see a friends band and stayed in Drury Court. This was our first time in this hotel having stayed in a number of others, but I must say we had a great time and we will be going back again. The location is second to none beside Stephens green with parking on site. There are a second set of windows so even though we were in the centre of Dublin not a sound was to be heard. Staff were very friendly and knowledgeable, the room was clean and the bed comfortable.",5,2014,05,02
227,Great Hotel,"Stayed for 3 nights this weekend ,the room was huge and very clean .Great central location if a little noisy on a Friday and Saturday night, but Hey you're in Dublin ! if you cant beat them join them ! The thing that sets this hotel apart from others in Dublin are the friendly and efficient staff, nothing is too much trouble for them. I would certainly visit again.",4,2014,04,30
227,Good location and friendly service,"The hotel is located near the Temple Bar area and close to the Powercourt Shopping Centre.
We booked a standard double room and was happy with the size and the cleanliness of the room. The checking process was hassle free and the staff was very friendly, even took the trouble to pass us a map and ask if its our first time in Dublin.

We love the location around this hotel, which is the main reason why we choose this hotel. The price is comparable to hotels of similar grading around the area. 

We stayed in a room on the first floor directly on top of the bar, so we get to hear the pumping bass sounds the whole night till about 3am. But outside the functioning hours of the bar, the room is very quiet, even on a first floor. We will ask for a different room on another level next time.",4,2014,04,29
227,Lovely,"Stayed at the Drury Court for 3 nights. The staff were so nice from the moment we walked in to when we left and were very helpful. It's a good location, probably a 5 or 10 minute walk to Temple Bar which is a fantastic night out. Didn't do much of the typical tourist sightseeing during the day so not sure what the locations like for things like that although most things seem in walking distance. Overall I can't fault the hotel or the place and would definitely come back. Just bring plenty to spend too because it's a bit pricey when you get here but its worth it. Also coming to and from the Airport we used the Airlink bus service. It was much cheaper than a taxi. It's only €10 return and definitely worth doing.",5,2014,04,28
227,Perfect location,"While not plush, this hotel is in the best location possible. The room was kept clean and the staff was helpful. We could walk to everything. Even though we were in the heart of Dublin the room was quiet. We would recommend this hotel. ",4,2014,04,28
227,Average hotel - good location,"Stayed at Drury Court Hotel over Easter. Location is excellent. Plenty of bars and restaurants nearby and close to tourist spots. Room is average, with all basic stuff and clean. 
The only inconvenience: Some noise at times from other guests on the corridors and workers in a next-door room.",4,2014,04,27
227,"nice hotel, perfect location","Have stayed here on many occasions, the most recent being March. The location is excellent & with car parking available either in the hotel's own (restricted) space or the multi story opposite,  it suits my needs perfectly. They have special rates agreed with the multistory. The staff are very helpful & friendly. The rooms are a decent size (depending on where they are situated)  & well maintained. The bathrooms also, though the shower heads could do with unblocking, the flow is restricted.
Will definitely stay here again.",4,2014,04,27
227,another great stay!,"Have visited Dublin and this hotel lots of times. I think this is a well managed, quality hotel at a good price. The staff are always very friendly and helpful and always willing to go the extra mile! The hotel is well situated to access the city centre with most attractions being within an easy 30 mins. walk. Good sized rooms and bathrooms, comfortable beds and spotlessly clean throughout. Rooms are triple-glazed and so outside noise expected from a city centre location is much reduced. I will certainly return on my next visit this summer.",5,2014,04,27
227,Great Hotel,"Great hotel, in a great area for Grafton Street, St Stephens Green ect. Room was nice and big, better than some of the more expensive hotels we have stayed in Dublin. We stay in Dublin alot as husband works there so been to a lot of hotels, but will be returning here.",5,2014,04,25
227,Drury Court is excellent,"Wonderful experience; excellent location, friendly and helpful staff, clean and comfortable, large rooms.  I was very happy with the Drury Court.  And the price was very reasonable compared to other hotels in the downtown area.",5,2014,04,24
227,"Very central, nice hotel","We stay just one Saturday night.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  We were on the third floor, and the windows were quite noise-insulating.  This is an issue in the area because it's quite lively around this area, particularly on the weekend.  First floor might have been a problem given there's a pub directly below.  That said, we slept fine.  Very close to lots of tourist sites, and places to go out/restaurants/pubs.  Shower was ""OK"" - a bit old, and fixed to the wall.",4,2014,04,24
227,Great find in Dublin,Our first trip to Ireland and this hotel was the best of everything.   Great location.   The staff could not have been more helpful.   Clean spacious room.  Within walking distance to wonderful restaurants and pubs.   Near Trinity College and St Patricks.   We definitely recommend!,5,2014,04,23
227,Perfect hotel for a stay in the centre of town.,Location is excellent! Within walking distance to everything and the airport transfer was super easy. Great pubs and cocktail bars on the same street. The staff was friendly and very helpful. I would stay here again. ,5,2014,04,21
227,Outstanding little hotel!,"Great location in Dublin.  Can walk just about anywhere in the city from the hotel.  Excellent staff.  Rooms are very nice, clean and comfortable.  Pub located on ground floor serves breakfast.  Easy walk to mail shopping areas.",5,2014,04,21
227,"Convenient, friendly, city centre","Lovely staff, clean and nice accommodation. Great city centre location. Easy to find. Free baggage storage. Good shower pressure. Nice rooms and bed clothing. The living room could do with some interior decoration unification but all was good quality.",4,2014,04,21
227,"Consistently good, lovely staff, great value","We've stayed here a number of times and have been really pleased each time. Rooms are spotlessly clean, well kitted out and have everything you need for a comfortable stay at a reasonable price. Location is fantastic. Even though the hotel is slap bang in the city centre, noise in the rooms hasn't been a problem as windows are all well insulated/double glazed. Very friendly staff make the stay very pleasant. We've booked again, so will be back.",4,2014,04,20
227,Good friday good experience,Had 3 bedroom apartment for one night on Good Friday on the way to a wedding.  Great location and the rooms were fine for what we wanted (though a bit warm and 2 of us found the pillows too hard for comfort).  Great bar downstairs where we had a late lunch that was value for money and a full Irish breakfast the next morning.  Bar staff were friendly and helpful (as were all the staff at the hotel).  I would recommend this place for groups of friends visiting Dublin and any gripes I had were minor ones indeed.,4,2014,04,19
227,Charming hotel in Stephens Street,"Very nice hotel for a reasonable price, located nearby everything in the heart of Dublin. From Stephens Strees you have acess to resturants, bars and shopping centres within 5 minutes of walk. 10 minutes walk to the Temple bar district with must be visited while you stay in Dublin. Nice and helpfull personal on the hotel, the breakfast are served in a nice little pub resturant at the ground floor. A recommended place to stay in Dublin. ",4,2014,04,16
227,Location and staff were perfect!,"From the airport we took the Airlink bus to the ""College Green and Temple Bar"" stop.  Our walk from there was no more than 10 minutes and that was with a small child in the rain.  
Location: 5 minute walk to Grafton Street shopping district, Dunnes grocery 2-3 minute walk, SPAR grocery (open later) 4-5 minute walk, the Famous Temple Bar 8-10 minute walk, 30 minute walk to Houston Rail Station.  The pub next door (name??) is fantastic and you must stop in for at least 1 drink.  Food was just ok.  Atmosphere was fantastic.  Metro ( out the front door, turn right, left at the next street, 1 building down on the right across the street) was a great spot for breakfast....they serve it all day if you're a late sleeper!
Staff:  everyone was always helpful and friendly.  Special thanks to Maeve who was an amazing asset for us.  Very knowledgeable, friendly and happy to help.  Her tips, pointers and suggestions made our trip much more relaxed.  She treated everyone like they were old friends.  Give that girl a promotion!
Rooms:  we upgraded to the superior and for a family of 4 we were extremely happy with the room size.  One of the largest we've found in Europe.  Clean and had everything we needed.  Expect noise from city traffic and pub deliveries in the morning.  Nothing unbearable. 

Here is why only 4 stars, not 5... The beds.  So uncomfortable!  The couch bed was a super thin mattress over wood.  The other beds had a thicker mattress but still too hard.  The shower also had very soft, low pressure.  I have long hair and showering took 3 times longer.",4,2014,04,15
227,Not the best,Well located in Temple bar area with friendly staff but very limited hotel. Tiny reception area and breakfast comes at an extra cost. There is a very vibrant bar under the hotel thus noise is a problem if you want to keep windows open. This is really a budget hotel which charges a bit more.,3,2014,04,10
227,Excellent value & location,"Stayed here recently as myself & partner were going to a concert in Dublin.
Staff were so friendly and helpful. They even reserved a parking space for us when I rang to book a room at no extra cost. Excellent value and you couldn't get a better location, everything on your doorstep. Will definitely stay here again when in Dublin.",5,2014,04,10
227,Good value,Got stranded here back 2 years ago when the ash cloud happened.  Front desk was nice.  Food at the bar next door was awesome. The rooms were a little dark but overall pretty darn good.  Hopefully be back soon.,4,2014,04,06
227,Noise? What noise?,"Could not be happier with Drury Court. Everything from the staff at reception greeting us to how fresh the room felt every time it was cleaned, Drury Court certainly know what they are doing. It is in the heart of Dublin, minutes walk from anything and everything you want to see. So much so we didn't need a tour bus. Due to reviews on here, we phoned prior to ask for a quiet room, on arrival (hours before the advertised check in time) we were not only told we could check in now but were placed on the top floor to the back! Can't get much better. The staff couldn't have been friendlier, from showing us places on the map, to getting an ironing board asap to us, or a bottle opener (As I was daft enough to buy wine without a screw cap top)! The price, the staff, the location...all I can say is, we're impressed!",5,2014,04,03
227,drury court hotel,"I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel, the staff were very pleasant and helpful, breakfast was delicious and surroundings in breakfast area were fantastic, very quiet and peaceful, but it was Monday night, but hopefully it would be the same weekends.  Would deffo stay again.",4,2014,04,01
227,Everything we wanted!,"We spent two nights in a three bedroomed apartment, which was located in a building 2 doors down from the actual hotel.  We arrived early and the hotel were happy to hold our luggage while we began exploring the city. They offered us early check-in as soon an apartment became available, free of charge.  When we returned, check-in took less than two minutes and the staff were happy to answer all of our questions.  Reception is open 24 hours, helpful when you have a 6am flight to catch home!

Our apartment was clean, decorated in a warm, modern style and had everything we needed.  The kitchen was compact but had a full-sized oven and hob, a microwave, fridge and even a washing machine.  Wardrobe space was plentiful and the complimentary WiFi was a very welcome addition (router within the apartment meant that the connection was speedy and consistent).

The hotel was in a fantastic location, a five minute walk from Temple Bar and just a stones throw from St Stephen's Green and all the shops on Grafton Street.  If I return to Dublin I will not hesitate in booking to stay at this hotel again, in my opinion it was brilliant value for money.",5,2014,03,31
227,Very good choice for a group staying in Dublin,"I stayed with other 5 friends (6 people) in the 3 bedroom apartment for three nights. We spent less than staying in Hostels. There is also a kitchen, which works fine. We could cook our own meals.There is a very little terrace ideal to take some fresh air or have a cigarette if you smoke.
The service during our staying was very good. Very friendly staff.
Also the booking per phone went smoothly and the staff helped us with all our requests.
We are all very happy to have chosen it.
Ps. position is really good and central - we could reach everything walking.
We never had problems because of the noise.",4,2014,03,31
227,Wonderful St. Patrick´s Weekend in Dublin,"I would absolutely stay at the Drury Court Hotel again as well as recommend it to any friends or family staying in Dublin. The room was better than advertised, clean and we even had a St. Patrick's Day goodie basket waiting for us. The staff was more than helpful and very friendly.  The location was also wonderful as we were able to experience more of the local flavor than we might would have closer to the Temple Bar area, yet it was still accessible to everything we wanted to see and do.",5,2014,03,26
227,Good value hotel,"We chose this hotel as it provided free car parking. We got a good deal which included the parking and breakfast. Had requested for a high floor room to avoid the noise which the hotel very kindly accommodated. Room was clean, there were tea facilities. Only downside was that the shower wasn't too hot or strong but we felt that for one night it was fine! Wifi was adequate.
Breakfast served down in the quirky pub. Continental or hot breakfast with plenty of juices and yummy pastries! 
Would stay again!",4,2014,03,22
227,Noisy,"Our room overlooked the attached restaurant/bar...how lovely to hear thumping bass music all evening. Make sure you request a room that doesn't face the alley. 

Otherwise, this hotel is in a nice location (quick walk to Temple Bar, Grafton St, etc) and staff were friendly and pleasant.",3,2014,03,16
227,Comfortable hotel in the best location,"My sister, mother and I stayed in a triple room on Wednesday (12th March) as we were attending a concert. 
The hotel room was clean and spacious and they had plenty of towels, toiletries and the beds were comfortable. 
This comfortable, convenient hotel was perfect for what we were after.",4,2014,03,14
227,Perfect location.,"We stayed for a night in this hotel when we were going to a production in the Gaeity Theatre. We also wanted to be near pubs/restaurants/shops in the Grafton Street area. The hotel turned out to be in an ideal location for all these things, within walking distance of everything. The staff were very friendly and the room was lovely. The only problem was that our room was at the front of the hotel, and the street is very loud and busy on a Saturday night. The music from the pubs nearby was really loud well into the night and there were loads of people out on the street too so you wouldn't want to be looking for a quiet and peaceful night's sleep! But other than that it was great.",4,2014,03,13
227,Great short break,"Myself, wife & 17 year old daughter stayed at this hotel between 07-10 March 2014, overall we had an extremely enjoyable stay, hotel staff are very friendly & the Hotel itself is in a fantastic location around corner from Grafton Street for for anyone interested in shopping & only a 5 minute walk to the Temple Bar area with all it's great variety of bars & restaurants.",4,2014,03,12
227,fantastic stay,"my husband and I stayed at this hotel on Friday the 28 of feb for one night as it was our anniversary this hotel  is spotless clean and the rooms are very comfy the bar in the hotel is brill 
  really lively.breakfast  was very good they also have a great self serve buffet with lovely pastries
the staff are all very nice and helpful we will stay again well done",5,2014,03,03
227,Curtain up.,"We stayed here for one night on the 27th of February. Check in time is 3pm and we were greeted in a friendly manner on arrival. We had pre booked car space and were provided with free parking in the Hotels private car park which is just around the corner. Pre booking is advisable as parking in this area of Dublin is expensive. The room we stayed in was quite large and accessible by elevator to the 5th floor. All necessary amenities are available in the on suite room and the only complaint rests on the curtains and the TV. The curtains were not wide enough for the window and the  blind was damaged so no closure possible. We were on the 5th floor so could not be overlooked but the curtains and blind should not have been so shabby. The TV channels were not set properly and we had to retune the set to watch a little TV. These small inconveniences did not spoil our short visit as everything else was very satisfactory. The breakfast in the morning is well done and includes a self serve cereal and cake buffet along with the select menu. The staff are very helpful, cheerful and obliging so would stay again if in the area.",4,2014,02,28
227,2nd visit,"Went here last January and decided to return again.it's a central hotel 5 mins from temple bar and very good value at only 46 a night room only for the two of us. We had room 207 and it was comfy with a spacious bathroom,Lots of hot water and a warm room with comfy beds. Would definitely go back to this hotel it's comfy,central and reasonably priced",4,2014,01,26
227,"Ideal location, great stays!",I regularly use the Drury Court Hotel for business and sometimes leisure and cannot find fault with anything.  Sure it is slightly (only slightly) dated but the rooms are spotless and the staff are excellent and cant do enough.  The improvement of sound barriers to the windows has improved sleep quality significatly.  The changes to the bar have made it more lively (if you like lively) and the food is always excellent.,5,2014,01,17
227,New Years Break..,"stayed at this hotel for a 4 night break.. room was tidy and clean, maid replaced the coffee/tea/milk/sugar every day, the room was cleaned and bed made up....  very good..  The rooms have been refurbished as far as the windows went.. now double glazed..  this hotel is in a perfect location, close to everything. have been to Dublin 3 times now staying at different locations.. this is by far the best as to yet.  Temple bar not far away but beware.. the cost of drinks are expensive by the hour at night times, the pubs get full.. there are plenty of eating places here spoilt for choice, there is every nationality of restaurants.  Well recommended.",5,2014,01,07
227,Perfect for Family with 2 teenager daughters,"we booked the apartment for 4 adults by telephone with Julia who was extremely helpful. After a busy day shopping, we managed to locate the hotel and again Julia was very helpful in getting us a car park space and showing us to our apartment. The apartment was perfect for our stay with 3 bedrooms, a well resourced kitchen and small living room. Despite the location, there was little noise heard from outside. We didn't have breakfast as we were eating out for lunch but we cooked toast in the kitchen. The apartment was very clean and the location was excellent as a central location in Dublin. The attached bar had a nice buzz too and a bit of character.",4,2013,12,31
227,Good Location,"We chose to stay here as we were going out for dinner with friends. The price was really good for the location and that made us pick it out.
The downsides - despite it having ""free wifi"", we couldn't get on it at all (2 x iPhones and an iPad). Maybe it was because we were on the top floor. The room was a little shabby - stained carpets and the curtains didn't hang straight down as the wall curved inwards (not good at avoiding morning daylight). The shower was a little underpowered.
The good bits - great location for the centre. Great price that would have been the same price as a taxi home, so a no-brainer.
We'd stay again for the above points.",3,2013,12,31
227,Really good value for a central hotel in Dublin,"Great hotel that I would definitely use again. Great location, nice rooms and very good value. Staff also very helpful and ultimately a really good experience. Limited parking, but you can get discount at a public car park that is fairly close. ",4,2013,12,22
227,Good 3 Star Hotel in a Great Location,"Stayed here for 3 nights and it really is in a great location, step out the door and walk any direction will bring you too an endless number of shops , restaurants , bars and tourist attractions. From the hotel a 10/15 minute walk will bring you to the centre of Templebar , O Connell St , Grafton St , Stephens Green ( Green Luas Line ) and Dame St ( Hop on Hop off bus stop ) .
We had a comfortable if basic clean room on the 4th floor to the rear of the hotel , no views but that would be  expected in the city centre.Room had a double and single bed so plenty of room for luggage etc.Free wi fi with good reception , tea / coffee facilities, trouser press, flat screen tv , good quality bed linen ,plenty of fresh towels and toiletries provided and excellent shower pressure.
The only item that I missed and I still can't understand why in room safes are not a standard provision . The room has a air conditioning unit to provide cool / hot air  and even though there were instructions provided ( and I work in the heating industry ! ) I found it frustrating as the instructions provided were not enough to operate a quite complex control panel for a hotel room but when I got it to switch on the heating was very effective.
One of the reasons I booked this hotel is that it has a limited number ( approx 8 ) parking spaces to the rear of the hotel . These are free to guests( which is so unusual in Dublin) if you book your room through the hotel and then call or e mail them to try and reserve a space. But even if spaces are not available there are a couple of multiple storey car parks close by.
The entrance to the hotel car park is through a small archway just before the hotel on a one way street so we just called reception as we pulled into the archway and they opened the electronic gates to the parking area and kindly met us in the car park to bring us through the back door into the hotel.
If your looking for a no frills city centre hotel with excellent rates then look no further than the Drury court .",4,2013,12,11
227,"Great location, clean hotel, noisy.","We stayed here to run the Dublin marathon and the location was perfect for walking to almost anything in Dublin in 10 minutes, (including the start and finish lines for the marathon).   The staff was awesome, the rooms were clean.  So why the four stars?  We were indirectly serenaded almost every night by friendly Irish folk frequenting the three bars that populate the corner of Drury.  In fact the bar connected to the hotel was super cool, with games on the tables and neat hodge-Podge of chairs and tables and little nooks to hang in.   Drink Guinness - advice I got after finishing the race.",4,2013,12,08
227,Great location,"We chose this hotel because the did have parking; however, there us a public car park across the street! The hotel is in a great location, not a far walk to most downtown sites and very near many wonderful restaurants. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was small by American standards, but it met the need of rest after a busy day. It was clean.",4,2013,11,22
227,"Good location, old hotel","The location is very good with complimentary parking. The reception staff and hotel staff are very polite and accommodating. However the rooms leave a lot to be desired. They are small, very old and run down. They could really do with a refurbishment, especially for the price we paid. We spent very little time in our room which was just as well as it was very dull and dreary. It is beyond me why in this day and age some hotels still have shower curtains. Overall the hotels location and staff make up for the shortcoming's in the rooms decor. ",3,2013,11,19
227,"Convenient, Clean, Comfortable and Affordable","We stayed 2 separate times at the Drury Court during our trip to Ireland. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Both rooms were clean, comfortable, quiet for sleeping and affordable. (The only thing I would have missed is a hairdryer had I not brought one myself.) The hotel is convenient to popular tourist sites, local transportation and the Dublin Tourist Center, which is the pickup point for most day tours. Also convenient to many restaurants, bars and shopping. A big plus - we needed a laundry that would wash our clothes while we toured and were referred to a convenient laundrette right around the corner - same day service. I would recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a convenient good value accommodation.",5,2013,11,09
227,Exellent service,"We found the Drury Court Hotel to be very good with very friendly staff. Our room was spacious, very comfortable and clean. When we arrived we were met by very friendly and professional reception staff. They offered us free car park space, which is very unusual for Dublin hotel. We had a few drinks in the bar before exploring the streets around hotel, which had large number bars and restaurants, offering excellent value. While our room was at the front of hotel there was absolutely no noise coming from the street. Our breakfast the following Morning was excellent. Thanks to David (General Manager) and his professional Team. We will definitely be back again. Garvan and Mairead",5,2013,11,05
227,well located hotel,"The Drury Court Hotel is in a great central location, you can walk to most of the tourist sites and close to the fantastic restaurants in William and George St and across the road from the Hairy Lemon pub.
We were in a double room (409) on the 4th floor which was very close to the lifts, the room had double glazing but it was still noisy and it was very hot in our room as there was no AC so we had to open the window which made the noise factor worse.
The room was a good size, clean with a comfortable double bed.  The free wifi had a good reception in the room.
The bathroom was small but clean the shower in the bath had a very poor flow due to the very small shower head. Toiletries and a hairdryer were supplied.
We did not have breakfast as had to leave hotel by 7.30am and breakfast was not yet available.
We did not eat in the restaurant.
All in all a satisfactory stay mainly due to the central location and friendly helpful staff.",4,2013,10,30
227,"Good service, convenient","I've used this a couple of times in the last month and rate it an excellent find.

It's convenient to the city centre, has (limited) complimentary car parking and is reasonably priced.

The rooms are a good size, too.  I've read some reviews suggesting you need a room high up or at the back to avoid street noise, but each time I've been at the front and had no noise at all through their triple-glazing.",4,2013,10,17
227,Comfortable stay in excellent location,"We stayed here with the car recently and made use of the hotel's own car park which we were able to book in advance at no extra charge.  The room was large, clean and comfortable and we were able to check in early which was a bonus for us.  We managed to get a deal on line which included continental breakfast which was more than adequate for our needs.  It was wonderful to have everything we wanted to see within easy walking distance.  A lucky find for us!!",4,2013,10,12
227,Location makes it worth consideration,"This hotel is a couple of blocks from Grafton St. and St. Stephen's Green so it worked out very well for a couple of days sightseeing in Dublin.  It is not a modern hotel but our room was large and clean although somewhat noisy facing a very busy side street.  More than adequate breakfast in a ""temporary"" basement location and helpful front desk staff. Very good value and no major complaints.",4,2013,10,10
227,A pleasant surprise...,"This very central hotel wasn't on my radar til now. There are cheaper but for the €109 I paid (inc. breakfast) I'm very pleased with my stay here. 

Check in was friendly. Staff were very helpful to some tourists. The room was amply appointed and clean. Proper toiletries provided. Breakfast was fine too.

Good job. ",4,2013,10,07
227,Budget hotel in great location!,"I stayed here for 3 nights whilst at a conference in Dublin Castle. 

Room: My room was on the 5th floor which personally I really liked. It was a large twin room, presumably disabled as there was a lot of floor space and handles in the bathroom. The bed was hard but the duvet was really warm. There were tea / coffee making facilities, a TV, an iron / ironing board to use if you asked at reception (they kindly put it in my room whilst I was out for dinner). 

The shower was a trickle and it did not go as hot as I would have like it. There were little shampoo, conditioner and body lotion bottles to use, as well as a large shower gel on the wall which was great because I had forgotten my own things. Towels got changed everyday which in my opinion is unnecessary but at least the room was clean.

I was not too bothered by noise as other posts mentioned. The window had an extra window to seal off any noise from the street, plus on the 5th floor I am sure that helped. One night I was woken by a boiler-type noise but I fell back to sleep easily enough.

Breakfast: There was a nice choice for breakfast; hot drinks, cereals, juices, pastries, toast, hot food (I had the smoked salmon and scrambled eggs), and much more which I did not try – all were great. 

Location: The location of this hotel is really great – it is easy to walk to all the essential places.

Staff: Everybody I spoke to was very friendly and always happy to help. We were even allowed to keep our suitcases behind the front desk after checkout until we were ready to go to the airport. They were also great at ordering taxis for us.

Hotel: Overall, the hotel is in need of a renovation. However, I felt secure with the key card door from the front lobby into the lift area. The room cost me ~66 euros per night including breakfast for my twin room. It is a budget hotel (for a city) in a great central location – I would give my stay 4 stars for being a 3-star establishment, only losing a star on the few negative points mentioned above. Thank you for a lovely stay.",4,2013,10,07
227,"Nice location, but not as nice as we expected.","A nice website does not guarantee a great place.  The staff was most accommodating, but could not make up for an older establishment sorely in need of renovation.  The rooms were clean, but small.  Breakfast in their temporary room was nicely done.  Overall, lodging was terribly overpriced.  If we hadn't had so much luggage, we would have re-located.",2,2013,10,01
227,Our 1st Trip to Ireland,"Arrived in Ireland for a 7 week vacation, 12 days in Ireland, 12 in Scotland and balance in Paris.
Several rounds of golf scheduled.
Picked up our Hertz rental car with no problem, Found the hotel with our GPS  Our flight landed at 5:30 a.m. Hotel room not ready but they stored our luggage.  Later that day we checked in..........room was comfortable and a very convenient location.  Only problem, when the bars close at night,  you can expect about 2 hours of screaming, loud music and NO SLEEP.  Suggested to the desk clerk that they should call the police........said he would, noise continued each night.
Breakfast was nice, friendly service and plenty of choices.",4,2013,09,28
227,Abruptly Awakened by Aggressive Banging of Door in Middle of Night,"We stayed 4 nights at the hotel.The receptionist was friendly and helpful. The lift had been modernised and improved efficiency.  On entering the room we noticed there was some renovation done since we last stayed a couple of years ago. The windows were changed to new double windows.The curtains also closed perfectly. The twin beds were comfortable.  However the room had no air-condition and it was rather hot and traffic noise almost the whole night when we had no choice but to open the window for some fresh air. The next day we made a complaint and the guy at the reception promptly brought in a standing fan which made our sleep a tad better.

However, there was absolutely no improvement in the sound proof of the room, where the closing of doors of neighbouring rooms were clearly audible at all times.  The worst came when we were abruptly awakened by a long, loud and aggressive banging of door of a neighbouring room. It lasted about 10 minutes and was scary.  It spoilt our night of sleep.  

Another annoying point was the unreliable and poor quality magnetic key cards, and had to be repeatedly reprogrammed and replaced at the reception counter.  The was the same problem I had when I stayed here a couple of years ago. This had grossly inconvenienced the staying guests.

The only plus point is the location of the hotel which is close proximity to all shopping areas and restaurants.",3,2013,09,26
227,Excellent location - clean and friendly !,"We had a lovely one week stay at The Drury Court Hotel. 
We had a couple of minor issues with the room that were dealt with quickly and helpfully by the staff. 
We really enjoyed eating at Fallon and Byrne - 2 mins from the hotel.",5,2013,09,25
227,Very Good Location,"We stayed 4 nights in this small conveniently located hotel in Dublin.  Because of our flight from the states, we arrived early.  We could not get into our rooms, which was understandable, but most frustrating since we had been on two long flights, and were really too tired to do much sightseeing at that time.
The room was clean, but quite small.  The staff at the front was mixed as far as friendliness, but the housekeeping staff was very helpful.  Internet was mostly not.  There was a password, then there wasn't a password, and it was iffy either way.
The restaurant/bar was being renovated, and there was some noise on one of the days we were there. We did not have the breakfasts.  It was quite warm in our room, even with the windows open, there is no air conditioning.
The best part of this hotel is that it is across the street from the Hairy Lemon.  A great little restaurant with delicious, well presented food, and a great waitstaff.",3,2013,09,20
227,Great Location,"Stayed two nights over weekend.  The hotel is in a great location for walking to Graffton Street, Temple Bar, St Stephens Green, and Trinity College.  It is surrounded by amazing restaurants. A great pub, The Hairy Lemon, is stumbling distance away.  The rooms are functional and a little outdated.  We had a room on the second floor right above the main entrance and if we left the windows open our room filled with cigarette smoke.  I would definitely stay here again but would ask for a room that doesn't face the main street.",4,2013,09,11
227,Average Hotel in downtown Dublin!,We stayed 3 nights at this hotel.  The Hotel location is what makes this hotel worth the high price. It is centrally located and an easy walk to everything in Dublin.  The interior of the hotel is outdated and our room had a musty smell with old cosmetics and an old mattress.  We were glad they let us check in early.  The staff was hit or miss on their friendliness.  Most times we felt they didn't care about us a bit when we had a question or asked for advice.  The internet is very inconsistent as well and didn't work most the time.,4,2013,09,09
227,"Above average location, some shortcomings","Stayed for a long weekend after a 5-day brewery excursion. Stayed on 4th floor of 5 with two twin beds. No room safe, UK-style AC outlets, large closet with spare comforters but only four hangers (more supplied upon request). Large, soft cotton bath towels. Bathroon with no ceiling fan. Beds were average and there was no noticable room-to-room noise. Didn't  try (wake up for) breakfast.

TV with few stations and some commercial radio stations.
Some alley noise when adjacent bars empy billions of glass bottles at 7 am. And beer keg delivers g=begin at 7:30. No airconditioning so open windows for sooler air also let in alley noise. Tiny lobby has pay-as-you-go PC for Internet access. Room WiFi was completely unreliable.

Accalimed Bia Bar on ground flloor was closed beginning September for renovation. Noise from that renovation was eveident in some rooms. 

Friendly staff and great location for Stephens Green and Tourism Office (and friendly bars) mean I night consider again in the future.",4,2013,09,08
227,Centrally located quality hotel,"We stayed at Drury Ct for three nights in early September.... hotel was as expected..... excellent central location a few minutes walk from Trinity College, Grafton Street, Temple Bar district,St Stephen's Green ,....   Rooms were spacious and spotlessly clean....  Check in is 3:00 PM so don't be surprised when you arrive after a long trans-Atlantic flight.... 
Did not try the breakfast but the Metro Cafe and Butler's Chocolate Cafe are excellent within 2 blocks.  The Hairy Lemon pub across the street is a superb restaurant disguised as a pub.  Highly reccomend it.  ",4,2013,09,07
227,Helpful Staff,"It was unfortunate that in the 2 days that we were there, the lifts were not working most of the time. The apartment was comfortable, although the bathroom needs updating. The exhaust fan was not working and some lights had to be replaced whilst we were there. With 5 persons in the apartment, there wasn't enough facilities to hang our wet towels.
Apart from the few downsides, the hotel was conveniently located and restaurants/pubs were all within walking distance from the hotel. 
The staff was commendably helpful with info we required.",4,2013,09,07
227,Exceptional Staff,"Great location in Dublin for a pretty decent price. What sold me was the staff. We took a red eye flight and arrived at the hotel at 10am, well before the 3pm check in time. The staff was more than helpful and let us check in early, it was really appreciated. Rooms are a little dated but overall room and bathroom were clean.",3,2013,09,06
227,more than a good location,"I like this place very much. Staff friendly and management is top class.
 I had an excellent room. Breakfast was ok with a nice choice to eat indoors or outside- now that is nice. Carparking is excellent. On leaving, I was told what I should ""demand"" on my next trip; this is what i call doing good business for hotel and customer. I need hardly tell you that I plan to return",5,2013,08,29
227,"Great location, lovely staff","Perfect location, very clean and reasonably appointed rooms. The price was right !!!! And the breakfast was a great, classic Irish breakfast. We could walk any and everywhere from there. 
The staff was nice and helpful, and very accommodating when it came to getting our rooms suitable for the number of people in our group. Internet worked fine. A/C worked. Absolutely no complaints. Recommended hotel. ",5,2013,08,21
227,Perfect location,"Stayed in an apartment here for 2 nights on a hen weekend. Fantastic location- near the shops and lots of nice cafes and bars within walking distance. Easy walking distance to temple bar too. Good sized rooms, towels and toiletries supplied. Couldn't have asked for better!",4,2013,08,11
227,Very Pleased,This has my first visit to Dublin and was traveling alone. This hotel was recommended to me as a safe place in a good location.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The room was small but adequate. Best of all is the location. Very safe for a lone traveler.  I did not eat at the restaurant as I wanted to walk around the area.  I would definitely stay there again if I return to Dublin.,4,2013,07,21
227,Great location in the heart of Dublin,"This hotel was perfect for our first two days after arriving from the US.  The staff was very accommodating and allowed us to store our luggage until we could check in (~4 hours).  We took the bus into the city from the airport and then rented a car upon our departure.  This hotel is centrally located to everything I wanted to see and do in Dublin, i.e. Trinity College, walking tours, Temple Bar district, Medieval area, Guinness Storehouse, and great dining. The adjacent eatery/bar was a good breakfast spot.  Also, a coffee and tea house are next door.  I highly recommend this hotel.",4,2013,07,17
227,Very happy with my stay,"I stayed here for two nights while stopping in Dublin before heading west.  The hotel is in a great location, I was jet lagged and not feeling 100% so I came back the my room to regroup 3 times during my day of exploring Dublin, it's so central.  I had a room with a full size bed, it was about half the size of a hotel room in the states, but was very clean and comfortable.  I was on the 3rd floor, and the music from the pub across the street was pretty loud when I had the window open, but very quiet once I closed both sets of windows (they have extra interior windows which really cut the sound).  The wifi was free and fast, which I have come to truly appreciate after staying in way too many places (Hilton!) where I've paid $10 per device for basically dial up.",4,2013,07,15
227,"Nice hotel, friendly staff","Great location, busy weekend, staff excellent, especially David the Manager. Car parking sorted out with minimum fuss. handing out directions and friendly chat from all the staff. Triple glazing helped with noise. It would be beneficial to book your parking space before you travel.",5,2013,07,08
227,Location is key to this hotel,"The hotel is in a really good location for tourists.  It is within walking distance of a number of Dublin sites (Trinity College, Grafton Street, museums, Temple Bar area, etc.).  It's also close to a Wagamama (yeah!) and a TGI Friday's (not what I wanted to see on an Irish vacation).  It's only a few blocks away from a bus stop that you can take to/from airport.  Just use Google Maps to look at Street View to get your bearings on the way to walk to the hotel.  I was wandering around on a Sunday morning looking for the place.  Dublin streets aren't on a grid system!

The room was clean, and for Europe the room was good sized.  Bed was a little hard.  Lots of closet space. It faced the street and there was street noise, especially in the morning.  Two complaints.  First, not enough plugs around the desk.  Second, the bathroom had a temporary shower curtain (one of those rods with a spring that pushes the ends into the wall to support it).  That came down on me while I got out of the shower. I had to have the hotel put it back up as I couldn't get it to stay.  Guess the hotel's not sure this showering craze is going to hold.

Overall price was good.  I thought it was a good value for the dollar (euro?).

I only ate in the attached restaurant/bar for breakfast.  It was pretty good.  Not the best I had in Ireland (that would be Castlewood House in Dingle) but not bad.

Again, the biggest selling point on the hotel is the location.",4,2013,07,01
227,Very nice hotel,"We stayed in Drury Court hotel 14-17 June, I had booked fairly last minute and I had not realized how busy it was in  Dublin that time. I would say that for 3 star hotel it is very comfortable, clean and excellently located. Very convenient for a week-end trip in Dublin, a walking distance for everything. Also breakfast was nice and served in their bar downstairs (which was a nice spot for a drink in the evening as well actually!). We had breakfast included in our room price and that also included cooked breakfast which was nice. Service very friendly and helpful. Some reviewers have mentioned noise from the street, we did not have that trouble. To be recommended for sure!",4,2013,07,01
227,The Location is great.,"Our family of 4 stayed in Apt 36 for 2 nights this June.  It was fine for our purposes and really a great location to Grafton street, Trinity College and restaurants and pubs.  The apartment was very large; 3 bedrooms each with full size bed, full kitchen with laundry and a living room.  The kitchen was fully stocked with appropriate dishes, utensils and cleaning items like laundry soap for the washing machine.  The kitchen was clean but not sparkling clean, in fact it looked old and tired and at first glance it looked dirty, but as you got closer you could see it was older and there were stains on the stove that probably would not come out. There were no directions for using the washing machine that also doubled as a dryer, so we left with wet clothes.  
The bathroom was clean and the shower worked well.  The apartment was quiet, in the back of the building and the beds were comfortable. You should know that the apartments are in a separate building from the hotel, just 2 doors down from the hotel lobby.  My father was staying in a room at the hotel so it was a bit inconvenient to have to be in 2 separate buildings.  
The breakfast was very good, typical continental choices, it was in the restaurant on the ground floor of the hotel. Service was pretty good, not great.
For whatever reason, the apartment booking is a non-refundable booking, while the hotel room could be canceled and refunded, so be sure of your dates before you book.",4,2013,06,27
227,London Jackeen,"The Drury Court is probably in the best location for a weekend visit to Dublin. Situated at the top of Grafton street is located amongst some of the best pubs, cafes and restaurants on offer. 
The room was basic and very clean, perfect for our needs. The street below was a bit noisy at night but this did not bother us too much.",4,2013,06,24
227,Worth a visit,"Excellent location, attended a function there, staff were very friendly and genuinely cared in particular Paul who resolved an error I had made. I would recommend the Drury Court Hotel for all for their attentive and warm service.",5,2013,06,17
227,Shocking - don't stay in their apartments,"My husband and I recently stayed in apartment 43 of this hotel and it was very disappointing to say the least. 
Shortly after surveying our room/ apartment my husband phoned reception to ask if we could leave but were told that as we had prepaid we would not be refunded!
The apartment was very shabby - shower was broken - bracket broken off the wall & actual electric shower unit broken, mould on shower screen, lounge curtains hanging off hooks, badly matched furniture, broken lamps, burn mark on bedside unit etc. etc. 
I don't know if these apartments are leased out to the Drury court or owned by them but never the less they are shabby & badly neglected and don't give the hotel a good impression.  
The staff were friendly, but a bit inexperienced. 
We travel to Dublin often & all the usual hotels were fully booked so we had no choice to stay here. We will never stay there again!",2,2013,06,14
227,"Great location, quiet in back rooms, excellent Cust Service.","Simple clean rooms. Very good help by front desk staff. Sleek modern bar/ restaurant with excellent breakfast and coffee. Great pastries. Easy Walking distance to park, shopping and many Pubs. My family and I stayed in two rooms and would recommend highly.",4,2013,06,08
227,Excellent Location/Excellent Value/,"I recently stayed (5th June) at this small hotel in a very central location just minutes from the Gaiety Theatre. You are less than 5 minutes from Grafton Street. This hotel is very simple. The staff are extremely helpful with a smile. The room was a good size, very clean with nice bathroom accessories. The hotel has a bar with a door leading directly from the small lobby. It serves simple and relatively limitied options. Other than breakfast and lunch it is not suitable for dinner. It is a large bar with a little bit of a walk downstairs to the bathroom. Again, the staff were very friendly and efficient. We ate breakfast on the morning of our departure, one full Irish breakfast and one scrambled egg with salmon. Served hot and very tasty. Coffee needs to be upgraded. I like a good strong 'hot' mug of coffee in the morning. I will certainly return.",4,2013,06,07
227,"VERY Large room, excellent location, good value.","My wife and I stayed here our last 3 nights in the UK of a two week holiday and couldn't have been happier with the hotel. The room was large, the facilities clean and well organized. The bar downstairs served wonderful breakfast, and even better drinks. Temple Bar is WELL within walking distance, and even the Jameson and Guiness facilities are a generous walk away. The room was quiet, and we were lucky enough to get to park for free our 2nd and 3rd evenings. The hotel has limited parking, but if you ask and a spot opens they will hold it for you.",4,2013,06,05
227,Decent weekend city stay,"First night - room was extremely warm but as it was a fri night the hotel bar entertainment noise meant we couldn't keep the window open. 
Twin room (2 beds - bigger than singles, which was great), was spacious, had adequate facilities (no biscuits for tea and coffee!!)
Breakfast was good. Staff very helpfuul and pleasant. 
Only problem was access to wifi from an apple device! The free wifi is great however i was not told that in order to use the internet on my iphone, i had to go to a specific web link to log in. I only discovered this on leaving as other guests were enquiring about it. I thought the problem lay with my own phone. Was very disappointed to not have use of the free wifi advertised as i tried constantly since arriving. i hope the hotel take my advice about puttting a sign up to notify guests of this. 
Thank you for a pleasant stay, would visit again. ",3,2013,06,02
227,"excellent choice, best location!","Staff checked us in about 9am...very lucky!  Rooms were quite big by Euro standards, new, and clean with large bathrooms! best location midway between Grafton St and Temple Bar. After a week I cant imagine a better location. Very good neighborhood if you want to walk to everything!",5,2013,06,01
227,"Great location, Good Value","My wife and I chose Drury Court because it was central enough that we could walk everywhere, but it was far enough away from Temple Bar to avoid loud crowds making noise after midnight.  It was also less costly than many of the other hotels in the area.  We arrived in Dublin on an early flight and stopped by the hotel to drop our bags.  They allowed us to check into the hotel at 9 am instead of waiting until 3 pm since the room had already been vacated.  Each time we asked the staff questions, they gave great information and were amazingly courteous. 

The room was not extravagant, but it was clean and was larger than many I've stayed in.  We would use it for a base again if we are back in Dublin.",5,2013,05,29
227,first choice for location,"the hotel is very very central you can walk to almost anywhere.The rooms are different from each other but not very small.They're very clean.Didnt use the restaurant but heard that it was also good.The hotel is preferrable also for security reasons,too.",4,2013,05,28
227,This is our new home in Dublin!,"We were told by Dubliners to stay in south Dublin, so it was all about LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION for us.....we found the perfect location with the Drury Court Hotel.  We were steps to Powerscourt (shopping & JIG), Trinity College (The Book of Kells) Grafton Street & St. Stephen's Green. We were also a quick walk to the Temple Bar Area....and I was so glad that we were NOT staying in Temple Bar (it reminded me of Paris' Latin Quarter).   Our hotel was quiet.  The staff was helpful, kind and very attentive.  The Bia Bar served the included breakfast which was fine.  The staff at the Bia were also very accommodating making their special of the previous day on the following day per my request..... Our only complaint was there was a heating pump or something that ran up the side of our room (402) and made quite a  racket from time to time.... Our room had a double and single bed and a pull out couch.  It was more than adequate for a family.   They do have rooms with air conditioners but you must request in advance.  We will be back!",5,2013,05,26
227,"Good value, central location","This is a well situated, basic hotel. It's an easy walk to all the key Dublin sights. No frills or charm but very good value for the money.  Breakfast was included in our rate, which was convenient and basic. Quite helpful staff, would stay here again. ",4,2013,05,24
227,Location & Service!,"We arrived to the Hotel at 10am in hopes of an early check in so we could freshen up from our long flight. Check out is not until noon so we knew there was a chance they could not get us in. The young lady at the front desk checked if our room was ready but it was not. She felt bad knowing the long flight we had so she offered us a complimentary coffee at the Bia Bar. This was so very much appreciated! About an hour later my wife checked to see if we could possibly get in and to our surprise or room was ready! This was such a relief considering we had a full day ahead of us.

We arrived to room 305 and we were very pleasantly surprised. The room was very spacious and had all of the amenities we needed. We did have to call for an iron and iron board but they were brought to the room very quickly! We had 2 twin beds, a small table with 2 chairs, desk, flat screen t.v., closet & hangers, luggage chest & a very large bathroom. It was everything we expected and it was very clean. Being in the industry I am looking for a few things that make or break my experience at a hotel. 

I look for good customer service and a clean and tidy room to lay my head at the end of a long day of sight seeing. Both of these items exceeded both mine and my wife's expectations. The staff was always friendly and very responsive to our needs and the beds and pillows were very comfortable which is rare for us to find. We had the opportunity to speak with who we believed to be the hotels General Manager. He was very nice and seemed to genuinely care for his guests and it shows through the responses I have read here on Trip Advisor. I greatly enjoyed speaking with him and can see why the hotels customer service is what it is.

I did read some people that complained about the noise. To be honest it really was not that bad in our room. If you slept with the windows open yes it can be a bit noisy. We always just closed them before bed and had no issues. There was only one night that other guests were loud but that's no fault to the hotel. I could see how the noise might be an issue in the summer months when warmer. There didn't seem to be any air conditioning so if you had to keep the windows open that might effect sleep a little. 

I did like how they offered small amenities for the bathroom as well as larger pump bottles in the shower and at the sink. Participating in any green efforts are always something that shows a hotel/resort cares a little more than the next. 

My only real complaints were with the bathroom sink and the shower water pressure. It was very difficult to wash your hands, brush your teeth or wash your face at the sink. The hot and cold each have their own faucet so you had to keep swapping between scolding hot and bitter cold. It was almost easier to take a full shower than just wash up before bed. Not really sure what can be done about the water pressure but it is very low in the shower. Neither of these items would stop me from staying in the future but they were a bit annoying.

We did have breakfast at the Bia Bar one morning as well as lunch one day. We did not have the buffet but rather ordered off the menu. We had eggs, toast and hash browns and it was very good and very quick! It's was the least expensive meal I believe we had during our entire stay in Dublin. Lunch we had a few pints of Guinness and we each had one of their stone oven pizzas. They were very delicious and the Guinness as always was soooooo good!

I have to say that we could not have asked for a better location! It was close enough to walk to just about everything and anything. It was however far enough away from the Temple Bar area so we were not effected by the noise and partying that you find as you get closer. You get the best of both worlds with the location of Drury Court Hotel!

All in all we were very pleased with our experience. We would definitely stay here again if in Dublin during the same time of year. I think the fact that there was no air conditioning might have us looking for a different hotel if visiting when warmer. 

Thank you for an amazing experience that we will never forget!
",4,2013,05,17
227,Great value for money,"I used to live in Dublin many years ago. Coming back to Dublin has always been a great pleasure. This was the first time I stayed at the Drury Court Hotel and I must say that I was very pleased with my stay. I have stayed at a few other hotels in the city centre but this one is definitely a well-recommended place to stay. The location is very central, the cleanliness is excellent, the room & bathroom were quite roomy compared to other hotels (4 & 5 stars included) . They have all the basics but nothing fancy. We went down for breakfast but The breakfast was very standard. Overall, it is a great value for money.",4,2013,05,17
227,"Great value, location and quality","I chose this hotel based on location and other reviews and I wasn't disappointed.  It it situated on a quiet street off the main pedestrian walkways, but is very close to a lot of restaurants and shopping.  Only a couple of blocks away from the St. Stephen's Green, as well as the Grafton Street shopping area, it is an ideal location for a tourist who wants to explore Dublin.  The room was clean, updated and very quiet, and also includes free wifi (a bonus!).  The pub attached tot he hotel is also excellent and had the best live music I heard during my entire trip to Ireland...make sure you check it out!  I would definitely stay here again on my next visit to Dublin.",4,2013,05,16
227,lost laundry,"I spent 5 nights at the Drury Court.  I  would have rated it an average hotel, spartan but clean and safe.  However this was my experience.  I had entrusted  to them 4 days of laundry  and it was lost or thrown away.  While they admitted total responsibility for the loss, the compensation did not cover the cost of undergarments.  I was traveling with a carry on only, and did not have a lot of clothing options. I spent approximately 250 Euro to replace basic items and was compensated 80 Euro.  I submitted receipts but get not response.",1,2013,05,15
227,"Very good location, clean and nice.","Good value, location, location, location. You are close to ""everything"", The room were larger than expected. staff very friendly

227,Thank You!,"Great hotel in a central location.  My friend and I stayed here while attending a concert in the Olympia Theatre and the hotel is walking distance from the venue with very reasonable room rates and ever helpful staff.  Big shout out to Emma who nice enough to post me back my wallet, which I had misplaced in a taxi! :-)",5,2013,05,14
227,Great central hotel,"We booked this hotel because of its location, walking distance to most of the sights and the old town.  The reception staff were all welcoming and friendly and very helpful.  The rooms were much larger than we expected with everything spotlessly clean.  Breakfast in the adjoining bistro was good and plentiful.  We had lunch there one day as well, and the food was good.  We had a very pleasant stay.",4,2013,05,09
227,Nice Central Location,This hotel was recommended by a friend from Cork and suited our needs nicely.  We had a one day layover from Spain and wanted to do a little sightseeing in the city.  The adjoining restaurant was perfect for breakfast in the morning.,4,2013,05,07
227,Great Dublin Hotel,"What can I say - great hotel, great price and great location. Clean, modern and extremely comfortable hotel. We stayed in room 401 and room was huge. Staff very friendly and couldn't do enough for you. Right on the door step of Temple Bar area but far enough away not to be kept awake with all the loud music. We paid £84 for room and full Irish breakfast for the 2 of us through Travel Republic. Absolute bargain and a must if you want a good decent hotel in Dublin! ",5,2013,04,28
227,Good location,"This hotel was a pleasant surprise. The room was much larger than I expected and very clean. The staff seemed to be sincerely interested in making  sure the quests were happy. The hotel is in a very good location and many of the tourist sites are within easy walking distance.  There's  a nice selection of restaurants, Pubs and shopping areas close to the hotel. Also, a pickup point for the Hop On-Hop Off Tour is only about two blocks away",4,2013,04,27
227,Great base camp,Feels more like a motel than hotel. Very nice staff. Rooms average standard. A very central location if staying in Dublin. You are in Temple Bar. Close to all concert venues. And it's easy to get out of the city from here. ,5,2013,04,27
227,Good location for exploring Dublin,We spent 3 nights.  A great location within walking distance of most attractions.  Very clean rooms.  Had an excellent dinner at The Hairy Lemon across the street (go for the lamb shanks and chocolate Guinness dessert.,4,2013,04,20
227,Excellent Location - Great Team,"We were met by Emma on arrival - a most fantastic asset to the team at Drury Court - very helpful and friendly throughout our stay - Thank you Emma

Unfortunately our stay this time was a very short one but we will certainly be returning in the very near future.

This hotel is in a perfect location for anyone visiting Dublin - approx. 1 minute from Grafton Street.  Limited hotel parking available very convenient to the hotel but not directly accessible from the hotel itself.

The rooms are spacious, very clean and surprisingly quiet considering the location - thank you to the accommodation team.

We did not dine in the hotel this time but had light breakfast before leaving the following morning in the bar area.  

Thank you again to all - will certainly recommend and I look forward to my next visit",4,2013,04,10
227,Will definitely stay again!,"Was really happy with this hotel....I had a really early arrival into the airport and arrived at the hotel at 10.45am asking if I could leave my bag there for the day until check-in. I was informed that my room was ready and I could go straight there! What a relief, as I had been up since 3am so I went to my room for a 3 hour nap!! The room was perfectly adequate, the only disturbance during the night being from the elephants running up and down the corridor and slamming doors. I did wake up also due to being too cold but the radiator was adjustable. I wasn't informed of breakfast even though when I booked it I was told there was a free breakfast, so I can't comment on this.  Excellent location being at the bottom of Grafton Street. Just watch the taxis, I was charged 13 euros to go on a 1 mile journey to Christchurch which I could have walked in 15 minutes (but didn't want to)!!",5,2013,04,07
227,very nice hotel and friendly staff,the hotel was very nce and in a very good location. It is very close to the city centre. We had booked triple room and it was large and convinient for 3. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was good enough.The bia bar is a very nice place for a relaxing coffee.,5,2013,04,03
227,Dublin is great for walking,Hotel is nicely located v central making Dublin easily walkable and pleasant. Car parking available but do check. Breakfast was the worst aspect and is not to be recommended unless you are realty stuck and prefer the convenience. Variable everyday yet its the same basic fare. also terrible was the room lighting hopeless for night reading. Otherwise superbly friendly hard working staff keep this place going. Very good sized rooms n bathroom with plenty of hot water for baths with only one ceiling light. Very warm rooms and well double glazed from street noises which is just as well as digging up main roads outside was frequent during my stay starting at 6 pmish till very late. Tv ok although I had to ask for retune so as to get what is says is offered. ,4,2013,04,01
227,will def stay here again!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Booked a nite here at this hotel with my husband an child, have to say we were very happy with the central location an the staff could not of been more helpful will def be goin back!!! def would recommend this hotel, the room was large enough, comfortable an very clean.",4,2013,03,19
227,Great location and fantastic staff,"We booked a three bedroom apartment which was a separate building from the hotel but on the same street. We felt like we still received hotel treatment, our beds were made and fresh towels were put in the apartment every day, they even washed up anything left in the kitchen. I wouldn't expect this in a self-catering apartment. Even upon arrival they left a bottle of wine and still and sparkling water for us. 

One of the bedrooms had problems with the heating, they sent someone straight away to look at it and provided a plug in heater although this ended up not working either. They offered all six of us free breakfast and the heating problem was fixed the next day. 

I would really recommend this hotel or the apartments run by the hotel to anyone looking for a city break in Dublin. You can walk to most of the main attractions and taxi's across the city are not that expensive, only a short walk to the shops and Temple Bar.",5,2013,03,19
227,Absolutely fantastic hotel,"The location is incredible in the dead center of Dublin. It is a short walk away from the major sites to see in Dublin. The staff was extremely helpful and I was incredibly impressed with how cheap the hotel really was. Not only that, but your room key is good for a discount the next time you stay there so it is highly recommended to stay there any time you are in Dublin. Definitely a place you must stay in.",5,2013,03,12
227,Birthday Break,"Good clean hotel with excellent staff. Centrally positioned.
The rooms are large enough and comfortable with all the amenities you require for a pleasant stay.
Couple be a little noisy if you don't close the double glazing.

When I'm back in Dublin this place will be used again.",4,2013,02,25

227,Great Hotel,"Nice hotel, ideal central location, pleasant staff, convenient room. This is a great base to explore what Dublin has to offer. Good choice at breakfast ( continental / full Irish and vegetarian ) + a mini buffet ( cereals, yogurt, variety of juices, toast,  ham & cheese )... 
I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to family & friends and will most certainly use it again in the near future. Great experience.",5,2013,02,20
227,A good hotel in a great location,"Stayed in this hotel with a group of Lads over for the Ireland Vs England International. Hotel was very good, breakfast good, location excellent. Room rate was 'loaded' a little due to the Rugby but to be expected. No problems recommending.",4,2013,02,14
227,Excellent Choice for City Centre Night Out,"I have stayed here twice during nights out and have not been disappointed.  It is a short stroll to Grafton Street area, you have pubs, restaurants and theatres literally on the doorstep.  i liked this hotel as its quiet, comfortable and clean.  The rates were excellent €78 for a triple room!! Our last stay was mid January.  The lift was broken but we were offered help with our bags.  Room was on top floor so i requested a lower floor and that was no problem.  The room was clean, as was the bathroom, and beds very comfortable.  I would highly recommend.",5,2013,02,07
227,A night in Dublin,"This hotel is located in the heart of Dublin city (and a very good/quite area).  I had booked a number of rooms for a family dinner in Dublin and the rates were excellent value.
On the day the lift was broken but staff were on hand to carry bags if required.
Rooms were spacious, comfortable and clean.
Great location for all types of breaks, be it shopping, party or tourism.",4,2013,02,06
227,""" I made a good choice to come here""","Other reviews persuaded me and my party to come here-we were not disappointed.
Didnt arrive till approx midnight and heating in one room was faulty but call to reception got quick response and fault was rectified.
Very well positioned for access to Temple Bar and city attractions. Not too far to walk to get to a stop on the On-Off bus service which I would highly recommend for first time visitors like ourselves.
Staff very customer friendly and breakfasts served very quickly although I thought the Full Irish breakfast could have been Fuller.
Good choice and no regrets.",4,2013,02,05
227,Perfect location and staff! One or two minor niggles,"The first thing to say about this hotel is that the location is perfect. Everything is within walking distance to this place - the nearest shopping centre is literally two minutes away.Temple Bar is about 10 minutes away, as is Grafton Street and St Stephen's Green. It's literally slap bang in the middle and made the entire stay a lot more enjoyable.

There are also good bars literally next door - the attached Bia Bar was really nice (breakfast served here too) and the Hairy Lemon Pub opposite was also amazing. Obviously bear in mind drinking in Dublin will never be cheap.

The hotel allowed us to drop our bags off early in the morning and we then picked them back up at check-in. A very smooth process all in all. The key cards to be able to access the hotel from reception and the rooms themselves were extremely reliable. 

The hotel has recently had a new lift installed which we had no problems with at all. We were given room 201 which was spatious and had the new triple-glazing installed. This does an amazing job at keeping out noises from outside the hotel. Makes a massive difference. The downside to the window was a faulty catch which meant it was sometimes hard to open the window.

However, we were awoken at various times by noises from inside the hotel which sounded like they were coming from the plumbing system. Be it the central heating, the toilet, or coming from the room next door (we couldn't quite put our finger on it), there were some very strange noises. There was also a loud vibration a couple of times which we assumed was the lift. We could also hear the music coming from the Bia Bar on the Saturday night, so rooms on higher floors would have been better. 
We also found the central heating quite hard to ""get right"" using the radiator thermostats - and again, they were rather noisy when the heat was on.

The bed was a little hard for my liking, but I like it unusually soft. The bathroom was also large and included a bath with shower over. The shower itself was OK but it wasn't really powerful enough for me and I also had to set it to the maximum temperature for it to be hot enough. This is contrary to the bath which was red hot and filled up in no time which didn't seem to coincide. The downside to the bathroom is a lack of extractor fan as the mirror steamed up very quickly.

TV was good (had an EPG and teletext) but the remote was a little unreliable. We didn't use the Wi-fi, phone, or room service.

In terms of the breakfast, we had it included in our room rate and it was a good thing. At 9 Euros for the full breakfast, it was very expensive as you didn't get much at all. I had the full Irish one day and the smoked salmon the day after.

In terms of the staff, we couldn't fault anyone. EVERYONE was very friendly and helpful (from the cleaners, to reception staff, to breakfast staff) so the hotel has to be commended for this. The room was cleaned twice during our stay with a professional finish.

All in all, would we stay here again - the excellent location and staff make it a no-brainer!",4,2013,02,04
227,A couple of days in Dublin,"and this smallish hotel is situated in the middle of the shopping area with easy access to everything. either walking or hop on off busses. 
I stayed with my daughter and we had a nice spacious an clean twin room. 
Reception very kind and helpful with both printing out boarding passes and taxi to the airport- fixed price from the hotel, 25euro! 
Free wifi throghout the hotel - but not totally reelable. This being the only shadow!  
Would return!",4,2013,02,02
227,great value central hotel,this hotel is 5 minutes from temple bar and trinity college it's really central and within walking distance to most of the attractions.we dropped off our bags at the hotel at 10am and these were ticketed an  put behind reception. we returned at 5pm to check in (check in is 3pm) and check in was speedy.we got the lift to floor three and it seemed to drop then we were stuck for a few minutes which was pretty scary we pressed the alarm a few times and the lift started again. we never got back in the lift instead taking the stairs. our room 301 was spacious and we were quite impressed as we only paid 86 euros for 2 nights. we did not spend  a lot of time in our room as we were busy sight seeing but it was ideal. a lovely big bathroom with lots of hot water. we liked the teas and coffees from Bewleys a famous coffee shop.we ate in the hotel bia bar once-see seperate review.,4,2013,01,31
227,Great location,"A good hotel at a reasonable price. A great location for access to the city centre. The hotel is clean, comfortable and offers a good breakfast. My room was on the 5th floor and was spacious clean and had comfy beds. The bar in the hotel seems to be good and busy but didn't get a chance to enjoy it. Very handy to access the beautiful St. Stephens Green.",4,2013,01,26
227,Great hotel Would Return.,"This is a lovely hotel with good size rooms. Good bar to have a drink in the evening and lovely cooked breakfast in the mornings, staff are also pleasant and friendly. 

Good location in Dublin, highly recommended.",5,2013,01,25
227,noise no longer an issue,i have stayed in this hotel on numerous occasions and the location is great for some business i have to do around the city on occasion .only sometimes i had to stay on a Friday night in which i found i could hear alot off activity on the street but to my delight the hotel have started to fit  internal  windows i did notice a big difference in the room with the new internal windows .,4,2013,01,23
227,Perfect for a city break,"My four sisters and myself stayed here this month.  The location is perfect, so close to the shops and such a choice of really good restaurants nearby. The rooms were very spacious, comfortable and clean, and very quiet considering you are right in the centre of Dublin.  The staff are so friendly and helpful (the lift was out of order on the night of our stay and they insisted on carrying our bags to and from our rooms).  Free parking was an added bonus.  Would definitely recommend this hotel for a shopping/theatre break in the city. Excellent value for money.",5,2013,01,23
227,Great apartment for families,"We stayed in Drury Court's 3 bedroomed apartment which is adjacent to the hotel. Fantastic location, spacious and great value for money for a family of 6. The welcome was warm and car-parking was free. We will definitely return!",4,2013,01,21
227,Would stay here again!!,"I booked the hotel on line, with breakfast included. 
Hotel is in a great location, near grafton st & temple bar. Great pub opposite, the hairy lemon make sure you visit. 
Rooms are big, clean & comfortable.
Lifts not working, but the front desk staff were very apologetic.
Breakfast was nice, the full Irish was a bit small, would be my only gripe!
Would stay here again. ",5,2013,01,20
227,We will be back,My daughter and I stayed in this hotel this week and are both delighted to have found a centrally located hotel at a reasonable price. The staff were very helpful and friendly. The room was clean and the beds were comfortable. The bathroom was exceptional. The lift was out of order but two staff members gladly grabbed our bags and carried them to the fifth floor. We are thrilled to have found such a gem!,4,2013,01,15
227,Perfect location,"Thanks to David for his warm welcome to my daughters and I last Wednesday. We stayed for two nights and could not fault the hotel. It is perfectly located near shops, theatres and museums. Breakfast was plentiful and staff were happy to help and accommodate any of our queries. Being so perfectly located having two little ones made it an additional holiday for me we could come and go as we pleased. The children were fascinated by how close we were to all the amenities. Thanks to all the staff",4,2013,01,08
227,"Excellent location, nice room","We booked the drury court for a one night stay in January.  Got a great deal €75 per room.  The location of the hotel is excellent, very close to St Stephens Green, Templebar and Grafton Street. Staff were very helpful with recommendations for places to eat and where to go for live music.  Will definitely stay in the Drury Court again.  Only problem was the lift was not working but we were only on the 2nd floor so it was fine plus the reception staff offered assistance with bags at both check in and check out.",4,2013,01,05
227,Excellent Value and great location,"Really good value - nice and clean, good location.  Had read so many horror stories of being kept awake by noisy drinkers .... Not here..... Quiet back street but literally just a short walk from plenty of shops and attractions and only just off the bus route.  A great find.  Had a slight problem with a broken toilet as, which sadly was not rectified .....otherwise would thoroughly recommend.",4,2013,01,04
227,"Fair location, staff rude & not fit to be in the hospitality business.","The manager was curt, the staff members were not spontaneous or welcoming, plus the rooms are very average. Not recommended. 

When i went there, we had a lot of bags and the staff told us to put them behind the reception desk after notifying us that the rooms will only be ready by 2,3, or 4pm. There were tons of other bags and not enough room for walking. No proper storage, porter service, or concierge. They didn't even label the bags and other visitors could have just taken our bags while taking their own bags. 

Taking the elevator was also a very scary experience.",1,2013,01,03
227,lovely hotel.,"I stayed 1 night in room 505 .The room in on the top floor overlooking the side street.The room was clean and warm .No  air conditioning, Its Ireland you need central heating and it was on.The large  en suite bathroom was spotless .
Quick check in and they give you a little map of the area .
One lift /elevator but I prefer to use the stairs ,all five floors .
I always use the stairs in any hotel because you can tell how clean a place is by the stairs .The stairs was spotless .I didn't try the food .
Would use again .",5,2012,12,30
227,Fantastic location and staff,"Recently organised a corporate offsite and overnight stay in the Drury Court. From initial enquiry to the day itself, the reservations team were very helpful and organised. The bedrooms were spacious and well maintained. The food was great. All the staff were friendly and helpful. Overall, thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely recommend the hotel.",5,2012,11,28
227,Much better else where,"Old & worn hotel
Nice but a lot nicer around 
Pub beside is nice but just average on rooms & service. No receptionist there when we arrived but that was no biggy.just waited a while..
Really just the hotel needs updating! ",3,2012,11,25
227,Perfect location to explore Dublin,"I recently stayed at The Drury Court Hotel for one night and it was a perfect location for the event I was attending on Wexford Street.

The person at reception was very friendly and helpful.

The room was clean and very spacious and had a single and double bed in it and the bathroom was clean and spacious also had a good shower .
The bed was comfy and I slept well, so all round a good stay.

The hotels location is perfect for a person on a budget and also good for a person wanting to visit and explore Dublin city.",4,2012,11,19
227,Very friendly staff,"Stayed two nights in November sun,Mon got the bus from Dublin airport which stops on dame street hotel right next to temple bar drury court hotel is a few minutes walk from here . I purchased a three day rambler bus ticket  from a shop in airport costing 14 .50 euros ,it give you unlimited travel around Dublin and outskirts saving a small fortune plus you don't need to have the correct change in coins to purchase a ticket from the bus driver. The check in was very quick and smooth  I was given a room on the top floor it was a large room with two beds nice big bathroom with both shower/bath the tv had free veiw . Had breakfast each morning  full Irish very nice , the waiter refilled your coffee if you wonted . Free newspapers in breakfast lounge. Plenty of bars and resturants just outside hotel ,over all great location for exploding Dublin on settling my bill the receptionist said I  could have book my stay direct with them and they are offering a 10% discount just now I made my booking through late rooms pricing was very good so I will stay here again for sure . Hope this helps  ",4,2012,11,13

227,Good Enough,"Choosing a place to stay in Dublin for our last 3 days, of 10 day trip to Ireland, seemed a daunting task with all the choices.  We decided to stay at the Drury Court due to it's average place in the Trip Advisor ratings and reasonable cost.  As the other reviews attest, it is in a great location, in the heart of Dublin's tourist attractions.   We were staying in the middle of the week, and had a room on the 4th floor so noise was not an issue for us, but I can imagine the area can be quite loud on a busy weekend night.  The front desk staff was nice enough to let us check in an hour early to an available room, and they were professional through out our stay.  The one elevator seemed a bit dated and small, but worked well enough.  The room was of decent size and clean, beds comfortable.  The small flat screen tv was really too far from the beds for easy viewing, but we weren't there to watch tv, except for the morning new/weather.  There is no clock in the room,  but our requested wake up calls were reliable.  The bathroom was large and clean but carried an odor of mildew that we eventually traced to the shower curtain, not bad enough to make a big deal of, but noticeable nevertheless.  The shower itself is ""low flow"", not great, but good enough.  The one thing that did seem strange to us was that there were no washcloths/face towels available, how are you suppose to wash, especially with liquid soap?  When I asked the young lady, at the front desk, she stated that they did not provide washcloths, as it was an ""American thing"".  Really? We bought our own @ Dunnes down the street.
In short, the Drury Court is a decent hotel, in a central location.  It was good enough for our needs and at a reasonable (not cheap) cost.  It worked out well for us.  However, after now being to Dublin and having an idea of the area, we might choose to stay outside of the city if we visit again.",3,2012,11,08
227,Great Location & Great Value for Money,"We recently stayed in this hotel for a 2 night mid week stay.  Great location, just around the corner from St. Stephens Green, so excellent location if your heading to Dublin for a shopping trip or night at the Gaiety Theatre.  Room was very clean & very warm.  Excellent Breakfast is served in the bar.  We got a very reasonable room rate & we where very impressed with our stay at this hotel.",4,2012,11,07
227,Grate hotel,"Well checking in was a dream my room was lovely it was on the front so you did have noise ow well cant betem join them, the room was clean and tidey,we then move on to the bar well what can i say there rum is to die for the lad that sorts the rum out is grate here you pay good prices for good rum, position was fantastic come out turn right walk 100 meters across a junction there is a shoping centre and graften st walk down that to the trinity and on to o'connel st loved it",5,2012,11,07
227,Excellent location,"The hotel is located in the city centre, very near to Grafton Street. The rooms are clean, comfortable and quiet (at least mine was). WiFi works pretty well and is free. Staff is helpful. If you are looking for a good hotel in centre Dublin at a decent price, this is definitely the place to go.",4,2012,11,06
227,Great location and value,"This hotel was definitely worth the value given the location,  Although the facility could use an update, I was satisfied with my experience here. It was clean and basic though the bathroom towels are small.  

Bus 16 drops you off on South Great George's Street and it's just a couple blocks to the hotel from the bus stop. Very centrally located and there is a laundromat located just around the corner.  (I unexpectedly ended up on an extended stay and needs to do laundry).  The wifi worked well. There were green apples at the front desk, which is a nice touch. The reception staff even called and made a dinner reservation for me at the Brazenhead Pub for 2 days ahead while I was checking out even though I would no longer be staying with them. 

There was some random motor noise on my floor in the evening, which was loud but it finally ceased after awhile. 
 
It's not the Ritz but it met my expectations. ",4,2012,11,03
227,Very good location and decent accommodation; a solid hotel choice if visiting Dublin,"In August 2012, I stayed at the Drury Court Hotel for three nights at the beginning of a two week vacation in Ireland.  I don’t have a great deal to say about the hotel, which is a good thing since it means I had basically no problems or issues with the accommodation and service provided.  As many other reviewers have observed, the hotel is in a very good location, within relatively easy walking distance of most of the major tourist attractions, and in an area of central Dublin that is relatively quiet, especially when compared to the Temple Bar neighbouhood.  I found staff at the front desk to be courteous and professional and had no problems with the service they provided.  My room was clean and spacious and the bathroom was also well-maintained.  Some reviewers have complained that they were bothered by the loud sounds of music at night coming from the restaurant/bar on the hotel’s ground floor.  That may be an issue that people might want to consider when trying to decide whether or not to choose the Drury Court Hotel as their accommodation in Dublin.  I know that the decibel level of a musical act was an issue for me at another Dublin hotel where I stayed for one night at the end of my tour of Ireland.  It was NOT an issue for me at the Drury Court Hotel, however, but that may be because my room was on one of the top floors.  If booking a room at Drury Court, it might not be a bad idea to specify that you want a room on one of the upper floors, out of the reach of whatever sound might reverberate through the floors and ceilings from a live music performance in the restaurant/bar below.

In short, I think the Drury Court Hotel represents a sound choice for travelers to Dublin.  For what you get – comfortable accommodation in a good area of central Dublin – it provides solid value.",4,2012,10,31
227,Top Hotel,"Just spent 3 night at the Drury Court that were all excellent. We stayed B&B and the breakfast was superb. We filled up on full Irish, cereals, yogurt, baked goods, bread, cheese, ham & plenty of coffee. The hotel is perfect for accessing the whole city which we walked around or caught the hop on hop off busses. Staff were really helpful with advise on where to go. The room, on the 5th floor wax spacious and clean with a double and single. We took ample use of the tea and coffee making facilities. The hairdryer is in one of draws if your looking. only criticism would be the rooms could do with a safe each for you valuables for piece of mind but we found the hotel to be very safe anyway. All in all an excellent stay in a hotel I would definitely recommend.",4,2012,10,31
227,Ideal location for a weekend break.,"My fiance and I stayed here for a two night break, mid October. 

After arriving in Dublin around midday, we got distracted by the hospitality of the local bar's, and didn't arrive at the hotel until later that night. This wasn't a problem for the receptionist, who happily checked us in and showed us to our room. We had booked a double, but our room had an additional single bed in, and was very spacious. Our room was located at the back of the hotel, meaning there was no road noise. The hotel was clean, but in need of some cosmetic touch ups in places. However, it still was fantastic value for money.

The location has to be the best selling point for this hotel. Grafton street shopping area, Temple Bar and all the best bars and restaurants are within ten minutes walk, and the tour of the city bus stop is close by to take you further afield if you wish. 

Our flight to come home wasn't until 8pm. The hotel agreed to store our luggage until that evening so we could enjoy our final day in Dublin without carrying luggage everywhere. 

We would definitely stay here again. Can't wait for another visit. ",4,2012,10,20
227,Unhelpful staff,Great location however this was overshadowed by the unhelpful staff. I landed from Australia and arrived from the airport at 9am after 30 hour flight. I realised I might not be able to check in immediately however I wanted to drop off my bags as understandably had quiet a lot of luggage after returnin to Ireland after a year in Oz. I requested the hotel staff to contact me once the room was available as I was quiet jet-lagged and they informed me check in ws not till 3pm but they would call me once room was available . I have worked in hotels myself and this is quite standard request which is often done where I used to work. However this establishment made no effort to contact me despite leaving contact number with them. I returned at 2pm and asked if room was ready and was again told check in was at 3pm however when I explained my situation was allowed to check in reluctantly by the staff. I also advised them I had checked in on behalf of my sister who I wanted to suprise for her graduation however when my sister called they advised her someone had checked into her room therefore my suprise trip home was ruined.Very disappointed! even simple request for directions was met by grunts . Otherwise was an alright hotel good location thou quite simple room although we got quite good price for it,3,2012,10,17
227,"Great location, some major issues","We are a couple in our 30s who spent 2 nights here at the start of our 7-day Ireland driving trip. Their computers were down when we arrived, and we weren't able to check in for HOURS. We were exhausted and grumpy, so we (admittedly) didn't get off to the best start with this hotel. Front desk was slightly apologetic, but seemed more concerned with fixing their issue than accommodating us. Our room could have made up for it...except it didn't. It was dark and a little shabby, with an unappealing view of another building's window. Pros of this hotel: its convenient location. Cons: almost everything else! This hotel was a good deal, but there must be better options out there.",2,2012,10,17
227,Great Location,"My wife and I have just spent 3 nights in this centrally located hotel. We had a quiet and comfortable room at the back of the hotel, which was more than adequate for our needs. It was very clean and had a tea/coffee maker which, for us, is essential. The breakfast served in the adjacent bar was very good and substantial. The scrambled eggs and smoked salmon was almost a meal in itself. The staff throughout the hotel and bar areas were always smiling and eager to help and please. Nothing was too much trouble for them. So, overall, a very pleasant experience, and a hotel we would use again.",4,2012,10,12
227,Good value and good service.,"We stayed here for 2 nights, one starting our journey, the other 7 days later. We had no problems with noise (did request quiet room though). Breakfast was included in the price and was more than passable.  The staff are very helpful and friendly especially with driving directions to get out of Dublin. Rooms are clean and comfortable but no mini bar. Hotel is close to Marble Bar and lovely restaurants and shops.
Tip -There is a superb wine bar for a nightcap or meal, a few streets down, called www.olesyaswinebar.com, with a large selection of wines.",4,2012,10,11
227,Great location makes up for few flaws,"Stayed here for a few nights in late September 2012 with several family members, totaling 3 different rooms.  This hotel is in a FANTASTIC location - just a few minutes' walk from the Cathedrals in one direction and Grafton Street in the other.  It really couldn't be more conveniently located.  Front desk staff are friendly and helpful; they were more than helpful when booking a taxi for a larger group to the airport.  Our room was very clean and tidy, and surprisingly spacious compared to other European city hotels I have stayed in.  We booked a double room and were surprised to find it actually had a double AND a twin bed, which could be helpful for families staying together.  Beds were very comfortable and linens were clean..  Spent an hour or 2 at the hotel bar on a Saturday night as well.  I'm used to dim, scarcely-populated hotel bars.  BiaBar was very busy and lively on a Saturday night, which was a pleasant surprise... until we tried to go to sleep.

This is where the flaws come in.  Our room was NOISY!  Even with the windows closed and on the 3rd floor!  I think our room was right over the outside door to the bar, which was open since the weather was unseasonably warm.  We heard bass thumping until the wee hours, and then people yelling outside.  Other people we traveled with didn't have as much trouble with the noise since our rooms were scattered throughout the hotel.  Sunday night was less noisy than Saturday, granted, but it would be worth asking for a room in the back of the hotel when booking if you're a light sleeper.  One other complaint would be that our shower was awful; it felt like standing in a sprinkler.  Not a deal-breaker by any means, but something to think about.

Overall, the location of this hotel makes up for any inconveniences.  I'd stay here again if I make it back to Dublin.",4,2012,10,09
227,"Great Location, Good Value","I had read many previous reviews of the Drury Court Hotel that focused on noise issues, so I contacted them in advance via email to request a room in the back of the hotel, on a higher floor. They honored my request, we were in room 407 which was very quiet and secluded from street noise. Except for one night when there was an extremely loud party going on until 3 AM (!!) which I suspect was due to the All-Irish Hurling Championship held in Dublin earlier that day. Some rowdy Kilkenny fans celebrating :-)

We arrived very early on a Saturday morning from our trans-Atlantic flight and while we had also requested an early check-in, they were unable to help us out due to the hotel being completely booked the night before. However, they let us use a bathroom to clean up a bit and stored our luggage. Once our room was ready, check-in was efficient and fast. We found the front desk staff to be knowledgable and friendly throughout our 5-night stay. For example, they made arrangements for a cab to take us to the airport and negotiated the fee (25 euros) in advance. 

We loved the location of the Drury Court, you can literally walk to everything Dublin has to offer from there. Sight-seeing, shopping, pub crawling are all on your doorstep! We booked the hotel via United Airlines (which ended up going through Expedia) and our rate was ~ 100 euros per night (it was more on Saturday and Sunday, less during the week.) The rate included free WiFi which we used every day with no issues. 

I knew in advance that the hotel only stocked liquid soap (in shower and over sink), no shampoo, no bar soap, etc. That is common in Germany, for example but I was surprised to see this in Ireland. The hotel told me that this was a relatively new policy due to prevention of allergic reactions. Hmmm, not sure what to think about that response. In any case, I was well-prepared with my own shampoo, conditioner, hand lotion, and bar soap from home (in 3 oz containers, of course so I didn't have to check luggage on my flight!)

The room and bathroom were spotless throughout our stay. We had plenty of storage space and the bed/pillows were quite comfortable. During the day,we would leave our window open for fresh air, which was a nice option you don't get in the US very often. On our last day, the hotel was in the process of replacing the older TVs with new flat screen TVs. The new picture was great, although you still don't have access to many channels. But since we were rarely in our room anyway, that was not an issue for us. One thing that bothered us, there was no clock in the room.

The hotel does have a restaurant called the Bia Bar. We ate breakfast there on our first day and did stop there a few times to bring a drink up to our room while we were dressing for dinner, etc.  But with so many great places nearby, it's good to explore other options. 

Some tips, if you go left out of the hotel, at the next intersection, there is a great little deli/coffee shop called Snax in the City on Aungier St. For 5.90 euros each day, we'd get a large coffee, a diet coke, and a nice big bacon and tomato sandwich on brown bread (which we would split.) The young couple in there were so friendly and nice. 

Right next to that is an upscale restaurant called Darwin's. We had an excellent meal there, with both of us getting the pre-theater fixed price menu. Yes, it was a bit pricey, but we thought it was excellent value given the quality of the food and service. 

To the right of the hotel and around the corner, try Sheehan's for a good pub meal. We liked the atmosphere in there, and apparently so do a lot of locals. We also stopped by the Hairy Lemon (directly across from the hotel) a few times for a quick drink on our way back and forth to the hotel. Their cafe seemed to be doing a brisk business, although we did not happen to eat there. 

All in all, given the price paid and the great location, we found the Drury Court to meet our expectations. It is a solid 3 star hotel and exactly as advertised. I would certainly stay there again and would recommend it to others.",4,2012,10,06
227,Good but noisey,"We spent three nights here and would give it a much better rating but the bottm line is that you go to hotel for sleep and our experience was that it was too noisey to get much.

The staff are very friendly and go out of their way to be helpful and as others have said, the location is terrific.  The room and beds were fine but there is no air conditioning so we had to leave the window open a bit as it was warm. Unfortunatly the noise outside was really loud from the bar patrons next door smoking outside and we were not there on a weekend.  One of the 3 nights was not too bad, but we left feeling exhausted from touring all day and not getting much sleep at night.

So, as I have said, if you are a partier and are up late, a very heavy sleeper or can be guaranteed a room away from the street I would recommemd this hotel.",3,2012,10,03
227,Great location but not a good hotel,"We were supposed to stay for 4 nights but had to leave after 2 nights of stay. Check in was efficient and flawless. Front staff were helpful and friendly.The only other plus for this hotel is its location from Grafton st and Temple Bar. Other than that it's all downhill.

Our room had new paint and was quite large. The bathroom was very large as compared to other hotels. Room and bathroom were acceptable for cleanliness. However our room didn't have aircond so had to open the windows. As a result we could hear noise from the street, people drinking until the wee hours (Bia bar is underneath the hotel), delivery trucks unloading in the early mornings, cars driving by in the mornings. In short we couldn't get any sleep because we had to open the windows.

Also there was no shampoo but only liquid soap. And there were 2 separate fawcets for hot and cold water - you either use the hot or the cold so either you scald your hand or freeze it to death. Luckily we didn't stay during winter or summer.

I wouldn't recommend this hotel and will definitely not stay there again",2,2012,10,02
227,"Location great, but....","We arrived and the airport and decided to take a bus to our hotel. It's a bit of a drive due to the bus route, but was fun. The bus driver was very helpful ( it turns out that all Irish inhabitants seem to be that way. What a nice surprise). Hotel was easy to find with the help of the trusty iphone map. 

Hotel staff were very nice and helpful getting us oriented. Turns out the hotel is within easy walking distance to Temple Bar, St Stephens Green and many other nice sights. I'm not sure how you could find a better location.

Warning - our rooms were noisy and on a weekend there's plenty of late night activity at the bars with folks milling around in a ""happy mood"".  We had a difficult time sleeping due to the noice from the Bar next door and the folks on the street. I think it would be fine if you book a room off the street.",3,2012,10,01
227,Good location,A quite good hotel located just a few minutes walk from Temple Bar and other interesting areas. The room was actually bigger than we had expected for that price. The so called continental breakfast buffet was a bit of a disappointment though. There were however a lot of nice places nearby that served excellent breakfast.,3,2012,09,24
227,Pleasant  stay at the Drury hotel,"My partner & I stayed in The Drury Court for one night last month, and had a nice pleasant experience, staff were approachable & knowledgeable, should we be staying in the city again this is certainly where it will be.",4,2012,09,20
227,Nice Hotel very close to Gaiety Theatre,"Stayed here because our Son bought us tickets to a play in the Gaiety Theatre and it was a hotel close. Very good location in Dublin City Centre. Our room was a basic double room, had a comfortable bed, and very clean room. The woman on reception was very friendly. We ate lunch in the bar below the hotel the next morning, the food was very nice. I would go back.",4,2012,09,19
227,Location only thing going for it,"The location is good, however the hotel has the air of a budget hostel rather than a hotel. We did not enjoy our stay at all, in fact we spent quite a bit of time trying to find a nicer hotel but in the end decided to just make the best of a bad situation. Rooms are old and in need of refurbishment as is rest of the hotel. Our bathroom stank of sewage and when we asked to be moved to another room because of this they said they were fully booked - didn't seem that busy though. When we asked them to do something about the awful smell of sewage they just left us a can of air freshener! No attempt to actually rectify the problem and they really weren't interested. ",1,2012,09,15
227,"""No Frills"" BUT VERY Conveniently Located AND reasonable!","My Husband and I recently stayed at this ""central to everything"" Hotel. We requested a larger room because we (as Americans) required Air Conditioning, the Air Conditioning didn't work real well (it never got really cool ) BUT it just so happened that the UK had a very warm first week of September and we would have 'died"" without it ! As Americans I have found that our idea of a ""large"" room is not the same as the UK's definition of a ""large"" room -to be honest -  the room that was supposed to sleep (and  accomodate ) 3 people was simply adequate for 2 people, in other words it appeared to be a room for 2 with a single bed crowded into the room .That being said, the room was clean and although the decor was ""bare-bones"" ( the t.v. was small and old fashioned looking) the Hotel was right in the center of everything and Sophia and the rest of the staff were friendly and eager to please.The Bia Bar in the Hotel served an adequate breakfast with the evening atmosphere being lively (with music on the weekends) but NOT overun with students ( a nice place for a ""grown-up"" to get an Irish coffee)  !  We had a bit of a parking snafu and David Cahill (the Manager) went above and beyond to resolve our problem , he is kind and charming and obviously cares about the guests comfort and the Hotel.",4,2012,09,12
227,Great Location,"We stayed here for 2 nights last weekend. The location of the hotel is perfect,located rigth in the city centre and within walking distance of everything Dublin has to offer. The room was clean and comfortable. We had no trouble with noise or sleeping. The staff at reception were very helpful and directed us to everything we were looking for. The breakfast in Bia Bar was lovely and kept us going the whole day. The staff in the bar were very pleasant. If you are looking for somewhere to stay while visiting Dublin I would definately recommend this hotel. We will definately be back!",5,2012,09,10
227,good value hotel in a great location,"Just spent 2 nights at The Drury Court Hotel & had a fantastic stay. The staff were friendly and helpful which made our visit to Dublin all the more enjoyable. The reception were great on arrival, check out & throughout. We requested breakfast in our room quiet late the night before and the reception staff had no problem at all. Breakfast was tasty and plentiful. This hotel is good value & in a very central & convenient location. We found the room very adequate, it was spacious and the beds and linen were really comfortable. lovely bath and showers and lots of wardrobe space. Nice lively bar and again great staff. The hotel had a personality to it that a lot of others lack. The only thing i would suggest would be to provide fresh drinking water in the rooms but obviously its easy to get downstairs or any of the many nearby shops! For anyone looking to get the most out of a stay in Dublin I would recommend this hotel, you can't beat the location, we were within walking distance of every place we needed to go.",4,2012,08,28
227,Very helpful staff.,We have just returned from a three night stay at this hotel.  We would like to personally thank Anne-Marie and the rest of the reception staff for their warm welcome and swift action in allocating a car space for our hire car which unfortunately had not been pre-booked by our travel company.  The hotel is centrally located and comfortable.  We would certainly stay here again if we return to Dublin.,4,2012,08,26
227,"Bare Bones,Convenient Location","This was my second stay in Dublin and was looking for a reasonably priced and conveniently located hotel. This hotel met those needs, but not much else. If you are only concerned about those things and don't require much in the way of creature comforts that are so common these days this is the perfect place for you. If you do however require reliable Internet, a shower that does more than spit at you, and a bathroom door that actually closes you may want to look elsewhere. The room and bathroom were very clean, however the towels are thin and scratchy. The old box style tv didn't get any channels, and despite being on a higher floor the noise throughout the night on the weekend woke me up. The front desk staff were friendly, and the Bia Bar downstairs is convenient, but I will look elsewhere next time around.",2,2012,08,21
227,Loved this hotel!!,"Myself and my 3 friends stayed here after a night at Riverdance in the Gaiety Theatre which is situated just up the street, we were give a junior suite room which had a double bed, single and comfy pull out bed, the room was lovely and clean with a really nice bathroom.  The staff at reception were lovely, very friendly and helpful including the Manager.  There was a little issue with our room card key but we were immediately offered a complimentary drink in the hotel bar which we all thought was excellent customer service.  We ate in the hotel restaurant, the food was very nice, the bar man was also really helpful suggesting some bars to go to being leaving cert night!! We returned late enough that night and were greeted by the friendly Pavel who kindly obliged us a lovely cold jug of water from the bar.  The location is just perfect for city shopping, with everything being close by.  All in all would defo stay here again!!  The little bit of friendly customer service is what makes such a difference compared to the last Dublin hotel we stayed in which was awful.",5,2012,08,20
227,Lovely Hotel and Friendly Staff,"My Husband, Myself and our 5 year old daughter stayed for 2 nights at the Drury Court Hotel in August 2012. We stayed in a lovely room at the back of the hotel, which was nice and quiet, Breakfast each morning was delicious. We have the Full Irish, and we would recommend this. All cooked to perfection. My Daughter loved the crossiants. The staff are very friendly and helpful. In the evening time we went to the bar for dinner, My daughter was given some home made cookies. Which she adored. The location is great. So near all the shops. We were also welcomed by David the hotel manager, he suggested a few places to see. Like the Doll's Hospital in PowersCourt shopping Center. My daughter had a ball there, She was fascinated with all the dolls and accessories. I would highly recommend staying at the Drury Court Hotel. A big Thank you to all the staff for making our stay a very enjoyable one.",5,2012,08,20
227,Adequate but not amazing,"I stayed at the Drury Court Hotel for one night in July 2012.I  needed a place for one night only as I was to catch a tour to the west coast the following morning. 
 I did have a considerable struggle to locate the hotel. Arriving at Dublin's airport and connecting to the downtown by airport bus, I found myself dropped off a few blocks away from the hotel. However, no one I asked (including the bus driver and someone at a tourist info booth) could give me clear directions to Lower Stephens street. Very frustrating. My room  was okay...nothing special. The hotel's lobby is very small and understated. However, I was pleased with the bar and restaurant . I ate my breakfast there and it was very nice.When asked for a place for dinner , the front desk staff recommended the bar kittycorner to the hotel. I had a tasty meal there . 
This hotel was a place to lay my head for the night and nothing more. Would I stay here again? Probably not. Especially if my stay was to enjoy the sites of Dublin for a few days.",3,2012,08,19
227,Great Location but rooms are inconsistent.,"We stayed at the Drury Court in July, 2012.  I had  booked a twin room and requested a quiet floor after reading recent reviews about the noise on the corner units/ street side.  We were given a room on the 4th floor which faced the hotel next door, you could see directly into the rooms across.  There was a tiny laneway between the two hotels that was very busy with traffic coming from Great George Street behind the hotel.  There was no A/C in these rooms and it was very warm up there.  Only 2 small windows opened but the traffic and noise in the laneway from delivery trucks, garage removal could be heard day and night.  Also you had to close the drapes to get privacy but they were very heavy so no air could get in while they were closed and it made the dreary dull room worse.  The room was very worn and dated.  The bathroom was very large and tiled  but there was a very strong odour of urine that must have been in the floor grout that would not go away no matter how much perfume we sprayed on it! Ugh!! Gross!   The carpeting in the entire room had the same urine smell as well.  It was totally unacceptable!   The linens on the bed were clean and crisp.  However, we peeled back the bottom sheet to check the mattress and were shocked to find old worn, dirty, stained mattresses with wholes in the sides!!!!  As well as several blood stains on the sides and top!  I contacted front desk and reported this and requested another room of superior quality or I was going to check-out and find another hotel.  They said the room maids had not reported any of this and were compeletly unaware of it.  They did finally move us to another room on a lower floor which faced the back parking.  This room was much better, had A/C and looked like it was more recently updated and there were no bad smells. In both rooms the kettles to make tea/coffee were disgusting as well.  They had slime & heavy scale in them and as a result we decided to not use it.  We did not have the breakfast at the hotel either because there were so many wonderful places to eat just outside the doorstep! However, the restaurant & bar were nice and large.  We had drinks in there the one night late. We loved the location and walked everywhere day and night.  With that being said there are several other hotels in the same area that I would try next visit to Dublin.  The reason for this is due to the fact that I was told at check-in that I had to pay for my stay in full (since I was staying several nights).  I asked if I wasn't satisfied with the hotel and wanted to check-out what would happen and they said if I decided to do that then I would have to give them 24hrs notice.  So you can imagine how I felt after I paid in full and then opened the door to such a disgusting room!  My first reaction was, to go online right there in the room to immediately search for another hotel, give the 24hrs notice, loose the cost of 2 nights stay but get the heck out of this hotel.  After spending too much time doing that I decided to go complain.  Luckily, my 2nd thought to go complain and try another room was successful and no further time was wasted searching for another hotel. I found the room maids to be inconsistent as well, with room cleanliness, towels, supplies and requests.  We had an absolutely amazing time in Dublin and plan to return but it will not be at the Drury Court !",3,2012,08,17
227,Handy to Everything,"Our room was quite comfortable if a little ""tired"", with adequate facilities. TV reception was quite poor and there was only one bedside lamp. Breakfast was delicious in the comfortable setting of the bar where we also had drinks and a meal one night. The staff in the bar were very friendly and helpful. It is very handy to all the major tourist sights in Dublin but we would probably try other hotels in the area if we were in Dublin again.",3,2012,08,14
227,Pleasant place to stay,We stayed 2 nights and had a pleasant stay here. Rooms were quite comfortable. Facilities were adequate. Enjoyed a quiet breakfast in the restaurant as well as drinks and coffee in the bar. Hotel is well situated and we were able to easily walk to the many sights around. The staff at the front desk were very good. They willingly gave advice about sights to see and helped with computer and booking queries that we had. Would be happy to return to The Drury.,4,2012,08,12
227,Not good enough - better hotels for same price nearby,"I was very disappointed with my stay at the Drury Court. 
The hotel appears one which is in dire need of refreshing in the public areas and the bedrooms. It is, at best a 2* equivalent, rather than a 3*.
My stay was especially marred by a problem with my bathroom light. It simply did not work. I reported the issue and the housekeeper came to investigate (I stayed at the weekend and there was no electrician on duty apparently). Since the problem was not just a light bulb (she tried replacing it) the housekeeper could not fix the problem.
When I rang reception 10 minutes later to follow up, the receptionist said the hotel was full and offered a solution of a plug in lamp! When I suggested this would not be very safe in a water filled bathroom, I was then offered candles!!!!! 
When I responded that 'that must be a joke', I was asked to give them a few minutes for a solution. Their 'solution' consisted of a plug in floor lamp with extendable arms which had to be placed within the main bedroom area with the light arm directed towards the bathroom (photo attached). As a result when the shower curtain was pulled, I had the pleasure of trying to have a shower in the half darkness!! 
Speaking of the shower, the water pressure was extremely poor
When I checked out the next day the receptionist (not the one I dealt with re the issues) was extremely busy and did not ask me how my stay was - otherwise I would have told her! Additionally be very careful about your luggage. I was amazed to discover that when I came back to collect my bag later in the day after checkout that the receptionist simply allowed me in behind the counter and without any I.D. or tags etc allowed me to take whatever bag I chose!",1,2012,08,08
227,LOVED my stay... Thankyou :),I booked a double room for myself for two nights. The room was so comfortable. The bed was really nice and I had the best nights sleep. I did not have a problem with noise. The room was also cleaned to perfection. The amenities in the bathroom were lovely. I received room service and ate in the restaurant and I really enjoyed the food. The lady who delivered my room service breakfast gently knocked on the door and was so polite. The reception staff were also very friendly. I work in hotels and I have high expectations. I really enjoyed my stay. I did not want to leave. Also this hotel is located in the best area of DUBLIN!! Thankyou :) ,5,2012,08,01
227,Great location and professional attitude.,"Drury Court Hotel has a great location in the Dublin city centre. The rooms were clean and met the expectations of a middle class hotel. 

The best was the professinal attitude of the staff. Me and two friends booked a room with three single beds at hotels.com. When we arrived the staff told us that the triple rooms they offer have a double and a single bed, i.e. not what we expected and had booked through the booking site. After some constructive discussions the staffed offered us another triple room with an additinal sofa bed (double+single+sofa bed). We also got a complementary breakfast one of the mornings.",4,2012,07,31
227,Terrible Experience,"We stayed here three nights and I wish we had really not stayed here at all. We barely slept because of the poor ventilation in the room -- it was boiling hot with the windows closed without the heat on, and with the windows open you could hear all the people partying into the wee hours of the morning. Because I feel a good night's rest is an important element of a hotel, I cannot rate it very highly.

The plus sides to this hotel, as others have said, is the location to central Dublin's downtown area, the free Wifi (although this didn't work well for us at all -- it kept dropping, so I would say it is fairly unreliable) and clean rooms. The front desk staff seemed very friendly, and the attached restaurant was very pleasant and reasonably priced.
 
We booked through the Drury Court's website (Failte Hotels) and certain amenities that came with the booking (such as AC) were not actually there in the hotel. When I brought this to the attention of hotel staff, after one sleepless night of a hot room, they did nothing to try to make our stay more comfortable. I would not stay here again, and I would recommend you definitely do not book this hotel in the summer.",2,2012,07,30
227,"Great location, clean room, helpful staff",The hotel is located 3 min. Walk from graffton st. Great location close to city center and suffolk st. Where most of the tours start. The room was comfortable and clean. The reception staff was really nice and helped me with a mistake that i made in the reservation so i didnt pay more for this mistake. I will sure visit again!,5,2012,07,23
227,"2nd visit, still good","We booked the drury court for an overnight stay on 18th July.  We were in Dublin for the Bruce Springsteen concert (brilliant) which was in the RDS. I would have to say that if i was attending another event in the rds i would not book this hotel as there are other places more convenient.  The taxi from the hotel to the concert cost 25 euro due to the distance and the volume of traffic.  However the return fare was 11 euro.(also thanks to the return taxi driver who returned our bag left in car) Having said that if I was going to dublin for shopping weekend etc I would definately consider the drury court.  the staff are friendly and helpful, the room was spotless and the breakfast delicious. For 9.95 (cheaper if booked online) there was a full buffet continental and a full cooked irish breakfast to follow. The location is good for shopping, reataurants, nightlife etc. Car parking was 8 euros for overnight stay which was very reasonable.",5,2012,07,21
227,"Good hotel, great location","I have to be honest, I booked the Drury Court on-line because it had availability when I needed it and freee Wi-Fi (many of the hotels seem to charge) and it looked like hotel rooms in Dublin were going fast. It wasn't my first choice, but now I am very happy that I found it. I booked a single, but the room had two twin beds. It was clean, comfortable and perfectly adequate for my needs. They even turned the heat on for a bit to take the chill off a very unseasonably cool Dublin in July. The bathroom was clearly remodeled recently and was quite large for a small hotel. The reception staff was friendly and helpful. The best thing about the hotel is it's location - within easy walking of most major sights and in the middle of some of Dublin's best eating. Just one caveat. The hotel has no AC and I think it could be quite noisy at night on the weekend.",4,2012,07,19
227,Location,"My wife and I stayed at the Drury Court Hotel for two nights. The room was ok but a little noisy. The lobby is almost non existent, but the location of this hotel is hard to beat. Within easy walking distance to everything in Dublin. They couldn't accomodate an early check-in, but were nice enough to store our bags behind the desk until a room came available.",3,2012,07,18
227,Dublin....dublin....dublin...,It is the best place in the world... the guinness.. the people... the temple bar...the music... salmon... and what else?.. this is Dublin... when i ve been there i foundnthis hotel by my self in internet and i ask for so many things because my wife everyday toldmme somenthing to ask... they arranged for me a nice room with 4 big window and a bathtube... really at the reception were not so friendly but probably because they rememberballmthe e-mails with all the requetsts i send them. anyway i think this is really nice and clean hotel to stay and nest time in dublin formsure i came back here.,5,2012,07,16
227,"Excellent Location, Comfortable Room","We stayed at the Drury Court Hotel for four nights while attending a conference at Trinity College.

Our room was basic and clean.  The beds were clean and comfortable.  The location was fantastic.  We walked everywhere we went, except of course, to the airport.  The included breakfasts were tasty and filling.  There was a variety of cold food to choose from and of course, hot breakfast as well.  And the cost of the room was reasonable.

I would recommend staying in this hotel.  If you are not looking for luxury you will be very happy.",4,2012,07,13
227,Wonderful stay!!,We just left Dublin and had a wonderful stay at the Drury Court Hotel. It was centrally located for Grafton Street and Temple Bar. 5 minute walk to Grafton Street and 10 minute walk to Temple Bar. Hotel was perfect. We were a family of 4 booked in 2 rooms. The desk attendant Sophie was extremely perfect. We were booke in rooms 108 and 109 and I had reservations about that floor because I heard about noiise concerns. We did not have any problems. room was spacious and clean. Overall it was a great place to stay in Dublin.,5,2012,07,11
227,"Convenient, quiet location. Great Value.","It is close to Grafton, Temple Bar, DUB Express Bus, Trinity College and many other sites. Being in the center of things, but on a quiet street is what I like about it.

While not posh or fancy, it is clean comfortable and well staffed. I have stayed here several times over the past 10 years, and will likely be back.",4,2012,07,09
227,"Great location, friendly staff.","Stayed one night in Drury Court Hotel...got lost on the one-way street system and rang the hotel, the manager came out and waited for our car on the corner for us to direct us into the secure parking...very nice, friendly touch.  

This hotel is in a brilliant location, you're central to Grafton Street & surrounding pubs, clubs & restaurants not to mention museums & art galleries. Got a deal on the net which was €139, normally it's €179, pricey but the location is ideal.

Room was spotless. 

You can't go wrong staying here for location alone.",4,2012,07,02
227,"Nice, priced well, convenient location","Drury court was a great little gem right around the corner from the Grafton street shopping district. It is close to several pubs too. I thought it was a very nice hotel for the price and would happily stay there again. I was not overly impressed with the breakfast food or service in the hotel restaurant Biabar. Skip it and check out the Hairy Lemon across the street.
",4,2012,06,29
227,"Excellent location and value, average hotel","This hotel is in an ideal location in Dublin, walking distance to everything. The price for such a location was great as well, especially since most of the other hotels were at least 50% more, or they were total dumps. The hotel does offer discount parking, for those that drive. Honestly though, do yourself a favor and don't bring a car. The Dublin streets and lack of parking would make a car more trouble than it's worth.

The staff is very friendly and helpfully. Check-in and out were both very fast and the staff was very helpfully booking a taxi to the airport. 

The rooms are a little dated. There is no AC, so you need to keep the windows open, which makes the room noisy. Even with the windows closed, if you're there on a weekend, plan on hear the music from the bar downstairs and people on the street well into the late night hours. However, on Sunday night, things were much quieter. Nice bathroom, with a good shower. Free Wi-fi in the room as well.

Overall, this is an average hotel. The location and price are real winners, and I would stay again during the week. However on a weekend night, the hotel is just a little too loud for me. However, if noise doesn't bug you, go for it. You really can't beat the location.",3,2012,06,27
227,good location,"room comfortable quite large everything you would need -tv volume set so quiet no point having it!  Good base for exploring shops and restaurants all nearby. Staff in hotel very friendly (but everyone was in Dublin).  Would certainly stay here again, perfect for a short break.",4,2012,06,23
227,Great location and helpful staff,"The hotel is very well located. Just a few steps aways you'll be able to go  to the main commercial street (Grafton Street) and the main attractions in the center of Dublin. The rooms were quite comfortable and the staff was really helpful with our questions. 

I would definitely recommend this hotel for vacation and business travelers.",4,2012,06,20
227,"Great location, friendly staff","We had two rooms (a double and a triple) for us and three college-age daughters. The decor is simple but adequate, rooms clean and quiet (except for some loud pub noise from across the street our second night there). We arrived very early in the morning our first day, and while we had to wait in the (small) lobby a couple of hours, the staff couldn't have been more polite, and got us into rooms as quickly as they could.

The bar associated with the hotel is modern and the food is quite decent - a good choice for breakfast, or even dinner if you don't feel like wandering the neighborhood. All in all an excellent value.",4,2012,06,19
227,"Cheap hotel, great location, friendly staff & nice bar",My wife and I stayed with our 4 month old baby for 1 night before heading on down to Kilkenny. We requested a cot in the room and turned up early. We were able to check in early and the cot was already in place. No issue with noise during our stay although we were there on a Tuesday night. The rooms are basic but clean and fine if that's all you are after. The bar is nice and breakfast was ok. Handy location for grafton street etc. all in all a good hotel for the money,4,2012,06,18
227,Saviour staff at good value very good location,"We found this hotel, called at 07:00 and were checking in by 08:00. (For the first time in my life I checked out of another Dublin hotel after one sleepless night. At about 06:00 I started looking on iPad for another modestly-priced place to stay that was WELL-LOCATED but not TOO NEAR TEMPLE BAR). 
The staff was brilliant - very friendly/helpful; did not take advantage of our we-need-a-room-tonight desparation, but gave us a fair rate on a decent room.
Location very good for tourism and restaurants (not perfect for bus to/from airport).
Pillows OK, shower pressure sufficient, good control of room temperature. 
A bit noisey below our room as there was some kind of umbrella'd outdoor drinking (and talking) area but it didn't go too late. 
Breakfast a good value.",4,2012,05,29
227,Great location.,"Stayed one night, great location just off Grafton St and St Stephens Green. Staff very welcoming and helpful. Car parking arranged nearby at discount rate. Lovely bar, very easy access to all local sights, bars, restaurants etc. 
Will use again.",4,2012,05,27
227,Great location!,"I was travelling alone to visit my daughter and stayed four nights at this hotel. I would recommend this hotel, the location is just perfect and the staff was really kind.
The rooms are decent, but the shower was bad. There was no press so it was impossible to wash the hair. But that is the only thing I can complaine on, everything else was good. I did not have any breakfast so I can not write anything about it.",4,2012,05,19
227,Old Hotel - Good Location,"This hotel is in a great location, central to a good bit of Dublin's exciting night life and also in walking distance to many of Dublin's other sights, shopping, and Trinity College.  Actually, this hotel's location is its greatest asset!

The rooms are old but in decent shape.  The bathrooms are modern and clean.  The staff is friendly and very accommodating.  There is NO parking at this hotel but you can park at the mall about 1/4 mile away for a reasonable price if you stay at this hotel.

Note that because of its location, you will hear a bit of Dublin's night life well after midnight. As the title says, this is an older hotel.  Based on other reviews, we were expecting a four-star associated with the familiar ""Drury Inn"" chain - this is NOT that hotel so our expectation management was a bit off.  Otherwise, it is a decent 3-star (maybe 3 1/2?) hotel.",3,2012,05,15
227,"location, location, location... for a trip to Dublin","Myself and a friend were lucky enough to win tickets to a show in the Gaeity theatre and an overnight stay in the Drury Court hotel. The manager of the hotel ,David, was extremely helpful in sorting out tickets for a night that suited us and arranging everything, couldn't fault it. The staff on check in were busy but efficient and dealt with us promptly, our room had everything you expect from a good quality boutique style city hotel, the room was quiet ( a blessing for a city centre hotel in such a central location) it was warm, the beds were comfortable with extra pillows etc., tea, coffee facilities and toiletries provided. We ate in the bar enjoying the choices from the new Bia restaurant,, a kind of tapas style which we liked, Lots of different sharing dishes to choose from,, we shared a starter for 2 and both had the steak which were cooked to perfection as I like my steak rare and my friend likes hers well done..The waiter was extremely busy .. ( always the sign of good food) and we did have to wait about ten minutes but he was attentive, gave us menus to peruse while we waited and he apologised for the delay, we didnt feel like we were not being looked after, also as we had chosen a meal deal which included a glass of prosecco and we didn;t have time for dessert if we were going to make the start of the show he very kindly gave us an extra glass of prosecco each instead of dessert which we enjoyed with our meal.. these little touches make a big difference, the only suggestion I could make with regard to the menu is that they make their own chips, a small portion of home made chunky chips instead of the frozen variety but as everything else was fresh this is a small thing. We had a wonderful night. a big thank you to all of the staff of the Drury Court hotel, I will definitely stay there again.. but it is the location which is absolutely fantastic ,,, a few minutes waik from Grafton st, close to the theatres and shops and beside a selection of fantastic bars and restaurants.. Break for the Border is just across the road, the Hairy lemon and Bruxelles just around the corner to name but a few.. and yet when you get back to your room.. a few minutes walk, it is blessedly quiet. Definitely recommend this hotel for a city centre break",5,2012,05,12
227,Great hotel in a great location!,"I would highly recommend the Drury Court Hotel. We had a wonderful stay and would return if we ever go back to Dublin again. Any issues we had were promptly and professionally dealt with by hotel staff. 
The location was fantastic. Close to restaurants, shops and bus stops to the airport.
The only problem we had really was the noise at night. This seems to be a common thing in European hotels but if you request ahead of time by emailing the hotel directly, they have fantastic quiet rooms facing the back.
If you're thinking of staying somewhere in Dublin, don't let this hotel pass you by!
Thank you for making our stay wonderful!

**Also, take a short 30min train ride to the beautiful coastal town called Malahide. Just beautiful!",5,2012,05,09
227,nice place to stay,We stayed in this hotel on our first night in Dublin.  The rooms were quaint but nice and clean.  The location is great and is walking distance to many attractions.  The hotel service was wonderful.  The front desk was very helpful for recommending things to do and places to see.,4,2012,05,07
227,Gem in the city,"Just wanted to say thank you for a lovely stay in your hotel. 

My sister & I thoroughly enjoyed the hotel, staff are extremely helpful &
friendly

We had dinner in the bar & the food was delicious

I'd highly recommend your hotel",5,2012,04,30
227,Very basic hotel at a good price and great location,"We stayed 2 nights at the Drury Court hotel in Dublin.  The location was perfect, as we could quickly get to many of the tourist attractions.  Temple Bar is just a few minutes away, as is Dublin Castle, City Hall, the river Liffey, etc.  We ended up taking a short cab ride to Guinness and Kilmainham Gaol, however both should have been reachable easily by bus, we were just in a hurry to get there before closing time.

The hotel itself was quite basic and the rooms were not very impressive.  For the rate they charge though, I thought it was pretty fair for a clean room in such a good location.",3,2012,04,24
227,excellent hotel - great service and location,Friendly and helpful staff made our stay wonderful in this hotel which is located right in the centre of things in Dublin but not too noisy.  Large rooms which were serviced well and room temperature just right. Would definitely stay here again,5,2012,04,24
227,Nice little Gem,"I recently stayed here with my Husband who was on business. It was an overnight stop. Reception staff were very helpful. While the heating didnt work in the room the Receptionist very quickly came with a Heater without being asked. A maintenance man was rang and it was fixed in no time.It was midweek when we stayed so no noise of nightclub . 
The Breakfast was fine with plenty of everything.
I would consider this Hotel to be Central and good value for money.",4,2012,04,23
227,Our rooms didn't match the pictures,"The hotel is in a GREAT location for touring Dublin.  During our trip we stayed in 3 different rooms at the Drury Court. None of them have been renovated to look like the hotel photos (no pretty patterned bathroom tiles, silver/taupe-colored drapes, gray rug).  Our rooms had tired, stained red rugs and maroon drapes.  Some room photos show an extra chair in the corner (we didn't have one in room 208 or 408, but did in room 209).

The first night, Room 208 was across the street from a club.  We could not sleep! It was a Friday night.  Our window was closed, and the thick drapes were closed, too.  The entrance/line was on the sidewalk, so we could hear everyone talking.  When the club doors opened we could hear the music loud & clear. One side table was broken and one broken lamp missing a lampshade. The bathroom needed to be scrubbed.

In the morning I spoke to Ann Marie.  She moved us across the hall to room 209.  A much better location (above a parking lot).  So quiet!  However, the bathroom smelled musty (maybe needed a new shower curtain?)  The lamps were dusty (see photos).  Hopefully this room will be renovated soon.

We checked out to visit other cities, then returned to the Drury Court for a few more nights.  Our room 408 again overlooked the parking lot so it was quiet.  The bathroom sink was slow to drain, and the stopper was broken.  The chamber-maids must have known this b/c every day when we returned she had left on the counter (not in the sink).

You can't beat this location!  Turn left out of the hotel will bring you to Dame St, Dublin Castle, Christ Church, etc.  A right out of the hotel, is St. Stephens Park & shopping mall, Grafton Street, Trinity College, museums, etc.  5 minute walk to the Tourism Office, where you meet the bus for all-day tours.  Also, there are plenty of restaurants in the area.  Front desk/Ann Marie was very pleasant and helpful booking a tour for us.  

Hotel rooms come with free wi-fi.  A little slow, but good enough to check email.  If you need a stronger signal, walk towards the Metro Cafe then cross the street to Starbucks.  Use their free wi-fi instead.

There's free, secure parking if you call the hotel directly and make arrangements.  

We didn't bother to add breakfast to our room rate.  There are plenty of restaurant you an walk to instead.  Be sure to eat at the Hairy Lemon across the street for real Irish food.   Plenty of locals eating there. After dinner, we watched a soccer match on the pub side.  Such fun!

There's a standard 25 euro rate for a taxi from the hotel to the airport, approx. 30 minute ride.  Consider a taxi rather than walking to the aircoach bus stop for 7 euros per person.",3,2012,04,23
227,Hotel cancelled my reservation and left me nowhere to stay,"I was compelled to write this because of the awful experience I suffered with this hotel. I booked a hotel room by phone for a Thursday on the Sunday before my stay. I was told on the phone that I would receive an email confirmation. By Thursday, I still hadn't received an email confirmation, so I called the hotel to enquire. While on the phone, I extended my booking to 2 nights, and the lady who took the booking said there was a problem with their email but my room was definitely booked.

That Thursday night, I arrived at the hotel quite late, about 11:30 and was informed to my horror that there was no room booked for me and what was worse, that the hotel was full. Eventually the clerk, told me that my room had been booked and then had the temerity to tell me that I must've have cancelled it. At this point I started becoming frustrated. Imagine having been travelling for hours, and arriving at your hotel to find they had no booking and no rooms left in the hotel. I was left facing the prospect of having nowhere to stay!

In fairness to the clerk he called around to find another hotel with rooms, but then told me that I'd have to walk there! I suggested that the hotel should cover a taxi to the other hotel, and he looked at me blankly. I left at this point and went on foot to the other hotel, as I'd had enough of the shoddy treatment.",1,2012,04,20
227,good hotel in city centre,"hotel easy to get to, near temple bar but not to close to be noisey at night. big clean rooms, bathroom also big, everything in room you need. booked room only, you can have breakfast there but in dublin there are plenty of great places to have an Irish breakfast i would defo book room only. overall i would reccomend and if i go to Dublin again i would go back to the Drury Court.",4,2012,04,17
227,Value for money in a perfect location,"A very well located hotel just off Grafton Street- perfect for anyone walking the sights of Dublin.The rooms are clean, a good size and of a similar standard to Travelodge. We didn't have a power shower as reported in some reviews and looking at the photos our room was a basic standard. We requested a quiet room and got one on the top floor and at side of the hotel, which was very quiet for a city location. 

Reception staff were very helpful and pointed us in the right direction when we arrived with a map, local knowledge and excellent advice.

We stayed when the weather was very cold and had an issue with the room being cold when we woke up and returned late evening. Even the receptionist said the room was very cold when she came to check and we were very grateful for the portable heater she provided. The heating is timed to come on 5-7am and 5-7pm whch may suit business guests but unfortunately not us. To their credit the receptionist did tell us to call her if we were cold and the heating would be put on for that floor. A bit too much of a fuss for us first thing in the morning!",4,2012,04,07
227,Great hotel close to everything and lovely staff,"Stayed for 3 nights over the weekend  had nice meal on arrival and 3 lovely highly recommended breakfasts
Staff are very welcoming and efficient
We had a problem sleeping on Friday and Saturday nights the bass boom from the disco/bar was horrendous till 3 in morning even though we were on 4th floor.
Spoke with David the manager who handled our complaint with professionalism and assured us he would look into the cause and asked us to visit again when we return to Dublin which we certainly do and the Drury Court would be our choice.
The hotel is centrally situated for shops and bars",4,2012,04,04
227,Will be back,"Stayed here for two nights at the end of March.  Very reasonably priced for a hotel located just off Grafton Street.  The staff, from reception to bar/restaurant, were extremely helpful, and also I must mention  the manager who made us feel very welcome indeed.  The room was spacious, quiet and clean.  The bar/restaurant is a total chill out experience, from breakfast right through to evening meal.  The lighting and the background music are spot on, please don't change that CD!    Thanks again Drury Court, you are now my number one hotel in Dublin and I will be recommending you to all my friends.",5,2012,04,03
227,Perfect city centre hotel with delightful staff.,Ideal base for our two day visit. The staff couldn't have been more helpful. The bar / restaurant has a delightful ambience and very comfortable seating. Will definitely be back.,5,2012,04,02
227,Perfect value for money in great location,"Just stayed the one night but was very impressed with the value for money. 

Location was good, about a minute to the main shopping area and bars and restaurants literally on your doorstep. 

We had a double room which was quite large and would have been fine for a longer stay. 

If we got the same rate again, £49 for the room, we'd absolutely choose to stay again.",4,2012,03,29
227,"Location, Location, Location","Location of this hotel is perfect for those who wish to see Dublin on foot. The staff were helpful and friendly, welcoming and informative. The rooms were clean and comfortable and the shower powerful but relaxing.  This hotel is ideally placed to take advantage of all Dublin is famous for - great shops - pubs - parks - theaters - restaurants - galleries and history. The only slight fault  was the room only basis but with so many restaurants so near it was no problem.  Great value for money and we will return.",4,2012,03,29
227,"Nice little hotel, in central location","The Drury Court Hotel is walking distance to everywhere you want to go in Dublin. It's a couple of minutes walk from Temple Bar but further enough away to not be part of the craziness that descends in the evening. 
The hotel room is comfortable and my boyfriend loved the strength of the shower. If you want the heating on you have to ask at reception as they control each room.
There is a bar downstairs from the Hotel but even on the second floor over the St Paddys Day weekend, we could barely hear it. 
Overall, great value for money and great location.",4,2012,03,25
227,Great Stay,Thought this hotel was great value and in a great location in Dublin - everything in walking distance. There are some great bars and restaurants within arms reach too.,4,2012,03,21
227,PERFECT PERFECT......,"Stayed thru the St Patrick's day holiday and the hotel was perfect!! The location was perfect and the people there were the nices and most helpful. No reasopn to look any further if you need a hotel in the middle of all the action.  Pub across the street, shopping around the corner and food just up and down any street. PERFECT PERFECT",5,2012,03,21
227,very central,"this hotel is in an excellent location, within walking distance of temple bar, etc. When you walk in, reception area is very clean and modern, lifts, halls etc not so much, but still very clean. I stayed with a friend, in a twin room, decent sized room, with full lenght mirrors, hair dryer, tv, plenty of sockets for chargers, straighteners etc 
Bear in mind there was no resisdents bar, but that probably ended up being a good thing, 
Showers, bathroom, etc was very clean, with enough owels for the two of us. 
We did not have breakfast, but it seemed to be busy which is always a good sign. Def worth staying if you want to be somewhere central, at a reasonable cost.",4,2012,03,21
227,Great base to explore Dublin,Warm welcome from staff on arrival and the room was clean and much bigger than we expected. Great value for money and in a great location - everything in walking distance. There are some great bars and restaurants within arms reach too.,4,2012,03,15
227,Very impressive,The room was lovely and warm and the location was very central. Staff were friendly and helpful. Will be returning,5,2012,03,05
227,Great Stay,"Stayed in Dublin for one night for Business. Drury Court was reasonably priced, excellent quality and professional and friendly staff.  Nice clean, tidy room.",5,2012,03,05
227,Great value for money,"Nice small simple hotel, tucked away in the heart of us all. 5minuets from temple bar, 5 mins from main shopping area's and just 10mins to o'connel street. EVERYTHING IN WALKING DISTANCE! Well recommended for the price! Hotel room good size, always clean and stocked tea and coffee. Lovely stay!",4,2012,03,05
227,Excellent stay,"Stayed here on two seperate nights recently. Less than 3 miles from the Ferry port.
The service from the staff on the desk was excellent. I was concerned about leaving a motorcycle on the streets of Dublin... They provided very secure parking (and at the best price ....)
The cooked breakfast in the Biabar is excellent.
Will definitley stay there again should I need to.",5,2012,03,04
227,I'll Definitely Book Again!,"Had an incredibly WONDERFUL time at this hotel on  my last trip to Dublin. Having stayed in different hotels on previous visits, I can say Drury provided the best accommodations. Location is EXCELLENT - close to everything but not on a major street. Down the block is a very $$$$ 5* hotel, yet here is a boutique hotel for much less with great accommodations. 

Had a clean, expansive room - bigger than I thought it would be, very comfortable. Charming, helpful, friendly staff. Great places to eat, drink, shop 5 min away & Trinity College short walk & great for transportation. Personally I love walking in Dublin, and this was a great ""home base"" in any direction. (oh and there's a takeway place right across the street.)

I can say without hesitation that I have found ""MY"" Dublin hotel & I look forward to my next stay. Thank you to everyone at Drury, from all the staff to the manager -- especially the kind young man at the desk when I checked in on the morning of saturday 29 october. I also recommend this hotel to any solo female travelers concerned about safety, for there are no such concerns at this hotel. [fyi - I stayed 5 days from oct 29 - nov 2.]

cheers,

ps. for those who say it is noisy -- request a quieter room. while i was right above the bar, floor 1, i was fine with windows closed - and this was halloween and a bank holiday, extra festive. with window open, i didn't mind the music as it ended early, not all night. no complaints. i'd stay in the same room/floor 1 again.",5,2012,03,01
227,good base for city visit,"Good location,friendly welcome, attentive staff, good value rooms - have used it several times now and will do so in the future.",4,2012,03,01
227,Ticked all the boxes,"Stayed in the hotel for one night with a friend. The location is excellent, near the great spots for nightlife. The room was wonderful value, large and clean with comfortable beds. Yes, there was a little bit of noise from the street but what else is to be expected from a city-centre location. The staff were friendly and amenable. I really can't fault it.",5,2012,02,25
227,carpark a mess,stayed there for 1 night booked car in when i booked room tring to find carpark with directions was a night marewhen i found where to park was told i had to move car to another carpark and this is after driving around a one way system for over 1 hour the guy at the desk could not speak much english after going to another car park was happy just to park a pity because directions to park is very poor,2,2012,02,17
227,Very basic hotel but great location,"I booked the Drury Court Hotel as a Christmas gift for my sister along with concert tickets in Dublins 02. The location is great on Drury Street just a stones throw from St Stephens Green & Grafton Street. 

Reception is very small & bland. The lift is filthy, there was even a beer can in the lift. It was still there when we went for breakfast the next morning. Our room was very basic the curtains didn't even fit the window when closed. The beds are comfy & clean rooms. There were stains on the carpets in the corridors.

Breakfast is served in the large bar in the hotel. When we ordered breakfast we were told that there was only one person booked into our room not two. I was so embarrassed as I had bought it for my sister.  I let my sister sit at the breakfast table & went to reception to see what the problem was. Only to be told that the guy on reception the previous night made a mistake when my sister checked in & changed the booking to a single rather than a double. Also the bar staff must check the occupancy of the rooms as many people only pay for one person in the room.  I returned, bewildered to explain this to my sister & assure her I did pay for both of us! 

If you are staying here & have a car use Drury Street car park just across the road it's expensive but the reception will stamp your card for an overnight special rate.",2,2012,02,17
227,"Location, Location, Location","Having taking awhile to find the Drury Court Hotel (all one way streets in this part of Dublin) we eventually found parking.  We were in town for a rugby international.  We were given a double room on the first floor.  First impressions were that this room was small and as it was facing out to the street that it would be noisy.  However, this room was cosy and clean and had everything you would need for a night away and as it turned out we didn't hear anything from the street below!   The Drury Court is in a great location being in the very heart of Dublin.  The girls we met on reception were very helpful, telling us different places to eat, drink and what times mass were in the beautiful carmelite church just around the corner.  We did find €100 for room only a bit expensive but the location is worth it.  Also the parking cost us €6 for the night.   (Just be warned that if you check out, and arrive late back for your car you will be charged extra for any time after 12 - we arrived back to car park at 12.30 and the car attendent charged us an extra €2.90).  Unfortunately, Ireland lost the game but we had a great weekend in Dublin - thks to Drury Court.",4,2012,02,09
227,A welcome break,"We arrived early and were welcomed by friendly staff who were happy to look after our bags and guide us on our way around Dublin.  A very helpful woman at reception recommended a great place to eat and tips for getting around.  The staff were always friendly to help out when we had any requests.  Apples and newspapers in reception, clean rooms and common areas.  Staff were genuinely keen to help.  The location is great for shopping and a walk away from the popular Temple Bar.  Breakfast was excellent in the morning, fresh bread, good choice and nice thick bacon!  The stay made a great visit to Dublin even better!  Would definitely go back.",5,2012,01,22
227,Brilliant but could do with a shake up!,"I had the pleasure of staying in the Drury Court twice on the last few weeks and on my first stay was very impressed!  The staff were very friendly, I got a space in the hotel carpark, the location was superb right by Stephens Green, The rooms are spacious and clean and the rate was unbeatable! 

I really looked forward to my return visit the next week! However when I received my confirmation for my booking my rate was different from what I had previously been quoted so I emailed back to question this but yet it was never changed in the hotel system so when I checked out on the morning of my departure I had to question it again! Not a biggie but it should have been fixed the first time I mentioned it!

I had dinner in the bar and the service and food was excellent. 

I only had one other quip which was I believe when you go to a reception desk the receptionist should stand to greet you but while I was checking out she remained seating which annoyed me a bit! That's what I mean about needing a bit of a shake up! What I first thought was great customer service and friendliness now came across as complacent! I have stayed in many hotels and have a lot if experience and I know the fine line between been friendly and personable. 

It is great to have friendly staff but I think they could be more professional! 

My comments are more based at the hotel improving their service standards rather than any faults with the hotel itself! It is a great place and I will stay and recommend it in the future! ",4,2012,01,21
227,"Excellent Location, Comfortable","Drury Court Hotel is in an excellent location - right downtown, walking distance to Temple Bar, St. Stephen's Green, Trinity College, Grafton Street etc.  We very rarely had to take public transport to go anywhere, this hotel was central to most things on the tourist map.  The hotel also provides a very nice map of the city with major attractions marked on it.  The room is very spacious, with two double beds.  The bedding was clean and bed comfortable, and we were able to get a good night's sleep even with the location of the hotel being so close to bars.  The bathroom is clean, and the water pressure in the shower is also good.  The hotel offers free wi-fi.  Shuttles to and from the airport are also very close by, about a 5 min walk from the hotel, which makes it even more convenient.
Overall, I would strongly recommend this hotel to others - clean, comfortable and close to everything! you can't go wrong.",5,2012,01,14
227,Great Hotel in Fantastic Location,"I would recommend this hotel to any tourist looking for a decent, comfortable hotel in a great location that won't break the bank. 
You won't get too many hotels a stones throw from Grafton street for this sort of money and it's hard to fault this hotel. Room was clean and comfortable and the guy in reception was good enough to upgrade me for my second night to a very spacious room on the 5th floor at no extra cost. He also threw in a free breakfast which was very nice. 
The Bia Bar is a great spot also for both food and drink and I don't know any hotel in Europe where you would get a 2 course lunch just off the high street for under €10.
Overall, great hotel in fantastic location. Great value for money.",4,2011,12,28
227,Central hotel,"This is an average 3 star hotel at 3 star prices but it is bang in the middle of everything and because of its location, I think it represents good value.  The room we had was a family room on the 3rd floor with a double, single and fold out sofa.  It was a good size room, clean and basic. We paid €156 for B&B for four people for 1 night and booked directly with the hotel.  The hotel is a short walk to shopping and night life and dozens of restaurants.  The hotel claims to have parking – I am not sure I believe them , if you bring a car, plan to on street park it (metered during the day) or park it in a local multi-storey car park (€8 overnight and very close by) or street level car parks which cost €12 for a day (short walk).  The hotel says that they have 8 parking spots.  The hotel is moderately noisy from street activity and music from pubs and bars, but it is not too loud on the third floor.  Breakfast was fine, it was served in the pub underneath the hotel.",4,2011,12,19
227,Great Location,Nice reception staff. Easy check in. Nice room.Comfy bed. Lovely breakfast. Could'nt ask for more.,5,2011,12,18
227,Don't stay here unless you plan to be in a bar until 3am,"Very central but right on top of a very noisy bar. Asked for a quiet room at the rear of the hotel but the smoking area of the BiaBar downstairs is out the back and is very noisy. 
 Impossible to sleep as the shouting and music penetrates up even to the 2nd floor.",2,2011,12,17
227,Kids in Dublin!,"When my husband and I first planned this trip everyone back home thought we were crazy... but we´ve been fortunate enough to find this hotel in Dublin: great location, very friendly staff, room clean and comfy, nice shower and breakfast. And we travelled with a very active 5 year old and a toddler! The hotel provided the cot and bed linen as previously arranged, all to our liking. We´d visit again for sure!",4,2011,12,16
227,A SOLID 2-3 Star Hotel - Great Value and location!,"The front desk staff was outstanding and they were a VERY good value for the price and their location.  Down the street is Taste Food Co. (Cafe & Bistro) which was hands down some of the best food we had in Ireland.  We ate breakfast AND dinner there for two days.  The hotel is nothing sexy to look at and the bathroom, though it had granite countertop in it, was pretty 2 star (the bath/shower tub and stall particularly)  But those were small issues given its convenient location to everything.  We walked everywhere and never felt it was too far from where we were.  I look forward to staying here on my next trip!",3,2011,12,01
227,Helped in a crisis,"Stayed here with my friend recently, brilliant hotel, lovely location very central, nice rooms and nice breakfasts. Would also like to say a big thanks for being so kind and helping me and friend wen i unfortunately broke my ankle after we had checked out. Thank you for sorting us out another room at such short notice and for looking after our things wen i was in hospital. I wud definately recommend and stay again.",4,2011,11,21
227,Anniversary (Tim & Helen),"Wanted a nice central hotel in Dublin so i could show my wife the excellent city and its attractions. We found the perfect place, Drury Court Hotel. The staff were fantastic, very friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The breakfast on both mornings was absolutely superb, plenty of choice and all fresh. We ate in the hotel bar on the first night, food was excellent, the service was just as good.
We will be definately be returning soon...",5,2011,11,13
227,Wonderful stay,Couldn't have had a better stay in Dublin.   The staff were all professional and went above and beyond to help and answer questions.  The rooms were clean and comfortable and the location was excellent.  This is a great place to stay and I highly recommend it!!,5,2011,11,11
227,Drury Court Hotel,We can't say a single bad thing about our stay there - the staff was extremely professional and above board helpful.  Even so much as to help me pay a toll by phone and fixing a slice a toast in the middle of the night for my mother-in-law who felt ill.  The rooms were neat and clean - very comfortable - the location was priceless and we were just extremely pleased with our stay there.,5,2011,11,10
227,Average,"Shower curtain fell down in the shower! Nobody could fix it until the next day, i.e. after we'd left. At one point I left my room card in the room and had to ask the receptionist to open the door to get past the lobby, which was done without a smile or a word to me as I apologised. Parking is tricky at the back of the hotel, and I had to remind them when paying the bill that parking was free as it was charged to our bill.
Location was perfect for touring Dublin city, I stayed there after the Dublin City Marathon and it was spot on location wise.
The breakfast was delicious though,  and the staff at the bar were brilliant.",2,2011,11,09

227,"Great location, value for money and lovely breakfast!",From start to finish staff were warm & friendly. Rooms were small but perfect for city centre. The breakfast was delicious with a huge variety! Definitely 4.5 star rating not 3. I will not think of staying anywhere else on my next trip to Dublin!,5,2011,11,04
227,Great location for a fab time in Dublin,"My partner and I stayed here for 2 nights end of Oct-Nov. I've been to Dublin 2 times before but this hotel has a great location.
The hotel in itself is a 5 minute walk from Grafton street & the main shops of Dublin & also 5-10 minutes walk to Temple Bar area, it was also a 10 minute walk to the bus stop to collect our return bus to airport.
The hotel room had good amenities, was clean however the room was very warm and we both couldn't figure out the aircon, meaning the window had to open, our room was above the street so slightly noisy (this is a city so it's bearable).
Breakfast was amazingly adequate a full Irish breakfast, cereals, dried nuts fruits and my partner especially loved salmon for breakfast.
Entry service was a bit poor to check-in but the bar man/manager was very friendly and pointer out all great bars in Dublin on our map which was really good of him. 
Overall a pleasant stay.

Would recommend heading to Sr.an ciste (exchequers) & Boulevard cafe on exchequer street amazing food! 5 out of 5 in both.

Also save pennies and get bus from airport to Dublin city (air bus €14 return) 

Loved our stay in Dublin & would stay in this hotel again!

227,Lacking in Soul,Basically a Ryanair type hotel experience with zero frills. If you needed to be in Dublin for a specific purpose and needed a cheap place to sleep this would tick the box. However if you like to linger and have the hotel experience then avoid here. Could do with some serious upgrading/decoration.,3,2011,10,30
227,Great stay in Dublin,"Great hotel -- very reasonable, nice size rooms, even by American standards, excellent location, helpful front desk.
Only criticisms -- the wireless internet is free, but you have to repeatedly log in, ie every 20-30 minutes, the carpet in our room was a little old/dirty, and the street can be very noisy on weekend nights, so look for a room that is away from the street.

The service in the restaurant was average, but the front desk service was excellent.
Would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2011,10,29
227,I'll STAY HERE AGAIN,"Loved the spacious, clean room and the security provided by the hotel.  Hotel staff were very helpful.  Its location is great as Dublin is a walkable city and if you want to go further the Hop On Hop Off bus tour is a few blocks away.  There's a Dunnes grocery store near by if you want to save on dining money or the noodle take out is across the street . Pete's Pub is down the block and Robert pulls a fine pint of Guiness.  O'Neils Pub is nearby and has great dining and is a local favorite.  Temple bar district is close if you want music with your food and drink.  The hotel restaurant does offer decent food although a limited menu but it's comfortable and with a window table you can watch the street scene.  Some noise at night from the street but tolerable  and early morning as they collect the trash-bottles.  However, we didn't want to slep in so that got us going.  I'd recommend This hotel to friends and I'll stay here again.",4,2011,10,28
227,Strictly Budget,"The Drury Court is not a hotels in the true sense rather a collection of serviced rooms with a reception desk. Those who like coffee shops, spas, fine in house dining and watching the world go by while sitting in the foyer should look elsewhere.

The main thing it has going for it is price, which is very reasonable for central Dublin. The hotel is reasonably well situated with the city centre a very short walk away and there are lots of pubs and restaurants in the immediate vicinity. My room was quite large, much larger than rooms one would pay considerably more for but rather soulless. The room was clean but quite dreary and the although the bathroom was large the shower pressure was pitiful. I think it was an electric shower built into the wall, no doubt to save expense but not terribly good.

The bar and restaurant is a pub next door to the small reception area but you can walk there without getting wet. The breakfast had a limited choice at the buffet and the staff seemed overworked - we were advised to find a clean table. Bar furniture is not really conducive to dining so it was hard to find a regular rather than low or high table or a table with chairs rather than stools. Many of the upholstered seats were slashed and had beer stains - in other words exactly what you might expect in a pub. On the plus side the cooked breakfast was freshly made to order and was quite good, much better than food that is left under lights.

The Drury Court is not a bad hotel but it is not a very good one either. I recommend it to people on a tight budget who will get decent accommodation at a very reasonable price or to people who are stating in Dublin for one our two night for show or shopping trip but not for any longer and definitely not to those who like to pamper themselves for who want a romantic getaway.

Overall, a qualified recommendation for a brief stay that won't entail too much time in the hotel or for those who have to count the pennies.",3,2011,10,25
227,VERY ENJOYABLE STAY,"This hotel was a very pleasant surprise.  The location was superb, room was great, breakfast was DELICIOUS and the reception staff and manager were all really nice.
I would definitely recommend this hotel and I would definitely stay here again.",5,2011,10,24
227,Excellent Value. Great Location,"I've just spent 3 nights at the Drury Court as a midweek break with a friend. 
There are lots of positives to say about the hotel. Firstly book direct via the internet, we got an amazing deal that included a full Irish breakfast was was delicious, and cooked fresh, not buffet style.
Secondly the location was perfect. Walking distance from lots of shops and bars. Too convenient really as we were able to drop off shopping as the bags got too heavy and go out and spend more!
The staff were helpful and friendly without being too intrusive.
The rooms are a little tired, but are very clean and comfortable. There is noise, but that's what you get when you stay in a city centre hotel, and it didn't stop me sleeping - though the plentiful nightcaps in the Hairy Lemon pub across the road may have helped with that!
All in all, I would recommend this hotel for a good value, excellent location hotel and will certainly be staying there on my next visit to Dublin.",4,2011,10,22
227,"Good Hotel, Great Location","I stayed at this hotel for about 3 nights in April. We picked it for the price and location. Finding the hotel was a little difficult as there is no massive signage to draw your attention. The hotel was pretty secure and we found the staff very helpful. We had to change rooms a couple of times as the originally was a smoking room and we couldn't stand it, the second had people's belongings in it (that was a bit scary) and the third was just right - except for the fact the door was a little broken. 

The other good thing about the hotel is the couple of take aways right outside its door - perfect after coming home after a few too many drinks. The hotel is also very very close to the shopping centre and grafton street. 

Would i stay here again, maybe...........It was good value at 79 euros a night.",3,2011,10,21
227,Highly Recommended,"We just came back from a weekend visit and stayed at the Drury Court Hotel.  The reception we received from David was very welcoming and also very helpful with mapping out were to go in Dublin.  The staff here were also very courtious, food was gorgeous and the hotel was spotless.  Only downfall was we were at the front of the hotel so the street was noisy when pubs shut, but that did not spoil our stay.  Our overall stay in dublin was perfect and will be back again and will stay here again.",5,2011,10,18
227,Would recommend to anyone,Group of female friends got a great deal with this hotel and how lucky we were. The staff are second to none and are genuinely pleased and happy to help you and make your holiday even more special. The rooms were spotless and large and your every need is catered for and in my opinion it surpassed a 3 star hotel standard indeed i have stayed in 5 star hotels nowhere near as nice. Yes it was a bit noisy on a night from the people outside in nearby bars etc but this is the trade off for being central-earplugs thats all you need. Other than the shower pressure was very weak (mentioned by others on ta) I could not fault this lovely hotel nor its fabulous staff.,5,2011,10,18
227,What a great hotel,"Having just returned from a 4 night stay at the Drury Court Hotel we have to say what a great place to stay when you visit Dublin!
The room was very clean and tidy, the breakfasts were superb and all the staff were extremley helpfull and knowledgeable, especiallythe reception staff.
The bar attached to the hotel served great meals & drinks at acceptable prices the only slight critism was that the menu was slightly limited, but to be fair there many resturants within a short walk from the hotel.
We are intendin to return to Dublin (itis a great city) and we will be staying at the Drury Court Hotel again.",5,2011,10,15
227,Gammelt,"Broken bathtub, leak by the radiator in the bathroom and the AC didn't work.. ",2,2011,10,08
227,Nice central hotel in Dublin City,"I spent a weekend in this hotel with a friend of mine and we were extremely pleased. The location is very central: 3 minutes walking from Grafton Street, the staff was very polite and the room was clean and quiet. The shower would need some improvements but overall I would strongly recommend it.",4,2011,09,27
227,Loved Everything About It  - Including the Price,"Our group of 34 spent 2 nights here on the last leg of our 12 night journey.  Although we arrived early, we were  warmly and personally greeted by the manager and staff, who even gave us an overview of the hotel and our location in regards to attractions in Dublin.  This hotel is perfectly located  and within easy walking distance of Grafton St., Temple Bar, Christchurch, Trinity College, hop-on and off bus route,etc.  The hotel itself is lovely, with very clean and spacious rooms, a terrific bar  (great music) and restaurant, and the service was wonderful.  I actually would have expected to pay much more for a hotel of this calibre.    David, the manager even arranged an early breakfast for us before we left for the airport.  Speaking on behalf of 34 very happy guests, we will all highly recommend the Drury Court to anyone travelling to Dublin, and look forward to the day we can return.  Our thanks again to David, Sophia, and Ann Marie for making our time in Dublin so special!!",5,2011,09,27
227,Won’t be staying here again,"Booked this hotel on line and was very disappointment with it.  It states on their websites “Car Parking on site”  and We “also offer free parking at the hotel for guests” this not true as you have to park in a muilt story carpark which  is not on site and you have to pay for the parking and the car park gives a small discount to people staying in their hotel.

I booked a smoking room, cjecked in and was told none left whey request smoking and then they don’t deliver was told by the reception that was hard luck.

Went up to the room and the window had no handle on it as was open and could not close it and the noise from the street was unreal.  Rang and still waiting for someone to appear to fix it.  Finally got the window closed myself or with the noise I would not have slept.  They also state they have Individually controlled heating in the rooms no true as the room I stayed in the heating only went one way and that was up.

In all this is a 2 star hotel and would not recommend a stay her and would not be back.",2,2011,09,19
227,Great Service,"We made a reservation at this hotel and paid in full.  We had to cancel at the last minute on the day we were supposed to arrive.  The manager was amazing, gracious, and returned our payment in full.",5,2011,09,14
227,Book here sleep on the streets,"Folks you may find this story hard to believe (because I am writing it and I do), but I assure you it is 100% true.
From January 2011 to August 2011 I stayed in this hotel 2+ nights per week. tonight I arrived at the hotel as normal to be told we don't have your booking and could I wait in the bar until they sorted it out. Not really a problem as I was told I was their best customer. 
To my utter dismay the desk clerk Pawel unable to contact his superiors decided to tell their best customer their was no room for him. Some background, at the end of a month I would normally book 2 nights for the next 2 months, as it happened Pawel himself took my booking at the end of July for August and September 2011 for 2 nights per week. Can you imagine my dismay at being told I am their best customer and then being told I got you a room for 1 night only elsewhere as Dublin is very busy this week. I suggested he might be advised to disapoint someone else, but since he himself forgot to put my booking in the computer I was the one to be rejected. So folks can I suggest you book a hotel that honours their commitments.
I have travelled through business in UK and Ireland for 30 years and I have never been treated this way in any hotel. Can I congratulate the Drury Court Hotel on gaining the distinction of the most dishonourable establishment in Ireland.

227,Great little hotel in a fabulous location,"Perfect location! Right in the middle of things and a really lovely walk. Its close to some great bars and attractions. The room was large and bright, I was worried about the noise in our 2nd floor street front room as the live music from the bar downstairs was blazing when we checked in at 10pm but all was quiet when we returned after visiting a few of Dublin's lovely bars. 

For me, the best hotels offer a great bed, a great shower and a great breakfast. This one got 1.5 of these things. The breakfast was delicious, the staff extremely friendly and they remembered what we wanted. The bed was okay, Im a fan of a harder bed and this was certainly on the hard side. The shower was dissappointing. It wasnt very strong and seemed to stop quite a lot. It seemed like there maybe a problem with it but it was really a minimal gripe in an otherwise faultless 2 night stay. Would definately reccommend for anyone wanting a cheap and very cheerful place to stay in central Dublin.",4,2011,09,13
227,Great Location & a Great Value,"The location is really great for seeing Dublin - in the Temple Bar district (this refers to the area near the river where a sand bar built up, and not pubs), but not in an especially noisy area, so the hotel is pretty quiet.  An easy walk to Grafton Street, Trinity University, St. Stephens Green, St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin Castle, museums, very close to a nice supermarket with a deli in a nearby mall, and is surrounded by many restaurants and pubs.  The walk to Hueston Station (the rail point to access other cities in Ireland) is a 20 to 25 minute walk, but takes you along the river and past The Brazen Head - Ireland's oldest pub (we stopped there for dinner and a Guiness after our trip to Cork and the Blarney Castle).  Very friendly & helpful staff, large clean room with wi-fi, comfortable bed, and a nice large bath.  We stayed three nights, and would definitely stay here on our next trip to Dublin - a great hotel for the price(about $100.00 US / EU 65 per night)!",5,2011,09,12
227,Would definitely use it again.,We were going to see Riverdance in the Gaiety Theatre and wanted somewhere nearby for an overnight stay.  The Drury Court Hotel fitted the bill perfectly.  We had an offer called the Sunday Sinner which included bed and breakfast and a bottle of wine in your room.  Nothing was too much trouble for the staff who  were all very friendly and helpful.  We found the hotel very central and just a short walk to the famous Temple Bar.  I would definitely stay here again and I would also reccommend Riverdance.,5,2011,09,09
227,Great Location,"We have stayed in this hotel several times before and love it for its great location just off Grafton St. Loads of small restaurants just on the doorstep lovely for a coffee or breakfast if your not having breakfast included. We didnt on this trip and that was a mistake as we paid similar in Bewleys for a not as good breakfast!.
Bedroom was spacious and well appointed but no small touches like shampoos etc  Only soap dispensor s even in the bath/shower. Warning sign to use bath mat  as bath very slippery (which it was) but no bath mat was available. 
Reception area very limited but Bar Bia which opens off reception area is spacious and welcoming.",3,2011,09,05
227,Sleepless in Dublin,This hotel is in a good location close to all the main sites. We booked through the hotel's website which advertised free parking. When we checked in they wanted us to pay for it. After explaining the situation the manager said it was ok. Once we got into our room we found a used coffee cup from the previous guest and a used towel in the bath. Only managed to sleep at 2am as there is a club next door. A nice hotel with useless house keeping and you won't sleep! ,3,2011,09,04
227,"Good value, quiet, very helpful reception","This was in a good location without being the noisy-all-night Temple Bar area.
A short and pleasant walk from the O'Connell Street Shopping District and lively spots.

Worth a visit:- St. Stephen's Green Park and the nearby (secret) Garden, Iveagh.

Word of warning, despite online booking requesting Bed&Breakfast, system defaulted to room only and about an extra 72 Euro for the breakfasts we had.",4,2011,09,04
227,we enjoyed our stay so much we had to let you know about it,"We recently stayed at the Drury Court Hotel and found our room to be quite large and very comfortable and relaxing with a good sized bathroom, wardrobe and plenty of other facilities and services available.   The breakfast was excellent (had the full irish breakfast) and there were lots of cereals, juices, croissants, cheese, salmon, you name it they had it there.  They have their own bar / restaurant in the evenings which was always busy, we will have dinner there the next time we are staying with them.   All the staff were polite and helpful.  It is just a very short walk from Grafton Street itself and we just walked everywhere we needed to go.  We found the hotel to be a very good, comfortable and convenient place to stay in Dublin that is also reasonably priced, we recommend it to our friends and family and to all who read this.  Regards EM.",5,2011,08,24
227,Fantastic service,"I arrived back from my trip to Dublin this morning after a wonderful stay at the Drury court. Nothing was too much trouble for the manager and his staff. Whatever we called down to reception for, Ice, iron, glasses etc was with us inside of 5 minutes. We ate breakfast each morning in the hotel for under 10 Euros, there was a good selection of food ranging from a full cooked Irish breakfast to smoked salmon, cheeses and fruits. Should I visit Dublin again I will not hesitate to book into the Drury court.",5,2011,08,17
227,"Great Location, excellent staff","Stayed here for one night recently - Anne marie the receptionist was so helpful.
Allowed us an early check in despite our room not being ready. She offered us an alternative room. Ideal location too. Room clean and spacious. Only thing was there was no residents bar for after hours. We didn't eat in the hotel but it looked good.  There was no noise as such except a little street noise early in the morning but thats to be expected when you are in a busy City in a room on the front. Would definitely stay again. Great value for money.",4,2011,08,15
227,Exactly what we wanted.,"Spent 1 night in this hotel and I could not fault it at all. The location is exellent check in was hassle free and the receptionist was very friendly. The rooms were spotless and the beds are so comfortable. 
There was music in the bar but it did not disturb our sleep at all. The breakfast was delicious with a great selection. I would recommend this hotel to family and friends.",4,2011,07,30
227,Great discovery!!,"We picked this hotel from an internet search and we were extremely pleased with our find. The hotel is great value - big room, very clean and great location, near to Grafton Street, St Stephen's Green and many tourist attractions.  The staff were extremely friendly and helpful - we would definitely stay here again.

We caught the Aircoach bus from the Airport which dropped us off at Trinity College - only about a five minute walk to the hotel - great value at 12Euro return per person.",5,2011,07,30
227,Great location,"stayed here for 2 nights in July. Very good location, within walking distance to most interesting locations and shopping. Staff friendly and helpful. Parking a bit of a pain, but not insurmountable. Stephen's Green parking nearby. Hotel has a few parking spaces in the back, 10 euros per day.",4,2011,07,29
227,"Great location, friendly staff!","My husband and I stayed at the Drury Court for a week at the end of June this year. The hotel is in a very convenient location, and the staff was helpful and friendly. The room was a good size and was very clean. We were not bothered by any noise from the bar downstairs. The room rate was very reasonable, and we will certainly stay here again!",5,2011,07,21
227,Perfect location; perfect stay,"We loved our stay at Drury Court Hotel. Because it is not located directly in Temple Bar, the rates are a bit lower, but it is certainly within walking distance for a young couple. The staff was very friendly, the room was clean and the stay was perfect.",5,2011,07,01
227,Does what it says on the tin,"We booked at short notice on the internet and were not disappointed.Very clean,well run hotel in great location just two minutes from Grafton St.There are numerous bars and restaurants on the doorstep and the hotel is a great base from which to explore the sights of Dublin.The hotel has limited on site car parking for a cost of €10 per night which is very reasonable.
Our room was on the 4th floor and we have no complaints about noise.",4,2011,06,14
227,"Very Nice hotel, great location!","My sister and I really enoyed our stay at the Drury Court Hotel May 2011.  We discovered the hotel after searching for hotels on the Internet.  The price seemed very good and the pictures of the hotel were nice so we booked.
The staff was very accomidating.   We arrived before our rooms were ready so they stored our luggage so we could go sightseeing.  We had a bite to eat at the restaurant next to the hotel - the food was good, prices reasonable and service very good.  The room was larger than we expected and the beds very comfortable.  Shower worked well and ample room for two women to store their stuff.  Our phones didn't work in Dublin and the staff ws nice enought the let me use the computer behind the desk to contact and email relatives.  They also offered parking in the back of the hotel at a fantastic rate.  The hotel was wonderfully located - walking distance to Trinity College, Grafton St. and other places.  Overall we we were very pleased with our stay at Drury",4,2011,06,08
227,Like staying with your best friend,"Excellent from top to bottom.  I stayed for 4 nights in a 5th flr/back room then a week later returned for a 2nd flr/front room.  Both rooms and bathrooms were spacious and comfortable.  EVERY request for help was exceeded with a natural pleasantness and professionalism.  Manager, desk, wait staff and room servers were as understanding, thoughtful and diligent as your best friend.  Ideal location and just a block away from unnecessary noise.  Plus, around the corner is a same-day laundry, full service travel agency and Catholic (Carmelite) Church with the remains of St. Valentine.  Bar/restaurant serves late food and is a pleasant way to start or end the day.  The 2nd flr room was a little noisy but it was a weekend.  Otherwise the streets and bar were quiet at 10PM.  I will return.",5,2011,05,21
227,"Good Hotel, Good location, average breakfast","Just returned from a 3 night break at this hotel, paid for by my wife as a treat for my 50th birthday. The room was fine and clean, decent size, and contrary to what I've seen in other reviews, we both found the bed really comfortable. Unlike other reviewers I didn't think it noisy either -  we both slept soundly and comfortably. 
The Bia Bar was pretty good too. The breakfast wasn't outstanding (a bit of salt & fresh ground pepper in scrambled egg wouldn't go amiss) but was cooked to order and did the job. Nice pastries and plenty of toast as well as cereal also filled us up for the day !! 
Excellent location - near Grafton St, Trinity College & St Stephens Green. 
All in all pretty happy.",3,2011,05,03
227,"Great Location, Price and Service","Stayed there last week with my wife for the first time. Had a bite to eat in the Bar, good selection and very reasonably priced. The room was spacious and imacculately clean with all the necessary facilities. The bed was a particularly plesant experience, have stayed in plenty of hotels but this was truly memorable. Free parking on site included in the rate - a definite bonus and extremely convenient. Couldnt get over the location: completely central to all the best that Dublin has to offer: Grafton St, Trinity College and Temple Bar. Will definetly be using the Drury Court next time We're in Dublin.",4,2011,04,20
227,"Perfect Location, hard as a rock bed","After touring the Southern part of Ireland for 3 days, my boyfriend and I were looking for a place to crash in Dublin that would be cheap & central so we could get the most out of the only few hours we had to spend in the city the next morning. I couldn't have been happier with the location & price, but tossed & turned all night due to the uncomfortable bed. I prefer a firm mattress, but have to say, this was the worst hotel bed I've ever slept in. If you can deal with the bed, it's a great place.",3,2011,04,12
227,"good location, decent hotel.",enjoyed my stay here. The location off Grafton Street is great. It is not the ritz but then prices are reasonable. A good deal here.,3,2011,04,01
227,Top Class,"My friends and I stayed here on a Saturday night and I have nothing but praise for the hotel and its staff.

We received a warm greeting at reception. We then ate in the ajoining bar were the service and atmosphere are wonderful.  The food was fairly priced and just delicious. The rooms were spacious and very clean.

The hotel is in a wonderful location with many clubs and pubs within walking distance (make sure you take a trip to the hairy lemon acroo the road!!)

The one complaint I would have was with the female receptionist when we were checking out. She barely looked up from her books and just grabbed the room keys off me not uttering a word. It wasnt the best end to a superb stay.",4,2011,03,31
227,Fine hotel but reception staff not very helpfull,Stayed for 3 nights in the hotel. I had no problem with my stay but I had problems with the invoice issuing during checkout (first time I encountered this kind of problem) so I will not stay there again.,3,2011,03,30
227,"Good location, clean and helpful staff!","The location was great and we walked everywhere. We paid about 30 euro to get from the airport by taxi, and took the airport bus back. It you don't have too much luggage you can easily walk to the bus stop by the tourist information and take the airport shuttle bus from there.

The staff was helpful and gave us great tips to restaurants every night. The room and the bathroom were clean and spacious. Our room was on the second floor, right over the pub. It was quite noisy on Saturday night, but the other nights were fine and we didn't mind the noice. However, you might want to bring ear plugs if you're staying for the weekend. We will definitly stay here again.",5,2011,03,20
227,Sleepless in Dublin,"The biggest complaint is the noise.  Our room was on the fourth floor and we were kept up by the noise from the downstairs bar.  The music was booming until 3am.  We were also annoyed by the noise from the street, the people out bar hopping until the wee hours of the morning.  I highly recommend ear plugs if you are considering staying at this hotel.  We ordered room service one night and the food was good and delievered to the room very quickly, however, they charged 6.50 euro to deliver it to the room.  We had breakfast in the bia bar one morning and it was very overpriced.  They are nearby pubs where you can get a full irish breakfast for half the price.  The rooms were clean and good sized but the beds were hard as rocks and between that and the noise we went without sleep during this trip.",3,2011,03,14
227,"Fabulous, Fabulous & even more Fabulous","Flew with Ryan Air, even after all the hype they were really good, and on time.  Got taxi straight from airport as we landed late evening, approx 25 euro (although there is a fantastic bus service back and to to the the centre of Dublin and 5 mins from the hotel for 6 euro, or even less if you take up the 2 day bus tour with airport ticket (red busses)! Hotel staff very friendly, left cases there after checked out too, no problems with them looking after them. Bar brilliant and friendly. DJ and music all the time should you wish to stay there. Breakfast, full Irish was brilliant, set you up for the day! Room was big, spacious, clean, could have easily stayed there for a fortnight! Could not have picked a better hotel for touring either. 5 minutes from Grafton Street for the shops and 5 minutes to Temple Bar, if you go you have to do both. Loads to see. Caught the red hop on hop off tour bus. Would recommend the Castle, Dublinnia exhibition, The Guinness Storehouse and Gilmainham Gaol is a must (although this is a really busy tourist interest and you have to book a tour so better early on for this). O'Connell street, cinema and loads more shops to see. Loads of places to eat, but would recommend The Church, Irish Stew is lovely.  Don't forget to walk across the Ha'penny bridge too!",5,2011,02,22
227,"Good Location, friendly staff","Very central location, helpful staff, clean room, lovely breakfast overall great stay the only downside was due to the central location it was a little noisy at night but this did not spoil our enjoyable stay.

We went to the Gaiety Theatre which is about 1 - 2 minutes walk from hotel and also very close to the shops so it's in a great location.  

Couldn't fault it in any way so definitely plan on staying here again.",5,2011,01,03
227,Good 3 star central location,"Very comfortable 3 star hotel in the centre of Dublin with bar, restaurants and shops very close by especially Grafton St and Stephens Green shopping centre.

Don't need car in this place.Close to many tourist attractions of Dublin City. Easy to walk about and good street map available to help you find your way around..Hop on Hop off bus good value..Go round once before starting to explore and pick out places that most interest you.Close to St Stephens Green....parks.  King Street Shopping complex.  Great clothing shops for women. Classic and fashionable.",4,2010,11,29
227,Customer relations,"We could not go to the hotel the night we booked because we had to attend A&E. We asked the hotel for a credit or a discount against a stay another night but were refused.
I posted a comment on tripadvisor and we were contacted by the hotel saying they would get back to us. 
I then took off my comments from the site. 
That was the last we heard from the hotel.
Obviously I now have no intention of ever staying there, but if that is how they treat people watch out.",2,2010,11,23
227,very little to complain about here,"On Sunday, November 7 we travelled to Dublin to attend a concert in The National Concert Hall. We arrived around 4.30 and were greeted with a smile by the very welcoming receptionist. She answered all our questions and allocated us our room. We requested a top floor room with a bath and got both. Room 503 was spacious,spotless,and warm(which was very important on the night in question). It had tea/coffee making facilities,limited TVstations  - but we were not there to watch TV; extra pillows and blanket in the wardrobe. The bed was quite comfortable and we would have enjoyed a very good nights sleep except for the proximity of the night club(Break for the Border) which had  some thumping music and lots of loud voices up until about 3. However we were on the 5th floor so it was bearable. The bathroom was very well equipped with everything one needs ie.shampoo, bath gel ,tissues and a good supply of towels.
There is a very nice bar but unfortunately there was no food being served that night (Sunday). I don't know why this was. We ended up in Bewley's on Grafton Street as it was nearby and too wet to go looking elsewhere. 
Breakfast is also served in the bar area and it was more than adequate with a selection of juices, bread/toast, cereal, and the full Irish breakfast in various combinations. Staff here were excellent too and very friendly.
Overall I was quite pleased with its location(except for the night club).It is just a few minutes walk from Stephens Green Centre, Grafton St. Temple Bar, Trinity College.
On that particular night we paid 78euro for room and breakfast and I feel we got value for money.  (Room 501 may be in a quieter part of the building for any oldies like myself who value their sleep!)",4,2010,11,10
227,We shall return!,"The Drury Hotel was the best experience of a lifetime.  Sophia at the desk helpful always.  Sinnead & Paddy in the restaurant/bar always happy.  Peter very friendly as the innkeeper.  We could not have asked for more.  From the moment we stopped in and booked until we regretfully left.  If you want a  spot near Dublin city centre with more a family staff Drury Court is the place for you and yours.  I would not hesitate to recommend very highly Drury our home when in Ireland.  
We tried very unsuccessfully self catering apartment and could not be understood when trying to explain my walker and the avoidance of stairs.  Then when we discovered Drury well that was our 'pot of gold.'  The lift was no bother and there were no stairs involved in travelling to our accomodation.  
Even the laundry did not become a problem.  
Bia Bar for breakfast with not just a full Irish Breakfast but as much or less that you want.
You are in for a real treat when booking at the Drury the family style staff tremendous.
Enjoy all!

227,"Nice, comfy hotel","Found this hotel really comfortable & relaxing. Room was a fair size, clean & homely. Staff were very nice & welcoming. Breakfast was also included, which was very tasty. 

I love Dublin & this hotel is in a good location. Would stay here again.",5,2010,09,13
227,Absolutely disgusted - most definitely would NOT recommend,"I stayed in this hotel for a weekend with 2 other friends from Fri to Sun. 2 out of the 3 of us stayed both nights and the 3rd person stayed on the Sat night. Breakfast was included for the 2 who were staying for both nights. Our room was located overlooking the ""Break for the Border"" nightclub entrance which was noisy but if you intend on going out on the town then this shouldn’t be a problem. We had an early start on the Sat morning and the 3rd person from our party joined us in the room about 8am. Once ready, we proceeded to the breakfast area of the hotel - ""Bia Bar"" restaurant were myself and the 2nd party member ordered breakfast - 2 breakfasts! The third person stole a piece of toast from my plate while we ate. A late night ensued for our party on the Sat night and all was well until the Sun morning where at 11.30am we rang down to reception to request if we could have a late checkout (normally 12pm). The lady at the desk informed us that normally there would be a €25 charge for late checkouts, however it was agreed with her that as long as we were down before 1pm it would be ok. At 12.30 we received a phone call to the room from the ""Manager"" who proceeded to warn us that if we were not down in reception in the next 5 mins we would be charged. We proceeded to explain to her that we had arranged for a later checkout to which she said it didn’t matter as normal checkout was at 12pm and that she was telling us that if we were not down in 5 mins there would be a charge. At that she added that she “knew” about the 3rd person eating breakfast the previous morning but was not going to charge us extra for it! She would not listen to any reasoning and continued to warn us about the late charge. Naturally a rush ensued and with all 3 wet heads and barely packed suitcases we departed the room and calmly confronted the manager. We did not pay any extra charges and had a frank discussion with her informing her of her disgusting behaviour towards paying customers…….and this has lead to my writing this review. As an Irish citizen, I am completely appalled and disgusted that a hotel in the heart of Dublin where many tourists and visitors frequent would treat their paying customers with such disregard and contempt. I am extremely embarrassed as a country if this is the way we treat our visitors and wish to reassure them that this is not how the majority of Irish people would welcome them and can only seek to apologise for this despicable behaviour. I will never recommend anyone to stay at this hotel unless the Hotel owners choose to replace this manager and ensure that this performance is not repeated under any circumstance. We, as a nation, do not demand a good service and hence businesses do not have to enforce appropriate training as we are more inclined to accept poor quality and unworthy services. However this is just not good enough and I cannot express my contempt forcefully enough. Do not stay here.",1,2010,08,17
227,Good value hotel in central location,Great location. Bedroom clean but bathroom in bad condition. New toilet seat needed and shower curtain very dirty and smelly. Breakfast very good. Staff very nice.,3,2010,08,03
227,"""Do not stay here; take your money elsewhere!","I became more and more hesitant about reserving this room when I was reviewing all of the reviews, but had read reviews at a previous hotel located in another city that consisted of poor comments and did not have the same experience; (I can live with “rough” towels and hard-water as this is understandable).  However, I have discovered all of the negative ratings of this facility were true and accurate.  I do understand that this is a ""3-star"" hotel which means that it should meet minimum lodging expectations...but c'mon!!!  We reserved two rooms; one for my husband and me and one for our 23 year old son.  Thankfully the initial rooms we had booked were upgraded...the clerk was very kind as only the ""triple"" rooms, (one twin and one double bed) have air-conditioning...so beware if you don't like stuffy room with no air circulation.  Apparently there are only 5 rooms total in this establishment that have central air-conditioning.  They are the “triple” rooms.  Our son however had two twin beds in his room which does not have any central air-conditioning.  So, he decided to open his window and discovered that the window handles and locks were broken but fortunately he was able to open the window providing a little air.  Unfortunately for him the noise from the outside made it difficult for him to rest.  (I would like to mention that our window handles/locks were also broken and the window did not shut, reducing the effectiveness of the air-conditioning and made for some very interesting noise coming from the courtyard below - - the hotel is conjoined with private apartments).  The toilet seats in both rooms were broken and the toilet in our son’s room was extremely difficult to flush.  Both rooms smelled unclean and musty - - kind of like the underground in Dublin Castle area…if you take the tour you will understand what I mean.  The covers on the beds had stains/spots on them.  The beds were hard, hard as a rock and the pillows were very, very flat!  I also discovered trash in the trash cans left by the previous guest(s).   The parking situation was ridiculous!  At most “good” hotels, the establishment will validate parking so be warned and weary if you are told that parking overnight will cost you only Euro 7 to park overnight (1730 – 1000) however, we were charged by the hour from 1730 – 0100 when the parking garage closed and then the overnight rate from 0100 to 1000 costing us a grand total of Euro 41.50 for less than 24 hours of parking.  You figure the math.  Yes, my husband said he asked for parking validation by the staff and was told they don’t do it nor do they give a reduced rate for being a guest!  On a positive note, the location is a very good location so I can’t complain about that because we had great access to walk about.  There are no irons or ironing boards in the rooms but if you ask, they will provide.  There is no hairdryer in the rooms nor are any available so make sure you have the proper voltage/adapter if you bring your own.  There is not any complimentary toiletries provided either; although “3-star” it is a given to provide the minimum in today’s culture.  We did take advantage of the breakfast; was okay for the price.  Finally there are several upgrades that appear to be taking place like new tile in our bathroom, new sink faucets and granite counter tops…there are several older characteristics that in a normal circumstance would be quaint…but this facility is worn and unkempt!    I decided to wait on which establishment I would give my hard-earned money to until after I stayed here.  For the amount of money we spent, I do not recommend this hotel and would not stay here again and did not when we returned to Dublin.",2,2010,07,08
227,"Nice Hotel, Great Location","This hotel is located conveniently in Dublin, close to many restaurants and major tourist sites. Hotel staff was helpful and rooms were nice. No complaints and would definitely stay here again.",4,2010,07,04
227,Worst hotel experience - rude staff and dirtcy accomidations,"My stay at Drury Court was the worst experience of my life.  At check-in, I was greeted by a very rude staffer and one top of it, my room wasn't ready at the time as previously discussed.  Also, they advertise car park accomidations for 7 Euros which is far from the truth.  I ended up having to pay 28.10 Euros on top of the 7 Euros to get my car out of the car park.

The room was old, smelly and very unclean.  The bed covers looked as though they hadn't been washed in 20 years.  The floors were disgusting!

Upon check-out, the staff was very disorganized and charged my credit card multiple times for my staff.

I recommend finding somewhere else to stay.",1,2010,06,29
227,"Brilliant location, excellent staff, good value","I stayed at the Drury Court Hotel for 4 nights while working at The Taste of Dublin.  The location was ideal, 5 minutes walk from The Iveagh Gardens, but would have been perfect for a weekend of leisure in Dublin too as its very near to Grafton Street and St Stephens Green.

As a female travelling on my own, the hotel was very secure and my room was a good size.  The only problem I had was the pillows which were like sleeping on flat bricks!!  Fortunately a friend was meeting me on day 2 so I asked her to bring me a pillow from home, result!

 The staff were extremely friendly and helpful.  There are lots of good restaurants a couple of streets away as well as some of the best shopping Dublin has to offer.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat.",4,2010,06,17
227,Very nice Hotel,The hotel location is perfect for the sightseeing anf\d it is across the main shopping street. The rooms are clean but there is no lobby (small room) and the elevator is very old. The stuff was very nice,4,2010,06,05
227,"Location, Price, Good Breakfast -- A WINNER","LOCATION is primo at the Drury Court, on Lower Stephens Street in Dublin, near St. Stephens Green and the famous Trinity College.  The hotel is walking distance to numerous shops, restaurants, and parks, and not too far from the lively Temple Bar district.  The desk staff is unfailingly pleasant and helpful, especially Paul, who said, “If you don’t like that room, you have issues.”  He was right:  our room was not overly large, but big enough, quiet and comfortable.  Unlike many European hotels of older vintage, the Drury Court has a lift.
	The included breakfast offers plenty of choices, including the full cooked Irish breakfast.  One quickly becomes accustomed to eating tomatoes and beans along with sausage, egg and toast!  Although the Drury Court’s breakfast room is in the basement, the room is nicely decorated, bright and cheerful with plenty of light.
	A screw fell out of my reading glasses first day in Ireland; the Drury Court staff sent me a few doors down the street with instructions to tell them I was a hotel guest, and they kindly fixed my glasses for no charge.
	Reasonable price, great location, good breakfast; I have  no hesitation in staying here again or in recommending that others book the Drury Court.",5,2010,05,26
227,Great location - service ok,"Great located hotel near Grafton Street. A small lobby area, but quite ok sized rooms. The staff doesn't seem to be the most smiley and happy ones in the world, but thats ok. The hotel feels safe and its very quiet, even on a Saturday night.

Several bars and restaurants close to the hotel. Breakfast is served in the basement.",4,2010,05,18
227,"Great Location, Helpful Staff","This hotel is in a great central location allowing a ten to fifteen minute walk to get you almost anywhere you need to see in Dublin. It has a bar attached, The Bea Bar, that is reasonably priced making the Pizza and Guinness readily available without having to travel too far to get it.
It is a traditional hotel, that is to say, it's not modern but it has all the amenities of other, more expensive hotels. Our bedroom was large and the beds were extremely comfortable.
Staff were all helpful, especially when we got stranded due to the Volcano for three days even allowing free use of the internet (we did not have Wi-Fi) to search and book our trip home.
Breakfast was plentiful, both cooked and continental are available, the service was polite and quick. The breakfast room is on a lower basement floor but is easily reached by lift if you don't fancy the stairs.
The only drawback is the noise on Friday and Saturday night from the nearby nightclub that does make it hard to get a full night's sleep. 
We would definitely stay here again but we would also aim at midweek to avoid the weekend club goers.",4,2010,05,17
227,"Good sized rooms, central location","Stayed for a night last sunday night, good sized family room with 1 double, 1 single and a sofa bed, plenty of room, staff were friendly breakfast was great, tv in poor condiion but everything else was great, no disco next door on sunday night so no problems with getting good night sleep, parked in college of surgeons car park at back of stephens green shopping centre, good overnight rate of 6 euro 2 minutes walk away",4,2010,05,15
227,Superb value.,"Might not be a four or five-star, but we had a superb large corner room, which was light and airy with windows on two sides and in a remarkably good décor and good-sized bathroom with bath and over-bath shower. Everything worked! Bathroom was not in pristine condition, having obviously seen use, but everything was scrupulously clean. Staff were very friendly and helpful, and breakfast OK. Ideal location - Grafton Street literally two minutes away, and all delights of Temple Bar easily walkable in 10 minutes. They arranged a  taxi to the aiport for us which arrived promptly. Dublin is a city where you generally have to suspend belief in value for money and pay over the odds for everything, but this was real value for money. On our experience we would not hesitate to recommend, and would stay there again",5,2010,05,15
227,"Great location, noisy weekend nights","My husband and I stayed at the Drury Court for 3 nights earlier this month. I chose this hotel mostly for the location which great, right by Grafton street , Trinity college, and Temple  Bar and it was a great value for the money.  We were able to walk to many of the main attractions. The room and bathroom were clean but the bed was uncomfortable. The springs in the mattress were sticking right in our backs. The breakfast was very convenient and filling. We had an early flight out back to the U.S. and they had breakfast put aside for us before they opened the dining room for the morning which was great. Sleeping Friday and Saturday nights is rough though. The club/bar down stairs has the music blasting until early morning with loud party goers outside the windows. We didn't get much sleep that night and we had an early flight home the next morning. We were four flights up but we could still hear everything. I would stay here again but not during a weekend night.",3,2010,05,14
227,If location is your only  concern,"the hotel is two blocks from Grafton but is very noisy on weekends if you stay bring earplugs. The rooms are very tired our bathtub siding was torn and falling off, the window latches were broken, and the remote had no back. they did come and put screws in the tub siding and put duck tape on the remote but never addressed the latches on the windows. The breakfast was nice and they have internet. This would be my last choice in the area.",2,2010,05,08
227,Very helpful and friendly staff in very centrally located hotel,We stayed for one night after doing the Great Run in the Phoenix Park and found this hotel to be very well located in the heart of the city just a short stroll from Grafton St.  The staff were extremely helpful and friendly and because we needed to leave early agreed to put on breakfast at 6.45 which is much earlier than the usual 7.30.  The waiter saw us waiting in reception for the carpark to open and when he went out to post a letter returned to tell us the carpark had opened which was a real nice touch and made all the difference to us getting on the road a little earlier.  Our only complaint would be that we had booked a non smoking room and there was obviously a mix up or else the previous occupant was a smoker - we probably could've moved rooms but as it was just a one night stay we didn't bother complaining.  We'll definitely be back to this hidden gem of a hotel.,4,2010,04,19
227,"Really excellent location, well priced, clean and comfortable!","Final stay at the end of a long journey. Much better than expected (considering Dublin pricing) – big rooms, clean and comfortable. Location is this hotel’s feature – hard to get to by car (due to Dublin’s tricky one way systems), but wonderfully close on foot to the action of Temple Bar and the university. Decent breakfast too. Will definitely stay here again.",4,2010,04,14
227,Excellent location - great value - would stay here again,"We spent seven nights at the Drury Court Hotel in March 2010.  The hotel staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful at all times.  The breakfast was very good and well-attended.  Our room was on the fourth floor, so I missed much of the street noise surrounding St. Patrick's Day although my husband didn't sleep well one night.  

I would definitely stay here again.  This hotel is within walking distance of everything you would wish to see and do in Dublin!",5,2010,03,29
227,Good location but spoiled by the Disco,"As other reviewers have said, this hotel has a very convenient location, handy for Grafton Street and not too far from Temple Bar and has good sized rooms with excellent mattresses - if only you could get to sleep early! There is a Disco on the ground floor and the beat is audible even on the upper floors. That's the only downside apart from the fact the hotel diidn't seem to have a lounge. There was a basement dining room and the breakfast (included in the room rate) was good and cheerfully served. All staff were very pleasant",3,2010,03,15
227,Great Location; Lovely Staff,"This hotel is in a fabulous location around the corner from Stephens Green and Temple Bar and close to the best of Dublin's shopping areas.  
I found the room to be huge compared to some hotels I've stayed in.  The furniture was a little soulless but spotlessly clean and well thought out.  
Being February, the weather was close to zero outside but the room was warm and there was extra bedding in the wardrobe should you need it.
We ate at the bar downstairs which was relaxing and funky and GREAT value for money!
Breakfast the following morning was in the basement, a mixture of waitress service and help-yourself buffet.  The staff there were charming and friendly and made us feel very welcome. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would happily stay here again.",4,2010,03,02
227,Great city centre hotel,"Stayed here over a weekend in January and had a great experience. Hotel very central- just round the corner from St Stephen's Green shopping centre, staff very friendly and approachable. Room was of a good size, very clean and in good condition. Would stay here again anytime.",4,2010,02,02
227,"Great location, great value !","I stayed with friend at the Drury Court Hotel and we were really happy with it. It has an amazing location (really close to all the important places, but not in them, so you don´t hear all the noise). The restaurant is REALLY REALLY good and they had an offer of 2 main course dishes for the prize of 1. We stayed there for 3 nights, and I would definetly stay there again if I come back with a budget !",4,2010,01,20
227,Would definately stay again!!,"Friendly, clean, well located hotel. Staff very helpful. We booked our whole trip online, from flights to hotel and it was the most stress free weekend away we have had. After landing at Dublin airport we hopped on the 16a bus which took us into the centre of Dublin for 2.20 euro (lots of stops on way). Our hotel was 10min walk from stop. Get the Airbus for return to Airport for 7 euros,  less stops!  The only down side to our Dublin experience were the Polish beggers, they are everywhere. On the plus side, the food fab, the drink fab, the atmosphere in the pubs fab (The Hairy Lemon,  and for live entertainment, The Temple Bar a must!! My significant other.....a Guinness lover... had the experience of a lifetime visiting the famous Guinness Storehouse.  Be warned tho, prices high for food and drink, but worth it!!!!  We are planning a return trip very soon!",4,2010,01,19
227,lovely hotel very obliging,"very central hotel 5 mins to temple bar, we took the tour bus but you could walk to all the attractions. bus from airport 12 euros return get off at dawson st that is your nearest stop to hotel. breakfast fantastic very clean rooms ask for one at least on the third floor or above otherwise can get noisey.
dublin is hideously expensive hence plane full with irish people coming to UK!hotel offers two meals for price of one up until 21oohrs we reckon this saved us well over £40.also be aware that after 2245 prices go even higher a pint of guinness £6.50 same for glass of wine!!!",4,2009,11,27
227,Stay well away !,"Myself and my fiance stayed in room 104 , right on the corner of the street and above bia bar. We had planned on a relaxing weekend and ended up getting anything but. We didnt get a wink of sleep until at least 4 am both nights due to the incredible noise downstairs. The breakfast was very poor, 1 sausage, 1 rasher 1 egg!! The staff had little or no english. As we were staying with the use of a voucher i didnt complain .However upon return home i received an email saying they hoped we enjoyed our stay and they would be greatful for any feedback . I think all they wanted was a pat on the back, but i responded telling of my grievances and havent heard a thing since !!! Do not stay here if you want to sleep at all.",1,2009,11,20
227,Initial Bad Customer Service!,"Initially, when my friend and I reached the hotel, the lady at the front desk said we would have to wait at least 45 minutes before our room would be ready. She didn't even look or try to look as if she was trying to get our room read for us ( even though we came at around 2 pm). That receptionist was quite terrible. 

The room was fairly big, with the usual amenities - fairly good view from the outside and is pretty close to anyplace that is busy in Dublin. 

The room is fairly big and fairly nice and clean. Their buffet breakfast certainly is quite good and a good draw since you can save a bunch of Euro if you don't have to worry about eating breakfast.  Their Wifi is terrible though - I kept being disconnected from it about every 2-5 minutes! 

Overall pretty good, but that first receptionist was quite terrible!",3,2009,10,19
227,nice but noisy,"stayed here with my boyfriend paul and friends.not a great selection of food.very hard location to find at 3 in the morning.awa
ke early next morning with noise on the street.kathy cavan",2,2009,10,14
227,"Great location,great staff,great hotel!","As above and all that has been said before! We were travelling with a party of 8 from the ages of 20 - 82! and all enjoyed their stay. We were careful to avoid the weekends so did not have much noise from outside - only the Guinness lorry picking up the empty kegs at 5.00am but that is part and parcel of city centre life!
Found the staff all very helpful and breakfast good - Hairy Lemon opposite was good for food and drink and also Pete's Place down the road was good for friendly staff and an empty pub that served coffee ,tea and sandwiches. If you want a laugh do the Viking Duck Tours - our party are still talking about it 4 weeks on!!!
All in all a good base within walking distance of most attractions",4,2009,10,11
227,Would Recommend,Really warm reception and friendly staff. Loved our stay. Bit noisy at weekends if room is near the adjoining club. We could not find anything to say that was bad about this Hotel  Close to Grafton Street and St Stephens. Short walk to Temple bar. Couldn't have been in a better position. The Hairy Lemon pub right across the street and loads of places to eat nearby. Would recommend the Metro cafe  nearby for breakfast.,5,2009,09,23
227,Wonderful hotel with great staff,"Stayed for 3 nights in August. The room was comfortable and extremely well-kept.  The staff was accomadating and always willing to help.  The hotel is well-located for walking the city and is easily assessible from the airport.  We had a room facing the street so there was a bit of noise, but only one night was extremely noisy and that night was not a normal night in Dublin as the school kids had just received their grades and were ""doing the town"".  The breakfast was full and  tasty.  Highly recommended for the older crowd.",4,2009,09,23
227,great hotel,"stayed here for 2 nights bed and breakfast.  Booked online and got the 2 nights for £100 for 2 of us.  Great location at the top of Grafton Street, easy walking distance to Temple Bar, Stephens Green etc.  We were in room 408, very quiet and very comfortable.  Good breakfast, very helpful reception staff.  Would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2009,09,10
227,Good value for money!,We stayed her for one night... Rooms are very big and spacious. Good location for Grafton street and nice walk to the Guinness Storehouse. The only down side is the bar/club below . If the noise worries you then ask for an quiet room. We were so tired it didnt bother us. The breakfast was plenty big enough and good.....,4,2009,09,05
227,Drury Court Hotel,"Very friendly staff ! 
I didn't have to pay for the breakfast, got free breakfast for 5 days !
Rooms were clean
Negative points: the appliance in the bathroom that should take away the damp of shower didn't work, so had to open the window in the room while showering to get out the damp.  In the end of my stay the tap for showering broke down, but I got offered a new room (staff is great).  It can get a bit noisy in L Stephens Street especially during Thursday night, I had no problem with sleeping through it, but I can imagine people which like total silence for sleeping might have a problem with it.
But overall this is quite a nice hotel to stay in.",4,2009,08,30
227,Good hotel in great location,"Booked hotel as best value on Laterooms.com(Dublin is quite expensive!!). Was looking for good location so that we could walk to most attractions, including the Gaity theatre(had booked to see Riverdance...great show!!), & you really will not find a better location.
Not much of a reception area, but rooms nice & clean.Great breakfast(try the lovely porridge), & Jim in breakfast lounge very cheerful & helpful.
We asked for ""quiet rooms"",so the noise from the Bia bar next door(I think it is part of the hotel) did not affect us, although I did wear ear-plugs as recommended by others!!
I would greatly recommend this hotel.Why spend more money for a 5-star hotel in a such a lovely city with so much to see?!!!",4,2009,08,07
227,Much better available elsewhere & beware of noise,"The bar is about the best thing about this hotel, had booked a double room and ended up with a twin room. This wasn't too bad as I was in Dublin on my own when I got to the room I was expecting a double and single bed in the room, but found two single ""very uncomfortable"" beds. Tried both of them! One of the bedside lights had a blown bulb in it, and the other didn't work. I found the room to be very dated in comparison to other dublin hotels, the bathroom was small and grotty and the shower wasn't working 100%

As I was there on my own on business over a weekend I didn't bother to complain and was jut looking for somewhere to rest my head on a very busy weekend in Dublin, and headed out a few minutes later.

Firstly I decided to go to the hotel bar for dinner, which I found to be ok, but unless you  ask which I did was this part of the hotel, there is no way of knowing. I only asked as I wanted my check/bill to be charged to my room.

Upon returning to my room around 1 a.m. I found my room to be facing the smoking area of a very popular night club across the laneway, coupled with this I had an early start the following morning and didn't get to sleep until after 4 a.m.

The reason why I booked this hotel was due to an international match being on in Dublin this same weekend and this was one of the last central hotels available.

I can't comment on breakfast as I decided to check out as soon as I got up and showered myself. 

Overall review of this hotel I wouldn't bother with it unless you won't be returning to your room until 6 a.m. when Dublin is closed down for the night especially at the weekends.

Personally I have no intention of returning here again, and would not recommend staying here.",1,2009,07,29
227,Decent for the price - but beware of the noise and unhelpful staff,"My boyfriend and I booked the hotel for its central location and its price (we paid about 100 euro per night, breakfast included), and the Drury Court was decent enough on both accounts. We were less than pleased with the noise from the Bia Bar, which was directly underneath our room - on several occasions it sounded like the crowd in fact was partying in our room. Its decent enough on a quiet night, but if theres a party then earplugs are required.

The hotel itself was nice enough - decent rooms, good cleanliness, and close to the centre. Some of the staff at the front desk, however, was most unhelpful and apathic, and difficult to communicate with, some of them being less than fluent English speakers. And we were much offended to be offered a room for 280 euros a night by one of them when we unexpectedly had to return to Dublin a week later - so much for loyalty to customers! All in all a decent hotel if you book well in advance and dont mind some racket from time to time, but I dont think we will be back.",3,2009,07,28
227,Good location - good deal for the price,"We stayed at the Drury Court for 2 nights in early June. The first room we checked into had a funny odor – we called the desk and moved into a different room within 20 minutes and that room was fine. Lots of room to spread out. Wireless internet worked fine in the room. We paid 69 Euros per night and it was appropriately priced. It was a great a location, ok amenities, and breakfast was decent. Not much late night happens right there – I think most things closed by 11 or midnight. Its not close enough to Temple Bar to hear it, but close enough you’re an easy walk home, which we liked. There was construction by the hotel, so most of the time we slept with the window closed. The night service staff could've been a bit more friendly, but that's ok.

Bottom line, totally worth 69 Euros a night including breakfast, but if you’re paying over 85 Euros, keep looking.",4,2009,07,23
227,"Room fine, noise terrible!","OK, the reception was friendly, the room was fine and the location was great.  The problem is the adjoining Bia Bar.  On Tuesday night it is supposed to shut at 11.30pm but it was rocking long after that with the inevitable overspill onto the pavement.  Loud music and shouting punters do not make for a good nights sleep.  On Friday & Saturday night the advertised close time is 2.30am!  When I pay for a hotel Iwant to sleep not to lie awake listening to row outside.  If you are happy to join in, fine.  If not stay somewhere else.",3,2009,07,18
227,Great location for the price,"Stayed here one night during the week. It is in a great location, walkable to Grafton St and everywhere. Staff friendly and accomodating. Room clean and basic. The rooms all face the street. At 6am the Guiness truck came to change the kegs at the disco accross the street. It was really loud. The front desk said it only happens on Tuesdays. Other than that a fine stay.",3,2009,06,30
227,Good experience,"A good hotel in a good location.I was on the 5 th floor,no noise from Bia bar but a lot from the street outside,I used earplugs so it didn´t bother me.The room was nice and comfortable and the staff were friendly(except for the owner himself!)Breakfast was pretty good but could have been more to choose from.The food in Bia bar was very good!Over all a good hotel at a good price in the centre of Dublin,would recommend it and will stay there again!",4,2009,06,19
227,"Nice Hotel, Great Location.","This was the first hotel of many on our trip. We reserved two rooms, one for us and one for a friend. We were checked in by a friendly and helpful front desk person, no fuss, no muss. Our rooms were pretty standard and very clean. There is a bar on the first floor and it is on a busy street. By saying this, yes, there was noise in the middle of the night by traffic and late night club goers. But it's Temple Bar area, it's to be expected. It was conveniently located to walk everywhere. Our rate was very reasonable which included a most sufficient Irish breakfast. For the price we would absolutely stay here again.",4,2009,06,08
227,Hotel Hell,"Where do I begin.....First let me say that I am not an overly picky traveler; I can appreciate a  2 or 3 * hotel with just the basics, and I am pretty easy to please. But the Drury Court Hotel was, hands down, the worst hotel I've ever been too. The beds were rock hard; the front desk staff were apathetic and unhelpful (our questions to the staff were met with blank stares); the sheets and shower curtain had cigarette burns on them;  the smell of the hallways and room was bad; and the noise at night was over the top and relentless due to the bar down below.  If you're there on a Friday or Saturday night and have a front room, don't expect to get any sleep before 3 or 4am. Because I couldn't sleep, I ended up going out to get some pizza across from the hotel. The atmosphere around the hotel can only be described as something like an Irish ""Spring Break ""- wasted and obnoxious drunk people. I guess it's a decent location if you're college age and in Dublin specifically to binge drink. The only positive thing I can say is that they had a decent breakfast buffet with a lot of options.  The end of the story is that we were suppose to return to the Drury Court on the tail end of our vacation. The following day, however, I immediately booked at another hotel and canceled at the Drury Court never to return again.",1,2009,05,28
227,"if you have trouble sleeping, stay away, else a decent hotel","This hotel is located near a club that plays loud music - it did not bother me, but if you're one of those who get troubled by noise at night, definitely stay away.

The location was perfect for me, as I was working in Sandyford, and this was about 3 minutes walk from the tram that goes there. It was also about 5 minutes walk from Temple Bar, and about 10 minutes from O'Connell Street. Then again, Dublin town centre is quite small, so any hotel in the centre is not too bad location wise.

My room was very clean, and so was the bathroom.

The annoying thing about the shower was that it had a fixed head, and I prefer those where you can move the head.

The TV did not have a remote control, but I did not complain about that.

You do not get an iron in the room, but if you ask at the desk, they give you one, and they let me keep it for the whole week.

The wi-fi is annoying. They use a ""free"" provider, that puts adverts on your web pages, and then you have to sign in to the service every half an hour or so. 

All in all, this was a decent hotel.",4,2009,05,23
227,Great location and very good value.,"My adult daughters and I stayed two Sundays at the Drury Court Hotel in a triple room.  The staff was very friendly and accomodating for our early arrival.  The room was nicely appointed and clean.  We were within walking distance of Temple Bar which suited our purposes.

My only caution is that our room faced the back courtyard and that is an extension of the downstairs bar/restaurant.  We happened to be there on a holiday weekend so the bar was open until the wee hours and the noise from the bar was disturbing to our sleep.  At 2:30 am we finally turned on the TV and waited out the bar patrons.  Our second Sunday was much better as it was not a holiday and the bar closed around 11pm or 12.",5,2009,05,14
227,The weather was terrible so we made the most of the hotel!,"As has been said before the hotel is in a city center position. Quite easy to find (and i dont have a sence of direction!) and the food and rooms were of great standard. 

We was noisy outside late at night and in the early hours of the morning but don't book a city center hotel if all you want is peace and quiet!",4,2009,05,09
227,Unscrupulous Management,"The good location of this Hotel is the best this about it and that is overshadowed by the unscrupulous management and staff. They show very little interest in their residents after the financial transactions have been made. I called this hotel and gave my credit card details to provisionally hold rooms for myself and some friends. Having found a cheaper deal with a Hotel website I called the Hotel directly to cancel my provisional booking and was assured that my credit card details would be destroyed and no further action was necessary. (no written confirmation was given). On return from our break in this less than impressive Hotel, I then received my credit card statement which had a cancellation fee of almost £300!! The reception staff claimed that they had received no call to cancel the provisional booking and, to cut a long story short were very rude. The manager of the hotel was no better……he said the paperwork had been processed and could not do anything!! My advise is to stay well away!",1,2009,05,08
227,"Good Value, great location.","My cousin and I spent 6 nights on the 5th floor.  The location was ideal, walking distance to shopping and all forms of transportation.  The staff were friendly and very helpful as well as accomodating.  The room was very clean and the breakfast was consistantly good, they even prepared a continental breakfast for us one morning when we were going on a day trip and leaving before normal serving hours.  It is a bit noisy from pubs in the area but that is a part of Dublin.  We espencially enjoyed the seagulls outside our window who greeted us every day.",3,2009,04,09
227,Clean and Great Location,"I stayed here for 4 nights in January. The front desk was pleasant, the room was very clean, and the location was great.  Its located away from the general Riff-Raff which I took part in, and was able to get away from it at night.  The only downside was every morning I was awoke by noise from garbage trucks and dumpsters.  It was a little $$ , but if you want a clean room and bathroom, that's the gig. The room was very spacious, I had a double, and the wireless access worked just fine. Depending on the $$, Id stay here again.  I posted a few pics of my room.",4,2009,03,10
227,Nice valentines get away,"Me and my boyfriend went away to Dublin on valentines day and stayed in the Drury Court Hotel for three nights. We booked this hotel because it was really central to everywhere, and we didn't need to use taxi's or buses to get around the centre of Dublin. The staff were very friendly, espcially in the hotel restaurant, and we didn't have any problems checking in and out. Everywhere was very clean, including the bathroom. We were both very impressed with the quality of the breakfast, as it was a good start to the day with good service. The room had everything we needed, with enough space and good comfort. The only problem that we found with the room was that it overlooked a noisy bar which was open till late on the Saturday night. This caused some loud noise until late at night, but for the rest of the nights, it stayed quiet. I would recommend this hotel for couples who want to explore the centre of Dublin, but possibly not for families due to the noise.",5,2009,02,25
227,Great Location,"Stayed for one night in the Drury Court Hotel as it was easier for us to stay the night in Dublin rather than trying to getting a taxi home after a night out...  We stayed in room 102 and just as we entered there was a stong smell of old cigarette smoke..Thankfully you were able to open the windows to get some fresh air into the room...  The room I thought was small considering there  was meant to be a king size bed in the room, this was not the case..  The bed wasn't even a double bed it was like a 4 foot bed, it was very small for two adults.. The room was clean other than for the smell of smoke..

The Drury Court is in a great location as it is just off Grafton Street / St. Stephen's Green..

We were also told that when booking with them that the car parking fee would be €6.50 for the day/night which finalised my decision on choosing this hotel as most hotels in Dublin City charge €20.00.   They don't have their own car parking facility but do use the multi storey car park across the road. When I checked out we got a voucher for the €6.50 but was only told then that this was only for the hours of 5.30pm to 12noon and that we had to pay for the difference ourselves it we arrived any earlier..  We had checked in at 2.30pm therefore we had to pay for another 3hrs @ €2.80 an hour.  The car parking fee in total amounted to €15.00 and not the €6.50 specified..

The breakfast was included in the price of our stay and the waitress staff were very pleasant..  Breakfast was very tasty and a wide choice available- full Irish breakfast, smoke salmon and brown bread, good choice of cerals, juices and teas..",3,2009,02,16
227,Fantasic loaction and clean,"Hi, Myself and my Husband have recently returned from this hotel after staying over New Year and what a fantastic time we had.

The location of the hotel is great a 10 minute walk tops from Temple Bar and about a 5minute walk from St Stephens Green for shopping. 

The room we had was 201 and our friends stayed in 204, i have to say 204 was better. This was a corner room and was very spacious with 2 windows and a plasa tv. Ours was still large and we can not fault it at all. It was clean with tea and coffee making facilities, table and chair, tv and a large double bed. The bathroom was clean and we had maid service each day. We had breakfast each morning but also did not recieve any black or white pudding. You could help yourself to juices, cereals and fruit and there was a choice on the menu for a hot breakfast from a full breakfast to beans on toast.

I do have to agree the website pictures did differ from the room we had but were happy with them never the less.

As we stayed New Years Eve we did experience noice but we were out until early hours of the morning anyway. The second night we returned at 11 and went staright to bed and there was no noice at all. There is a bar on the gound floor and can imagine this getting busy over a weekend stay.

All in all we could not fault this hotel and was perfect for what we wanted out of our stay. We would definately return in the future and hope to sometime soon.",4,2009,01,07
227,"Dont listen to the reviews Hotel is ideal for the price, loved it!!!!","I have read some of the other reviews and i wanted to tell you mine. Hotel is in an ideal postiton for both shopping and bars and resturants, 2 Min walk to main shops and 10-15 mins to Temple bar.

I went with my sister and a Friend and i will admit that we didnt really go for sight seeing mainly the bars and shopping, but we were really pleased we could get every where by walking, and i really dont like walking too far!

The hotel was clean and the rooms were a good size, all the hotel staff were very polite and helpful especially at the reception. The food in the bar which is attached to the hotel is also nice and the staff friendly there to.

If you want good bars and pubs def go to the Hairy lemon which is just over the road, citi bar which is in temple bar(  the main strip of pubs, but there is loads more) has a club downstairs and you must go to The Temple bar pub on a sunday there is brilliant live music and so much fun, the band zebra 3 are brilliant.

we are looking foward to going back to Dublin in July and we will be staying at the same hotel.",5,2009,01,06
227,Enjoyed our stay.,"Having read earlier poor reviews regarding noise, I was not sure about booking, but am very happy that I did.  We requested a 'quiet' room and had no problems with noise, though we were there on a weekend in summer.  Room was large enough for 3 adults, was very clean and beds were comfortable.  Staff were helpful, and breakfast was adequate.  The location was very, very good--just a few steps to the pedestrian shopping and many restaurants and pubs.  Easy walking distance to Trinity College, Christ Church, etc.     I stay in hotels worldwide 50+ nights yearly, and although this is not luxury, for a short holiday it was convenient and comfortable.",4,2008,12,25
227,Not what it seems,"Well what can I say.take no notice of the description of this hotel, i dont know where they got the room photos?. I stayed on a Friday & Saturday night, did not have any sleep for two days, this hotel is next to a very noisy night club open till at least 3am, together with a bar within the hotel, DONT stay hear if you want some sleep. The receptionist advised me that noise had never been a problem, yet next day another person told me that ""we usually move people to room 503 when they complain"" !. The hotel moved me to another room (503), however it was not any better, the heating didnt work, the noise was just as bad, like another report rooms ending in 3 seem to be on a corner. The breakfast was OK, although the black & white pudding are non existent. I will say the location was good. So to summarise: A hotel that is different from the web site description where ear plugs are highly recommended.",1,2008,12,16
227,Ok hotel - web picture of room not very accurate,"The Drury Court is an ok hotel. The location is very good - central. 
The room I have stayed in was a bit different from the pictures on the web. Much more old fashioned....

Bathroom is also looking a little tired. 

On the plus side - 
The room is clean, the bed comfortable, there is free internet and it is good value for money.",2,2008,12,11
227,"Most of the positive reviews of ""great location"" are false","This Hotel is a a total disgrace, starting by the hotel manager, some irish guy by the name of Paul Hande as per what the receptionist wrote on me statement.  Paul is so rude and i have never heard a senior member and a figure of authority, that he should be, swearing so much infront of the guests. That is very disrespectful for someone in this position. He is so rude, and the smell of the rooms are just bad, the smell of sewage is just it and they don't seem to care at all to fix the problem. I told him many time to change my room because of the smell and it got bad. I would advice people not to book any rooms there regardless of its location: the smell of it wrecks your holidays or your business plans.",1,2008,11,29
227,Good Value hotel,"we stayed at the Drury Court for two nights during October half term.  The location was great, very central and close to shops, St Stephens Green etc.  Room was fine, plenty big enough for two adults and one child.  Breakfast well cooked, not loads of choice but quite adequate.
Would stay here again, good value hotel in city centre.",4,2008,11,04
227,Great Stay,If you are looking for  a great place to stay which is central and well worth the money book this hotel you won't regret it.,5,2008,06,28
227,Good location,"We stayed at this hotel for a weekend city break. The location is good as it is not far from Temple Bar, the castle and the shops!

The rooms were spacious, comfortable and clean. We were on the first floor which meant that is was really noisey on the Saturday night from people shouting in the street. Sunday night was quiet though so we managed to catch up on sleep!

Breakfast was fine, nothing special but it is plenty for a day of sight seeing. 

Overall it was good value for money for a city centre hotel.",3,2008,06,21
227,Great Location,"Stayed here with my two children for one night.  Hotel is in a great central location, within easy walking distance of St Stephen's Green, Grafton Street and Temple Bar.

The room was big and clean, with a nice, spacious and clean bathroom. Asked for a quiet room so was put on the top floor but would have preferred a room at the back of the hotel as we were kept awake until 5am by the noise from the pub opposite.

We ate in the bar attached to the hotel which was very nice.  Breakfast in the morning was also nice but quite a small cooked breakfast, however you could help yourself to cereals, pastries, fruit, etc...

If you want a reasonably priced hotel in a great location then this is great but be warned of the noise from the Hairy Lemon Pub, it's loud!",3,2008,05,29
227,Nice but noisy,"My husband and I stayed at the Drury Court hotel for one night in May. The hotel is in a fab location right in the centre of Dublin, the reception staff were very friendly and helpful and our room was very nice. We did not realise until we got back to the room (about mid night on a Sat night) that the room was directly above the hotels late bar and it was really really noisy until pretty late/early. 
It is a nice hotel  and offers good value for money but I personally would rather have had a better nights sleep.",3,2008,05,07
227,Great Location....be careful what room you get!!,"Booked 3 nights through laterooms.com.  Arrived early on the Friday and explained I needed a room high up as I am light sleeper.  We were given room 403, which turned out to be on the corner of the hotel, which also turned out at night (when trying to sleep) to be the noisiest room I have ever stayed in!

Very early the next morning, we complained and then given room 508, which is at the back of the hotel and is very quiet.  If you don't want noise, ask for a room ending 06-08.

Aside from this, the hotel was very well located, the staff were pleasant and did as much as they could to help us.

We had a great time once our room was sorted!",4,2008,05,06
227,"Excellent location, excellent food, front-desk service only OK","Booked with reserveahotelonline.com.  The hotel is in a great location, very close to Grafton Street.  There are numerous reasonable restaurants in the area.  I would recommend Steps of Rome, which is nearby the hotel.

The hotel rooms are very nice and spacious.  The breakfast was also excellent and elaborate.  Highly recommended.",5,2008,04,30
227,"Very clean, comfortable, central hotel","I was very impressed with the Drury Court Hotel, although I don't think I spoke with anyone irish in the hotel, they were all foreign employees. 

The room was very clean, the bed very comfortable. The bathroom was spotless. The breakfast area was fine, although, I felt, the staff should wait until you go onto your hot food before offering tea/coffee. There is an adjoining bar/restaurant which also has an external entrance. The bar area was very spacious and attractive, also the staff were very pleasant. There are very many bars/restaurants/shopping areas nearby. I would recommend a visit to the Guinness factory. I unfortunately fell ill on the holiday, but would say that the doctor and hospital were very helpful. I will go back again and to the same hotel, not the hospital and have a more enjoyable time.",4,2008,04,22
227,Do Not Book!!!,"As first time visitors to Dublin we checked out all info about Hotel .  All Trip advisor reviews seemed great so went ahead and booked for a 30th Birthday suprise.  Arrived and staff were ok, room was clean and adequate, so left bags and went shopping. Is central to all areas taht we wanted to visit.  Came back after dinner and as soon as we walked in room very strong smell of sewage, we told Reception and as they were fully booked, we were told to close the bathroom door and maybe it would go away.  No manager or supervisor on site on a very busy Sat night.  Asked for a refund so we could book in elsewhere, told no decisions could be made until the next day.  Ended up Rec rang supervisor and we were offered half our money back plus a comp glass of wine if we stayed the night.  Took the 3 hour bus journey home.  Very disapointed as this was supposed to be a special occasion.  Feel let down by the service at Hotel.  Should have paid the extra 20 euro for the Brooks Hotel just around the corner.",1,2008,04,13
227,Central good price,"4 night stay. excellent location. 5 min walk from Temple bar, 2 mins from Grafton St. 10 mins to O'Connell St. 

Stayed on the Top floor to avoid any street noise. The bia bar is open until 2:30 on Fri/Sat so if you are on a low floor I imagine you will get some noise from here, so if you are planning early nights request a high floor. We didn't get disturbed at all.

Breakfast was good. Room was fine - no complaints. Hot water, comfy bed, clean. 

From my searches this hotel seems to be the cheapest one this close to the centre of Dublin. Recommened!",5,2008,04,08
227,Central Location,"As a first-time visitor to Dublin this hotel was a good choice in terms of its central location! It's a good standard 3* (so no frills) but i didn't stay there to spend time in my room. It's situated in a safe area within walking distance to bars, clubs, great restaurants and shops (Grafton Street).
The frontdesk staff were efficient and helpful with directions. Breakfast was cheap and cheerful and the hotel also had free wifi which was a bonus!
A draw-back was no parking available for hotel guests so my suggestion would be to use public transport, especially coming form the airport.",3,2008,04,08
227,Lovely stay,"The Drury Court hotel is located in a great part of town... easy walking distance to temple bar, trinity, grafton street, museums and the liffey.  There were complaints about noise on previous reviews but we did not find this a problem at all, apart from being awoken by the barrels being dropped off at the bar downstairs.  We were there during the week though.  Loads of places for drinks, food and coffee near by.  Bar downstairs is nice and they do 2 pizzas for Euro14 sun-wed which were tasty and cheap in whats an expensive city.  Breakfast was good and served till 10.  Room was spacious, clean and with tea coffee, hairdryer, toiletries and lots of towels.  Staff were on the whole friendly and helpful. Hotel also kept our bags before we could check in and after we'd checked out.  Overall I'd def. recommend this place.  Very good value for money.",4,2008,04,03
227,Everything for a perfect trip to Dublin,"The Drury Court hotel is near to everything. Temple Bar is 5 minutes away, Graftan St Shopping is right around the corner and there are plenty of bars and restaurants near by catering for every taste. The hotel itself is very good - the service was exceptional. We had a problem with the heating in our room but it was dealt with fast and we were transferred to an alternative. The beds was confortable is large pillows and thick duvets, while the bathrooms has all the usual toiletries so no need to take your own. The breakfast in the morning was hugh and you could help yourself to cearals, fruit, yoghurt and pastries. When we arrived at 9:30 our room was not ready (we were no expecting it to be) but the staff were only too happy to store out luggage so we would enjoy the day without having to carry them around. A free tourist map was also provided. All in all a great  hotel in a great location and we would definately use it again if we went back to Dublin.

The hop on hop off bus is a great way to orientate yourself with the city - you will soon see that the centre is not as big as you thought it was. The Arlington Hotel on Bachelor Walk provide a great evening entertainment with a 3 course meal, Irish band and Traditional Iriah Dancing - 28.95 Euro great value for money!!! Guinness and Jamesons is a must!!!",5,2008,02,21
227,Excellent Hotel!!,"Me and my girlfriend Stayed in the Drury for three nights.  I wasn't expecting a great deal as it was quite reasonable in cost but the hotel is excellent!

We stayed in a twin room, which was a double and a single bed and a big bathroom too.  The room was very clean, the maids did a great job.  I understand previous people saying it can get quite noisy but we didn't have any problems.

The breakfast was good, although I have to say I like my buffet in a morning and this was one where you order.  The hotel reception were very helpful whenever needed.

The location is great it takes 20 mins to walk to O'Connell street and also about 20 mins to the guiness factory.  Grafton street is only 5 mins away and this has all the big name stores on that you find in the UK plus those great independent stores too.

Overall exceptional value for money I've stayed is worst 4* hotels in UK, how it's only a 3* I don't know.",5,2008,02,14
227,New Years Eve 2007,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for 2 nights to celebrate New Yeat Dublin style!!  The hotel was brilliant - I could not fault it.

The room was clean - with a king size and single bed.  Nice working shower which was really powerful.

We were in room 304 - and we were not kept awake by any late night noise - and we were there on New Years Eve - possibly the nosiy night of the year!!

The breakfast was really filling and plenty of choice.

A taxi from the airport is approx. 25 euros & takes about 30 mins.

It was our first time in Dublin and we loved it - everyone is so friendly.  Brilliant shops on Grafton Street and Temple Bar was the place to go drinking!!

You defintely need to view the Guinness factory and sample the black stuff!!

We would definitely stay at this hotel again.",4,2008,01,03
227,Steve and Liz,"Had a wonderful stay. The staff  young,charming,and would walk the extra mile so that we would enjoy our stay. Breakfast was good and the room was MORE than we had thought it would be..in a good way. Proximity to all that is Dublin (which is a wonderful walking city)was excellent.When we requested that the staff made reservations for us on a rail trip to Cork it was all handled perfectly as were all taxi reservations. If their is a complaint to be made its on the very early AM arrival in Dublin of the Aer Lingus flight from Orlando Florida.This,of course,is not the hotels fault but it does create about a 4-5 hour time seam before a room was available,but even then the staff was as accomodating as they could be in storing our luggage and offering suggestions.The REAL KEY to this property  is all the staff had a warmth and a smile all the time.",4,2007,12,07
227,Fantastic,"Stayed at the Drury Court for 3 nights mon - thurs. On arrival staff were freindly and room was ready even though it was 10.30am, rooms are clean, spacious. Grafton Street is  right on your door step Brilliant only a short Stroll to O'connell Street aswell. Never used the hotel bar as there are so many around the hotel would recommend a meal in the Hairy Lemon Pub across from the hotel it was Brilliant.Breakfast was fab in the hotel full Irish and staff were very nice. Overall would definatley return here on my next trip to Dublin and would recommend to anyone .",5,2007,11,27
227,"Great Hotel, Great Price","Our stay at the Drury was from Nov. 3-10, 2007.  Great things:  our hotel room was ready by 1pm, the receptionist rushed housekeeping after she saw how wiped-out we were after our long flight.  Good breakfast.  Nice room - they upped us to a triple room, only charged us for a double.  Location of the hotel was so convienent.
Bad - lots of construction going on around the hotel - the walls weren't enough to keep out the noise.  Some bass at night from the Bia Bar - but not too bad.  Hotel advertised that they had laundry service - not really so, they send it out, and you end up doing most of work anyway.  We trucked it to the All American Laundrette ourselves and only paid 9.50 euro per load for wash and fold service.  
However, the good outweighed the bad and we were pleased with our choice of hotel and would recommend it to our friends.",4,2007,11,23
227,take a crash helmet,"I stayed at the Drury Court for 4 nights from 28 October this year. I arrived at the hotel at 2pm and had a short wait while the room was got ready. The room appeared fantastic on entering, spacious, king size bed, good lighting and 3 windows. HOwever on looking out of the windows I was on the corner of the main road and the alley with the night club and bars opposite, the hotel bar below. I was in room 303. The noise from the street wasn`t that bad - worst on the tuesday night when I was woken 3 times but not as bad as expected. The bed was lovely and comfy with lots of squahy pillows so that probably helped. My main gripe was the bathroom - the hot water pressure was virtually non existent and was only luke warm. It took 45 mins to run a bath and get about 4 inches of water! Then I tried a shower and the pressure seemed OK but was freezing cold. On maximum it was bearable but again the pressure drops so much its little more than a mist - no good for washing your hair. Then on getting out the shower the curtain pole fell off and hit me on the head.
I reported these problems the following morning at  reception and they were very appologetic. The pole seemed to have been fixed that evening but repeatedly fell down every night so it was impossible to have a shower. The water pressure never improved either so it was just luke warm baths everyday, and wasing my hair n the hand basin which took ages to empty - theres definately something wrong with the plumbing!
All in I would probably stay there again, its a great location. The service at breakfast is good if you get down early, poor if you go late.",2,2007,11,05
227,No hesitation in recommending this hotel!,My wife and I stayed at the Drury Court for three nights at the beginning of October. We didn't know what to expect as the price was way below other hotels we had looked at. We were not really sure of the area that the hotel is in as we had never been to Dublin before. Checking in was quick and easy and the room was brilliant - much larger than I expected. Bathroom was of course en-suite and excellent. There was a small kettle with tea and coffee. The breakfast room was maybe a tad small for all the guests but the staff more than made up for it - they were absolutely superb! The breakfast itself became something we looked forward to each morning. Great choice and well cooked. We really cannot fault this hotel - it's a little gem and we will definitely be staying there again.........hopefully very soon!,5,2007,10,17
227,Brilliant !,"Having booked this hotel through hotelsclick.com and finding we paid around £108 for two nights b+b for myself and my wife we were a little ominous about it as it seemed too cheap for it to be of any quality with also its central location. After checking in and arriving at our room ( 503 - we took the advice of fellow traveller on this website to book a high roomed floor due to possible noise ) we noticed staright away the quality of the furnishings upon us...superb!
We have stayed in many hotels and for a 3* hotel, this is top notch stuff. We have stayed in quality 4* hotels before and the Drury Court has beaten some of those hands down. Lots of hot water, our room was spotlessly clean and towels changed even though we didn't need them changing.
The t.v. in the room has BBC1, BBC 2, Sky News and a few local channels. Toiletries are supplied i.e. shower gel, shampoo,  soap, shower cap, mending kit.
The wardrobe had two full length mirrors attached to it, the bed was extremely comfy as were the pillows.
We heard someone complaining at reception about his shower not working, but we didn't encounter no problems whatsoever.
 The staff are friendly, polite and kept our luggage for us due to our early check-in, something a recent visit to a Travelodge wouldn't do in Edinburgh.
The breakfast room downstairs again is decorated perfectly and the food is more than adequate. No doubt other reviewers may find fault at this hotel for whatever reason, but again, compare it to 4* hotels around the world and this one is almost a contender to be upgraded.
If you are after peace and quiet you may be better asking if they have a quieter room at the rear of the hotel as there are many bars nearby and revellers may wake you, but this is nothing to worry about at all.

If you like Indian food, try the 'Diwali' restaurant on nearby Great Georges street, about a 4 minute walk away. The food is of very good quality indeed and is cheaper then the Indian restaurant near to the hotel..sorry, can't remember the name but its 50 yards away from The Drury Court.

Cab fair is approx 30 Euros one way to/from Dublin airport to the Drury Court.

Expect to pay in the region of £3.50 to £4 per pint of beer in many of Dublins pubs.

There is also a TGI Fridays restaurant about 5 minutes walk near the St.Stephens Green shopping centre if this is of any help to anyone.

We do not have any photos I'm afraid, but if you need to know anymore, email us at graham.thomas99@btinternet.com",5,2007,10,11
227,A great moderate priced option,"We were very pleased with the Drury Court Hotel.  Although this site had mixed reviews, our room was very quiet.  We were in Room 308 and the only exterior noice we had was from the apartment across the courtyard and that was very minimal and either ended early or we were too tired to let it bother us.  The room had been freshly redecorated and was a good size.  The room had a queen size bed and a double bed.  The room did have air conditioning so it was possible to keep the window closed.  We chose the Drury Court despite the mixed reviews because of its location and were very pleased at the accessibility to Temple Bar, Grafton Street and St. Stephen’s Green.  If you want to take bus service anywhere else in the city, the #16 and #19 buses are 1 block away on South Great Georges Street.  We found the Drury Court and excellent value for a city center hotel.",4,2007,09,27
227,Very acceptable....for the price,"This hotel is lucky to have a reasonably central location but not so central so as to suffer excessive disturbance.

The Good: Breakfasts are outstanding. The price was for bed and breakfast and was an exceptional rate given the location. I wouldn't agree with an earlier reviewing implying it's 5* for the price of 3*. It's not. But as a 3* it's not too bad.

The Bad: Of course nothing is perfect. The rooms are all single-glazed and I was woken on two occasions by a racket going on outside. There was a problem in my room with the wash basin and hot water is more like tepid rather than hot.

The Ugly: Not too much. The bath was a bit grotty and the bed wasn't really as spotless as I would have liked but nothing which warranted a complaint.

If you want a reasonably good, central hotel at a great price with breakfast included then I reckon you'd be quite content with this place. Would I stay again? Yes but only if I could get a room on a higher floor.

227,Very nice hotel,"The Drury Court Hotel is an excellent base to see Dublin from. It is in the Temple Bar area but not right on top of any of the clubs so is nice and quiet at night. Although it looks quite small from the front and the reception is not that big, don't be put off, the rooms were a good size and the bathroom had a good supply of complimentary shampoo etc.

There were alot of Eastern Europeans working in the hotel but their English was excellent and they were always polite and happy to help.  The breakfast was excellent and included a fresh buffet of fruit and cereal as well as full cooked breakfasts or American waffles. We would really recommend this hotel.
",5,2007,09,08
227,Good Night's Sleep at the Drury Court Hotel,"This review is a bit late - but better late than never! I stayed in three hotels in Dublin in May, and the Drury Court Hotel was the second one that I stayed in. In my opinion, it was the best one of the three.

I used the hotel's web site to make my reservation, and then I followed up with an email. It took them about a week to respond. Oddly, they never responded via email, nor did they send me an email confirmation. Instead, they telephoned me to let me know they had received my reservation - and they sent an actual letter by snail mail. If you use the web site, don't expect an instant email reply. It's probably best to give them a call if you're anxious for a confirmation.

I stayed in the Drury Court Hotel after a week-long tour of Ireland on a bus (Shamrocker tours). I was SO happy when I saw that hotel room. It seemed so luxurious compared to the other places I stayed in! It wasn't a 5 star hotel or anything, but it was clean, quiet, and perfect for what I wanted. It also had a HUGE bed that was so comfortable that I fell asleep instantly. The Drury Court was the ONLY place that I stayed at in Ireland where I got a good night's sleep. I'm not kidding. It was unbelievably quiet, and I felt so rested that I wished I had stayed longer. 

The staff were very professional - pleasant, but professional. It seemed more like a business hotel in that sense. It was also a bit difficult to find - as it was situated on what appeared to be a side street. It was a bit further away from the site seeing and the more crowded areas of the city (which is probably why it was quieter). I would say that this place is great if you need a place where you can actually get some sleep, and if you don't mind walking a bit farther to do your sight seeing. For me, it was a welcome haven. Very nice, clean, and comfortable. If I ever return to Ireland, I will stay at this hotel again.

227,"great location, great hotel","A fantastic hotel right inthe heart of dublin. A short walk to the information centre and where you can pick up loads of buses, near to temple bar and very close to some brilliant pubs.
The hairy lemon is just opposite and O'Neills pub (live music upstairs ) is a short walk away.
The breakfast is great and varied and the staff are genuine and happy to help with booking taxis etc.
",5,2007,08,21
227,A good choice !,"The Drury Court Hotel is a 3-star city-centre hotel.  I booked for 3 nights - Sunday to Wednesday.  I chose the hotel based on location and also price - Euro109 per night b&b.  

This hotel is very central - 3 minutes walk to St Stephen's Green, St Stephen's Green Shopping Centre, Grafton Street and the rest of the city centre.

The staff (foreign) at the hotel are its asset.  They were all so accommodating and polite.  Very impressed.

On arrival to my room, I asked to be changed as there is a night-club entrance on the window-side.  The hotel was booked up for the first night but they accommodated me on Monday.  Both rooms were very clean and simply decorated - nothing fancy.  The rooms (well the 2 I was in) definitely don't look like the picture of the room on the website. 

Breakfast is buffet (cereals, juices, bread, tea, coffee, toast) and you can also have a traditional Irish breakfast or a breakfast of kippers etc. The traditional Irish was ok but I didn't like the fried bread etc that accompanied it.

Went down to Bia Bar for something to eat on Sunday afternoon and sat at a table but nobody came to take my order and tables weren't being cleaned off.  Crossed over to The Hairy Lemon bar and had the 'bruschetta' (I'm sure you can tell by my inverted comments that I wasn't impressed - they were tasty but I wouldn't call them 'bruschetta'! and they were expensive!), and I also had the chicken fajhitas (tasty but that's all).  Presentation of food leaves a lot to be desired - a few small dead lettuce leaves accompanied my main dish, I had to laugh.  The place is also a bit smelly in my opinion but it was busy, which is generally a good sign.

Went to Stufi's (directly across from the hotel) for lunch one of the days and had a panini and it was delicious.  

Another night, we went to Break for the Border (next door where the nightclub is) and I enjoyed the food there and the waiter was very good (I have found that the foreign workers are definitely nicer than A LOT of the Irish workers in the service industry)

The noise coming from the lane (where many hotel rooms if not all have windows out onto) is very noisy especially in the morning (with kegs being rolled, loaded, unloaded, rolled; cars etc) and most nights with late-nite revellers.  I was studying so this didn't help at all !!

I would say, all in all, I had a positive experience at this hotel and would go back.

227,Great value hotel,"Stayed in the Drury Court hotel for 2 nights.  The hotel is ideal as a base for exploring Dublin and has a great central location.  Rooms were clean and a reasonable size.  Hotel staff were helpful and polite although not an Irish accent to be heard!  Good breakfast included in the price.  If you are looking for a good, cheap hotel in the centre of Dublin to stay in, then I would highly recommend staying in this hotel.
",5,2007,08,03
227,"great value, great hotel","Just returned from a 2 night stay at the Drury Court Hotel, after reading some of the reviews was slightly worried, however there was no need to be worried at all. 
This hotel is in an excellent location, shopping and entertainment within a short walk. On arrival we were allocated a non-smoking room on the 3rd floor, it was very clean, more than adequate considering how much we paid to stay here.
There is a restaurant located at this hotel, if you eat here you are given a complimentary drink, the food prices are pretty average, (as, as a whole Dublin is fairly pricey) the food is freshly made and plenty of it, neither myself nor my husband could fully finish our meals.

Your complimentary breakfast consists of either:

cereals, crossiant, fruit, yoghurt etc
or
full irish breakfast (bacon, egg, sausage, soda bread, black pudding, toast)
or
smoked kippers

the choice is yours, also, plenty of orange juice/milk/tea and coffee

All staff are very polite and helpful.

We both enjoyed our stay at the Drury Court and will be going back for a return visit.
",5,2007,07,02
227,Nice Hotel Great Value for Money,"Just got back from a very pleasant 2 night stay at the Drury Court. After reading the mixed reviews I have to admit we were a bit worried but to be honest  we can find nothing to complain about. We had a room on the third floor and experienced very little outside noise although we did stay midweek and would assume that it is noisier at the weekend due to the amount of bars that surround the hotel. The staff were very friendly, the rooms clean, breakfast was nice and a great location. (I am 6 1/2 months pregnant so ideal for me as everywhere is within easy walking distance).We will stay here again next time we are in Dublin.
",4,2007,06,11
227,Good value city centre hotel,"We took advantage of the 1p Ryan Air seat sale & booked 3nts at the Drury Court.  We arrived in Dublin early morning, took the airlink bus into the city centre - O'Connell St.(10 euro return) & a taxi to the hotel to drop off our luggage .  We were greeted by a smiling face receptionist, she gave us directions into the centre (2mins away)& off we went to begin our short stay in Dublin.  We went back to the hotel just after 2pm to check in.  We had a short wait for our room (10mins) & then received the key with directions to our room.  We had requested a 4th floor room (due to reading other posts) which we got, room 407 was clean & spacious with all the usual conveniences. We experienced no noise from the street below & have no negative comments reqarding our stay.  I could carry on & describe everything about the hotel, but I feel I would be stating the obvious reqarding any city centre hotel.  Our 3nt stay was completely as we expected it to be, the hotel is modern & clean.  the staff are pleasant & knowledge-able.  Maid service is good & breakfast choice good - try the smoked salmon & scrambled egg ;o) 
We had a late flight back to the UK & again left our luggage behind reception until we made our way back to the airport.  I would definately use this hotel again & recommend to others.
",4,2007,06,08
227,"Great location, nothing more","Expanding upon my wife's review below...Drury Court is probably the best location for a hotel in Dublin.  Easy walking distance to Grafton St shopping and Temple Bar restaurants/pubs, as well as all the other major attractions.  That is where the positive ends.  Terrible staff who didn't offer to help with our large and ungainly bags, cheap motel-like rooms, and man did our room stink!  At least it was quiet, since we were on the top floor facing away from the street (undoubtedly their ""best"" room).  .
",1,2007,05,29
227,P.U.!,"My husband and I traveled to Ireland on our honeymoon. The first half of our trip we stayed at Dromoland Castle and Brook Lane Hotel in Kenmare. Both treated us like royalty, both upgraded our rooms when they heard we were newlyweds. We eagerly drove across the country (no small fete on those roads!) toward Dublin and the remainder of our trip. The exterior of The Drury Court is modern and sits in the midst of one of the city's best and most bustling sections. This is where the good news ends. Everything about this hotel stunk, from the moment we entered the front doors. No one bothered to help us as we struggled in with our luggage. When we mentioned our honeymoon, they didn't bat an eye. Then we get up to our room, after hopping over garbage bags and vaccuum cords in the corriders, and we are overcome by an unbelievable stench when we open the door. Besides this unexplicable stink, the room was easily the ugliest hotel/motel room I've ever stayed in- complete with window overlooking a dumpster and construction site. The ""new"" 12-inch table top tv was missing a remote that they apologized for but did nothing about. As for the stench, after being told there were no other rooms available, a day and a half later one of the many Eastern Europeans working there (there are no Irish folks at Drury Court!) brought up a scented candle and scented room spray. Super! Oh, and lest I forget the tub that had been covered with one of those cheap bathroom re-finishing deals of plastic rather than actually replacing tubs. It was all smashed in on the side. 

I can only hope someone reads this and opts for a different hotel in Dublin!
",1,2007,05,17
227,Very good hotel,"We were very happy with our stay at Drury Court.  All the staff were very friendly and helpful.  Our room was clean, well decorated, spacious and comfortable.  The bathroom was equipped with shower and bath.  Tea and coffee making facilities were appreciated.  The breakfasts were very good - lots of choice.  The hotel was ideally situated for all the major attractions in the city.  The noise from the nightclub next door could be a problem on some nights - fortunately we were on the 4th floor and were equipped with ear plugs.
",4,2007,05,14
227,Excellent Location,"Stayed here for one night on the 26th April. The hotel is very basic but perfectly adaquate. The rooms are average size. Ours had a double and a single. The double was a 4ft 6"" bed, so if you are used to bigger you have been warned. The bathroom was tiled from floor to ceiling and again was clean and in good nick.  The only complaint was the water never reached anything over luck warm. We requested and got a double on the fourth floor to avoid the noise issues other reviewers experienced. This did the trick and we had no problems. The breakfast room is also quite basic but the breakfast was fine and the service good.

The best thing about this hotel is its location. Two minutes from Grafton St and right in the middle of everything. It is more suitable for use as a base for shopping, touring, etc rather than as a romantic getaway location. But really at €99 b&b it is the cheapest city centre hotel of its standard that I have come across. Would definitely go back.
",3,2007,04,30
227,Great Holiday,"We are 4 women of a certain age who thoroughly enjoyed the warmth and hospitality of the hotel. Staff were great. We booked  4th floor rooms having been advised of the Club nearby  so had no problems although if you are a light sleeper take earplugs- worked a treat.
Full Irish breakfast must not be missed.
Bedrooms and ensuite v. roomy, clean and tidy.
Evening meal in the bar no pronlem although it gets busy later on in the evening.
Will happily recommend the Drury Court to all.
",5,2007,03,15
227,Fab,"Had a great time. Hotel is ideally situated, the staff are very friendly despite the fact that there are practically no native english-speakers and the rooms are fine. Breakfast is yummy if you do manage to make it down in time.... finishes a bit early for party-goers! Would deffo stay there again - and would recommend it.
",4,2007,01,16
227,Excellent Hotel great rates!,"Stayed for a weekend was a last min idea and I must say for the location and service the rate was really a steal!!...would easily have payed more! in the middle of everything excellent bars and restaurants at a stones throw... reception staff were really helpfull and so polite,rooms really spacious and spotless...was out every night so didnt hear any noise after 3am when we were in the room...A+++++++  property and service!!!!  : )
We will be back......
",5,2007,01,10
227,Super Location!,"The hotel is in a fabulous location. Two streets down from Grafton Sreet in Lower Stephens Green. No taxi's were needed all weekend. We were in room 505 and didn't hear any street noise at all. Yes the reception area is simple but what more do you want! The staff were freindly, helpful and very curtious. The bar has a really nice feel to it and they make excellent pizza's and mohitos! Graet value for money too! This  was my seventh time in Dublin and I have stayed in a number of hotels including the Burlington but for my money this is the best hotel for location and has everything you could need for a girlie weekend break. They also offer 10% for returning guests. For Grafton Street and trendy bars look no further than this gem of a hotel! Oh, and the bed was really comfy too!!
",5,2006,10,10
227,Great Location,"Stayed in the Drury Court hotel in Sept with my partner.  The staff where very friendly and helpful.  The hotel was fine the only problem I would say is the noise at night time.  The rooms are fine and all was clean. The hotel is in an excellant location just off Grafton Street.
",3,2006,10,09
227,Not a nice hotel,"I stayed at this hotel one night in September 2006 in room 106. I found the hotel globally quite ugly, the lobby is very simple, no charm at all. The room was quite spacious but dark. The bathroom was OK but the light was too low.  Breakfast was disappointing, with low quality products. I stayed on a Sunday night so maybe this is why I didn't suffer from the noise at night but given the location of the hotel and the fact that the room was not isolated (we could hear the air conditioning from the building facing the hotel although this did not prevent me to sleep), I can understand the previous reviews. During a few minutes I could hear the music from the bar downstairs but it stopped at 11.30 pm, before I went to sleep.
",2,2006,09,19
227,Don't expect to sleep,"My husband and I were put in Room 106 on a hot Saturday night.  The bass from the music blaring in the bar directly below our room came up through the floor until the bar closed at 2:30 am.  We were forced to keep our windows open because there was no fan or air conditioning in the room.  The loud voices of the bar patrons from the street below only added to the noise level.  
We complained to the desk receptionist, and apologies were made.  The man promised to talk to the hotel manager about it and arrange a room discount given the circumstances.  Sunday morning when we checked out, a new desk person ""did not have the authority"" to discount our room for our trouble, but gave us the email address of the hotel manager, Paul Hand.
In responding to our email, he promised to investigate the matter and respond promptly.
Despite our followup email, we never heard back from him. 
Unless you plan on experiencing the night life of Dublin until 2:30 am, we would NOT RECOMMEND staying at the Drury Court.
",2,2006,08,02
227,"Brilliant location, but poor room and facilities","My wife, adult daughter and I occupied a triple room at the Drury Court on the nights of 4 and 5 July 2006 (at a room rate of Euro 170 per night, including breakfast). The hotel's location in Lower Stephens Street is brilliant, close to Grafton Street and Temple Bar. But that's the end of my favourable comments. Our room on the 4th. floor was hot and humid, as the temperature control did not function. As a consequence, we had no option but to open the windows for ventillation, and this exposed us to night-time people and machinery noises from the laneway below. Our television was well past its use-by date, and no amount of tuning could establish a picture with appropriate colour or contrast. We had booked for 3 persons, but were supplied with towels for 2. Breakfast was served in a pokey basement, and the buffet food choices were not replenished as they were eaten. Any guests who arrived for breakfast in the last hour or so of the scheduled breakfast time found very slim pickings of food. On our first morning we arrived for breakfast at 9.15am (with breakfast advertised until 10.00am) and found that much of the food had been eaten by earlier diners, and not refilled. A choice of another hotel would be sensible.
",2,2006,07,18
227,Sleepless night....on a MONDAY!!,"We'd stayed here once before and it was fine, so when we booked it again we weren't expecting things to be so different. I know there were issues with nightclub/late bar noise, but this was a Monday night, so I figured we'd be fine.

We were given Room 108 - a triple room on the first floor, overlooking the narrow street at the side of the hotel. What a disaster!

We were first woken at about 4am to find the bottle carts from the hotel/nightclub across the street being emptied. This lasted 5-10 minutes.

Then at 6.45am a truck full of beer kegs pulled up RIGHT UNDER OUR WINDOW, and some guys proceeded to throw kegs off the (still-running!) truck onto the street, and load up the empties. The noise was INCREDIBLE! It lasted until about 7am, and we were just dozing off again when we were woken for the third time at about 8am - more movement of kegs across the street again - I think they had opened the cellar, and were now throwing the kegs down there! We just got up then - so much for relaxation...

It's put me right off this hotel - and I wouldn't mind, only the rooms and breakfast are good for the price. However, I will never take this risk again, and if you choose to stay here, I would strongly suggest that you refuse Room 108.
",2,2006,06,28
227,Rude reception staff,"We had a few problems with our room some of the lights did not work which we reported and was never fixed. The extractor fan in the bathroom was really noisy and kept us awake. Thee was a hole in by bed covering and the bathroom needed to be refurbished but we put up with this. Dirty linen was left by the lift for the whole of our stay. Breakfast also was not the best in a dingy room in the basement. But I was really upset on how I was treated on reception on checkout because I queried the biil the receptionist said 'oh [--]' and then started raising her voice. I was not going to do a review but I have now sent 3 emails and have never received a reply from any of them. So I now feel I should let people know about the lack of customer care.
",2,2006,06,23
227,could be better,"I looked at your reviews before I went. The reviews were mixed and the good price swayed me into giving it a try. We arrived at about 1pm. The room wasn't ready. The receptionist took our bags off us, we returned at 4pm. The room was ready. The room was on the 4th floor. The room was spacious. There was a patch on the quilt, The tiles on the bathroom wall were loose. There was tea and coffee in the hospitality tray. The room was noisy as there are clubs underneath and across the road, particularly noisy one night about half two. The breakfast was poor. My boyfriend ordered pancakes which were rock hard. The toaster broke down the next morning. I asked the hotel to book me a taxi on check out morning so I could catch the bus to the ferry. They forgot. We missed our ferry bus and had to pay for two taxis.
",2,2006,04,30
227,Loved it!,"The receptionist welcomes you warmly & are super helpful!! They do things extremely quickly and efficiently, so no-one really can argue about how bad their service is coz it really was gr8!! 
Lots and lots of smiley workers, makes ur stay a lot beta!! (u dont often get that in hotels!)
Clean rooms, very cosy and nicely decorated, and the bathrooms are nice too. Just the shower is slightly dodgy coz when you turn them off, it turns freezing, so run away from it before it gets u!
The only real main problems are that its quite noisy in the morning so it could wake you up!!
its fairly close to the river, and temple bar, within very short walking distance. stephens green shopping centre just round the corner to get pressies for families & friends!! Lots of bars and clubs nearby so PARTY ALL NIGHT LONG!! 
Hotel bar is so cosy and nice, looks amazing for a hotel bar!! 
i loved my stay & i definately would want to go there again! it was amazin going there with a large group of my mates and the price is amazing!

227,Great Irish hospitality,"Stayed at the Drury Court Hotel for 2 nights and found the location excellent, staff very helpful, breakfast fine.  The manager, Paul Hand, personified Irish hospitality at its best.  Rooms very nice, clean and comfortable.  Would recommend it to anyone.
Great value for money too!

227,"Good Hotel, would stay again","As a 3*, Drury Court is perfectly acceptable. Centrally located, ideal for shop & restaurants, and in a nice area of Dublin 

Staying Saturday and Sunday night there was a little nightlife noise but not enough to disturb or prevent us from getting off to sleep.

The room was nice, clean and well presented. Staff were helpful.
",4,2006,01,11
227,Good location but noisy,"Our family of 5 stayed 4 nights at Drury Court Hotel in Dublin.  We were in adjoining rooms on the 3rd floor.  We booked the rooms through Mr. Terry Butler, their Internet booking representative.  He was wonderful to deal with, efficient, helpful and friendly.  The desk clerks and Paul Hand, the general manager, were very nice and Paul was quick with a lesson or two on local Irish history.  

The rooms were very roomy and our three sons had a triple suite.   The rooms were clean with comfortable beds and extra pillows were supplied.  There were also a desk, table and chairs in each room plus a book on Ireland, nice touch!  However, the subsequent cleaning by the cleaning crew were not quite up to par.  Nothing overly serious but soap wrapper was not picked up by the side of the tub but overall, the bathrooms were roomy and well supplied.  

The major problem we had with our room was the noise from below!!  The windows did not stop the noise from the pub from entering into our rooms.  Our rooms were right above their pub on the street corner so we got it from two sides and with Ireland's no-smoking law, all their patrons ended up outside the pub into the wee hours smoking and partying on.  We had to have our TV on just to drown out the noise.  Needless to say, we didn't have any good night sleep in Dublin.  

The other issues were. 1. The TV cable (dis)connection in our sons' room, 2. The missing light bulb in the floor lamp and 3. running toilet.  all in the boys' suite.  We complained about the lack of stations and the snowiness of their TV the next morning to the front desk but did not get it serviced until the day before we checked out.  The other two issues were promptly dealt with.  Great!!   The TV cable was apparently cut by someone and it was wrapped together with a metal hanger.  Paul, the general manager told us he didn't know there was a problem until we ran into him the second morning there and informed him personally of the problem.  He promptly called in the cable guy and it was done the next afternoon.  Needless to say, our idea of booking two separate rooms to give us space from each other did not materialize as the boys camped out on our beds watching TV in our room!  These issues I felt should've been checked by the cleaning staff and serviced before check in but didn't.  However, with that said, these issues were dealt with as soon as we brought them to the hotel's attention so it did not reflect badly on the hotel.

The restaurant is no longer full service.  It's been sealed off from the pub since the design of their website and now only serve breakfast until 10 am.  Nothing exceptional but it was adequate for a quick breakfast to start off our days.

As with many Medievel cities, it was difficult to drive from one place to another and we were thoroughly lost driving in Dublin city centre.  It was frustrating driving around in circles for 1 1/2 hrs during rush hour traffic to try to find our hotel when we were within 1/2 mile of the hotel at all time and knew exactly where it was but just ""couldn't get there from here"".  I would recommend calling the hotel and get exact direction before venturing into the city.  The hotel location was great for walking to all the sites we wanted to visit.  Very central and we felt safe walking around in the neighborhood.  Great restaurants nearby!  

I rated this property above average because I liked the rooms, the location, the staff and the way the many issues with dealt with.  I would definitely stay there again but next time, a room away from the pub and the streets!

227,Only in an emergency,"Stayed at this hotel for one night and one night was enough i could not go back there.
The rooms are badly decorated and small street is noisey and staff are only so-so friendly. The Bar staff males are too busy talking to young lady's to serve other customers including me and to round it all off the staff drink shots with customers while working. Very unprofessional. At one stage one of the bar staff made a ######## in a blender served up the ######## to the customer and then drank the rest of the ######## from the blender container. The only nice part of this hotel is the beer garden that is at the back its nicely presented and looked after but thats it about this hotel. I wouldn't go back
",3,2004,08,24
227,Noise & Dirty Windows,"The service was awful and there was noise everywhere as there is a construction site outside.

Also the windows were very dirty and when we arrived there was an argument going on with the manager, as somebody wanted their money back.

After two days we would have that same argument with the manager and never got our money back or a discount despite little sleep and having to move elsewhere to stay.

",1,2004,06,10
227,Great hotel,"Our rooms were right on the first floor looking out the front, we had the clock just outside our room,but this made no impact on our stay,all i can say abouth the room was it was quite small and very noisy, However getting passed this was no problem as the managment would have moved us had we asked , we found the staff very helpful and the bar staff very attentive,was does let the hotel down is the downstairs dining room which was rather cramped and the breakfasts did leave alot to be desired,
We did enjoy our stay at the drury and would reccommend the hotel .  and visit again..",5,2004,05,21
227,Ok..not bad..but still renovating,"Still carrying on the rennovations but all in all not too bad... breakfasts were good but air cond non existent in bedrooms..asked for no smoking room but ashtray repeatedly replaced on table by variable room service (from 10 am until sometimes after 4 pm...inconvinient if going out early and wanting a shower..)
All in all the location makes up for a lot of minor problems.. the bar is quite nice but no ding room (suggest Jaipur....up-market indian 20 metres away) and of course Temple Bar.. a few mins on foot.",3,2004,05,10
227,Check before you leave !!,"On arrival to the hotel we were greeted with lots of workman noise as they were rebuilding the hotel. We were assured the work did not start till 9-30 and therefore not concerned. We were also told that our booking company were informed of this problem. However the noise started earlier than this on the Friday. Also the room was cold due to the fact the radiators were either switched off or not working. In the end we had to ask for a portable heater. In conclusion this could be a nice hotel, once the work has finished! But check if there is work on the hotel before you leave, and if there is dont go !!! Dont expect to complain when you get home, the management of the hotel or the booking company (...) have been no use so far!",1,2003,02,17

super friendly staff at reception (they also speak excellent Italian) and very central location just a few minutes from everything",5,2024,01,21
227,Highly recommended.,"I confirm all the positive reviews: excellent location, cleanliness, abundant and quality breakfasts. Beautiful, spacious rooms, my quadruple room could also be suitable for 5 people, shame about the blind bathroom.
The only problems I can report: bathroom fan not working, reported but not repaired, closed safe blocked, reported but not repaired.
Adjacent (connected with a connecting door) there is a nice pub, for a quick dish and/or a beer it's excellent!",4,2024,01,09
227,"Nice, family-run hotel in a very good location",The hotel is very centrally located to the city center. The reception was very friendly and helpful. The rooms were very clean and there was enough space for three people. The room has a kettle and various hot drinks. Room service even left a few chocolates as a welcome gift. The beds were big and good. We would book there again.,4,2023,10,03
227,Splendido Hotel,"Ottimo hotel in zona centrale piena di pub e posti per mangiare a 10 minuti a piedi da zona temple bar.
Camera spaziosa e pulita, letto comodo, ragazza alla reception super gentili (parlano anche molto bene italiano), ci hanno consigliato molti posti dove mangiare e divertirsi che sono stati davvero ottimi e non i soliti acchiappa turisti.
Tutto super, davvero nulla da dire",5,2023,06,13
227,Tutto perfetto e posizione strategica,Siamo stati per una breve vacanza di 4 notti in questo hotel. Tutto benissimo. Posizione assolutamente perfetta e strategica per visitare a piedi tutti i punti d’interesse. Lo staff alla reception era sempre sorridente e ci ha dato molti consigli su cosa visitare e qualche pub dove mangiare e bere bene a buon prezzo. La camera era una tripla molto spaziosa ed era ben insonorizzata nonostante fossimo al primo piano e con i vicini pub sottostanti. Pulizia perfetta. Ci hanno cambiato gli asciugamani tutti i giorni. Tutte le camere sono dotate di un asciugacapelli: se non lo avete chiedete in reception. Intorno ci sono molti pub buoni per la sera e altri locali adatti per il brunch.,5,2023,01,07
227,Excelente opción,"Estuve dos días en octubre en este lindo hotel muy bien ubicado en Dublin. La atención de las chicas (las dos se llaman Emma) de front desk es excelente. Siempre con una sonrisa, siempre dispuestas a ayudar. El desayuno que se sirve en el pub contiguo, es sencillo pero correcto. También allí la atención es amable. Creo que es una caracteristica general de la gente de Irlanda, pero no está de mas destacarlo.
La habitación muy cómoda y el baño muy amplio. La ubicación es perfecta para recorrer la ciudad a pie y cerca de casi todos los puntos de interés del centro de calidad. Además, tiene una excelente relación calidad - precio. Muy recomendable!",5,2022,11,08
227,Staff e struttura eccellenti!,"Hotel confortevole, posizione perfetta, camera ottima e staff superlativo! Gentilezza, sorrisi, disponibilità.... struttura super consigliata! Se dovessi tornare a Dublino sceglierei ancora il Drury Hotel!",5,2020,03,01
227,Wochenende,"Super Hotel für den Wochenendtrip nach Dublin. Sehr gut gelegen, alles in der Nähe und Pubs ohne Ende. Frühstücksbuffet ist frisch und auch warme Extras sind kein Problem. Personal super nett und freundlich. Zimmer sauber und nett eingerichtet

227,Un Bell'Hoel nel centro di Dublino,"Hotel molto comodo nel centro di Dublino. Personale simpatico e molto disponibile. Camere spaziose e comode. Peccato che non ci sia il miscelatore dell'acqua nel lavandino e i due rubinetti, dell'acqua calda e fredda, siano separati. Nel complesso un ottimo giudizio.",4,2019,09,28
227,"Confortevole, centrale, pulito","Hotel in posizione strategica per visitare Dublino. Stanze spaziose e pulite. Letto comodissimo e bagno con vasca (manca ovviamente il bidet). Colazione continentale varia e abbondante. Personale cortese, disponibile ed efficiente. Consigliatissimo.",5,2019,08,26
227,Peccato solo per una notte!,"Nel cuore di Dublino, vicinissima al Trinity College, aGrafton Street e a Temple Bar. Camere ampie, letti comodissimi, bagno pulito, grande e accessoriato.

",5,2019,08,08
227,Gute Lage und gute Zimmer,Die Lage ist ausgezeichnet. Ein sehr gutes Pub ist im gleichen Gebäude. Ein paar Schritte und man ist Zentrum von Dublin. Die Zimmer sind einfach aber gut. Das Morgenessen hat auch einen guten Standard.,5,2019,08,02
227,Muy buen hotel,"Localización perfecta y habitaciones amplias y limpias, trato amable y muy amistoso. Nos ayudaron mucho en temas de desplazamiento fuera de Dublín y la relación precio-calidad es muy buena. Hotel aconsejable. ",5,2019,06,04
227,"Tolle Lage, gerne wieder","Das wichtigste zuerst, die Lage ist fast unschlagbar. Wir waren mit unserem Nachwuchs (4 Jahre) dort und konnten alles wichtigen Punkte in wenigen Minuten zu Fuß erreichen (Temple Bar, Haupteinkaufsstraße, Trinity College,...). In unmittelbarer Umgebung gibt es zahlreiche Pubs, Restaurants und Einkaufsmöglichkeiten. Das Zimmer selbst war eine eigene Wohnung mit Küche/Bad/Wohnzimmer und Schlafzimmer im dritten Stock des Nachbargebäudes (Aufzug vorhanden). Das Hotel bzw. die Wohnungen liegen in einer Seitenstraße und sind daher schön ruhig obwohl die Wände nicht dick sind. Die Wohnung war sauber und auch das Schlafsofa für unseren Kleinen bereits vorbereitet. Einziges kleines Manko war vielleicht das kleine Bad. Preislich ist es kein absolutes Schnäppchen was uns die Lage jedoch auf jeden Fall wert war.",4,2019,06,03
227,"Ottima posizione, staff disponibile, stanza bella e pulita","L'hotel si trova in una posizione centralissima che vi permetterà di andare un po' ovunque. All'arrivo vi accoglieranno i ragazzi dello staff (uno più gentile e disponibile dell'altro) in una piccola ma deliziosa hall. 
La camera era ben arredata, con un letto matrimoniale (e non i due odiosissimi letti singoli uniti), un armadio spazioso e un bel bagno. Tutto molto pulito - il che non è comune dappertutto in questa nazione - ed ordinato. Il silenzio era assicurato dalle finestre doppie, che ci hanno permesso di dormire in pace nonostante la posizione centrale dell'hotel. 
Tra i servizi che ho apprezzato: un vero e proprio phon riposto nella cassettiera, tanti specchi nel bagno (anche quello per truccarsi), spazio a sufficienza per riporre le proprie cose (sia nella stanza - dove trovate il mobile per mettere la valigia, invece di dovervi chinare sul pavimento - sia nel bagno per i vostri oggetti personali), doccia pulita e ganci per appendere gli asciugamano.
La colazione viene servita nel pub accanto che comunica con l'hotel, rendendo l'esperienza anche molto caratteristica. Anche lì staff gentile e disponibile, che prende le tue ordinazioni (le cose calde le preparano sul momento in cucina, così come il caffè o il cappuccino che sia).
L'unico appunto è quello che faccio a tutti gli hotel dell'Irlanda: mettete un miscelatore nel rubinetto perché non tutti amano lavarsi miscelando l'acqua nel lavandino.

Torneremo sicuramente, fosse anche solo per la disponibilità e gentilezza di tutto lo staff. Continuate così!",5,2019,03,10
227,Difícil encontrar algo mejor,"Estuvimos alojados 2 noches una amiga y yo. Habitaciones amplias, limpias, silenciosas, camas cómodas, baño amplio, hotel limpio, desayuno razonable por el precio. Situado a escasos metros de todo lo que hay que hacer y ver en Dublín, pero sin el ruido del centro, a pesar de estar en el centro. Relación calidad precio perfecta. Inmejorable",5,2019,02,07
227,Gerne wieder:),"Das Hotel hat eine unglaublich tolle Lage ! Man erreicht fast alles ganz easy zu Fuß und in der Umgebung befindet sich alles an coolen Pubs, Restaurants, Bars und Shopping Möglichkeiten. 
Das Zimmer war wirklich toll (Raum 503) sehr geräumig, sauber und durch die Doppel Verglasung der Fenster total leise ! Ich möchte betönen, dass wir zu new years Eve da waren und nichts gehört haben, von dem was unten auf der Straße abging !
Das Hotel Personal war unglaublich nett und zuvorkommend- wirklich ganz großes Lob !
Das Frühstück ist ok, ich kann aber empfehlen es nicht im Hotel einzunehmen, sondern in der Umgebung zu schauen ! Kleiner Tipp das METRO zwei Ecken weiter bietet ein top Frühstück an !
Das Hotel ist echt super und wir haben uns total wohl gefühlt! Dennoch gibt es einen Punkt Abzug, denn es hat kein ,wow‘ Effekt und dafür hohe Preise !
Aber wir werden bestimmt wieder kommen!",4,2019,01,01
227,Fate molta attenzione!,"Camere prenotate ad agosto su booking.com per novembre ,
con cancellazione gratuita fino a 24 ore prima dell’arrivo.

Ho riscontrato con dispiacere il blocco sulla carta di credito dell’intera somma della prenotazione per addirittura 14 giorni. Dopo avere chiesto spiegazioni mi è stato risposto che si dovevano tutelare per verificare che la carta fosse valida. 

Irritato dalla risposta molto poco professionale (è legittimo controllare ma poi devi sbloccare subito la somma) ho cancellato la prenotazione ed ho dovuto attendere altri 14 giorni per avere nuovamente l’intera somma disponibile. 

Pertanto per 28 giorni i soldi dell’intera prenotazione sono stati bloccati dal l’hotel rendendoli indisponibili sulla mia carta di credito, una cosa veramente poco professionale ed un abuso che mi ha causato non pochi disagi impedendomi di effettuare altri pagamenti. Situazione risolta solo grazie al ripetuto intervento di booking.com 

Fate attenzione perché anche se millantano la cancellazione gratuita comunque vi bloccano i soldi sulla carta di credito per diverse settimane.

Ripeto poco professionali e ai limiti dell’azione legale.",1,2018,08,25
227,gerne wieder ,"Ideal für einen Kurzurlaub in Dublin, mitten im Zentrum. 

Meine Frau und ich haben das Hotel über Internet gebucht und zwei Nächte hier verbracht. Wir waren restlos zufrieden: wir haben ein grosses Dreibettzimmer erhalten, grosses Bad, Zimmer und Bad waren sauber, die Recéption freundlich und hilfsbereit, wir sind vor 13:00 Uhr angekommen und konnten das Zimmer bereits beziehen - alles in allem bestens. 

Frühstück : normal, kein Höhenflug, aber für den Preis von  €9.95 ganz in Ordnung.

Nachts : Musik vom gegenüber liegenden Pub bis ca. 23:30 Uhr, danach hin und wieder jolende Jugendliche - aber das gehört zu einer Zentrumslage.",5,2018,08,23
227,Überteuert,"Dieses Hotel profitiert von der zentralen Lage, ist jedoch überteuert. Enge kleine Lobby, Zimmer ok, Frühstück ok. Der Renovationsbedarf ist vor allem in den Bädern sichtbar. Nettes und aufmerksames Personal. Nachts sehr lärmig, der Frühstücksraum wird ab Mittag ein Pub mit lebhaftem Publikum auch draussen vor der Türe",3,2018,08,12
227,Piacevole sorpresa,"Abbiamo alloggiato solamente una notte in una camera tripla, al 4° piano, e siamo stati veramente bene.
La camera era spaziosa, ben arredata, silenziosa e pulita.
Sottolineo pulita perché ho constatato che in Irlanda, in genere, non è sempre da dare per scontato.
Il terzo letto era quasi 1 piazza e mezza e non il letto pieghevole o il divano letto che spesso ho trovato in diversi alberghi.
Anche il bagno, spazioso e comodo.
La posizione, poi, è ottima. A due passi dalla zona del Temple Bar e dal centro.
Staff molto gentile e disponibile.
Wi Fi gratuito e veloce.
Per la colazione non posso dare un giudizio perché non abbiamo fruito di quella dell'hotel.
La prossima volta che torneremo a Dublino sarà la prima struttura presso la quale alloggiare.
Altro punto a favore è il parcheggio (a pagamento non dell'albergo) che si trova proprio di fronte con il quale hanno una convenzione.
Veramente buono anche il rapporto qualità/prezzo.
Lo consiglio senza alcuna esitazione.",5,2018,06,06
227,Alojamiento Regular en Ubicación Perfecta,"Estuvimos en los apartamentos que están a 20metros del Hotel, aunque el check in se hace en la misma recepción del Hotel. Lo mejor que tiene es la ubicación por el precio que es inmejorable para ver todo caminando. El apartamento está limpio pero descuidado, bombillas que no van, sofá cama para uno ,pero para 2 personas imposible, puerta de la cocina suelta y que se cayó al abrirla.  Detalles que no cuestan mucho pero no dan buena imagen e incomodan. Recepción Correcta.",4,2018,04,26
227,Cordialità e centralità,"Week end lungo a Dublino in questa location molto comoda perchè in pieno centro, pulita e accogliente. Il personale è cordiale,  le camere pulite e nonostante i pub nelle vicinanze anche molto silenziose. 
Location perfetta per un week end.",4,2018,04,18
227,Continuate così: a presto! ,"Abbiamo pernottato per 4 notti in questo comodo hotel a pochi minuti a piedi da Temple Bar e siamo rimasti piacevolmente sorpresi. Prima di tutto siamo stati accolti da uno staff veramente gentilissimo e disponibile a ogni nostra richiesta al quale voglio fare i miei più sinceri complimenti.
Per quanto riguarda le camere sono belle, spaziose, comode e pulite.
Penso sia veramente difficile trovare qualcosa di meglio a Dublino come rapporto qualità prezzo.
Se dovessi ripassare per Dublino prossimamente ci tornerò di sicuro!",5,2018,03,30
227,The top in Dublin,"Abbiamo preso un appartamento da sei persone per una vacanza in famiglia.
L'appartamento era perfetto ed esattamente come descritto al momento della prenotazione,caldo pulito con tutto il necessario ed i letti erano nuovi e molto comodi.
Situato a due minuti di cammino da St. Stephens green è punto ideale per visitare la città ed ha un ottimo ristorante oltre a diversi pub nelle immediate vicinanze.
Un altro plus è sicuramente lo staff,sia in reception che al ristorante. Gentili e preparati cercano di rendere la tua esperienza a Dublino la migliore possibile.
Nessun rumore durante la notte hanno reso il nostro soggiorno veramente unico.
Secondo me uno dei migliori hotel in città per il rapporto qualità prezzo.",5,2018,03,16
227,Bellissima vacanza,L'albergo è situato a pochi minuti dal vivissimo centro della città ed è quindi una ottima scelta anche per i trasporti. Le camere sono insonorizzate e ai dorme benissimo. Il personale é gentile e disponibile per qualsiasi cosa.  ,5,2018,02,06
227,Localización y servicio inmejorables.,Estuve seis días en Dublín por motivos de negocio aunque buscaba una localización que me permitiera hacer algo de turismo en la.ciudad.

La limpieza.del.hotel es excelente y las habitaciones tienen un excelente espacio.,5,2018,02,03
227,Inverno in Irlanda,"Quello che non mi è piaciuto:
Dispiaciuta, essendo sotto Natale, di aver trovato una sala colazione e una hall veramente scarna di decorazioni. Durante la scorsa visita nel 2014 nel bar c'era un bellissimo albero decorato, quest'anno niente, ed è stato un peccato essendo tutta la città avvolta nell'atmosfera natalizia.

Quello che (ormai come sempre) mi piace:
Ormai quando vengo a Dublino soggiorno sempre al Drury, e questa è la quarta volta. Direi quindi che mi piace praticamente tutto, dalla posizione, allo staff, al rapporto qualità prezzo.",4,2018,01,10
227,Ich komme wieder!,"Ich würde das Hotel jederzeit enpfehlen. Das Personal war sehr hilfsbereit und freundlich, gab gute Tipps. Das Zimmer war klein aber genau richtig für eine Person. Sauber, das Mobiliar ein wenig abgenutzt aber liebevoll eingerichtet. Ein wenig hellhörig ist es. Die Lage ist sehr zentral, vieles ist zu Fuss erreichbar. Ebenso Temple Bar, wobei man durch den Lärm verschont bleibt. Auch ansonsten hielt sich die Lärmemission von aussen sehr in Grenzen.",4,2017,12,03

227,Mejorable,"Es una pena que por algunos detalles que se podrian mejorar no se pueda poner una mejor puntuacion.
Elegi este apartamento de un dormitorio para cuatro personas pero el sofa cama no reune condiciones para ser usado por dos personas.Es bastante incomodo y no muy grande.
El resto del apartamento es normal pero los detalles de los que hablaba antes...
Por ejemplo en el dormitorio solo tiene lampara una de las mesillas y la la luz del techo no se puede apagar desde la cama.
En la pared del salon donde va el sofa cama no hay enchufes ni lampara pequeña.
El baño estaba bien pero la ducha no tenia ningun elemento donde dejar champus, guantes o ningun elemento. El portarrollos estaba roto. No hay donde dejar la toalla de lavabo, etc.
En fin pequeños detalles que mejorarian el apartamento. Por lo demas todo nuevo en un edificio anexo al hotel muy nuevo y tranquilo, y bastante centrico.
Los apartamentos estan en los pisos altos, con ascensor, y tienen buena luz.
Se puede usar el restaurante del hotel pero no lo hemos usado.",3,2017,10,05

227,Ideal por su localizacion,"De los pocos hoteles que te preparan una habitación familiar con dos hijos. El personal es muy amable y aunque el hotel es pequeño y con unos años merece la pena.

227,Soluzione comoda,"Soggiornato per due notti ad inizio luglio si è rivelato essere un'ottima soluzione per girare il centro dell'incantevole Dublino. Vicinissimo a tutte le principali attrazioni della città fa della posizione il suo punto di forza. Per il resto hotel di buon livello, personale giovane e molto cordiale, stanze pulite e confortevoli. Colazione presso il pub a fianco non di altissimo livello ( costo di 10/12  euro ).",4,2017,07,13
227,Da consigliare,"L'albergo ha numerosi vantaggi: è centralissimo e, nonostante sia in una zona dove ci sono diversi locali, le finestre sono perfettamente insonorizzate. 
La nostra camera, una tripla, era grande e ben pulita, nonostante l'onnipresente moquette.....
La reception è piccola (non ci sono quasi spazi comuni), ma tutto il personale è sempre stato gentilissimo, cortese, per qualunque richiesta (dalla stampa del boarding pass alla prenotazione di una macchina a noleggio per una escursione).
A mio giudizio, un albergo da considerare seriamente per un breve soggiorno a Dublino.",5,2017,07,04
227,Excelente ubicación y una atención muy correcta,"No tenía muy buenas experiencias de los hoteles en Dublin pero tengo que destacar que he quedado muy satisfecho con el trato recibido en el hotel.

Las habitaciones son espaciosas y muy limpias, aunque la calefacción para las habitaciones ""normales"" es central, por lo que dependes de que la enciendan en el hotel.

Muy curioso que todos los enchufes tienen puerto USB, por lo que se puede cargar el móvil, tablet o similar sin necesidad de adaptador de corriente.

El personal es muy simpático y atento, resaltando a Sofía, que habla español perfectamente y facilita todo.

Volvemos al hotel, puesto que la ciudad nos encantó.",4,2017,03,22

227,Ottima posizione per girare a piedi la città,"La posizione dell'hotel è ottimale per visitare la città, infatti con una piacevole passeggiata si raggiunge il Trinity College, Grafton Street, St. Stephen Green,Temple Bar, inoltre il quartiere è pieno di caffetterie, pub e negozi di ogni genere.Lo stile è forse un po' datato, andrebbero apportate diverse migliorie, come ad esempio un'illuminazione più potente, una ventola in bagno e la nostra vasca era scheggiata e un po' rotta esternamente; tuttavia ci siamo trovati piuttosto bene, il materasso era comodo e nonostante i locali sottostanti, le finestre sono risultate abbastanza insonorizzate.Il personale è stato gentile, ma un pomeriggio si è verificata una cosa che ci ha lasciati un po' perplessi: eravamo in camera e sentiamo bussare alla porta, non abbiamo aperto subito ma non saranno passati neanche due minuti che la cameriera prende e entra, dicendo che doveva aggiungere una pagina nel menu' sulla scrivania.Comunque per il resto tutto bene.",3,2017,02,03

Lo stile come dicevo è cecchiotto, moquette per terra, mobili anni 90. Nel bagno il lavandino ha due rubinetti separati (con due flussi d'acqua), da una parte esce bollente dall'altra fredda, un pò complicato da gestire. 
Per dormire una notte in viaggio di lavoro può andare.",3,2016,10,26
227,Posizione eccellente!,"Già quando il tassista non appena gli abbiamo detto la destinazione ci ha risposto"" Ah ma siete in pieno centro!"" avevamo capito di aver scelto l'hotel giusto.
La posizione è infatti il suo grandissimo punto di forza: centralissimi e vicini a tutto, scendevamo in strada e in pochi minuti eravamo a Temple Bar, al S. Stephen Garden, al Trinity College o al Dublin castle.
La camera con doppio letto era spaziosa e pulita, anche se si nota che l'arredo inizia ad essere un po' datato, soprattutto quello del bagno.
I ragazzi giù alla hall sono stati sempre disponibili e l'ultimo giorno dopo aver liberato la stanza ci hanno fatto la cortesia di tenerci i bagagli mezza giornata.
Lo consigliamo!!",4,2016,10,19

227,Ottima posizione e buon hotel,"La camera che ci hanno assegnato era molto spaziosa (addirittura un singolo più matrimoniale nonostante fossimo in due) ed il bagno altrettanto fruibile e pulito (unico appunto: hanno ancora due rubinetti distinti per acqua calda e fredda, ma pare che a Dublino sia cosa comune). Il check in velocissimo, per accedere alle camere dell'hotel si utilizza lo stesso badge della stanza (ma per ben tre volte non funzionava, forse perché programmato male, comunque sistemano la cosa immediatamente). La camera era sufficientemente insonorizzata, ma un certo rumore proveniente dal pub sottostante si sentiva, però a Dublino è un aspetto diffuso, soprattutto se si soggiorna un centro. La posizione dell'hotel è fantastica, perché è a due passi da Graften Street e St. Stephen's Green, per arrivare nel pieno di Temple Bar sono cinque minuti a piedi.
Mi sento di consigliare questo hotel, il rapporto qualità-prezzo è discreto, c'è da dire che a Dublino i prezzi degli alberghi sono mediamente alti.",4,2016,04,20
227,Ottimo hotel,"Ottimo 3 stelle in PIENO centro. Ci siamo trovato benissimo, camera al quinto piano, perfetta. Senza balcone, con piccole finestre.

Ottimo il bollitore in camera anche perché la colazione non era compresa nel prezzo. Consigliamo chiaramente i piani alti x evitare i rumori notturni della strada su cui si affaccia l'hotel. Per chi ha l'auto c'è un parcheggio convenzionato a 100 metri (S.Stephen) e per pagare la metà è sufficiente chiedere gratuitamente il voucher alla reception, dove si alternano ragazzi che parlano bene varie lingue, compreso l'italiano.

227,DA EVIDENZIARE : OK !,"Sintesi positiva per questo hotel :
1) LOGISTICA : posizione ottimale per girare a piedi o in bus verso le bellezze della città 
2) RECEPTION : personale professionale, gentile e disponibile (vedi adattatore)  
3) ADATTATORE corrente elettrica: ricordatevi di portarvelo dietro (noi chiesto in prestito all'hotel) 
4) CAMERA : (la ns al 5° piano) spaziosa, pulita e silenziosa. 
5) PREZZO : è quello che ci si aspetta nel we, per una posizione centrale, in una città poco ""cheap"", sicuramente non economico, ma ci sta !

227,"L'ideale per i motociclisti, perché..","Situato in pieno centro, in Temple Bar, posizione strategica per visitare le maggiori attrazioni di Dublino e uscire la sera in cerca di locali.
Si trova in una strada relativamente tranquilla, comunque non troppo trafficata.
Dispone di parcheggio privato chiuso, importante per chi ha la moto!!!
Le camere sono belle, ampie e comode per disporre i bagagli, e con bagno grande.
I prezzi (nonostante Dublino sia cara, e tutte le strutture raddoppino o addirittura triplichino nei weekend) non sono tra i più cari.
La colazione (servita nel locale adiacente che la sera diventa un Pub) è molto abbondante e buona.
Ma soprattutto, le ragazze alla reception sono veramente molto molto gentili e carine. Ci hanno aiutato nel trovare la sistemazione per la moto, nel consigliarci i luoghi da visitare, nel farsi comprendere nonostante il nostro inglese non sia perfetto, nella necessità che avevamo di stampare il biglietto del traghetto, e alla fine ci hanno pure fatto un po' di sconto sulle colazioni. Hanno dimostrato di saper trattare i clienti, di essere molto preparate, e di avere molta pazienza.

L'hotel è essenziale, nel senso che non dispone di hall, sale comuni, proprio bar. Ma le camere sono abbastanza ampie, accuratamente pulite ed i doppi vetri attutiscono i rumori che provengono dalla strada (ed in centro a Dublino ve ne sono molti, a partire dai locali e pub dove la gente staziona fuori chiacchierando vivacemente, alle attività di pulizia della città che viene fatta il mattino molto presto), consiglio per questo camere ai piani più alti. Non ho utilizzato la possibilità di fare la colazione al pub collegato con l'hotel perché abbiamo preferito sperimentare i vari locali vicini.
Il costo è medio alto rispetto agli standard Italiani, ma in quella zona i prezzi degli hotel sono mediamente tutti ancora più alti.
Nel complesso un piacevole soggiorno.",4,2015,07,07

L'Hotel è convenzionato anche con il servizio taxi a prezzo fisso, veramente utile per raggiungere l' aeroporto senza brutte sorprese.

227,Tolles Hotel in Bestlage mit unvergleichbar freundlichem Personal,"Ein absolut zu empfehlendes Hotel! 

Das Doppelzimmer in der 5.Etage war sehr ruhig und hat unsere Erwartungen für ein Stadtzentrum diesbezüglich definitiv übertroffen; der Schlaf war in keiner Weise gestört.

Die Zimmermädchen haben das Zimmer und Bad gut ordentlich gehalten.

Das Frühstück nimmt man in der angrenzenden Bar ein, dort ist es unglaublich gemütlich und urig. Die Auswahl besteht zwischen Continental Breakfast oder auch à la carte typisch irisch. Beides hat uns sehr gut geschmeckt und stärkte für die vielen Ausflüge. Aufmerksames und bemühtes Personal in der Bar.

Alle Sehenswürdigkeiten sind fußläufig zu erreichen und wenn man nochmal eine Anregung für die Tagesplanung gebrauchen kann, dann kümmern sich die unvergleichlich engagierten und absolut freundlichen Damen an der Rezeption gerne darum. Und in einer Art wie wir es bisher noch in keinem anderen Hotel erlebt haben, wird Anteil an der eigenen Reise durch das Personal genommen. Hier wird wirklich alles dafür getan, dass man sich rundum wohl fühlt!
Man kann mit jedem Belang an die Rezeption herantreten, ohne sich als Störfaktor zu fühlen, und es wird einem sofort kompetent und nett weitergeholfen.

227,Excellent,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel nella stanza 408 al quarto piano, tre notti, per festeggiare il capodanno 2015 a Dublino. 
L'hotel si trova in posizione centralissima, a circa 400 metri dal famosissimo Temple Bar, non è necessario usare mezzi pubblici, si fa tutto a piedi.
Le stanze hanno doppi vetri, quindi sono insonorizzate e non si sente minimamente il rumore della discoteca (aperta venerdì e sabato) sotto l'hotel e dei vari Pub nelle vicinanze (aperti ogni giorno).
Le camere sono pulitissime e molto ampie, anche il bagno sempre limpido e profumato, un grazie particolare alle ragazze della reception sempre gentili e cortesi.
Per raggiungere l'aeroporto di Dublino, noi abbiamo preso un taxi che impiega circa 20 minuti e costa 25€.  
L'hotel è interamente coperto da rete wi fi (si entra con password che danno al check-in) e funziona benissimo in ogni piano dell'hotel.
Nel nostro pacchetto non era compresa la colazione. Per chi volesse andare a Dublino questa struttura è consigliatissima, (parlano anche Italiano, poco ma lo parlano).

La atención es muy buena, la gente de recepción encantadora, y las camareras del pub del desayuno son muy amables. El desayuno no está incluido en el precio, y son unos seis euros el bufé continental, y unos 9 si ya nos queremos animar con algo caliente como el desayuno típico irlandés (no está mal) o huevos revueltos con salmón ahumado.

Il personale dell'hotel è sempre disponibile e cordiale, soprattutto la receptionist italiana e l'unico ragazzo presente. Attenzione al piano e alla posizione della camera! Siamo stati per due volte in questo hotel: la prima volta è andata benissimo, la seconda decisamente no. Inizialmente la nostra camera era al quinto piano ed in una posizione interna da cui non sentivamo il chiasso proveniente dai vari locali lungo la strada, dotata di condizionatore che potevamo accendere quando volevamo regolando a nostro piacimemto la temperatura e, cosa fondamentale, il lavandino era moderno e dotato di un rubinetto con miscelatore. La seconda volta siamo stati invece molto sfortunati: la camera era al terzo piano, rumorosissima, sembrava di stare in mezzo alla strada tanto bene e distintamente si sentivano gli schiamazzi degli ubriachi, per non parlare della musica proveniente dal pub sottostante! in camera al posto dell'impianto di condizionamento c'erano i termosifoni (cosa mai vista in un albergo) che non potevamo regolare in quanto erano centralizzati. Risultato? Ci alzavamo di notte perchè in camera la temperatura era davvero molto alta,poi  la mattina ci facevamo la doccia congelando perchè i riscaldamenti erano stati spenti ed una sera in particolare a causa del freddo siamo stati costretti a scendere per chiedere in reception di accendere i riscaldamenti... Semplicemente allucinante.  Ciliegina sulla torta, il lavandino era dotato di due rubinetti separati per l'acqua calda e fredda, rendendo tutto più scomodo e difficile. In compenso potevamo scegliere se ustionarci la mano destra e congelarci la sinistra o viceversa. A seguito delle nostre lamentele per la rumorosità della stanza, il mattino seguente ci hanno gentilmente e prontamente spostato in una camera interna al quinto piano, migliorando sensibilmente la situazione sul fronte rumore; niente da fare invece per il riscaldamento ed i rubinetti ""old style"". La pulizia della camera è complessivamente accettabile. La colazione continentale,  servita al pub sottostante, era eccessivamente costosa per la qualità e la quantità degli alimenti che offriva: muesli, cereali integrali, riso soffiato, mini croissant, pane bianco e integrale, marmellatine, ""prosciutto"" che non sapeva di prosciutto, salame di provenienza ignota, due tipi di formaggi o presunti tali e diversi succhi di frutta. Le tazze, le posate e le brocche del succo di frutta erano spesso un pò sporche ed appiccicose, ma a quanto pare è usanza locale non badare molto alla pulizia dei coperti.
Ci sentiamo comunque di consigliare l'albergo, ma solo per un breve soggiorno.",3,2014,04,18

Il personale è molto efficiente e davvero gentilissimo, una menzione particolare va a Georgina e ad un ragazzo - presumibilmente indiano- della Reception.

Los desayunos continentales algo pobres, sin nada de fruta y zumos naturales.El personal muy atento y servicial.
No entiendo como con todos los turistas españoles que hay no saben nada de este idioma, y tampoco como tienen cartas en este hotel y otros restaurantes en español.Seria un detalle para los que no tenemos ni idea.
los baños con poca iluminacion pero limpios.
Mi valoracion ha sido positiva aunque hay mucho que mejorar.",3,2013,04,06
227,Good good good,"Ottima posizione, personale gentile, qualità prezzo ok!!!! 24/24h!!!!meglio se ci fosse qualcuno che parli bene l'italiano, ma d'altra parte sia in Irlanda ed loro c'è la metto tutta per farsi capire ed aiutarti!!!",4,2013,02,22
227,ideale,"Staff molto cortese e gentile..si prodigava ad aiutarci nonostante il nostro inglese zoppiccante, la posizione è centrale e tutto è a portata di mano; le stanze sono grandi, confortevoli e pulite; comodo il bar ""BiaBAR"" sotto l'hotel; rapporto qualità prezzo ottimo.

l'unica nota dolente è la mancanza dei miscelatori nel lavandino del bagno, o acqua calda o fredda, senza via di mezzo....ma tutto sommato sopportabile data la comodità dell'ubicazione dell'hotel.
se dovessimo ritornare a Dublino, sicuramente alloggeremmo nuovamente in questo hotel.",4,2012,12,06
227,Centralissimo,"L'ubicazione è delle migliori, si scende e ci si trova al centro. C'è il wifi anche all'ultimo piano. Il personale è molto gentile e cordiale. La pulizia buona, hanno riordinato la stanza nonostante avessimo dimenticato di porre il cartellino fuori la porta. Complessivamente lo consiglierei.",4,2012,11,02
227,Zufriedenheit wegen Zimmerpreis,"Wegen Fussball-Länderspiel 10 Monate im Voraus gebucht. Daher sensationeller Preis: EZ zu € 57. Kann aber an normalen Party-Wochenenden  über € 190 kosten, dann total überteuert. Hotel und angeschlossenes Restaurant & Bar sind sauber, sehr freundliches Personal, super Lage. Würde ich immer wieder buchen - wenn der Preis stimmt.",4,2012,10,17
227,"Posizione, cortesia, convenienza","Abbiamo prenotato una tripla per due notti nell'ultima settimana di agosto e, sfuttando un'offerta, abbiamo speso 110 euro per notte -senza colazione.
Camera comoda, molto spaziosa e pulita (malgrado la moquette), con un bel bagno grande e pulito. Solito bollitore a disposizione per the e caffè. 
il personale è molto cortese e paziente con il nostro inglese zoppicante. 
Avendone la disponibilità, ci hanno anche assegnato un posto per la macchina gratuito nel piccolissimo parcheggio sul retro.
 Il punto di forza è senz'altro la posizione, centralissima a 5 minuti da Grafton St.
Forse perchè in settimana, non abbiamo avuto problemi di rumori notturni.
Oltre al bar dell'hotel, dove oltre alla colazione è possibile pranzare, vicinissimi ci sono molti locali di tutti i generi ed un supermercato con apertura serale (carinissimo il piccolo bar due /tre numeri prima).
Nel complesso un'ottima esperienza, decisamente consigliabile",4,2012,09,05
227,"Excelente localización, servicio básico","El Drury Court Hotel está en una práctica y bella zona de Dublin. No muy cerca del ambiente ruidoso de los bares y muy accesible desde cantidad de puntos de interés. Sin duda lo mejor es la localización. 
La habitación en básica: baño sin bidet, camas confortables, alfombras, una mesita. La limpieza deja mucho que desear: sólo estiran las camas y cambian las bolsas de residuos. En una semana no pasaron la aspiradora ni un trapo de limpieza. 
El personal es hostil, a veces confuso en su comunicación y no tiene una actitud abierta de ayuda. No saludan en la recepción y siempre parecen ocupados para atender al cliente. Un ejemplo es que no podía abrir una botella de plástico con agua, porque tampoco había llevado cuchillo, y ese ""favor"" lo resolvieron con muy mala gana.",3,2012,08,18
227,Un buon hotel in centro!,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo albergo 3 notti nel mese di Maggio. L'albergo si trova a 2 minuti da Grafton Street e Saint Stephen Green. In pratica si è nella parte sud del Liffey ed in centro. Le stanza nella quale abbiamo soggiornato era al primo piano, molto spaziosa e pulita, nonostante la sempre presente moquette.La nostra stanza affacciava sulla strada e di fronte aveva una sorta di fast food. Questo ci aveva fatto presagire notti insonni. Per fortuna non è andata così e la stanza era abbastanza isolata dal punto di vista acustico. L'unico vero problema è stato il freddo. La stanza di notte gelava e le coperte fornite erano assolutamente insufficienti e corte.",4,2012,06,21
227,"Sehr zufrieden, gerne wieder","Wir waren im Mai 2012 einige Tage im Drury Court und haben den Aufenthalt sehr genossen.
Die Lage ist phantastisch, man ist zu Fuß sofort in der Innenstadt. Es kann wegen der zentralen Lage - vor allem am Wochenende - allerdings nachts etwas lauter werden, wer diesbezüglich empfindlich ist sollte sich Ohropax einpacken.
Das Continental Breakfast wird in Buffetform angeboten, es gab verschiedene Säfte, Wurst, Käse, Lachs, Joghurt, diverse Frühstückscerealien, Obstsalat, Butter und Marmelade und natürlich Toast sowie Kaffee und Tee - und man sitzt dabei ausgesprochen gemütlich in der zum Hotel gehörigen Bia-Bar, in der am Abend des öfteren Livekonzerte stattfinden.
Das Personal war stets freundlich und hilfsbereit, wir hatten wegen einer vergessenen Kameratasche auch nach unserem Aufenthalt noch Kontakt mir der Rezeption und man war dort sehr bemüht um uns.

Sollten wir noch einmal das Glück haben, eine Reise nach Dublin zu machen, werden wir uns sicher wieder im Drury Court einquartieren!",5,2012,05,30
227,Consigliato,"L'albergo è in zona centrale vicino a Grafton Street e a 5 minuti a piedi dal Temple Bar. La struttura è dotata di reception aperta 24 ore con porta di sicurezza che porta alle scale e all'ascensore. La camera, con la moquette, era spaziosa, il bagno enorme con finestra e la vasca. In camera c'era il necessario per prepararsi the e caffè istantanei e una tv coi canali locali. A piano terra c'è il Bia Bar un accogliente localino dove si può bere o mangiare qualcosa. Il personale è stato molto disponibile (abbiamo avuto un problema col riscaldamente e ci hanno fornito immediatamente una stufa elettrica) anche se non molto cordiale visto che non ti salutano mai.",4,2012,05,17
227,Sehr zentrales schoenes Hotel,"Ich habe das Drury Court besonders wegen der zentralen Lage gewaehlt und wurde nicht enttaeuscht. Man kann einfach zu Fuss in die Innenstadt gehen. Es ist zwar abends etwas lauter, aber auf jeden Fall ertraeglich. Die Zimmer sind sehr gross und angenehm. Kleiner Minuspunkt: Wenn man erst spaet zum Fruehstuecksbuffet kommt, sieht man der Wurst und dem Kaese sehr an, dass sie schon ein paar Stunden ungekuehlt herumstehen.",5,2012,04,23
227,OTTIMO!,"siamo stati in questo hotel 3 notti ad agosto 2011 e che dire,fantastico!
tutto davvero perfetto,dalla posizione al personale carinissimo anche con chi non parla un ottimo inglese, alle colazioni stratosferiche del bar.
camere spaziosissime,pulite e molto silenziose.
noi avevamo chiesto una doppia e ci siamo ritrovati con una tripla!!!
sicuramente ci ritorneremo!",5,2012,03,20
227,Schöner Aufenthalt in Stadtmitte,"Waren in diesem Hotel Ende September. Modern und praktisch eingerichtete Zimmer, nicht zu klein. Alles war sauber und aufgeräumt. Sehr gutes Frühstück mit großer Auswahl. Das Beste aber ist dass es um einen fairen Preis mitten in der Stadt liegt. Die Fußgängerzone Grafton Street ist nur wenige Meter entfernt. Wer es gerne ruhig hat sollte ein Zimmer möglichst weit oben verlangen, in den unteren hört man manchmal die Abends stattfindenden Konzerte oder die Barmusik, eventuell auch die Raucher die außerhalb des Hotels stehen.
Nachdem unser Lieblingshotel das Wynns in der Zwischenzeit zu teuer geworden ist werden wir für unsere fast jährlichen Dublinaufenthalte immer hier bleiben. Sehr zu empfehlen.",5,2012,02,12
227,Gut mit Einschränkungen,"Das Drury Court Hotel ist sehr zentral gelegen. Die Laufweite vom Trinity College oder Temple Bar beträgt cirka 10 Minuten. In der Nähe das Hotels befinden sich zahlreiche Restaurants und Pubs. Im Hotel selbst befindet sich auch ein Pub. Die Zimmer waren schön eingerichtet, jedoch sind die Fenster einfach verglast und wir konnten eines nicht richtig schließen. Da wir ein Zimmer Richtung Straße hatten war es in der Nacht (Samstag Abend) wahnsinnig laut sodass an Schlaf ohne Ohropax nicht zu denken war. die Folgenächte waren ok. Die Rezeption war dauerhaft besetzt und sehr freundlich. Wir konnten unser Gepäck am Abreisetag im Hotel verstauen. 

Fazit: Für einen Kurztrip sicherlich empfehlenswert, aber unbedingt Ohropax einpacken oder mitfeiern :-)",3,2012,01,15
227,Due notti al Drury Court.,"Mio marito ed io abbiamo alloggiato presso l'hotel Drury Court agli inizi del mese di settembre 2011, dopo avere trascorso un breve soggiorno a Cork. Abbiamo prenotato una camera matrimoniale sul sito internet dell'albergo, pagandola circa € 70,00 a notte. Puoi prenotare anche la prima colazione (€ 14,00 quella tipicamente irlandese, comprensiva di salsicce, becon, uova, fagioli, pomodori, funghi, frittelle) ovvero pagarla direttamente in albergo con un piccolo sovra prezzo. Le stanze, discretamente ampie, sono arredate con letti comodi, una TV, che non trasmette canali italiani, un armadio a muro, aperto con specchio centrale e un piccolo bagno dotato di sapone e bagnoschiuma/shampoo liquidi. In un cassetto, sotto il televisore, c'è il phon. La nostra stanza affacciava su una strada laterale, ove si trovava un locale notturno. Non ho sentito provenire però, alcun rumore o musica e così anche dal bar situato al di sotto dell'albergo, dove organizzano serate dal vivo, forse perché non eravamo nel fine settimana. L'hotel è molto vicino al centro pedonale (Grafton Street) ed a Temple Bar, dove si arriva in un attimo a piedi. Consiglio vivamente questo albergo perché centrale, pulito e conveniente, soprattutto se si ha la fortuna di prenotare le stanze in offerta sul sito internet, come è capitato a noi.",4,2011,09,16
227,vivamente consigliato,"Abbiamo pernottato in questo hotel 3 gg.
Ottima posizione, a 15 minuti a piedi da ogni punto di interesse in città.
Silenzioso, camere pulite, personale cortese ed efficiente.
Particolare menzione va fatta alla ragazza del bar, la mitica VALENTINA di Firenze che ci ha allietato il soggiorno e fornito preziosi consigli ed informazioni.
Ricca la colazione a buffet che per soli E. 6,50 dava veramente di tutto.
Ottimo rapporto qualità/prezzo.
Ci tornerei.",4,2011,06,09
227,Cortesi ma....,"Mi sono trovato a fare un viaggio di piacere a Dublino e ho cercato un hotel praticamente in centro a prezzi abbordabili. approfittando di un'offerta in internet ho scelto il Drury Court Hotel.
l'hotel è in una posizione fantastica, in pieno centro
Al mio arrivo mi stupisce la cortesia del personale (come tutti i Dublinesi), una volta espletato il check-in mi dirigo nella mia camera.
La camera non era nulla di eccezionale mi hanno colpito particolarmente gli infissi vecchi e impossibili da aprire, mancano le tende alle finestre, lo spazzola del WC, torno nella hall a chiedere tende e spazzola, vengo rassicurato e torno in camera, il giorno dopo le richiedo e nulla, quello dopo ancora ci rinuncio e finisco la mia permanenza così...
per il resto l'hotel va bene, pulito e in pieno centro di Dublino.
può valere la pena solo a prezzo scontato (60€) a notte, pagare il prezzo pieno (110€) per quel servizio è follia.",2,2011,05,24
227,Muy buena situación y relación calidad-precio. Limpio,"Dublín es una ciudad a la que puedes ir caminando a todos lados, pero aun así, este hotel está muy bien situado, muy cerca de centros comeciales, restaurantes, zonas de interés (Catedral San Patricio, el Temple,...). La habitación era limpia y silenciosa. Estábamos en la planta 1. Pedimos una habitación doble, y una cama era más grande que la otra, pero ambas del tamaño más que suficiente. La conexión a Internet era buena, pero había que reiniciarla cada poco tiempo. El hotel está muy limpio, aunque la cortina de la ducha ya estaba un poco deteriorada. El desayuno no está mal, aunque si desayunas más tarde de las 8.30 puede ser algo escaso y no varía mucho de unos días a otros. 

Yo volvería, sin duda.",4,2011,04,26
227,Hotel ist okay wenn man nicht geräusch- oder geruchsempfindlich ist...,"Trotz meiner ausdrücklichen Bitte, ein Nichtraucherzimmer zu bekommen, stank das uns ""zugewiesene"" Doppelzimmer bestialisch nach Rauch. Auch meiner Bitte nach einem ruhigen Zimmer war man nicht nachgekommen, obwohl ich monatelang im Voraus gebucht hatte und es zu diesem Zeitpunkt sicher noch reichlich Auswahl gegeben hatte. Unser Zimmer lag nach vorne zur Straße raus, wo es am Wochenende bis in die frühen Morgenstunden lärmt, da zahlreiche Kneipen und Clubs im Umfeld sind. Auch das Hotel selber hat einen Nachtclub, es lässt sich aber nicht genau sagen, ob man diesen in den Zimmern hört - in erster Linie habe ich den Lärm der Läden (bzw. deren Besucher) gegenüber vom Hotel gehört. Wer allerdings selber vorhat, in Dublin am Nightlife teilzunehmen, den wird die Geräuschkulisse wohl eher weniger stören. Auch unter der Woche ist es eher ruhig, nur eben Fr/Sa nicht.

Als wir gegen 14.30 Uhr im Hotel ankamen, war unser Zimmer noch nicht fertig, wir konnten jedoch das Gepäck schon einmal in einem speziellen Raum abstellen. 

Die Zimmer sind einigermaßen groß aber nicht übertrieben sauber - es geht aber noch, wenn man vom Rauchgeruch absieht. Insgesamt eher ""verwohnt"" als wirklich schmutzig, denke ich. Die Matratzen in unserem Zimmer waren so durchgelegen, dass man die Federn spüren konnte. Das Bad war okay, bis auf den üblichen Schimmel in den Ecken an Dusche/Wanne. Heißes Wasser gab's und der Wasserdruck war auch gut. Die Wände sind extrem dünn, man hört jedes Geräusch vom gang und den angrenzenden Zimmern.
Das (irische) Frühstück war ausreichend aber recht lieblos - aber der Frühstücksraum im Keller ohne Fenster lädt eh nicht gerade zum verweilen ein... Personal ziemlich gestresst und eher unfreundlich, bis auf den Manager, der war höflich bis freundlich. das zugehörige Restaurant/Bar ist dafür ganz nett und die Pizza ist gut.
 
Für einen Kurztrip okay, hängt wahrscheinlich auch davon ab, welches Zimmer man erwischt - für einen längeren Aufenthalt würde ich das Hotel nicht empfehlen.",3,2011,02,15
227,preiswertes Hotel in guter Lage,"Das Drury Court hat uns gut gefallen. Es liegt in einer ruhigen Seitenstrasse im Zentrum Dublins mit einigen Attraktionen sowie vielen Einkaufs- und Ausgehmöglichkeiten in Laufweite. Es ist ein gutes familienfreundliches 3 Sterne Hotel und bietet auch ein gutes und preiswertes Frühstücksbuffet. Das Personal war immer sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Das Zimmer war ausreichend groß und sehr sauber, die Betten bequem. Wir würden wieder dort übernachten.
Der Spielplatz im nahen St. Stpehen’s Green ist übrigens ein Geheimtipp für Familien mit kleinen Kindern!",4,2010,11,10
227,hotel Drury,"Ad un passo dal centro, si raggiunge tutto facilmente a piedi, molto accogliente, l'unico neo il venerdie sabato avendo sotto un locale notturno musica fino alle 2,30. Gli altri giorni è perfetto!",4,2009,12,19
227,Un buen hotel en el centro de la ciudad,"Hotel situado en el centro. Las habitaciones son pequeñas pero están bien. En frente del hotel está el pub ""Hairy Lemon"". Además tienen un parking enfrente.",4,2009,11,13
227,"angenehm, unkompliziert, nettes Service","Ich habe das Hotel aufgrund seiner Lage ausgesucht, da ich in der Nähe einen geschäftlichen Termin hatte. Es liegt recht zentral, die Dubliner Innenstadt ist jedoch sehr überschaubar und es ist alles zu Fuß zu erreichen. Das Zimmer war recht groß und sauber, die Aussicht war jedoch nicht die Beste. Als sehr angenehm habe ich den Wasserkocher mit instant Tee und Kaffee empfunden. Das Frühstück fand ich sehr gut, man konnte sich auf der Karte verschiedenes aussuchen. Das Personal an der Rezeption war sehr nett und hilfsbereit. Ich würde es wieder buchen.",4,2009,06,23
227,Posizione strategica,"Sono stato a Drury per Pasqua ad aprile 2009.
Posizione ottima, in pieno centro. Ovvero nella zona più ricca di negozi e a 5 minuti a piedi da Temple Bar.
Consiglio questo hotel a tutti sia per affari che per turismo.
Un consiglio spassionato, chiedete una stanza che dia all'interno oppure non sopra alla discoteca che c'è sotto l'hotel...altrimenti rischiate di addormentarvi alle 5 del mattino sabato sera....
PS: colazione molto buona, nella media. Pulizia delle camere ok.",4,2009,04,17
227,L'Hotel giusto,"Il miglior albergo nel rapporto qualità-locazione/prezzo della mia esperienza di viaggiatore.

227,Zentral gelegen und okay. Nicht wirklich mehr.,"Wir verbrachten eine Nacht im Drury Court und freuten uns ueber die zentrale Lage. Der Personal im Hotel war sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Das Hotelgebaeude  an sich wirkt etwas angestaubt und auch die Zimmer waren nicht wirklich modern. Alles war okay sauber, aber wir hatten nicht den Wunsch uns laenger als noetig im Zimmer aufzuhalten. Das Fruehstueck war reichlich und lecker.
Insgesamt: okay fuer eine Nacht, wenn man ohnehin viel in Dublin unterwegs ist, aber nichts fuer ein lauschiges Hotelwochenende.",3,2008,04,29
227,Ottimo Albergo,"Ottimo albergo.Posizione invidiabile ( pieno centro), ottima colazione,prezzo contenuto.Se dovessi ritornare a Dublino di sicuro soggiornerei qui.",4,2008,04,24
227,Zahlung,"... und die Menschen sind so herzlich in Irland!
Das war eine der Kernaussagen zu Irland, überall gelesen, überall gehört. Noch nie war ich selber in dieses Land gereist, doch mit dieser Erwartung erreichte ich Dublin und dieses Hotel. Nachdem ich mein Gepäck verräumt hatte, bat man mich zu bezahlen, an und für sich kein Problem, nur ich hatte an diesem Abend die über 1000,- Euro nicht bei mir, wollte aber cash bezahlen. Auch kein Problem, ""...aber morgen sicher!"", kam etwas scharf der Verweis. Keine Frage! Ein netter Abend, ein neuer Morgen, der Weg zur Bank, keine Chance - kein Geld! Viele Anrufe bei meiner Heimatbank (vom Hotel aus!) folgten... - ""nein, die Karte ist ok..."". Derweilen hatte ich nochmals um Verständnis gebeten, man gewährte mir Zeit, wieder mit deutlicher Strenge. Die Situation wurde immer unerträglicher, ich merkte wie man mir mißtraute und so bat man mich (mit Nachdruck!) das Geld von der Heimatbank überweisen zu lassen. Wieder kein Problem, fünf Minuten später war die Überweisung getätigt. Man prüfte die Überweisung, das Geld war nicht da, aber bekanntlich dauert eine solche Aktion zwei bis drei Tage. Man traute mir nicht und so ließ ich per Fax eine Bestätigung meiner Bank an das Hotel senden. Man konnte das deutschsprachige Fax nicht lesen und so ließ ich ein englischsprachiges Fax verfassen. Das Geld war zwei Tage vor meiner Abreise auch noch nicht da (anscheinend verstand man das engische Fax auch nicht) und so forderte man mich auf, nun cash zu zahlen!! Doppelt zahlen???? ""... kein Problem, sobald das Geld überwiesen ist, wird es zurücküberwiesen!!!!"" (????)! An diesem Punkt war ich einem Herzinfarkt nahe.

Bevor ich nach Irland fuhr, erkundigte ich mich bei dem Hotel über verschiedene Fragen die mir wichtig erschienen. Ich hatte das besondere Glück eine überaus reizende Persönlichkeit aus Deutschland dort als Mitarbeiterin vorzufinden - Frau Wagner. Ich fühlte mich wie der wichtigste Gast des Hotels (das vermittelte Sie für mich).

Frau Wagner war zu diesem Zeitpunkt nicht im Haus, ich verlangte Sie, man rief Sie an und nach wenigen Minuten war alles geklärt und gut.

Sie, Frau Wagner, waren für mich im oben genannten Satz, das ""Irischste"" dieses Hotels! Danke!

Das Hotel ist ansonsten ganz in Ordnung, ein wenig mehr ""Teppichpflege"" täte nicht schaden.",1,2007,11,10
227,"Schön,aber laut!","Sehr gute, zentrale Lage.Alle Sehenswürdigkeiten im Innenstadt leicht zu Fuss erreichen. Komfortables Zimmer, gutes Service,
höfliches Personal. Früschtück inklusive,war ok.
Einziges Problem: an der Strassen jeden Nacht grosse Gedrange von Leuten, die sehr laut sind, ganz bis 3-4 Uhr Morgen.
