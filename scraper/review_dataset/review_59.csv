59,better the first time because of price......,"this was our second time staying at this hotel....it doesn't have much to offer in the room....our room was the size of a double bed with a tiny bathroom and no real window... me had the same room both times....it wasn't so bad in February for the price....but now it certainly isn't worth $200 a night without breakfast....the room this time smelled like cigarettes as well as did the pillows😰...they sprayed and changed pillows, but by then it was too late...they did offer to change our room, but we were too lazy to repack for a night.... we had no problems with noise....maybe because we had no problems exterior window and quiet neighbors.... we like that location, but others are will prefer closer to major sights....Don't know if I would return....",3,2024,10,18
59,Lovely hotel in the best location,"Astoria is a simple but lovely hotel in one of the best locations in Barcelona.  Rooms are simple, with comfortable beds, good bathroom facilities and pretty quiet.  Breakfast and lunch are ok. But importantly, the hotel is in the best location at the top of Enric Granados and surrounded by more bars and restaurants than you could visit in a lifetime ",5,2023,02,22
59,A Beautiful Stay in Barcelona,"Our stay was so beautiful here. The location was excellent for all the tourist attractions we had planned, the neighborhood offers so many dining options for anytime of the day, it is very close to a lot of shopping centers and public transportation within walking distance, and thr hotel itself was an experience. Everyone at the front desk was always friendly & and exceptional with anything we needed help or directions with. The quality of our room was beautiful & comfortable, the hospitality was lovely & the housekeeping staff was so amazing, always went above and beyond. We would highly recommend this beautiful place and would happily stay here again thr next time we visit Barcelona.",5,2024,10,15
59,"A good place to stay on the edge of the city centre. Good staff, characterful reception and comfortable room.","Convenient for all the things we wanted to do in Barcelona. Helpful staff, characterful reception and comfortable room. Good to have access to roof terrace and small pool but without any exciting views.",4,2024,10,07
59,Excellent service and location,"Beautiful hotel, clean comfortable and located a short walk away from restaurants, shopping and bars. We will definitely revisit on our next stay in Barcelona.  The front desk staff was excellent in particular Luis who was very helpful and gave us excellent recommendations for local spots and best way to see the city during our short stay. 
Thank you Luis !",5,2024,10,05
59,This is hotel tired and old.    .not value for money,"
This hotel is old and tired.  The beds are very uncomfortable. The rooms are noisy.  The taps in the bathroom go off with pressure.  The bathrooms have mold in tiles.",2,2024,10,02
59,stayBarca,Hotel decoration and position for sight seeing was excellent. breakfast was good. Our Room was clean. WiFi was good.  ,5,2024,09,26
59,Decent hotel in Barcelona,"Great location, comfortable rooms and kind staff. It’s true what the reviews said about the rooms being noisy. SO loud all throughout the day and night. Thankfully we packed our sound machine. Beautiful rooftop terrace and delicious breakfast. ",4,2024,09,24
59,Its okay for couple of nights stay,The hotel is located within walking distance to other popular places in Barcelona but the bathroom will need some renovations. Tge toilet takes 5-7 minutes to stop the noise after flashing. There are no coffee machines in the room and its only basic. You could here the noise very loud from the room.,3,2024,09,14
59,Perfect!,"Just ten mins walking from Passeig de Gracia start and diagonàl metro line. The hotel was simply the best I could get after a long research and all went for the best! They let us check-in at 9:00 instead of 14:00 and was such a bless after arriving at Barcelona airport around 03:00. Our room was perfect, as expected, cleaning side also super efficient. All the staff was nice and smiley. The only thing I’d say would be the windows, our view was internal building so you’ll get to see 3 walls. But for us was not much of a problem since we enjoyed our sunsets on the rooftop by the beautiful pool! Thanks for having us, definitely worth more than a 3 stars hotel.",5,2024,09,10
59,Can’t wait to stay here when we visit Barcelona again!,"Staff were friendly on arrival and throughout our stay, our room was spotless and cleaned thoroughly every day. The rooftop/pool area was clean and had great views of Barcelona, there wasn’t always someone on the bar but there was a phone to dial to the inside bar for service - which we were then served promptly. Overall, we had an amazing stay and can’t wait to visit to stay at hotel Astoria on our next visit.",4,2024,09,06
59,Very nice hotel,"Very nice hotel. Good customer care, friendly staff. Well equipped and clean room. Small but lovely pool, pretty lounge and restaurant ",5,2024,09,04
59,Great stay in a stylish hotel,"Our family room at Hotel Astoria was the best we've ever stayed in. Great layout - 2 single beds in one part (why don't more hotels offer single beds in family rooms?), a queen (or maybe king) size bed in another room, loads of storage, a beautiful bathroom with 2 sinks (such a good idea) and White Company toiletries, a mini-fridge and a safe, and a terrace with table and chairs.The beds were so comfy it was a struggle to wake up!  WiFi good enough to keep the teen happy. The one downside about the room was the soundproofing from outside in the main bedroom - the street noise was quite loud even on the 7th floor. Didn't stop us sleeping though (those lovely beds). The pool is not a kid's pool but is great for adults and older teens.  The hotel is very beautiful and stylish and smells amazing - very refreshing to come back to after a long day. We didn't have breakfast there, there's lots of food and drink places nearby. Close to Diagonal metro stop and loads of buses. We really enjoyed our stay.",5,2024,08,30
59,A Classic stay in a classic part of town,"Immerse yourself in real Bacelona, this hotel is a throw back to the 1920s when life was affluent, free glamourous.  This is like the great gatsby. If F Scott Fitzgerald didn't stay here he would have wanted to. ",4,2024,08,29
59,Classy hotel close to city center,"The front desk staff are lovely! Helpful, warm, engaging. The room was well furnished and cool (coolest we had of 3 places we stayed in Spain). Close to center of city and could walk to Sagrada Familia. We did not eat or drink at the hotel. Would definitely stay again!",5,2024,08,25
59,Very good hotel,"Very good, old-style hotel in L’Eixample which is an excellent area to stay with lots of good restaurants, cafes and bars, tree-lined streets, gorgeous buildings and a very relaxed neighbourhood vibe. The hotel service is attentive and friendly, breakfast is good, and the pool area - although small - is a nice spot to relax.",4,2024,08,02
59,"Card stolen, don’t stay here","Do not stay here - I had my card stolen from the room and the hotel management was extremely rude and unhelpful about it. This was one of our worst stays - not only was this incident a real problem to deal with but also the rooms are super small, not well ventilated with a humid smell coming from the bathroom, and constant noises you can hear from every wall.  For price and peace of mind, search elsewhere.",1,2024,07,22
59,Would stay again but staff could be friendlier!,"Hotel Astoria was a nice and clean hotel, in a good location. Metro is walkable and lots of nice restaurants and cafes in the near vicinity. Pool area on the roof terrace was quite small and surprisingly busy. 
We didn't have breakfast included so cant comment on the food. Didn't find the reception staff overly warm or friendly. It felt like an effort for them to greet us when we walked through the reception area. Would stay again though, good value for money.",3,2024,07,20
59,Beautiful property!,"Fantastic stay! Great value for money.
I come to Barcelona often and this is now my new favourite hotel to come back to!",5,2024,07,05
59,Excellent hotel,"I would 100% recommend this lovely hotel . 10 mins walk to metro and in a lovely area with cafes and restaurants. Rooms clean and beds comfy, breakfast good, staff very friendly and very helpful with travel advice! Rooftop terrace nice too! Will  definitely stay again when visiting Barcelona ",5,2024,07,04
59,Overrated and over priced,Not worth the money. Photos look way better than reality. Hotel is out dated and looks dingy service mediocre at best. Rooms tiny and dim,3,2024,06,29
59,Great centrally located hotel,"Just spent 6 nights here while attending Formula 1 Grand Prix. Great location for major sight seeing, and lots of bars and restaurants locally. Within walking distance of railway station Passeig De Gracia. Room was very clean and comfortable. Overall great value. Would recommend.",5,2024,06,25
59,The best in Barcelona,It would be hard to imagine a more comfortable hotel or a more helpful staff - many thanks to you all for making my stay with you so pleasant.,5,2024,06,15

great location, nice and helpful service,comfortable rooms,additional opportunity to view the exhibition of posters from the early 20th century and drawings Ricardo Opisso",4,2024,06,10
59,Beautiful hotel in Barcelona,The hotel is beautiful and within walking distance to many sites. It is in a nice neighborhood with many great restaurants nearby. ,5,2024,06,05
59,boujee on a budget,"boujee on a budget. nice hotel. clean. needs to be a bit updated tbh. definitely worth the money. great area. only problem is we had asked for late check out and were promised 1pm, they called us at 12 to try and get us out the room which was unfair as we still weren’t packed up and it was written on the system that we wanted to check out at 1. other than that, i don’t seem to have any problem with the hotel.",3,2024,06,03
59,Near city center with easy subway access.,"It's a nice hotel.  I liked everything but the excessive restaurant prices.  So I ate out.
It's only a few blocks to the subway.",4,2024,05,30
59,Incredible service,"I enjoyed every moment staying in Hotel Astoria. It was much better than expected, and it's extremely quiet.",5,2024,05,28
59,"Book it! Great hotel, good location, family friendly and great staff","What can I say? We booked this place for a family visit to Barcelona, and at first, I was a bit worried about the room size with our 11-month-old in a crib. I was concerned about sharing the room and needing to stay quiet since there weren't any family rooms left. But, no worries at all! Room 227 had a nice little entrance area where they put the cot, so we could close the door to the main bedroom and watch TV while she slept early.

A special shoutout to Mateo, who helped us with our bags and saved the day when I forgot a UK power adapter. I went down to ask where I could get one, and he brought one up to our room! Seriously, we'll be back next time and can't praise this place enough. We emailed ahead to request a cot, and they replied within the hour! The room was spotless, the shower is fantastic (just be warned, the water gets molten lava hot 😂🔥), and the air conditioning actually works, unlike other places we've stayed. If you're thinking of booking, just do it!",5,2024,05,19
59,Great location and value for money,"Very well located hotel, at walking distance to main attractions along Paseig de Gracia.  Spacious and comfortable rooms (bed linen amazingly good). Very good service, too.  Nice common area at street level. Special thanks to Alex at reception.",4,2024,05,15
59,Love this hotel,Loved the hotel and it’s location. Service was excellent. Clean n spacious rooms. I’m wheelchairbound and the accessable room has a rolling shower. Plenty of restaurants and coffee houses and shops close by. Very safe area with wide sidewalks with trees,5,2024,04,26
59,"Super-helpful, friendly staff, great breakfast, and more","The staff was excellent, very friendly and helpful.  I needed help with a couple of special items and they were super-helpful.  I'd stay at this hotel again and plan to do so as soon as I can get the time to do so.  The location was excellent, I walked to many attractions, the train station, and evening dinners and more.",5,2024,04,24
59,Disappointing,"I found this hotel very disappointing. Money was taken from account a few days before arrival, told this would be refunded on departure. When we arrived we were asked to pay the whole amount of our stay. 
The staff were rather glum and not at all welcoming. The rooftop pool area was a mess with rubbish and the bar isn’t open yet. We went to celebrate my husbands big age birthday which I informed them of prior, but this was ignored

The location was good quite near to the sights and restaurants. There was quite a bit of noise especially from the lift shaft
I was pleased to be leaving and won’t book another Derby Hotel

",2,2024,04,21
59,Just A Couple Of Big Negatives For Me,"Don't get me wrong, this hotel isn't a bad hotel, but a couple of things ""bugged"" me which i will mention after i have given you the plusses.

I have been to Barca a few times, April last year with the lads on a stag party was one of them, and this year with my wife for my 59th birthday. For anyone thinking of asking the question, ""Isn't It Time To Grow Old Gracefully?""......the answer is Yes, Yes it is...and i will do that.......Just not yet. (a thumbs up at the end of the review in agreement would be appreciated lads).

Last year i stayed at the Silken Ramblas, which was amazing and right in the heart of Las Ramblas...this year....it was too expensive to stay there.
The Astoria had a similar pool on the roof (a small plunge pool, but still lovely), and a certain authentic charm, so opetd for it. I think we paid €145 per night for the room which was €50 cheaper than the silken's.

++++++ (plus) Points

Staff were very friendly and willing to help with anything. The older gentlemen who booked us in on 26th March at 11.00 a.m. was amazing. I don't mean any offence by calling him older, but didn't get his name and dont know how else to describe him. He appeared to be a gentleman of may age, and very, very much like myself...worth his weight in gold.

Hotel was spotless, authentic and very traditional. Marble floors, spiral staircase and that ""Oldy Worldy"" Spanish thing going on that a true historian would relish in.

Room was spotless, and cleaned every day. Large double window (about 5' across, that could be opened to fill the room with light and air, Awesome tbh). Power shower and toiletries.....and get a load of this.....Slippers.
And to top it off......if the towels cost the hotel anything less than €100 each to purchase, they were a bargain....wow...never had such fluffy hotel towels.
Hair dryer, desk and case stand, and comfortable beds with an abundance of pillows... and there you have it......Your Mid Range Spanish City Hotel.

 _ _ _ _  (negative) Points

If you are after a quiet area of Barca, then this could really be for you. Its just off the 
""Avenida Diagonal"", which basically cuts the city in half, which basically means......
Your A Bit Out Of It.. The hotel is right at the top of the Ramblas, and if you want to walk to the bottom, where the port is... and the museums.... and the buzz....and your not used to walking.....and you don't want to rack up €40 per night/day cab fares.....
Una Problemo

Senor Gerente Del Hotel.....€18 for a breakfast is charged unless you sign up to eat for the week.....then it drops to €12. A disgrace my friend. They are your guests, they have paid to stay with you and the price of bread and jam is the same weather you have it one day....or 5 days.

You cant eat Dinner in the hotel. They will do a Brekkie, and they will do a lunch (€18 again which i think is reasonable for a lunch)).....But The Hotel Astoria Doesn't Provide An Evening Meal. First hotel i have had this happen if i'm honest....however...if its a Spanish thing or a City thing....My Bad.

No Kettle, No Brew Facilities........Again, i cant remember a City hotel room without the facilities to make a brew when you wake up. Possibly....very possibly...tea was on the room service at a tenner a pop, but cant say as i thought if they don't have the staff to do a dinner, may not have the staff to do a brew......dunno tbh.

Anyways....not a bad hotel and not a great hotel, but wouldn't bother me staying here again.

P.S......The hotel plug the restaurant Crosmus as a recommended Tapas restaurant by  stamping a card with the hotel logo entitling you to a complimentary glass of Cava on arrival........Its Baloney......We had the two glasses of Cava.....And Was Charged For both (see my Crosmas review).

ChiChin.....The Choice Is Yours",3,2024,04,03
59,Perfection!,"Definitely will stay again when I visit Barcelona next time. Staffs were so kind, perfect location and vibe from the hotel was very welcoming. Cafès and restaurants around hotel were nice. Possible to find both comfy/local and fancy. Staying near Casa Mila and Casa Batlló was just like a dream! ",5,2024,03,31
59,Excellent quality and affordable price,"I stayed at Hotel Astoria for 2 days with my wife, in March 2024. The location is great and the whole reception team was very helpful. It is close to the train station, just few blocks. I will stay here next time I visit Barcelona.",5,2024,03,29
59,Hotel Astoria,Clean hotel with very friendly staff who were very helpful good location in city centre.  Transport links were good with plenty of resteraunts and cafes nearby.  10 Minute walk to subway or bus service just outside the hotel that took you to Catalunya square.,5,2024,03,23
59,Good but very noisy even at night,"The service was great, the hotel was beautiful, but the noise was quite annoying. The window to the front was so thin it sounded as if it were open. The doors were not sound proof at all. We could hear every movement in the halls, every door open and shut, and I found it very difficult to sleep without being woken up by someone inside the hotel or traffic outside",4,2024,03,16
59,Nice old style hotel,"Comfortable stay with nice beds 
Good wifi
Excellent breakfast
A giooid solution both for work and leisure just steps from major Barcelona landmarks
A few steps from Avinguda Diagional and Passeig de Gracia",5,2024,03,14
59,Ideal for a short stop,"Good position for walking to the sites and restaurants, bars etc. Room was very small but Hotel was clean and pleasant. Restaurant, terrace bar and pool closed in early March. Poor Barcelone has a drought presently so no baths and limits on water usage - fair enough!",4,2024,03,06
59,Suited my solo stay well.,"Nice hotel, pleasant staff . Safe area for solo travel . Well served for buses to other areas . Didn’t eat there. Room was nice , walls thin could hear other guests in rooms and people leaving from early morning. No noise during night though, thankfully. Value ok , a lot of Barcelona hotels quite pricey for room only , considering no frills. Was happy with it tho .",4,2024,03,05
59,"old world grace and luxury in a good neighborhood, a walking distance away from everything","This is such a lovely hotel. Very clean and well-kept for a property with such history. It has a charming museum room with old illustrations. The roof terrace swimming pool and gym are small but have a great view and suffice for a short workout. Breakfast was very nice, and mostly the staff are super helpful and gracious in every way. Bed was also comfortable, although the standard room is a bit on the small size, and I would recommend upgrading to a bogger one.",5,2024,02,18
59,A gem of a hotel for family Barcelona trip,"A fab little gem of a hotel in Barcelona. 
Smart decor, v clean and well looked after. Good size room for city hotel. Excellent breakfast. Small pool on roof - we didn’t use as visited in Feb but would be lovely in warmer months. Gym room with running machine etc in. Worth visiting roof terrace for views. 
Hotel is walking distance to many restaurants and shops. 
About a 30 min walk to gothic area etc. Also on plenty of bus routes. We walked everywhere and only used bus once. Main shopping street with Zara, H&M and designer shops about 10 min walk away. Smaller touristy shops in gothic back streets and alleys. 
About a 35euro ride in a taxi from airport.",5,2024,02,14
59,Lovely stay in a great and safe location,"We stayed at hotel Astoria for 6 nights In july and had a great trip. The hotel has a beautiful art exhibition inside and charm to it. The staff are very helpful, and would always  flag taxis down  and gave us directions to nearby places and recommendations. They even helped us with food to the room, after a late night. A great guy behind the desk and we forgot his name, took us to the local shop as we arrived late and told us where to be safe in Barcelona as 2 women travelling together, lovely touch. The room was always clean and tidy, and comfy bed. Check in and out was an easy process. And the rooftop pool and drinks sent up was a nice atmosphere the end of the day before dinner or first thing. Would recommend",5,2024,02,07
59,Beautiful hotel,"Excellent location, great value for money, helpful staff. Room was comfortable and very tidy. Great housekeeping. Convenient to all forms of public transport. Lots of choices for eating and drinking in the neighbourhood ",5,2024,02,05
59,Great Hotel in Great Location. ,"Excellent hotel with magnificent exhibition of drawings by Ricard Opisso. Hotel well located, close to metro and within 30mins walking distance of many of major sights in Barcelona, La Rambla, Sagrada Familia, Casa Vincens.

I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona ",5,2024,01,27
59,Lovely Hotel and good location,Lovely stay and room was small but perfectly adequate and clean and tidy. Staff were friendly and didn’t have breakfast but walk across the road and Lovely bakery and coffee before day exploring Barcelona. Only 4 out do 5 as no tea or coffee machine in room which was a first but would recommend and stay again.,4,2024,01,22
59,Excellent!,"We loved our stay at Hotel Astoria. Everything was super clean, including the room and the lobby, the workers were extremely nice and the location was excellent. If you enjoy to walk, the hotel was walking distance from many attractions, but if not, there were many metro stations close to the hotel. We would certainly come back!",5,2023,12,07
59,Lovely hotel and lovely staff,The hotel is really well placed to be close to public transport and lots of restaurants near by. The staff were super friendly and helpful. The hotel was clean and tidy and smelt amazing! The bed was super comfy and the shower was nice with good pressure. Definitely would recommend and definitely would come back again,5,2023,11,27
59,"Classy, clean, and friendly","Loved our stay at Hotel Astoria! From the friendly staff to the spacious, spotless, and quiet room, we were more than delighted with our week here. Very comfortable bed, upscale linens, lovely view of the street (and the trees with parrots in them!). We opted not to get the breakfast, as we were visiting family, but a peek in the dining room revealed a generous spread. The roof deck is gorgeous--a quiet oasis in the city. We also enjoyed all the artwork--elegant touch throughout the hotel. ",5,2023,11,24
59,"Nice, simple yet efficient",This is a no frills but comfortable little hotel. Our room was very quiet facing the courtyard. Hotel is located in a quiet neighbourhood yet is close to major shopping area and there is a lot of transportation choices around.,4,2023,11,18
59,"Highly recommended, very clean and friendly staffs ","Was here on holiday with my sister and we both very happy and satisfied with the staffs from the day we checked in till our last day (today) GM Mr Pepe so happy to let us stay till late afternoon due to our late flight as well, very central to every where we went. 
If you like art, the owner of the hotel have good collection by only one artist Opisso 
All I can say, highly recommended.",5,2023,11,16
59,Barcelona Stay,"Good hotel with a great location. If you are prepared to explore on foot, most city attractions can be reached with a walk. Area around the hotel is pleasant with lots of bars and restaurants. Would recommend. ",4,2023,11,05
59,"Exceptional People, Unforgettable Stay","Traveling with toddlers is always an adventure, and this hotel exceeded our expectations. While the location is great, the biggest assets of this hotel are its exceptional people. We initially booked for one night before our cruise, but the warmth and kindness of the staff, particularly Alex, who greeted us upon arrival, made us extend our stay. Alex was so genuinely warm and kind that we looked forward to seeing him every day. Another highlight for us was Miss Montserrat, our first night she set up the crib for our baby with a level of care and kindness that we've never experienced anywhere else. Her warmth and attention made us feel truly welcomed. The experience they provided was unparalleled. Thank you for making our stay extraordinary.",5,2023,10,30
59,Lovely hotel - highly recommended for families.,Would highly recommend this hotel! We stayed as a family with two children and the room was a great size with its own balcony. Breakfast was amazing and the staff were helpful and friendly! The location was really good - lots of nice places to eat nearby and close enough to walk into the centre.  ,5,2023,10,28
59,Staying there is now a core memory <3 ,"Went to Barcelona to celebrate my 30's and the location was the best! super central and close to everything. The highlight wasn't just the super comfy room nor the amazing pool; was the Breakfast staff, Maria José made the absolute best coffees that I can remember and always had this positive aura around her. I normally am not this cheesy with hotels, but this one has a spot on me. This is a big-time hidden pearl in Barcelona!! 

10/10!!!",5,2023,10,27
59,Recommendable hotel in Barcelona,"Wonderful classy hotel with a great location. Rooms well appointed, very clean and comfortable beds with quality linen. Appreciated the reception and the information provided. The art display in the lobby area is to be seen and we were thankful for the free passes to the Egyptian Museum of Barcelona.",5,2023,10,25
59,Brilliant for 3* hotel,"Good location, 10 minute walk to the diagonal metro station, great staff and nice rooftop terrace, only minor disappointment was the lack of toilet brush (not very romantic leaving a dirty toilet for your beau) but otherwise lovely for a 3* hotel.",4,2023,09,26
59,Our first stay here!,"A wonderfully located hotel, in an upmarket area, very close to the Passeig de Gracia.  Full of character, the hotel is very reasonably priced too.  The rooms are on the small side but certainly fit for purpose.  Air conditioning that works too!",4,2023,09,14
59,A little gem in Barcelona,"The hotel is situated in a safe neighbourhood, very clean and tidy and  we were thankful for the air conditioning after a day out in the sun.   We had room only.  Not a problem as so many places nearby to have our coffee and pastries in the morning.   Was a little way from the beach, but the hotel is close to the buses and metro, making it within  easy reach and also for sightseeing.  There are plenty of shops along the way.  The reason for 4 stars is the pool on terrace was not adequate for the amount of people staying there, but understandably, we weren't there to sit by the pool.    I would recommend staying here.",4,2023,09,02
59,Fantastic value for money,"Very good hotel for the price. Staff were lovely and very helpful. Beautiful building inside & out. Air conditioning worked excellently which was very important. Pool is small but it’s fine because it’s never that busy. Room is fine, nothing outstanding but absolutely fine. Location is good with lots nearby. Only thing I would say is roof terrace should have more shade/parasols available. All in all, I feel like this hotel should be 4 star rather than 3.",5,2023,08,24
59,Hotel Astoria barcelona,"Very poor place to stay in considering the price you pay. Double bed was tiny - my feet were hanging off the edge and I’m an average sized male. It claims soundproof walls however the noise from outside our room and throughout the night were extremely loud causing us restless nights sleep. The cleaning service crew contributed to these obnoxious noises  The photos of the hotel looked really promising with the rooftop pool / hotel room space ect. But are very decieving and in fact sub par.
No view to speak of which is indicated in the profile as a “Barcelona style courtyard”.
We also had a cockroach in our room upon arrival. The bathroom was tiny. The shower head and water flow would quite literally bounce off your head an overflow into the rest of the bathroom. 
Do not recommend and will not be returning. 
",1,2023,08,21
59,Solid hotel that doesn’t break the bank,"This hotel is a true 3 star hotel. It won’t enhance your trip or add anything special, but it also won’t be a sore spot and take away from your experiences in Barcelona. 

The pros: 

Budget friendly, very clean room, good location near excellent food and short walk or 10€ taxi to most parts of the city. 24/7 staff and really tasty room service.

The cons:

Pool is small and overcrowded. Our shower wouldn’t drain as fast as the water came out, so it would pool up. 

Overall I recommend the hotel Astoria for a 1-7 night stay, as it will provide the amenities needed for comfort without breaking the bank. If you’re looking for somewhere to stay that will up your Barcelona experience, you’ll need to spend more money, but the hotel Astoria is a safe and consistent nights sleep for sure!",4,2023,08,19
59,Peaceful and comfortable accommodation,"This hotel is a very good value for money indeed! It has got its own unique style and character which I found quite charming. Besides, it is conveniently located for those who wish to explore the most popular places of interest in Barcelona. Staff is freindly and helpful. A wonderful place to stay.",5,2023,08,17
59,Decent and served its purpose,"Fine as a place to sleep. While the lobby is beautiful, everything else is very standard and did the job but nothing beyond.

Pros
- Beautiful lobby, bar, and decor in the public areas
- Great location, fairly convenient to transport options 
- Decent rate 
- Good view from the rooftop with a small dipping pool.

Cons:
- Room was tiny. It would be difficult for two people to share despite the bed being a good size. - While the room was cutely decorated, it is clearly older and in need of a real update. 
- The room has an unmovable metal covering that doesn’t open past a peek. Essentially a dark room that feels like you don’t have a window.
- The bathroom stunk! The smell was obvious when I first entered and continued throughout my stay. Blasting the AC did not help to reduce the smell. I could barely stomach drinking water in the room due to the smell, and would instead do that outside on the roof deck.
- Staff did their jobs but were not particularly friendly or helpful. Sometimes you goto a hotel and the staff are so lovely that it elevates your entire stay - this was not one of those situations. Everyone seemed glum. Complete contrast to the friendly and cheerful city.",3,2023,08,16
59,lovely hidden gem,cool clean vintage feeling hotel. beautiful interiors with fantastic artwork. clean well proportioned rooms tho plainly furnished ideal for city break. good outdoor space on roof. very centrally placed for sightseeing and shopping. lots of great food nearby,5,2023,07,31
59,Great stay!,My husband and I are on our honeymoon and spent 3 nights at Hotel Astoria. The room was a little small but still very good. The hotel was clean and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The pool was a great addition to our stay. In terms of location this place is a 20-30 minute walk (or less) to most places. Highly recommend. ,4,2023,07,31
59,Definitely recommend this hotel!!,"We’ve just gotten home from a 4 night stay at this hotel and couldn’t fault it at all. The staff were so helpful and friendly, swapping our room to single beds and always helping with any key/safe issues we had. The young girl working at the bar/pool was so lovely. The beds in the room were amazing and also towels were provided. The rooftop  was great to come back to and have a few drinks by the pool. A lot of shops/bars nearby but to the main attractions we had to walk/taxi but it was always so easy to flag a taxi down outside. Would definitely stay here again!",5,2023,07,20
59,Hotel Astoria,"Great hotel! Beautiful, clean, safe area. The staff is fantastic, especially Pepe the manager! We felt right at home. There is a parking garage to the right across the street with valet if you have a rental car and a hotel parking spot for loading and unloading right out front. Great air conditioning, comfy beds, nice shower. Good noise control in the rooms and black out curtains. The rooftop is a nice escape from the busy city life below. Would recommend and would stay again!",5,2023,07,15
59,"Solid price, solid location, overall recommend","This hotel was great value, had a great location for our first time in Barcelona, and we loved the rooftop pool to cool down on hot days! Our room was always nice and cool (air conditioning was definitely important during our summer trip), and everything in the room seemed relatively updated and clean. The TV only had a couple channels in English, but we were out exploring most of the time anyway.

The staff could've been more welcoming - they were just fine, but didn't go above and beyond on the customer service front. Overall, would recommend this hotel as a solid value for your first time in Barcelona.",4,2023,07,14
59,Great hotel in Barcelona,"Really great 3 nights stay here with my son. Safe area. Only 5-10 mins walk to metro/bus. 30 min walk to Gothic quarter. Room fantastic. Breakfast great. Concierge restaurant recommendations outstanding! Pool nice luxury on rooftop at end of a hot day, small pool and pool area but really nice and always had a seat.",5,2023,07,11
59,Poor value for money,"Dark and depressing room for $280 CAD. Lots of noise in the room so had a bad sleep. Room is small, dark and depressing with the view of an air shaft. Can hear the huge AC venting machine all night long and feel it vibrating while in bed. Lots of noise from the hallway as well so wasn’t able to sleep in. I do not recommend and will not stay here again.",1,2023,07,09
59,Great location and front desk personnel,"Hotel is in a great location, close to major tourist attractions and very easy to get a taxi. There are many restaurants within walking distance and different prices (beware you won't be able to get lunch service until after 1-1:30 pm).The best part was the front desk personnel; they were always friendly, helpful, and informative.",5,2023,07,05
59,Excellent hotel,"This hotel is very beautiful situated close to metro stations, restaurants, bars and shops. The facilities are clean and the room is super comfortable. I loved the great rooftop pool. Can't wait to come back!",5,2023,07,04
59,"Great location, friendly staff, clean","We spent 3 nights in Astoria - great hotel, unique ambience with lot of artworks hanging on the wall.  Rooms was spacious, comfy, clean and tidy, staff was very friendly and helpful, location was good and we visit almost every attraction on foot (bus and metro stops are also near the hotel if you don`t want to walk). Breakfast was great, lot of varieties to choose from. Terrace with pool on the roof was a bonus, to drink the coffee in the morning, or chill in the afternoon.   ",5,2023,07,03
59,Great stay,"We stayed here for 3 nights recently, and had a fantastic visit. The staff are extremely helpful and attentive. We were unsure on how the air conditioning worked, so I went down to reception and the man behind the desk kindly came to the room to give a full explanation on how to operate this. The facilities in the hotel were fantastic, with the rooftop pool being a great touch after a long day in the sun. The bed was the comfiest bed I have slept on, and the sheets always had a nice crisp feeling everyday. 
The room was also cleaned to a high standard every single day. The breakfast overall was good - nice buffet style and also a option of cooked breakfast which is cooked to order. The orange juice was freshly squeezed and so refreshing. 
The hotel is in a great location and is no more than a 10 minute walk to the nearest metro, with lots of shops/cafe's/bars and restaurants nearby. 

The sound from the corridor outside the room does carry and you can hear other people when walking past - although the flooring in the corridor is marble so can be expected. 
Also, the room we stayed in wasn't a street facing one, so our window looked out onto 'a courtyard', which has been put there so the 'inside' rooms can get some light. This did mean that there was a lack of natural light going into the room. It is a large hotel so can appreciate not everyone can get a 'street facing room', so this did suffice for this, and good to have a window nonetheless.  

Overall, we had a fantastic stay here and would highly recommend this hotel if you are considering a break to Barcelona. We will return here for sure. 
",4,2023,07,02
59,Comfortable room in a good location,"The location of the hotel is good, with easy access to public transport (15 minute walk to Passeig de Gràcia train station) and many bus stops / metro stations nearby. 
The beds are comfortable and rooms very clean. There is a mini fridge in the room (although ours did not seem to be turned on). The bathroom is small but adequate (has a bath and shower). 
Front desk staff are helpful and informed of us nearby attractions and restaurants - they offered to book us reservations and taxis if required. 
I did not have time to use the pool or gym as my stay was only very brief, but the rooftop pool seemed popular. 
Would book again. ",5,2023,06,23
59,"Vantage location, excellent service and unique ambience","The first thing that struck us about this hotel is the ambience…an art exhibition was going on! Plus little touches like a piano, statuettes and framed poster art added to the impression!

The room was cosy and had sufficient space to move around easily! 

Best part was the service! We were provided with electric kettle and tea bags on request! They even provided us dinner plates and cutlery, when we requested for them (we had bought some snacks to eat in our room). The guys at the reception were eager to help and guide about movement and transport! 

A great place to stay! We wholeheartedly recommend others to try out this hotel!",5,2023,06,21
59,Lost our bag and never contacted us,"They lost one of our bags and never contacted us as they promised with an outcome. The service is poor and the hotel is old, but not in a charming way. It was so exhausting and it was just for one night!",2,2023,06,21
59,Hotel Astoria Barcelona,"The hotel is well located. Some sights close to it. Lots of bars and restaurants close by too.
Rooms are comfortable and clean.
The staff is pleasant and friendly.
Delicious breakfast with a little bit of everything.",5,2023,06,18
59,Fabulous - Highly Recommended ,The hotel is in an excellent location and just over a 5 mins walk from La Ramblas and approximately 25 mins from the airport by taxi. The interior and furnishings are beautiful especially the art work displayed in the lobby area. All of the front desk staff gave exceptional customer service and nothing was too much trouble. The room I had was quite small but perfectly adequate for a 3 night stay. There was a work desk and the WiFi was excellent. The marble bathroom includes big fluffy towels and The White Company toiletries add a touch of luxury too. The bed was very comfortable with a choice of 3 sets of pillows. The room was cool and dark so I had a great night’s sleep plus it was spotlessly clean. The roof top terrace was a bonus and a perfect way to start the day looking over the city.  In my opinion this hotel should be rated 4 star and I would highly recommend it. ,5,2023,06,18
59,Lovely hotel - great for the Spanish nightlife if you wish but far enough away not for it to be a bother. Good value,"Really liked this place, main reason, on Fridays and Saturdays it’s one block down from the main Spanish weekend party area (don’t worry far enough away from noise) and wow so busy great atmosphere which was great as celebrating my birthday with friends

Hotel was really clean, staff helpful, rooms are very intimate so be prepared. It’s got everything you need though and great shower but even a twin bed is cosy. 

Location wise is great we walked to port villa and las ramblas it’s about 25 mins away I’m sure people could do it quicker with other ways. Used an Uber a couple of times also. 

Hotel was great value for money vs others no complaints at all",5,2023,06,12
59,Great ambiance with a unique twist/touch,"The hotel has a unique permanent exhibition of Ricard Opisso that gives it that interesting twist that I am always looking for in a hotel. You feel like you are transported back in time. The rooms were clean and big enough for our needs. Hotel staff were helpful and alert. The hotel does not have private parking, but can help with a reduced price in a parking garage close by. Also, lots of restaurants in the area.",4,2023,05,22
59,Fair hotel,"Nice hotel but quite a walk from the main attractions. On a busy road and room at the front very noisy. Walls paper thin and noise from other rooms can be heard. Staff not very attentive, there is a hot breakfast selection but staff do not ask if you want to order so you may not realise this is included. Room facilities fair. No coffee/tea facilities. Mini bar available but prices very high. Take water with you. Overall fair stay but would not rebook. ",3,2023,05,12
59,Lana,Very nice hotel and good breakfast. Friendly and helpful staff. Good location. Walking distance to the centre and Sagrada Familia within half an hour.Very comfortable bed for a good night sleep. Enjoyed my stay.,5,2023,04,12
59,Expensive but fine,"Overall fine, perfect location, not too many tourists. BUT the cleaning ladies did NOT change our glasses? FOR THE WHOLE WEEK we had to drink water, cola AND champagne out of the same 4 glasses. Not okay! We even wrote them a letter, and they did NOTHING! The bathroom had minor problems, yet the overall experience was fine.",3,2023,04,10
59,Wonderful stay in Barcelona,We were sceptical about this hotel because of some of the reviews but we have just returned from 4 nights in this lovely hotel. This hotel looks nothing from the outside but once over the threshold it has the wow factor the reception area is very impressive the staff were smart and helpful. The room we were given was at the front of the hotel on the second floor which was spacious and very clean but we were perturbed because of recent reviews about the noise from the traffic. Barcelona is a very large city and my word there is so much traffic and it was noisy at first but it never impacted on our sleep or stay. My wife and I are very fortunate to have travelled extensively during our 52 years of married life and this hotel we rate as very good.,5,2023,04,02
59,Fantastic getaway Hotel,"First stay in Barcelona very nice hotel, great enthusiastic service. Rooms were clean and very nice, marble everywhere, hotel bar was good, didnt use the roof pool as the weather was too cold, only small anyway so beach would be better for a group. Everything you would want within reach, and street taxis are accessible easy enough, (hotel will book on request if needed). Would have been a five from me but i didnt stay long enough or use the facilities, overall was great stay and definitely recommend to anyone!!! ",4,2023,03,19
59,Best family room ever!!!,"We often travel to cities with two older kids (13 and 17) and have trouble finding a spacious, comfortable room with decent beds (usually a small sofa bed) at a price within our budget. This room had everything we always look for and met all our expectations. Kids had their own room with 2 twin beds, the room for us had a king size bed, extremelly comfortable, there was a hallway between these rooms with a washroom and mirrors and storage, all separated by sliding doors, the rooms had spacious closets and extra storage space, and among other things we had an amazing terrace with a view of the street and the city. The rooms were modern and practical. The hotel had beautiful interiors and also a terrace and a small pool on the roof. Also the accessibility of the hotel was amazing. It is located right in the center of the tourist zone. I have nothing to complain about and will definitely recommend it to my friends.",5,2023,03,16
59,Excellent!,"Excellent hotel very good location, very kind staff, very clean room exceeded our expectations. In my opinion it should improve a little bit  the breakfast buffet, although I am very satisfied. I fully recommend this place!!",5,2023,02,26
59,Disappointing,"Disappointed by our stay at Astoria. The reception staff sounded like they were mourning. The room was totally different than what is presented on the picture. Our room - very clean must we note - was old, stuffy and unpractical. The pool was so tiny it is laughable! The rooftop offers a nice view though, and the location is nice but we would not come back as we feel really underwhelmed. ",3,2023,02,21
59,Great stay,"The room was nice and clean. Location is just perfect, 15 minutes walk to Placa Catalunya, very close to the underground, as well as lots of nice restaurants. We had an amazing time, definitely recommend!",5,2023,02,21
59,Great hotel in a great location!,"Amazing hotel, especially for the price. The staff are all super friendly and the rooms quite comfortable, even for a bigger guy such as myself.  Definitely recommend this for my friends and family!  Don't miss this gem from Derby Hotels! ",5,2023,02,17
59,Very noisy for such thin walls,"The room was old. I asked for a full size bed but I got two twin that had wheels and would slide apart. The noise from other rooms was very loud. I have friends who could hear porn, netflix or peoples conversations. In my case it was furniture being moved and power tools, very early in the morning. I could not sleep after 8am.",2,2023,02,09
59,Comfortable and friendly hotel,"My friend and I had an excellent stay in Barcelona at Hotel Astoria. The staff were lovely, the building is charming and the rooms are spacious and clean. The beds were big and very comfortable. The road was a little noisy at night, and you could sometimes hear other guests through the walls, but we didn't find it too troublesome with earplugs. Would recommend, we had an enjoyable time! ",4,2023,02,07
59,Excellent,"Really lovely. Can easily recommend. Apparently there's a 200 character minimum review lenght, so I guess I'll keep typing, but the place is nice, travel connections are easy, and there's heaps of bars and restaurants nearby. Very comfortable stay. ",5,2023,02,07
59,Great hotel,"I liked the hotel, very nice interior. Everything was really nice.
Reseption open 24/7 , staff is friendly.  Rooms are cleaned daily and cleaning was so good. Towels are changed daily.  mini-fridge in the room, hair dryer (not very good for longer hair). 
Very comfortable bed and pillows were chic, there were 7 of them) Cool! 
Hotel has good located, there is near underground .
On the top floor is swimming pool and a terrace (the pool is not heated, it was cold in January).
We were satisfied with our   vacation.
 Of the minuses is poor soundproofing.
In the neighboring rooms you could hear singing or people sneezing and etc)  we woke up in the morning because the staff starts cleaning) all sounds are very audible. 
Second is the Internet is free for only seven days and it was hard to work, because wife is slow. 

I recommend  this hotel. 
We enjoyed  our holiday, thank you for the service",5,2023,01,06
59,I  recommend this hotel,"Very nice hotel, comfortable bed, clean room, clean bathroom, you get the room cleaned everyday even though it’s not necessary. Very friendly staff. Great location, around the corner you have Diagonal where you feel more safe  overall than in old town area. ",5,2022,12,31
59,Excellent and affordable stay,"A perfect 3 star hotel right at the center of Barcelona. Beautiful rooms, helpful staff and excellent service. It should be the place to chose if you want to stay at the center and roam around all major attractions of Barcelona.",5,2022,12,29
59,A gem of an hotel in a beautiful city,"From the moment we arrived at this elegant hotel we were warmly welcomed by the desk staff. We were in Barcelona for four days and during that time all the hotel staff were at pains to ensure that our stay was highly enjoyable.
The great welcome and the really elegant surroundings were a big contribution to a memorable city break.
We are determined to return next year.",5,2022,12,17
59,"Superb location, great service, excellent room","We get everything we need, and the location is exceptional, full of excellent restaurants, shops, services, nice areas to walk, public transport, etc. The room is clean and quiet, great value for money. We have already been a few times and we will keep coming.",5,2022,12,06
59,Wonderful stay in Hotel Astoria,"The hotel was absolutely wonderful. The location, the room were great and staff went above and beyond, which made it perfect. No request was too small or too hard. As a guest it made you feel as part of the family - very personable (that was ideal for traveling solo. I came to celebrate Thanksgiving w friends, but as they had to work, spent a large part of my stay alone-:) So could not have stayed in a better place❤️",5,2022,12,02
59,great,"The hotel location is great, the room is really nice and the bed is super comfortable. The shower is decent but the sink was leaking a little bit, and the showerhead was a bit too low for my 1.90m husband...",4,2022,11,19
59,Good hotel in a good location,"The hotel was really nice and in a great location -easy to walk to many main attractions. It was also close to bigger streets which made me feel safer as a solo traveler.
The staff was awesome -always helpful and friendly!
The breakfast was good for a 3-star-hotel. I especially enjoyed the fresh fruits!
The soundproofing was quite bad, so you could hear when someone was in the hallway. Anyway this didn’t really bother me bc there wasn’t that much noice during the night so I could still sleep well.
The detergents used for cleaning and laundry had a really strong smell, which was a bad thing since I’m very sensitive to strong smells. Anyway it helped a little bit when I opened the window. The ”view” was to a wall/windows of other rooms of the hotel, but there was still some fresh air since the interior courtyard shaft thing had no roof.
The general cleanliness in the hotel was good. It was also really nice that when I arrived, the staff showed me my room and told how the air conditioning worked and there was also a big bottle of fresh water in the room and it was free!
I do recommend this hotel if you’re staying in Barcelona! I would definitely stay again!",4,2022,11,12
59,"Great hotel, great neighborhood, above 3 star experience","Overall experience is good, from reception desk to hall with nice exhibition, to the cleanness of the room... Room is really good equipped, has a large bed (king size) wide about or over 2 meters, which makes the best one I've experienced in 3* hotel... The bathroom is amazing - from bide to full size bath tub, with shower, so you can bath or take quick shower... Great. 
Negative side - the street is quite noisy and the windows are extremely thin, so there is some noise you hear in the room even with windows closed. So if the bed wasn't as amazing as it was, my sleep quality would be poor. This way it was ok. ",4,2022,11,10
59,Nice location in Barcelona and immaculate hotel,"My daughter and I shared a twin bedroom. Room is compact, clean with gorgeous pillows and bed linen - the towels are luxurious. The bathroom is small - could do without a small bath but the shower is probably one of the best ever, so nice and strong with complimentary toiletries.  Sound proofing is not good you can hear other rooms and bathrooms but having said that we slept well. The staff are nice - we did not take breakfast as there are wonderful places nearby and many options.
A super clean and looked after hotel.",4,2022,11,08
59,"Great location, nice staff, comfortable bed, clean, pool if you need it","We stayed here before in 2009 and came back because it was a good deal and in a great location. We had a fine stay. Found the staff lovely, our room was far larger than last time, clean, white soft bedding, large bath sheets, no tub but a large shower and bath. The breakfast was typical Spanish with addition of eggs, sausage, bacon if you wanted it a bit expensive for 2 but all you could eat. Perfect location only 4 blocks to Passage de Gracia and block to the Diagonal. Restaurants and bars all around. Hotel bar was friendly.",5,2022,11,02
59,Not worth it,This hotel is clean and well located but you can hear EVERYTHING. I could hear a person brushing their teeth! Everytime anyone turned their sink on. Every door shut. Every foot step. Maybe some rooms are more insulated than others but I don’t know that its worth the risk.,2,2022,10,29
59,Home away from home,"I frequently travel to BCN and this is my go to hotel.  Best staff, lovely lobby, super clean, great location—my second home. Rooms in the back are quiet and very comfortable beds, good towels. Room service available so good if you’re working late. A handrail at the bathtub would be welcomed.",5,2022,10,19
59,Hotel Astoria,I stayed at a few different Derby Hotels and they're outstanding and have seemed to lock up some of the best locations possible! Hotel Astoria was a great value considering the location and room quality. Highly recommend. ,5,2022,10,14
59,3 night stay,"We had a three night stay here, nothing bad to say about the Hotel, it was lovely and clean, all the staff were very polite and accommodating, nothing was too much trouble. 
Breakfast times were perfect & there was plenty to pick from. 
Only downfall was the room could have done with a kettle. ",4,2022,09,29
59,Great Holiday,Enjoyed our stay at Astoria which came through a recommendation. Staff were very helpful and hotel is well placed to visit most attractions both on foot or by metro/bus (we walked everywhere). Also some good restaurants within 5 minute walk.,4,2022,09,28
59,Better off with an Airbnb or other hotel,"I probably got unlucky with my room and a particular staff member but certainly not worth the price compared to a airbnb.

Couple of nice things first are the lobby and room (although we paid for the enhanced double). Also the hotel and the location feel like safe places. 

AC was very loud and floor tile was loose in shower. The room keys honestly broke every time we used it and the staff weren't apologetic. 

Half the staff were really nice and the other half weren't very pleasant.. Very strange...

Unfortunately checking in we had someone who was quite rude and unhelpful regarding the fact we requested double beds and got single. They ultimately fixed this but I made a note on booking and rang up before coming to confirm and this obviously was ignored as the man had no record of either interactions.

Pool is nice but small for amount of guests and opening times are very short. 

In my opinion, these little things are exactly why you book with a hotel over a Airbnb but this hotel failed at every step. Can't say there was any major problems but enough to leave me with a overall negative experience.
",1,2022,09,25
59,Excellent location in Barcelona,"The location of this hotel is excellent for sightseeing and public transportation. The room was very clean and the bed very comfortable, and I loved the rain shower and good pressure! The artwork and beautiful spiral staircase add great character to the entrance lobby.",5,2022,09,19
59,Has character,Comfortable enough and has lots character however sleep disturbed due to clientele from the night club. Worth asking for a room at the back of the hotel.  Coffee and tea making facilities not included in the room rate; even budget hotels include this. ,4,2022,09,18
59,Comfortable hotel but the reception staff are rude,"This hotel deserves better than 3 stars out of 5, but the reception staff  on check in, check out and retrieving our bags from storage were rude, and inefficient. I am a paying guest and deserve better than the arrogance with which I was treated.

The room itself was comfortable and a good size. The bed was comfortable, shower was hot, and amenities were good. However it was also a little noisy, with crashing doors and gutters dripping!

Such a shame, as Barcelona is a lovely city and the hotel is well situated..",3,2022,09,15
59,We’ll definitely stay here on our next visit,"This hotel is well situated - near enough to walk to the centre of Barcelona but away from very crowded areas. The accommodation was excellent and the room was spacious. The staff were friendly and very helpful. The breakfast was very good, though a bit overpriced. We’ll be back!
",5,2022,09,11
59,Short city break 2022,"Barcelona exceeded my expectations with lots to see and do, although very busy it is a must experience city with beautiful sights and history as well as the very cosmopolitan gothic and harbour/beach areas to enjoy too, Hotel Astoria is a great base within 25-45 mins walk from all major sights, taxis and buses are all very accessible and plentiful , as is the underground metro for those more exploratory than myself. Great breakfast at the hotel, staff all very friendly and efficient and the cleanliness is spot on. Our room was modern and functional with plenty if storage but my only issue was the window outlook which opened out onto a central evacuation service shaft with zero sunlight or views to enjoy. A firm 4 star experience... must visits, La Sagrida Familia, cable car ride, Olympic stadium, Camp Nou tour, Aquarium and Narina, Gothic Quarter.",4,2022,09,10
59,"Good decor, hotel was ok",Hotel has beautiful decor and the main lobby was beautiful. Room were spacious with a nice big bed. Maids were brilliant and tired everyday. People having showers in the rooms nearby woke me up during the night however. Terrace was nice but pool was slimy and dirty - looked like it hadn’t been cleaned for a while. All in all hotel was ok.,3,2022,09,09
59,Great hotel for a family stay,This boutique hotel is well located in a safe area with many restaurants nearby. The staff are super helpful and sympathetic! Small pool but nice cocktails on the rooftop. Very clean. The family suite was spacious with a large patio off the room. A bit noisy.,5,2022,08,17
59,Weekend in the city,Excellent hotel with added bonus of a rooftop pool. Would recommend and stay again! Great staff too! Location was spot on and super quiet. Had pool to ourselves most of the time! Air conditioner saved us in the heat.,5,2022,08,17
59,Excellent hotel,"Great hotel, great stuff, tasty breakfast, good position.
Everything was really nice.
Min points:
It's a pity that smoking is allowed on the roof of the hotel. All smokers go to the pool or to the area next to the gym and smoke a lot there. Smoke enters the rooms and the corridor.
They should forbid smoking in all hotel. Now some people enjoy and the rest do not. ",5,2022,08,15
59,Staying in a hotel where nobody speaks english,I am staying in this hotel. Nobody speaks english here. We asked normal questions about seperate sheets nobody understand anything and we needed to ask this over and over. Also at the pool there is no service only one employee in an hour. We took our own food but us was told its not allowed but why is there no employee at the poolbar? Also we need to call 3 times to the reception if someone wants to take an order. We are not really happy here. After the employee told us that we cant bring our own food at the pool two minutes later she told this to her collegue and they both laughed in front of us. Bit strange right?,2,2022,08,11
59,Great hotel in Barcelona,"Very nice hotel with a pool on the roof with great service of drinks.
The room were nice with excellent air conditioning. The personnel always were very nice and managed all our request perfectly well.
The art in the hotel was an extra that was very nice. ",5,2022,07,20
59,Poor customer service,"I was so disappointed in this hotel after reading reviews and selecting it based on the positive things people have said. When we arrived, there was no one to greet us and the clerk who checked us in was on the phone and ignored us for several minutes. He checked us in without even a word of greeting or welcome. When we entered our room, a ceiling tile in the bathroom was exposed and broken. We went downstairs and explained and the clerk came up to the room to see. He told us the AC was being worked on and someone would be there tomorrow to fix it. We said we wanted a new room, and he reluctantly moved us. Not a great start! The new room was functioning, however the set up of the bathroom is strange. The tub/shower only has a 1 foot glass door, so water floods the tile bathroom floor after each shower. Very slippery. Throughout the rest of our stay, not one clerk or staff member said good morning or good evening as we came and went. When we arrived late one evening, we walked in and up the elevator with no one even turning their head behind the desk. Not great security! The ONLY time a staff member approached us was when I was leaving on an early flight and my travel mate walked me out. A clerk ran up to us and accused us of leaving before checking out! We explained that my travel mate would  check out since she had a later flight. Unbelievable, since we had to prepay, and only owed about 10 euros. Every other hotel we stayed at in Spain had amazing hospitality. ",2,2022,07,16
59,Worth a stay,"Hotel Astoria was a very good for value stay! A perfect location, close to numerous restaurants and bars. Rooms were spacious and clean. The rooftop pool was never too busy and had a good view of the city. Drinks were slightly more expensive than surrounding venues.",5,2022,07,09
59,Hotel Astoria,Stay in Astoria Hotel was really good staff was great Rooms we’re good seize and clean The service was excellent If am visiting Barcelona I will say with Astoria hotel .Check in and Check out was very professional.Break fast was great.,4,2022,07,08
59,Very good hotel,"It had a very good location, the service was excellent and polite. Our room was very clean and not too tiny, just enough for the both of us. The roof top terrace and pool was very good to with an excellent view.",5,2022,07,03
59,"Thin walls, Noisy.","The staff are friendly and hotel is in a good location. For almost $200 you would think you can at least get some sleep, NO. Thin walls, when someone is taking a shower at 2 am you will definitely be woken up. A/C does not work in all rooms. Rooms facing the street on the first two floors are also noisy. Had to change rooms twice and it is 3 am and I have been woken up by the sound of water running and it is quite loud.",1,2022,06,28
59,"Very nice, charming hotel","I really enjoyed my stay at Astoria. The service is very good, the staff friendly and supporting. The room equipment is excellent and includes even hand sanitizer. The building itself is beautiful with a lot of flair. The hotel is located at the heart of Barcelona, but when your room is located at the backside of the hotel (which was mine), you won't hear the noise of the street.",5,2022,06,27
59,Good choice for Barcelona.,"It is all about the location! Nice room but not very new. Hotel workers always pleasant and breakfast was ok. but not amazing. If you want a great location in heart of such big city like Barcelona, keep this as one of your options.",5,2022,06,26
59,Medium stay,"Over all it’s a good hotel, super good location and in general it’s nice. First day at arrival we had a leakage so we had to switch rooms, heard noise all night, second night the airco did not work, they had to fix it the next day and the third day we had no towels or toilet papers, I told the reception that we were not really happy with all that was happening but the reception did not say anything about it so that was a bit sad. Not really happy with the over all experience, but other than that the hotel was nice. ",4,2022,06,26
59,Best vacation ever!,"Let me start by saying that the hotel is ideally situated in the heart of the city. It is walking distance to public transportation, shops, restaurants, bars and a few Barcelona landmarks. We always felt completely safe in the neighborhood and never had any issues with troublesome folk or whatever else that comes with traveling as a tourist. 

The interior of the hotel is beautifully decorated with one-of-a-kind Catalonian illustrations throughout the 7 floors of the building. It has a Instagram-worthy spiral staircase that brings in the special Spanish sun. The terrace pool was idyllic and has a desert motif. Pool is small but always did the trick of cooling us off during the sweltering heat of summer. I enjoyed their fitness room which consisted of three cardo machines and a few dumbbells ranging from 5-25 pounds. 

Front desk staff was super friendly and supportive with our requests. We would get in around 6 am from the clubs and bars and staff was always there to point us to the right direction or getting us extra items if needed. Cleaning staff always kept the room tidy and clean. I appreciated the fact that they would check in with us on days we didn't need the room cleaned. 

What more can I say? This place was great and I am looking forward to the moment I can stay here again. As I write this, I'm already missing the magic of Barcelona. ",5,2022,06,21
59,Good but breakfast wasn't included,"I was joining a tour group that was staying at the hotel and needed to checked in several days earlier. They were very accommodating and allowed me to stay in the same room when the booking changed. Only ding is that never once was the fact that breakfast wasn't included relayed to me. Also, there are no posted costs of the breakfast. 16 euros and it was not worth it.",4,2022,06,20
59,Very enjoyable stay at Hotel Astoria,"The Hotel Astoria was prebooked for us by the group we were traveling with.  It was a great choice as we found it both comfortable and convenient.  The location put us within walking distance of everything we needed - restaurants, supermarkets, bakeries, and pharmacies.  It was also a short walk to the main avenue nearby - Diagonal.  If we needed taxi service for longer distances, they were also quick to come by, and an easy return.  That said, Barcelona is extremely pedestrian friendly which made walking around easy to do.

Our room was comfortable and very clean.  We had a double bed, desk and couch along with ample closet space and cabinets for our things.  The room safe was handy for smaller items, and larger items could be left with the front desk for safekeeping.  The bathroom had nice toiletries and luxurious bath towels.  The slippers provided were also a welcome touch.  We didn't use anything out of the mini-bar fridge, but we did take advantage of the fridge to chill our water bottles.  

The staff here is very friendly and helpful.  We always felt as though we were being welcomed home whenever we returned at the end of the day.  Housekeeping was always very attentive and would ask if there was anything we needed that day.  Dining staff were also helpful with any breakfast requests we had at the buffet.  Same with the bar attendants when we stopped by for an afternoon coffee, or evening drink.   You always had a good feeling when interacting with any of the staff.

 Hotel Astoria was a great place to call home for the days we spent in Barcelona.",5,2022,06,08
59,A Nice Place to Stay in Barcelona,"Nothing wrong with this place!  Very comfortable, well appointed room.  Well located near the corner of La Rambla and Diagonal; for those of us who need it, it is near a Starbucks; otherwise there are several paticerrias nearby.  Some nice restaurants and bars in the area.   ",5,2022,05,09
59,Astoria high class,"We are very excited about the Astoria hotel:
Clean room, delicious breakfast, wonderful rooftop and staff that did a lot extra for us.
Surprised by the beautiful art collection.
And the place of the hotel in Barcelona is super.
Metro, musea, shops and delicious restaurants all over.
Thumb up!",5,2022,05,06
59,Its average,"When we searched for hotels, this one was pretty reasonably priced so we decided to book a room here. Check-in was extremely smooth and staff were somewhat friendly. We were there like 30 mins early but they still helped us check in anyways. Room was clean and comfortable. They also have late check-out depending on capacity so do ask if you need it.

There is no kettle and coffee or tea or even complimentary water as other reviews have noted. This was something I already read about so I was not surprised but just noting it here for others. 

The reasons i gave 3 stars and not 5 (ideally i'd give it 3.5 stars but thats not an option) was because the sound proofing was quite bad. You could hear the plumbing, people talking or walking or any sort of movement. I am not sure but we may have been beside the supply room or something cause we could also hear housekeeping constantly moving things and going in and out. The other issue was our shower was not working properly so it wasnt a pleasant experience taking a shower unless you used the tub.

All in all though, considering the price, we were okay with the other inconveniences and importantly it was clean and comfortable.  ",3,2022,05,06
59,Excellent hotel and location,"We visited Hotel Astoria for 3 nights in April. The hotel is in an excellent location, with beautiful tree lined streets full of bistros, bars, shops and cafes. We felt very safe walking around and it is also close to the metro for getting around the city. The hotel is spotlessly clean, staff very friendly and attentive. We enjoyed the roof terrace for the views. Would not hesitate to return!",5,2022,04,19
59,Excellent hotel perfect location,Perfect hotel for a city break rooms were pristine and staff so helpful. Would definitely recommend this place if you are visiting Barcelona for a couple of days as its close to nearby attractions and very well connected to the metro etc,5,2022,04,17
59,Very good and Classic hotel.,I enjoyed the Ricardo Opisso Museum and the art work on every floor. Great!  The roof terrace was lovely. Architecture very nice and esthetic. I was nice to be in the hotel. its a pity we couldn't buy a book on he works. ,5,2022,04,07
59,Excellent hotel in a great location,"We stayed for a long weekend at the Hotel Astoria in March 2022. We had a standard room which was tidy, clean and well equipped. The reception staff were helpful and friendly and the room was cleaned daily for us. 
Location is great, we walked everywhere but the metro station is just 2 minutes away. Some excellent restaurants really nearby as well. 
We didn't get to try out the pool as sadly the weather wasn't on our side but it looked lovely and views from the roof top were great. 
Only small area for improvement would be that while we had one bottle of water when we arrived this wasn't replaced and the water from the mini bar was rather expensive. But the little supermarket a couple of doors down was open late for stocking up instead. ",5,2022,03,24
59,Wonderful Hotel,"Hotel Astoria exceeded my expectations.  This was a beautiful, clean, spacious hotel that was near the metro and a great hub for my stay in Barcelona and all the activities I had planned.  The staff were friendly and I enjoyed my stay.",5,2022,03,23
59,Fantastic stay,"Staff were all fantastic and thankfully spoke very good english, enough to make up for my lack of spanish despite my efforts! 
The location was great, rooms were very comfortable and the bed was absolutley HUGE! The actual hotel was also beautiful, there was art and marble and a wonderful spiral staircase! 

One of my favourite parts of the trip was getting up to walk to one of the many bakerys nearby and coming back to eat our breakfast on the terrace in the sunshine. ",5,2022,01,14
59,More four star than three!,"Just returned from Barcelona after spending four nights at Hotel Astoria.  Such a joy to stay in this elegant hotel with an amazing collection of Richard Opisso’s drawings and paintings lining the walls.  Our room was on the seventh floor at the rear of the hotel and was very quiet, spotlessly clean with plenty of storage space, a mini bar and fresh fluffy white bath sheets daily. All staff were helpful and friendly.

We would definitely return again and recommend it.",5,2021,11,30
59,Hotel Astoria is wonderful.,"I found the Hotel Astoria to be the perfect oasis in Barcelona. The hotel is classy, clean, well maintained and the beds are very comfortable. The staff is devoted to their hotel and it shows in the the front desk, the dining room and the housekeepers. The front desk is very helpful with local restaurant suggestions and every way I needed. There is a small gym and the internet is stable and fast. I wound up staying there for two months as it is truly the best value in the best part of Eixample. It’s very central and it has a great plaza right next to it with a selection of good restaurants and bars. The rooftop has a wonderful view and a pool and comfortable sun loungers. This hotel is one of the best kept secrets in Barcelona!!",5,2021,11,15
59,Pleasant stay,"Really lovely architecture and super clean hotel.  Staff nice accept for very rude check in girl on computer who did nor look up and ignored us when we arrived.  Clearly not a people person. 
All the other staff were great. 
Would come back.
Good value.
Nice location.",4,2021,10,22
59,nice and comfortable,"Nice hotel in the good localization. Clean place with very friendly and helpful crew. Around there are some nice restaurants (go two-three blocks on South) and shops, and also metro and bus stops. The small swimming pool on the roof was perfect in the hot days.",5,2021,09,08
59,"Great location, great staff!","Wonderful staff, especially Domingo who really looked after me. I was upgraded to a superior room and the hotel is really clean. The beds are nice and the interior is lovely! 
The breakfast was really good and I would rather say it is a 4 star hotel.
The location is also very nice close to Metro Station Diagonal and close to a big super market.",4,2021,09,01
59,Great stay! Would absolutely stay again.,"Stayed solo here for a few nights and would gladly stay again. The location is great. The room decor is a little 90s-does-deco but otherwise totally comfortable. Everyone at the front desk was incredibly helpful and informative when it came to local Covid restrictions, nearby restaurants, directions etc.",5,2021,08,22
59,Fantastic Stay,This hotel is beautiful The decor is stunning. The room facilities punch above their weight.  It felt more like a 4 or 5 star hotel. The staff were very helpful. I would certainly visit again and would make a point of choosing a Hotel Astoria  in other cities.,5,2021,08,09
59,Really great place,"Everything was excellent - the building itself, the room, highly supportive staff and tasty big breakfasts. The location is OK for people using public transport. We were offered another room once there was a minor fault and we arrived at the weekend while repairing it was impossible.
The first breakfast was free of charge and later on we could decide to buy ones on following days.",5,2020,07,17
59,Charming,This is my go to hotel for Barcelona. The staff is exceptional. Maria in the bar is sweet and efficient. The rooms are well appointed and nicely furnished. Very clean property and excellent location in exiaple.,5,2020,03,05

59,Excelent stay,"The service was excellent and the room was perfect. The comum areas have an excellent atmosphere, and we greatly appreciated the friendship of the staff, with special attention to the bartender Maria. Great hotel in a great area with a good price",5,2020,01,19
59,The Astoria Hotel: fine quality hotel in Barcelona,"I have been in hotels all over the world and think I can provide a fair judgement. The Astoria Hotel in Barcelona is a lovely hotel and can compete with 4 to 5 star hotels. Rooms are excellent, so are the beds. Room service and overall service is very customer friendly. Lots of 1930s artwork everywhere. I would certainly recommend this hotel!",5,2020,01,10
59,Holliday,"A  very good hotel in a very good part of Barcelona. Always with very strong service and support. high approach in support, to do, for actions.The top balkong with pool a nice area for relax and sunshine relax.",5,2020,01,08
59,Old school design and glamour.,Wonderful little hotel at walking distance to downtown Barcelona. It feels like a time machine to a glamorous era from the past. The interiors are beautiful and full of poster art on the walls. Great value for money. ,5,2020,01,06
59,great,"excellent service， check in can earlier than 2.00pm，which convinent our trip. all colleges are very polite and kind. breakfast taste good and the room can boil hot water. location is great, everthing is perfect!",5,2020,01,02
59,Hotel Astoria,"A splendid visit to Barcelona and stay at the Hotel Astoria, the staff were excellent in particular Domingo, also would like to thank them for the bottle of champagne they sent to our room for my birthday. We will be returning to the Astoria no doubt.

The hotel is in a great district, the Diagonal, is just behind, the Rambla de Catalunya, as well as the Paseig de Gracia all within 4mins walking.....perfect!",4,2020,01,01
59,Nice one,"Very good location, a few meters to avenue Diagonal. Room was clean and very nice. I really enjoyed the service. The staff was amazing, very friendly and helpful. The hotel has also a pool and a lounge I enjoyed a lot",5,2019,12,23

59,A Gem Of A Hotel,Stayed at the hotel Astoria at the end of November 2019. Service was top-notch. Room was very well appointed and spotless. Breakfast was fantastic.Location was ideal especially for walkers. Neighbourhood was vibrant and we felt safe. Great value for the money. This hotel would be our first choice next time in Barcelona.,5,2019,12,15
59,Very nice,"Very good service. Very clean. 
Breakfast is good but could have been better. The aesthetic of the lobby and breakfast room was nice. 
The location is  some kind of minus here. So the price should have been less,   if you ask my personal opinion 
But bottom line this is a nice hotel and yes I would recommend it easily 
",4,2019,12,04
59,I recommend this very nice hotel,Very good location close to Diagonal but relatively quiet. Very nice and helpful staff. Beautiful lobby and staircase. Very good breakfast. Clean room. Would give it 5 stars if not for a disturbing smoky smell in my room that wouldn’t go away.,4,2019,11,16
59,Loved this hotel,"What a gem to stay in this hotel! Great location. Staff was helpful and welcoming. Rooms were spotless, quiet, and the bed was very comfortable. The breakfast was fantastic, so many choices, selection, presentation and taste to die for! Loved it here!",5,2019,11,02
59,Great rest.,"Lovely old hotel, comfortable bed, immaculate space. Interesting art in the lobby and it’s really central. Staff warm and welcoming, always ready to help and advise on places and directions. We really enjoyed our nights in this location.",5,2019,10,31
59,Lovely Location & Stay,"This hotel  checked all the boxes for us - great customer service, clean, nice amenities, and the most important (other than clean): location.  We loved walking around L'Eixample area.  We took a few cabs only because we were running late sometimes, but you could really walk everywhere if you are okay with walking to places that are around 10-45 mins away.  I know that 45 mins might sound extreme, but it's such a beautiful city with ideal weather, that we did that most of the time and just found wonderful places while doing so.  I would definitely stay here again, especially with the very reasonable priced room for a very good hotel.  Thanks for the bottle of sparking for our honeymoon!!!",5,2019,10,29
59,Hotel Astoria ,This is a gorgeous Art Deco hotel. The rooms are lovely and clean and the bed is very comfortable. The staff are so welcoming and attentive. It’s perfectly located just off the Diagonal near all my favourite places. I will definitely be coming back. ,5,2019,10,23
59,An Absolute Gem in Barcelona,"We stayed here at the beginning of October for 5 nights. Upon entering the hotel, you are greeted to an impressive marbled lobby which is truly stunning. The reception desk staff were very welcoming and provided us with plenty of information, and one member of staff helped us up to our room and showed us where everything was. 

The room was a decent size and very clean. I was also thrilled to see that they provided mini The White Company products in the bathroom - this was a lovely surprise! 
Every afternoon, the maid would knock on your door and provide you with little chocolates which was a nice touch. 

The rooftop terrace was an added bonus and provided a fantastic rooftop view of the city. There is also a plunge pool for those hot sunny days. You can also order food and drink up to the roof terrace. There was a particularly delicious sounding club sandwich on the menu which unfortunately I never got round to trying. 

The breakfast (which we had included) is definitely worth the money. I’ve had similar quality breakfasts in 4* hotels and it was fantastic. You can choose from pastries, cakes, bread, cheeses and hams, and there’s also hot food on offer. Everything is restocked regularly and there is never a shortage of food. 

It is also worth taking note that you gain free entry to the Egyptian museum a few blocks away if you stay at this hotel. The museum was absolutely fantastic, and had an impressive collection of artefacts spread over 3 floors. It also wasn’t busy at all when we visited, so you can really get up close to the exhibits and take your time. 

Finally, the hotel is situated in a fantastic location; far enough away from the touristy areas of La Ramblas etc, but also situated just off Diagonal which has many large homeware and clothing stores. The area has a great vibe to it, and has amazing eateries a couple of minutes walk away (I can highly recommend Parking Pizza!). 

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Hotel Astoria. In my opinion it is worthy of a 4* rating. I only wish we had stayed just a few days longer! If I ever come back to Barcelona I will without a doubt stay again at this hotel.",5,2019,10,20
59,Beautiful Hotel,"Beautiful 3star hotel. Spotlessly clean, comfy beds, Fantastic breakfast, staff professional, friendly and gave excellent recommendations for dinner. The hotel is perfect for walking to all the major attractions. We would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,10,15
59,A Gem Stone,"We had a full day and a night before boarding our cruise.  I love these hotels with simple signage above the lobby door, otherwise you wouldn't even know its a hotel.  The room was small in comparison to what we're used to in Canada, but very clean and a comfy bed.  Location was perfect for us with shopping, restaurants, and bistros very handy.  There was an outdoor pool on the roof within a nice setting but the water was not heated, so we did not partake.  We had breakfast in the morning, very European with breads, buns, cheese, meats, preserves, etc. Everything was exceptionally tasty.  I was fooled by my 1st bun as it seemed rock hard!!!!!  The crust was wafer thin and the inside was still warm, and probably the best bun I've had in my life.  The butter that was served was like nothing I've ever had before, so much ""buttery flavor""  This was probably one of the best breakfast I've had with this much variety.  The coffee was to die for!!!  I would love to return and spend more time in Barcelona.  Without having to travel long distances, there is lots right close to this Hotel with a variety of options.  

The staff were awesome and helpful with touristy suggestions, maps and places to see.  This is a must do again locale.",5,2019,10,15
59,3 Night Stay,"Hotel in a good location, beside metro/bus stops.  Room [ 516] was fine, but noise during the night due to a generator which switched off at 9am kept me awake. When I pointed this out in the morning we were moved, but no offer of compensation or say offer of breakfast to compensate.
On the flip side left a coat after me on check out.  When I rang on wayto airport they agreed to post it t my home address once I paid for the posatge",3,2019,10,14
59,Eixample District,"This hotel was a real unexpected gem. Initially I booked it because we needed an overnight stay before flying home the next day - I only wished I had had time to stay in this hotel for a longer period of time! We were greeted by exceptionally friendly and inviting reception! Our room was of generous proportions and even included a sofa which was an unexpected level of relaxation after our extensive travelling around Spain and various accommodations. Generous size bathroom, and everything was immaculately clean. Generous Breakfast buffet (not included in room price)  in an inviting and very interesting diningroom which included an extensive collection of Art Deco framed art/posters, the added touch of flowers and a dainty tier of jams, etc on the table. The foyer lounge area includes an extensive collection of artwork and literature of Ricard Pisso of whom I knew nothing, and I appreciated this unexpected opportunity. Hotel is located in a very tasteful area of the city; about a 2-3 minute walk to Avenguda Diagonal; extremely close to La Pedrera, the Modernista mansions and  a good walk to the Sagrada Familia cathedral - take time to enjoy the park which is adjacent to the Sagrada - you can enjoy flocks of parakeets and other birds. This is also a fashionable shopping district and I wished I'd had more time to browse and shop. I have every intention of revisiting this hotel again - for its service, its ambience and location.!!!",5,2019,10,09
59,Great little hotel,I recently stayed at the Hotel Astoria for business trip and was pleasantly surprised what a great hotel tit was.  Centrally located and only a few blocks from Diagonal station it was easy to get to and from meetings.  The room was functional and comfortable.  Having breakfast included was an added treat.  Service was excellent.  The front desk staff even went out of the way to make a coffee for me to take-away for my early morning (5:00 a.m. departure).  Would highly recommend.,5,2019,10,06
59,Returning to a Favourite City,"Loved the concept of this hotel with original artworks featured throughout - what a great way to increase one's knowledge of artists that may not be as well known. And we enjoyed the free admission to the Egyptian Museum of Barcelona, as well.  Appreciated that breakfast included a buffet with good variety as well as the option of ordering 'a la carte' items as well. 
The concern was in our inability to have the room completely dark, as the drapes were airy, and the shade did not go down completely.  We asked several times to have this rectified and somehow we never got an explanation as to why a solution was not found.  ",3,2019,10,01
59,Barcelona stay,"Great location, especially for the Hop On Hop Off Bus just a short walk away. Mini markets, cafes and restuarants abound in the area too. Spacious room and very good breakfast offering. I had an internal room so it was reasonably quiet too!",5,2019,09,29
59,Wonderful location in the non-touristy part of Barcelona!,"My sister and I loved staying at the Astoria during our 8 day stay in Barcelona.  It is at most a 40 minute walk to all the main sites and we really enjoyed the ambiance of this part of the city.
The Astoria gives you very good value for money; the staff are exceptional in their customer service/assistance with tourist questions and the rooms are big/comfortable by European standards.",5,2019,09,29
59,Back to Barcelona,"Very good and autentic hotel in an exelent situation in town, me and my family stayed at the this hotel last time in Barcelona (2 years ago) and were happy to come back here again, very helpful staf, beautiful lobby interior with a lots of autentic art, can absolutely recomend this hotel. ",5,2019,09,27
59,"Historic charm, bustling location, fine rooms","Wood, marble, brass and crystal chandeliers in the lobby welcome guests - and remind them of the long history of this great city and of this beautiful hotel. Think of the thousands of people over a hundred years that have stayed here! The rooms are quiet, updated and clean. Service is fine - warm but somewhat perfunctory. Everything a tourist will want to see is within walking distance - provided they are physically fit and the weather is nice. Overall this hotel is a great value and we recommend it. ",4,2019,09,25
59,"When you'e looking for that 3* hotel with a little more than 3* treatment, this might be it!","From the minute you walk in the door you feel welcome. The graceful staff greets you immediately and with a smile all attention to details. From the hotel host/manager to the bell staff the feeling you get is it's about your satisfaction.  The marble columns and stairway with a baby grand piano in the hotel lobby create a graceful ambiance and the artwork in the studios is exceptional. we stayed three nights after flying into BCN and never needed or wanted anything that wasn't handled with great dignity and care and concern. The place is SPOTLESS, literally as clean as a new hotel, however this location has been here for awhile. The breakfasts were very good, as was the  food and presentation.  I would recommend this to all of my friends and their spouses for a reasonable fare. Check out their web site for some cool ""options"" ",4,2019,09,17
59,Beautiful old hotel,"Stayed for two nights. Beautiful old hotel with an incredible stair case. The place is full of old posters, prints and photographs, not to mention the two prints just outside the bar, which are discreetly hidden to hid their content. Very saucy, the artist obviously had a very vivid imagination. Staff there are lovely and friendly. And they serve up a delicious and varied breakfast. Couldn’t fault it",5,2019,09,13
59,Barcelona break,"First of all thanks to ,indulge football breaks,for the advice of where to stay in Barcelona,What a truly amazing city so much to do so much to see.The city just oozes class.stayed at he Astoria hotel only a 3star that's selling it a bit short first class staff were there when needed.Yes the roof pool is small but just for a couple of relaxing hours no problem.went with a group of 10 all enjoyed.Would I go back like a flash I advise anyone who's never been do it.If possible stay near the gothic centre that way your near to the beach so you can enjoy city and beach without taxis.And about restaurants there's so many good ones you'd be really unfortunate to pick a bad one .",5,2019,09,12
59,Good location for 5 night stay,The booking was made by Intrepid Tours and was an excellent choice. Astoria is a comfortable hotel with old world charm. Our room on the 6th floor was larger than we expected and had all the facilities we needed. Staff were excellent. The hotel is conveniently situated just off Av. Diagonal.,5,2019,09,05
59,The hotel is great.,Hotel Astoria in Barcelona is located in the great and safe neighborhood and its buildings is beautiful.  The service is wonderful and staff is very helpful.  The room is clean and comfortable. We enjoyed staying this hotel.,5,2019,09,04
59,Above average stay at the price,"Apart from few small things like; only 2 iron available in the entire hotel, periodic noise of water flowing in the bathroom pipelines, toiletries provided were limited 
(no toothpaste, brush), all other things were great. Very comfortable stay overall.",4,2019,09,02
59,Put an ease,"I read reviews for hours on here looking for a hotel. This was the first hotel i saw then read for a few negative reviews so i started to look for days at other hotels and finally thought some people complain over nothing.so i decided to give this hotel a try.
I booked.. emailed the hotel 5 mins later to ask for twin beds and ill be checking in late..got an immediate response and an ok.
The lobby is great..check in easy. The room was fine..nothing at all to stress over..
Clean.. airconditioned which i can control. Nice duvets..sheets..nice bathroom.  What else do you want for the price??? Its great.now best of all... the location..
Step out the hotel walk 10 seconds around the corner and you have a few nice trendy restaurants. Cafes and bars.. in a beautiful little piazza..walk 1 minute then you hit a main road..turn right and walk to casa milla and las rambles..10 mins!!! 
This is right outside the hotel!! Breakfast here..afternoon tapas..or a late drink before bed!! Safe neighborhood..quiet..and clean.",5,2019,09,01
59,A gem of a hotel in a great location,"I stayed in Hotel Astoria for two nights, beautiful spacious room for Spain, close to the train station, a number of wonderful restaurants and easy and safe for walking.

59,Great stay!,We really enjoyed our stay at Astoria! Amazing location and super friendly staff. The breakfast was wonderful as well. I wish we would have had an iron and ironing board but that is just me being picky. The room was larger than most European rooms and the bathroom was nice too. I would highly recommend! ,5,2019,08,22
59,Beautiful hotel,"This hotel is well situated. It's comfortable - Inc the spare bed, which is often v lumpy in hotels. 

It's not far from excellent transport links and many restaurants. 

The pool is a welcome break from summer heat. It is quite small so you can't really swim far in it, but it has great rooftop views and is perfectly presented and enough loungers / deck chairs to sit out enjoying the sun. Bar and food service by the pool too in case of need.

Staff are helpful and friendly. 
Didn't try the food as it was too pricey. But Audrey's cafe is nearby which is good for breakfast /Brunch /lunch (it's only 2 blocks down and 1 across). Plus plenty of local restaurants nearby. But do check on Google and trip adviser and their websites in case they are shut on particular nights (usually Sundays and Mondays) or don't open til 7.30/8pm. Some stay open more. But best to check before setting out.

Really enjoyed our stay in this luxurious hotel. Comfy, clean, great staff. Apart from price of hotel food I cannot fault it at all. Thank you for helping us have a fantastic holiday. ",4,2019,08,21
59,Good location,"Took Aerobus from airport to Plaza de Catalunya (€10.25 return) from here take the metro green L3 to Diagonal,towards trinitat nova (buy a T10 ticket for €10.20 - gives 10 journeys)Hotel is then less than a 10min walk. Great area with lots of bars, restaurants & little convenience shops nearby. Check in quick & polite. Standard room small but functional, cases fit under the bed. Small safe fits ipad. Small fridge holds 500ml bottles. Several plug sockets. Shower great. Bathroom desperately needs extractor fan. If i stayed again i would upgrade, as interior rooms have so little natural light - window looks out onto a wall🙁 you have to use room lights at all times of the day. Windows have shutter blinds so good if you like total darkness to sleep. Beds and pillows were ok, air con easy to use. Rooftop pool(closes at 9pm) is quite small but great to cool off after a day site seeing. Can see the roof of sagrada familiar in the distance. 
Reception is always manned and staff helpful. Left luggage there after checkout no problems. Was a bit disappointed that we were not thanked for staying and wished a safe journey - it felt quite a 'cold' checkout. 
You can walk to sagrada familiar in about 25mins. Las Ramblas 20mins & the port 30mins. Casa Mila & Casa Battlo are a couple of mins walk from Diagonal. Bus 29 from here takes you up to Park Guell. I would stay again.",4,2019,08,16
59,Good stay and location,We found the Astoria hotel staff very helpful for our short stay in Barcelona! This hotel is in a good location close to bus routes and quiet for a rest after busy days sightseeing: The room was clean and comfortable and the pool was refreshing on some hot evenings. We would stay. Here again on another visit.,5,2019,08,15
59,Enjoyable Stay and Vacation,"I arrived at the Hotel Astoria on July 22, 2019 early in the in the afternoon for four nights and five days. Staff was welcoming and my room was ready. I was given a really nice and quiet room on the first floor (room 122) which was a good size and very comfortable with a large bed.

The room was nicely designed. It had a good sofa and a flat screen TV. The room had ample storage for hanging or putting clothes away with a large cabinet. The decor was classic and well thought out. The bathroom was elegant.

Room service was excellent and the room was made up before 3 pm. It was very comfortable and clean and it was a pleasure to return to it at the end of the day to relax and to have good night’s sleep. 

The buffet breakfast included with the room had fruit, pastries, cereal, eggs and two kinds of juices. It was a complete and delicious breakfast that was served on the main floor in a stylish dining area. 

The hotel was nicely situated with a short walk to major streets such as Diagonal and de Gracia.  From those streets, you had access to major points of interest in this beautiful and photogenic city. 

The hotel also had a roof top pool which was really perfect at the end of the day to relax and cool off.

Finally, the entire hotel staff was professional, really helpful with advice on visiting Barcelona and kind and friendly. It made all the difference in my stay at Hotel Astoria.

The hotel  entrance was stylish with a baby grand piano and marble columns.  

The stay went by quickly and the city of Barcelona beautiful as I took 700 pictures.  Again, the staff was great.",5,2019,08,14
59,Barcelona trip,"We enjoyed or stay at hotel Astoria very much. The hotel has a stylish interior, rooms were comfortable and clean. The breakfast was varied and good. Very friendly and helpful staff. the hotel is situated very near interesting sights and shopping areas. Lots of restaurants and terraces near it. Definitely a great place to stay during your visit in Barcelona.",5,2019,08,11
59,"Fantastic hotel, absolutely perfect","Cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. Just returned from a 4 day break. Excellent location easy to get metro or bus to all the places of interest.  Hotel is impeccably clean and comfortable. Spacious rooms, very comfortable beds, lovely en suite. Great choice for breakfast , buffet style and option of hot food cooked to your order. Sun terrace and pool was fabulous after a hot day sightseeing, couldn’t get my daughter out of it !  But the highest recommendation must go to the fantastic staff, so friendly (reception has someone there 24 hours). They could not have been more helpful -maps and brilliant advise re bus metro routes and stops, nothing was too much trouble. The manager chatted to us at breakfast and was asking if we were happy with everything.  Would not consider going to another hotel if I return to Barcelona- BRILLIANT.",5,2019,08,02
59,Excellent,"The service is very satisfactory, I hope to be able to adjust the air conditioning of the room to control. During the stay, I want to enable the air conditioner many times, but it has not been successful.",5,2019,07,30
59,Beautiful!!!,"I have just returned from a short break at this hotel. 
All I can say is.... WOW!! Such a beautiful hotel from the moment you walk in. All staff were very friendly and approachable and couldn’t do enough to help you. Room was very clean and towels etc were replenished daily which I loved. 
In such a great location with lots to do around. The roof top pool was beautiful with a great view! 
Thank you so much for a great visit. We will definitely be back!!!!!!",5,2019,07,29
59,Excellent hotel!,Lovely hotel and convenient location. Roof pool an added bonus! Close to public transport if needed. Able to walk to La Rambla in about 15 min. Near to restaurants and bars with very good choice of food. Overall highly recommended - would stay here again.,5,2019,07,26
59,Adorable boutique hotel,"My daughter and I stayed at Hotel Astoria for a mother-daughter trip to Barcelona and loved it! It is an adorable, small, clean, lovely hotel centrally located just outside of the crowded touristy area but within walking distance to everything and the Metro station too! There is a beautiful little plaza right next door with great restaurants, a pharmacy and coffee shops. Be sure to check out Brunch and Cake! LOVE!",5,2019,07,25
59,Amazing Hotel Amazing City,"Had the most amazing stay at the Astoria.  We arrived late due to a delayed flight but the staff were so welcoming, in particular Domingo who was amazing.  He assisted us with things to do and had excellent recommendations for places to eat and party.  All the team were fantastic, if you're visiting barcelona make sure you stay here, location is great and the hoteliers are even better.",5,2019,07,24
59,Good hotel in good location,"Very close to all the major sights, transport  , and shops. The rooms were small but well ventilated and clean throughout
 I would recommend this hotel for their pleasant staff in a pleasant surrounding. Extremely good value. ",4,2019,07,17
59,Astoria July 2019,Small room but good enough for a one night stay. Good central location and it has a roof terrace and small pool. Friendly staff and overall nice hotel. It's a derby hotel and they have a good chain of hotels in Barcelona.,4,2019,07,15
59,"wonderful hotel, great amenities and staff","we spent five nights and found our room spacious and comfortable.  the staff were wonderful, very helpful and always attentive.  great location, near buses and subway and lots of restaurants.  Would stay there again.",5,2019,07,12
59,Great stay!!,"It was wonderful to stay in the true native area of Barcelona to experience the real Barcelona culture, food, and the style was a great experience.  Staff was very friendly and very accommodating.  Highly recommend.",5,2019,07,11
59,Lovely Hotel,"Hotel location was perfect. 
Only took a minutes to reach Diagonal Station. 
There are many Restorant and convenience market near the hotel.
If you strong enough you can go to Sagrada Familia by walking. Its about 2.5 Km.
I have done it and its worthed. I can see the beauty of Barcelona city during my walk. 
For safety, better provide yourself with the internet connection for road guideline. Its very comfortbale to walking around Barcelona. And during my stay, i never met bad people.

Do you love liquoer? Its easy to find with cheap price. I bought 1 bottle oa sampanye and it only 1 Euro. Taste good. You can find itu at conveniece market (supermercat) near Astoria.

Palea? Its one of food you have to eat.
Iberico Ham and their seafood.
It taste heaven.

Souvenir?
if you need to buy, you can find it around Sagrada. Various souvenir including magnet, keyholder, Barca thing ... and Gaudi Lizard. If you are lucky, you can but 6 for 5 Euro.

Dont forget Barca merchandise. You can get cheaper price there than at Camp Nou. Of course the quality is different but its still worthed.

TURRON is one of souvenir to bring. I find it near Sagrada but i dont have time to buy it. Closed at 9 pm. Too bad.

Burger? there are plenty of burger there but FIVE GUYS is my choice. Taste and Price. 

",5,2019,07,05
59,A getaway to remember,"What a great place for romantic getaway.   A quite bit pricey but I did Enjoy the location and overall glamore. 

I have been to Barcelona often, this part of town was not overly friendly as if tourists were a problem or didn't belong in the area. The hotel staff was the same way for us. 
I really got the impression that they just didn't like Americans,   but who does now days?",3,2019,07,02
59,Hidden Gem,"This hotel is really a hidden gem. Reasonably priced for a weekend away. I went for a long weekend with my mother to celebrate her birthday. The building is in keeping with the Barcelona architecture and the inside is the same. Very friendly staff and checking in and out was very easy. The rooms are spotless with big fluffy towels and slippers for your comfort, mini bar is fully stocked everyday. Items like cola is quite expensive from the mini bar but the alcohol for a 50ml miniature is 5 euros. Which I find good. The room was cleaned daily by a lovely housekeeper, I only saw her in passing. We would pop out for an hour and come back to a clean room. The rooftop pool is bliss. They provide towels for the pool so you do not need to pack your own if you plan on using. There is only 6 sunbeds, 3 on each side with 4 beach chairs and 2 dining chairs. They could do with more sunbeds but if it wasn't for the 36⁰ weather that we had while there we may have not used the pool and the 6 sunbeds they had would normally be enough. I have trouble walking and use a stick for walking long distances and up and down stairs. Did not need to use my aid in this hotel as it is all serviced by lifts (apart from the communal toilets - which we only used on check out while waiting for transfer) the hotel is very central to 'Diagonal' metro station (5 min walk) and all the buses. There is a mini supermarket and tabaconist on the same road as the hotel so you never have to go to far. Overall a really good stay and perfect for a Barcelona city break!",5,2019,07,02
59,Rooftop pool & bar!,"Stayed here with my husband for 3 nights in June! My husband booked it as a surprise for my birthday & I was surprised he managed to choose a lovely hotel. The reception is so impressive when you walk in, as is the rest of the hotel. The room was perfect sized, super comfy bed, the air con worked perfectly. We also loved the roof top dip pool and sunbathing area. The bar on the roof was excellent also! The location was perfect for us...we were happy to walk the 8 mins to the metro station when necessary but we loved wandering this gorgeous neighbourhood too! 100% would recommend!",5,2019,07,01
59,Hotel in good neighborhood,The hotel is located in a nice area. Thre is a walk of 3 long blocks to the Metro. Good restaurants are nearby. The hotel breakfast is a bit pricey but there are bars and cafes very near where you can get a good breakfast for less. You can walk to some of the finest Gaudi houses as well as to other modernist buildings. ,4,2019,06,26
59,Great hotel,"Good location, staff are friendly and very helpful and extremely nice rooms. Metro is about a 5 minute walk from the hotel booked hop on hop off bus from hotel reception and reception taught me to use metro ticketing machines. ",5,2019,06,23
59,Would Stay Again,"In our recent trip to Barcelona, we stayed at the Hotel Astoria.  They are advertised as a three star resort, but we felt they were better than that, especially for a European hotel.
 
The hotel is centrally located and close to city and tour buses, the metro, as well as shops and eateries.  Our room was  a decent size and modernly furnished.  We had a roomy closet, adequate drawer space, and a mini bar with snacks and beverages (for a cost).  Though we asked for a king size bed, we got two twin beds pushed together, but it was not uncomfortable.   The bathroom was a little tight because it also contained a bidet.  We opted for the breakfast plan, which was a buffet consisting of juices, coffee, meats and cheeses, rolls both sweet and savory, yogurts and more.  There was also an a la carte menu where you could order some hot breakfast selections at no additional cost.  The staff was helpful in arranging some of our tours and gave us restaurant suggestions and travel directions, so thank you to Louis and Alexandro.  They also have a rooftop pool which, unfortunately, we were not able to use because of time restraints and weather.
 
Our complaints are minor.  We wished the TV had some channels in English, instead of just the BBC news channel.  In the bathroom, our shower door did not prevent the water from spraying on to the floor, so we had to keep laying towels down to mop up the wetness.   They did however, send more towels when we needed them.  Also, we were glad there was a safe in the room but it took us awhile to figure out how it worked because if a mistake is made, it requires unlocking by the staff using a master code.   
 
All things considered, we would recommend this hotel for your Barcelona stay.",4,2019,06,20
59,Great stay,"We had a great stay at Hotel Astoria. The staff were lovely and helpful, excellent location, comfy beds and good sized bathroom with all the amenities. I would highly recommend a stay here for those wanting a nice getaway where you can see and do everything but not in the center of the touristy area",5,2019,06,20
59,Excellent Hotel,"Not sure why this is a 3 star hotel.   It was clean, friendly, breakfast was amazing.  The only complaint I had was thay we were by the cleaning closet - the outer door helped that!  I will definitely stay here again!",5,2019,06,13
59,Nice hotel ..... but noisy,We stayed at the Astoria for 3 nights. We checked in early our room wasn’t ready but we left our bags and were told to come back around 14:00. The hotel is in a fairly central location around a 15-20 min walk to la Ramblas. The metro Diagonel is just around the corner with links to all parts of town a single trip costing €2. We got a taxi to and from the airport costing €25 each time but it would be just as easy to use the public transport if you didn’t have to much luggage. The staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful. The hotel was clean. The only downside we found was our room was number 322 which is opposite the lifts and right next door to the cleaners storage cupboards. We were woken every morning by a lot of banging and noise being made by the cleaners who maybe need to keep the noise down early in the mornings! Also our mini fridge in the room leaked every time we came back from a day out the fridge had leaked water on the floor. I asked to use an iron which reception provided but didn’t provide an ironing board ? So I had to iron on the floor on a towel! ,3,2019,06,11
59,Lovely hotel with wonderful service,"Very good service, room is very clean and nice, comfortable bed, good location for bus and metro, plenty of restaurants and shops around, friendly and courteous staff, often saw the manager greeting us and checking if everything was fine, The view from the rooftop was lovely .  I was very happy.",5,2019,06,10
59,review Astoria Barselona,"Nice hotel, clean. Very impressed by the rooftop pool. Located in a nice place. Nearby there are cafes, restaurants and taxis. I would like to improve the quality of breakfast - there was little variety of food. Staff pleasant
	

",5,2019,06,10
59,Most elegant centrally located hotel at a reasonable price,"We were awestruck by the timeless elegance and classic chic .The amazing  art gallery of local work from the early 1900's wanders  throughout the main floor.  This hotel is a piece of artwork itself.  The friendly and efficient staff spoiled us, but did not hover over us. The view of  spectacular and architecturally varied courtyards and balconies behind us a looked like a destination in itself. I was impressed by the cleanliness of the room, halls,floor to ceiling marble foyer, elegant staircases and everything.Amazing rooftop pool and lounge area with a breathtaking view.  The bed was luxurious with a heavenly duvet and copious pillows. The updated rooms included contemporary cabinetry with closet  doors holding drawers and choice of slippers  and on the other side of the room a credenza with a  well stocked  bar fridge .Close to taxis, restaurants and shops . Photos to follow.....",5,2019,06,07
59,Good 3 star Hotel,Good location. Clean room and efficient staff. Walls are thin and we were unlucky to have a hen party next door to us the first night so not the best sleep experience that night. We paid for a late check out and were locked out of our room which is a pet hate of mine especially when we’ve paid for an extra day!,3,2019,06,04
59,"Decent hotel in a quiet, but hip part of Barcelona.","Hotel room was very clean. Amenities were bountiful. Bar was lacking on rooftop, but the view was lovely. We didn't receive the perks of the room we purchased until we inquired about them. 

Hotel was located in a very ideal location and in walking distance of hip areas. If you're looking to be close to the tourist trap of las ramblas this isn't the place for you.",4,2019,05,31
59,Wonderful hotel in the center of Barcelona,"When my husband and I travel, we normally stay at 4 or 5 star hotels.  But after reading a number of reviews about this hotel, we decided to try it.  My expectations were exceeded.  It's a very clean, updated hotel situated in the city center.  On my first day there, I took a walk around the block and found at least 15+ eateries (restaurants, cafes, tapas bars, bakeries, patisseries). Additionally, there's a mini market just down the corner.  This location is walkable to Casa Mila, Casa Battlo, a street that is compared to the Champs Elysees in Paris called Passeig de Gracias lined with high end stores.  We bought a bus card (10 euros for 10 rides) at the tobacco shop steps away from the hotel.  Very easy to get around by bus. The hotel desk staff was very helpful as they have tickets available which we purchased for a flamenco show, Casa Mila, Casa Battlo and Park Guell (among others). They also work with an travel company if you would like to book an excursion as well.  The only little downside is I wish they had complimentary bottles of water in the room.  We did take one from the mini fridge (which was 2.5 euros), then headed to the nearby mini market to stock up on water. Also, breakfast at the hotel was 16.5 euros which I thought was very expensive especially since there are so many breakfast options nearby.  All in all, I would highly recommend this hotel.",4,2019,05,28
59,"Nice, Quiet, Friendly and Relax Place","Around the hotel, there are restaurants, coffee shops with cheap and high prices for your choices.  If you like a hotel with an art feeling, Hotel Astoria is a good choice.  The environment within the hotel is quiet, which is quite matching the feeling when you stay in this hotel.  ",5,2019,05,26
59,Quiet and comfortable with very helpful staff,"Hotel Astoria was picked out for us by our travel agent, and we were so happy with our stay.  We arrived at noon on a cold, rainy day. My husband was battling the flu and felt terrible. The helpful staff quickly got us a quiet, interior room and carried our bags up for us. The metal shutters on the window allowed us to block out all light, so he could sleep during the day.

I loved the neighborhood around the hotel: easy walking distance to La Pedrera and the Diagonal subway stop, and a 25 min walk to Sants train station and to Placa de Catalunya. 

We ended up having the breakfast buffet every day at the hotel (discounted rate of 11 euros), because it was convenient, quality and we could make healthy choices. We also ordered room service twice, since my husband was ill and we didn't want to wait until 8 pm when many of the nearby restaurants opened for dinner. Staff promptly brought our tasty food and then took away our dishes.

When you get sick on vacation, it's so wonderful to be able to rest in a quality, well-appointed hotel with attentive staff who speak excellent English (and a lot of other languages, too).",5,2019,05,20
59,Barcelona stay,"We enjoyed our stay immensely at the Hotel Astoria in May of '19.  The location was very central to many high-end shops and the hop-on, hop-off bus service was just a short walk away.  There were also many cafes and tapas bars in the immediate area to enhance the local experience.  The room was not huge, but was spotless and the bath and shower was large and also immaculate.  The desk service was terrific and staff went out of their way to ensure our connections with travel went smoothly. Would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone and if the rest of the hotel chain lives up to these standards, would definitely endorse them as well! ",5,2019,05,17
59,Average,"First off, my sincere thanks to Luis for making my stay extremely comfortable, and for helping me with checking up on things (either with a map or on the internet) that I wanted to include in my itinerary during my stay in Barcelona. Also, since I did not have a kettle for hot water in my room, Luis organised this immediately for the duration of my stay. In addition, when I had a problem with the noise from the terrace (I was in Room 826), and couldn't sleep the entire night of Saturday due to the noise, Luis and Domingo assured me that there wouldn't be any noise the next night, and if there was, to definitely call Reception, who would attend to it. Domingo was also very helpful and friendly. My interaction with Luis and Domingo is what made a difference to my stay at Astoria. 
During the day time shift, the front desk was busy, and not really interested in attending to me at all. Everybody else that I saw at Reception really didn't care to engage with me as a guest at the hotel. I'm not sure whether this has to do with my being non-white/Caucasian, or whether it was generally the attitude. I do not know whether I would visit Astoria again solely because of this reason. ",3,2019,05,08
59,"Great Location, Average everything else!","Stayed for 6 nights with my wife on vacation in April '19. Firstly, the room looks NOTHING like the picture here on Tripadvisor. I was shocked to see the tiny space which was supposed to be my ""Superior"" room. Barely any space to move around. Tried explaining this to the Hotel staff, but they didn't bother to help, or even hear me out properly. Breakfast at the hotel was too expensive for my taste - 16.50 euros per person per day. We stepped out to cafes at walking distance and spent half that amount for a better breakfast. 

All in all, a very AVERAGE stay. Not recommended.",3,2019,05,06
59,Very nice hotel in nice area,"Nice comfortable hotel, friendly service, clean rooms, perfect breakfast, good wifi for free, metro close by and good restaurants around the corner. Even supermarket, bakery for take away sandwich....         ",5,2019,05,04
59,Beyond good ,The staff is kind and gracious. Rooms well appointed. The bar staff were exceedingly friendly and efficient. Good neighborhood as well . My only wish would be a kettle in the room but this is not the norm in spain,5,2019,04,24
59,Excellent,"Hotel well located in Barcelona; staff very helpful and available, service is very good, breakfast excellent. I found the room very comfortable, not far from the famous Rambla. Too many restaurants and shops around. In one word excellent",5,2019,04,20
59,Wonderful hotel,"My wife and I travel a lot and this may be the all-around nicest hotel we have stayed in. It may not have 5 star services but the decor, the artwork, the jewel of a simple restaurant, the helpfulness and warmth of the staff, the comfortable rooms and the location in the Example district close to the center but quieter make an almost unbeatable combination.  From now on, this is where we will stay in Barcelona.
 ",5,2019,04,17
59,Excellent location,"Excellent location, the staff is very helpful. The hotel has beautiful and clean rooms. The breakfast is very good and fresh. You can easy get to Diagonal metro station and to placa Catalunya. You can also walk to Casa Batlo, or take the touristic bus. The hotel has a pool on the terrace, which is full with cold water, so if you are not there in the summer , you cannot use it. And if you are there in the summer, the pool is too small for the entire hotel.",5,2019,04,13
59,Fantastic stay,"My partner and I visited a couple of weeks back to take in an Barcelona game at the Camp Nou. From check in, the experience was fantastic. The member of staff who helped check is in took us and our luggage up to our room. The room itself was spacious, with a large separate bathroom and toilet with luxury toiletries and accessories. 

The hotel is a couple of blocks away from the nearest tube (diagonal), and for the energetic ones, a walk away from some of the famous landmarks. Would definitely to anyone looking for a high standard stay in Barcelona.",5,2019,04,12
59,Perfect place,"Just Loved our stay here. Very helpfull and friendly Staff. 
Check in and out worked perfect. 
It was our wedding aniversary and hotel arranged a Perfect surprice. 
Would really recomend this to everyone. 
In walking distance to shopping and only 30 minutes walk to Beach ",5,2019,04,11
59,Staying at Astoria,"Staying at Astoria was really good to us. The price was substantially reasonable, and there were many good restaurants near Astoria.
In addition, the size of room was big, and it was really clean.
I was really satisfied with the quality of Astoria.",5,2019,04,08
59,"Clean and well located, but poorly sound proofed so not for light sleepers!","We visited Barcelona for a weekend recently and stayed at the Hotel Astoria.  It is well located just a few minutes walk from the main streets, the open top bus tours pass nearby and there and some nice restaurants in the local area.  The staff were friendly, the hotel very clean and quite impressive as you walk into the lobby and the breakfast selection was good.

The big issue with it however is that it is an older building that has never been thoroughly modernised to be a hotel, so the doors on rooms and the windows to the streets outside are not well sound proofed.  So when people arrive later at night you hear every one in the hallways outside your room.  A number of the rooms near the top of the hotel also have loud air conditioning units or lift machinery adjacent, which would be very difficult for the average person to sleep through.

I would probably give the hotel a poor rating based on this, other than the fact that there really are not that many modern hotels in the centre of Barcelona and at the price of the Astoria.  So if you're an easy sleeper or just in Barcelona for a night or two it's actually an OK choice.",3,2019,04,08
59,Good hotel with reasonable price,"Clean, reasonable price, and comfortable hotel with friendly staff. It is located in a good area with many restaurants, cafe, and convenient stores. It is about a 10 minute walk from the metro station so it is not as convenient if you carry large luggage or after a long day of sightseeing.",5,2019,04,07
59,Just like home!,"My room was great, I overlooked the courtyard. Bed was comfortable and I noticed my room was swept/mopped everyday. Breakfast had many choices of traditional European, or you could order alla cart. Lunch was also available as was room service. Everything was delicious.Its a great location one block from Avinguda Diagonal and La Rambla. Roof top was relaxing, it was to chilly for the pool but it was open. There's also a small gym you can use.Everyone on staff made my stay so welcoming and comfortable that it's now my go to in Barcelona.",5,2019,04,03
59,PLEASURABLE VISIT,"Although not centrally located the hotel is close enough to the city centre with a variety of shops, bars and restaurants to suit every requirement for couples or families. sited in a quiet area and surrounded by delightful architecture",5,2019,04,02
59,Great Stay,"Such a lovely hotel. Stylish, clean, comfortable and friendly. Great location and breakfast was spot on. 
Just wish we’d realised there was a rooftop pool as there were no signs anywhere.
Asked receptionist if they could post our cards for us but none have been received yet - if they’re still on your desk, please pop them in a postbox. Thanks all.",5,2019,04,01
59,Lovely - great roof terrace ,"In a really good area for eating out and getting out and about.

The staff were really friendly and the front desk recommended a really nice tapas restaurant for the 1st night.

Our room was of a good size and the bed was really comfortable. The only downside was the small bathroom and getting out of the shower was virtually impossible due to the bidet being so close to the bath. 

Breakfast was nice and there was plenty of it. They did a freshly cooked breakfast if you wanted. 

The best bit was the gorgeous terrace at the top of the hotel with a plunge pool and a distant view of the Sagrada familia. It caught the evening sun rays.

It took about 25 minutes to walk to plaza catalunya and the Ramblas - so a great location.",4,2019,03,31
59,Vacation in Barcelona,"I will recommend this hotel to my friends if any of them will visit Barcelona, because the location is very good, also the hotel is very stylish, the terrace on 8th floor is nice and all around very suprising quality of services and food and drinks in restaurant/bar",5,2019,03,30
59,The best hotel experience I have had,Astoria never disappoints. Friendly folks who are always eager to help. The offered breakfast is convenient and a quick way to get your day started in one of the world's most amazing cities. Viva Catalunya! I booked my return trip prior to this review so I do wish I could have gotten the offered 10% off my next booking. Thank you to all of the staff at Astoria!,5,2019,03,28
59,Great hotel in Barcelona.,"Great hotel, very good location for a visit in Barcelona. Clean room and bathroom. Service-level is very high. 
Breakfast is complete and fresh. When going back to Barcelona, this is the hotel for us to stay.",5,2019,03,27
59,Standard,"Stayed in this hotel for 5 nights and it fit our needs. The two double beds pushed together was kind of odd and difficult to sleep on. About a 7-8 min walk to the metro, would’ve preferred a little closer. Room was clean but definitely older with some wear and tear. All of the staff were extremely friendly and helpful.",3,2019,03,25
59,Solo Barcelona ,"Want a clean, beautiful, well located hotel in Barcelona! Hotel Astoria is the place to stay! Friendly staff, so accommodating and is walking distance to a lot of places!! I arrived early before check in and the accommodated me without any hesitation!! ",5,2019,03,24
59,Lovely hotel and staff,"The hotel is beautifully decorated, especially in the central areas. The staff were excellent during my stay, always on hand and very helpful.
The rooms were clean and had everything required for a stay. If not a bit small, but as I was out and about most of the time, not an issue. The bed was comfortable and I slept well. My only gripe would be the air conditioning, I just couldn't get the room to the temperature that I required. But that was only a minor issue.
All in all,  the hotel is in a good location, clean and comfortable.",4,2019,03,22
59,Nice hotel but DON'T stay in room 119,"The hotel it self was quite nice and with a good location. Walking distance to Gracía, a lot of nice restaurants and cafes as well as a good walk to the ocean.
But! Our stay was quite awful due to the room we were staying in, no. 119. I have no doubt this is the absolute worst room in the entire hotel. Just outside our window was a large machinery, presumably the outer engine of the hotels air-conditioning or something like that. Because of that, there was a constant machinery noise, which made us sleep bad and waking up with a headache. Also it was not an option to go back to the hotel during the day to relax, as it really isn't very relaxing when there's a constant, loud noise. 

So in conclusion; we would probably stay in the hotel again, but only if we're assured, that we will stay far away from that engine or whatever it was. Unfortunately our holiday wasn't nearly as relaxing as we hoped, and we were noticeable tired during the day due to the bad sleep. On that background, we have to give it a bad rating, as it indeed had a negative influence on our trip. I do believe that a room facing the other way, and/or on a higher floor would have made our trip a lot better.",2,2019,03,21
59,Good hotel,"This hotel location is very good! Very close to everything, excellent transportation, so many choices fe eating! They have bar and restaurant. Staff is very nice, and friendly! This hotel is classical style, but very clean, and Vell  maintained.",4,2019,03,19
59,One night stay,"This hotel has an amazing staircase and the staff were nice but really.. they were the only nice things! The room had very little natural light.. the window looked out onto the light shaft and as we were on the 3rd floor and there were 8, we didn’t get any light. Everything in the room was dark brown, horrible. There were 10 different kinds of buzzing going on all night.. fridge, other peoples air con/ heating, extractors or fans... it was soooo annoying. There was no drinking water in the room apart from the tiny bottles in the mini bar at €2.70 and to our disappointment ... NO coffee making facilities .. and all for €76.... never again!",1,2019,03,17
59,Great stay at Astoria,Stayed for four nights with a friend while visiting my son in his semester abroad program. Outstanding staff. Went out of their way to be helpful.  Very clean room and great towels.  Great and clean hotel. Will return.,5,2019,03,13
59,Nice and a good hotel to visit in Barcelona,"Nice hotel, with a good shower and overall bathroom.
They took good care of us. There was a good varity of food with breakfast. 
The room was clean and looked modern.
Astoria is near the centre. So walking takes 20 min. to la Rambla. But there is in 10 min. a stop for the Hop on, Hop off bus. And also de Metro is nearby.
",5,2019,03,11
59,Week Away in Barca!,We decided to take a break away in Barcelona for a week and the Hotel Astoria was an amasing base for us. The hotel is in a great location with some amazing restaurants within a 10 minute walk. The restaurant and bar in the hotel itself had some amazing breakfast with a great choice. All staff were so helpful and couldn't do enough to help us. Good options for public transport within walking distance and plenty of taxis available outside the door!Rooftop pool was a nice place to chill after a day of walking. Couldn't recommend the hotel highly enough,5,2019,03,11
59,Lovely hotel.,Very clean. Comfortable bed. Big fluffy towels. Range of complimentary toiletries. Good selection for breakfast. Staff friendly and helpful. Would have liked tea/coffee facilities in room. A bit far out if you are walk,5,2019,03,11
59,Caledonians in Catalunya.,"Lovely hotel in the area we prefer to stay when we visit Barcelona. Mix of Art Deco and modernity with staff very friendly from reception, bar, cleaners and even the manager. I borrowed a corkscrew from the bar and forgot to return it but we will go back there next time so it’s on it’s on its way ...
Baby loved the exhibition and the attention she got at breakfast. We looked at the pool and she dabbled but maybe next time! We loved our stay and would recommend the Astoria and will return next trip. Thanks for making us feel special. ",5,2019,03,07
59,Birthday Weekend,"First impressions of this lovely hotel were great.  On arrival we were greeted by very friendly reception staff.  Alvaro was extremely helpful and provided us with a map of the city and advice of where to go and what to see. During our stay Domingo on reception was also really helptful - thank you Our room was very nice and exceptionally clean, the bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. My only negative with the hotel was that they did not serve evening meal which was disappointing.  The location was perfect as it was with walking distance of all the main areas of Barcelona.  Although we didn't use the rooftop pool it was a lovely area and could imagine how nice it would be in the summer.  We celebrated my birthday over the weekend of our stay and found a bottle of fizz on our return from our day out.  This was a lovely touch - thank you very much.  Would I go back? Definately!  Thank you for a great stay.",5,2019,02,28
59,Very Confortable,Spacious bedroom and confortable bed. Very clean bathroom and I liked the towels and the shower products. The place is really quiet and beautiful.

59,In constant motion,A very pleasant and clean hotel in a very pleasant location in a very pleasant city. Everything was very pleasant and highly recommend by a very fussy pleasant man 46 and his very fussy unpleasant boy 12.  ,5,2019,02,26
59,Good value for money,"Very nice an quiet small scale hotel, in a quiet neighbourhood, close to the centre. Shops and bars close by, but no noise hinderance. Well connected to public transport, but if you have time you can walk into the centre. Otherwise take the metro. Friendly people.",4,2019,02,22
59,Very nice.,Very good location. Close to metro station and a lot of buses. Not far from Plaza De Catalunya. Staff is very polite and professional. Room was very clean and comfortable. Good value for money. We would recommend this hotel.,5,2019,02,22
59,"Lovely hotel, can’t wait to go back!","Hotel Astoria made our stay in Barcelona perfect! All the staff were friendly and helpful and the gentlemen on reception spoke excellent English. Nothing was too much trouble for them.
 Our room was spacious and well equipped and the en suite was lovely with a great shower! There was a reasonably priced minibar in the room and a safe.
Everywhere in the hotel was spotlessly clean. 
Breakfast was the usual continental style with cold meats, cheeses and pastries etc and there was also the option for a cooked breakfast if you wish it. The restaurant was not open for dinner but there are lots of lovely bars and restaurants nearby so this was not a problem.
We didn’t use the pool as our visit was in February but we spent some time by the pool as the roof is a real sun trap.
The hotel houses an art exhibition which was really interesting.
The location of the hotel is great, not far from La Pedrera. There was a metro station nearby but we chose to walk everywhere. 
We were so impressed with The Astoria and hope to return before too long!",5,2019,02,18
59,"Clean rooms, good beds and polite and serviceminded staff!","Located in the fashioned eixample district, surrounded by many great restaurants, this hotel good value for money . Clean rooms and great staff makes your stay enjoyable, and just a 15-20 minute walk from Plaça de Catalunya. ",5,2019,02,10
59,"Wonderful place to stay, service and value of 4* hotel!","I stayed for a several nights in this hotel and was absolutely satisfied about the facilities and attention from the staff. The hotel is very clean, nicely decorated with posters and pictures including Pablo Picasso. The room was not too big but was very cozy too with beautiful wooden interior.  The staff was very polite and friendly, I felt very warm welcomed. The hotel has also a very nice cozy terrace where you can sit and enjoy a sun even in January! The taxi station is just opposite the hotel, so you won’t be waiting long for one. 
The owner of hotel supports Egyptian art and Egyptian museum in Barcelona, so you will also get a free pass to visit that museum! I had ordered some room service , the food was good and veey reasonably priced! I was very happy to stay here and I will definitely visit this hotel again and try the one in London and Paris. The only thing I wish was there is some tea making pot in the room.",5,2019,02,03
59,A real gem in Barcelona,"We stayed for a weekend in Astoria celebrating my Birthday. Absolutely perfect from the staff to the cleanliness, location all spot on. already thinking of coming back in May when the weathers a bit nicer",5,2019,01,30
59,Staying at the Astoria Barcelona,"Our experience staying at the Astoria Barcelona,was the best ever since the moment we checked in we were greeted by Mr. Pepe Camps manager of the hotel as well by Domingo whom was in charge of the front desk the day that we got in,which was 15-Jan-2019. The hotel is well located very close to Plaza de Catalunya and also to the Ramblas,within the area you can head to Mercat del Ninot if seafood is your thing,the hotel also offers a very good dining option. In our case the icing in the cake were to tickets to see the Barcelona games,many thanks again. We well stay there again for sure, Carlos and Corina Deleon.",5,2019,01,24
59,"Lovely hotel, great location",Stayed for a weekend in this lovely hotel.  The staff are friendly and super helpful.  The hotel itself is clean and well kept.  The art work displayed in various rooms/areas is very good and well worth viewing.  Our room was cleaned both mornings and toiletries were replaced.  The hotel is very close to Avinguda Diagonal for quality shopping and there are restaurants bars and cafes close by.  Also some small supermarkets.  I can recommend this hotel and I would stay there again.,5,2019,01,21
59,Excellent,"Breakfast very good, sorry that not all are using the option to enjoy brekfast.. Other time of the day except evening not any need of the restaurang, close the doors. Be more open and proud of the extremt strong art presentation. Officiel time of the day some days in the week when Others can enter the rooms. A own Guide",5,2019,01,11
59,Lovely experience during my stay at Astoria!,"Initially, we had booked a room with one bed and when we arrived at the hotel we asked if we could get one with two beds. The staff was really helpful and generous. They immediately changed our room and made sure we have everything we need. The services are of good quality and the general atmosphere is just lovely. We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. Totally recommend it!",5,2019,01,05
59,Great clean hotel in a good location,"I was pleasantly surprised with this hotel. It was in a great location not far from public transportation so it made getting to main sites easy (Sagrada Familia, Gaudi houses, etc.). It was extremely clean and quiet and the front desk was always helpful. I would highly recommend! ",5,2019,01,03
59,Cozy,"Great hotel in the center of the city where everything is close. Restaurants, metro and art are close to it. Nice hotel to stay, good service and food quality. I ve been there already 3 times. Summer roof pool indeed",5,2019,01,03
59,Keep it a secret....,"I travel to Barcelona frequently on business.  The staff is incredibly kind and efficient, and greet me as if I were family.  Keys are ready to go and check-in is a breeze.  Services, like printing PDF's from your room, is super fast and delivered with a smile.  Love the oversize bath sheets in the bathroom--wow--they should sell these towels in the lobby.  Slippers in the room are a plus.  There are many pleasant restaurants in the neighborhood, including a few of my favorites:  Bardot, Filete Ruso, Paco Meralgo.  Best is the art: a lovely gallery of original Opisso drawings and sketches in the lobby, original posters from the 1900's in the restaurant, all in a modern setting.",5,2018,12,27
59,Great hotel!,"When we walked in we realized we had stayed there ten years ago. The hotel is very nice. We had a very spacious room. It was very quiet and the staff very helpful. They sent up a bottle of Cava cause they noticed it was my birthday from my passport. It is in a great neighborhood, just one block over from Avenida Diagonal which is a main street. Public transportation nearby and lots of shops and restaurants nearby. We will definitely stay there next time we visit Barcelona.",5,2018,12,18
59,Great value Hotel in the centre of Barcelona,"Great value hotel, 300 meters from Diagonal metro station. Rooms are small but clean & fresh. Towels were changed daily & reception staff were polite & helpful. This is the 2nd time this year that I have stayed here & makes an excellent location if you are going to the football.",4,2018,12,12
59,5 night stay,"The room we were allocated was too small and claustrophobic for a 5 night stay. We asked if there was a larger room available, as the hotel was not busy. They gave us a bigger room, but charged us extra money for it. I was very disappointed, as we have stayed here before, and were happy with our stay. I felt it was bad customer service, as there were plenty of vacant rooms available. It is a nice hotel, and well located.",4,2018,12,06
59,Nice location very quiet street,"Enjoyed our stay before departing on cruise. The location is a few blocks off Diagonal which was quieter than some of the hotels in the area,had to walk about5 blocks to catch public transportation.Very clean and beautiful inside.",5,2018,11,23
59,Wonderful experience,"Wonderful staff the were very knowledgeable and helpful in every way. The hotel was quiet and very clean. The decor was interesting and pleasant. The location of the hotel was very easy to find and was close to many points of interest as well as a good selection of restaurants, bars and bakeries.",5,2018,11,21
59,Very good hotel on the edge of L'Eixample,All the facilities in the hotel are excellent. The rooms are comfy and provide you with anything you would expect. A spacious bathroom with a tube but no moving shower. The hotel is set at the end of E'Eixample so If you need to walk to the heart of the area you will need like 10 minutes.,5,2018,11,17
59,A great hotel in a quiet location,"I stayed at the Astoria for 2 nights to take my 10 year old son to the Non Camp to watch a Barcelona match. The hotel is in a quiet area, 10 minutes walk to Diagonal Metro Station which is perfectly positioned for visiting the Sagradia Famila (2 stops) and the Non Camp (about 5 stops). There are loads of restaurants and shops all within a short walk from the hotel so the location is great if you want to stay away from the hustle and bustle of areas like Las Ramblas.  

The hotel itself is very charming and the reception foyer feels like an art gallery due to the hundreds of framed artworks. This is a theme continued throughout the communal areas of the hotel. The rooms are clean and well appointed, comfortable beds and good bathrooms with everything you need for a short break. Tea and coffee would be a welcome addition in the rooms and our TV didn’t work so well but only small things really. 

There is a fantastic roof terrace with a small plunge pool. It was too chilly to use in November but I can imagine its fantastic up there in the summer months. The staff were consistently very friendly and helpful and the breakfast buffet was also excellent. 

Overall a great hotel that I would visit again if I was staying in Barcelona.",4,2018,11,14
59,Nice hotel - but simple things can make it better! ,"Stayed here for 4 nights in November, nice hotel but a few simple things could be done to make the stay better. 

No tea / coffee in rooms - I see from other reviews that you can ask for a kettle, but if you don't know you can ask you won't. Just ask on check-in if people would like it, job done! 

Website says room service is 24hrs, but it stops at 11pm, this meant on arrival we had 15 minutes to decide if we wanted the slightly unusual random food choices, or decide to leave the hotel and find somewhere to eat - we chose the latter and glad we did.
The hotel restaurant is only open at lunch.

Very noisy at night, every time someone flushes toilet / uses taps in other rooms you hear it loudly in the room, this is constant all night.
Aircon effective, but noisy so had to be turned off at night - fan on aircon took an hour after switching off to stop loud humming and kept us awake. Also when other rooms put aircon on we could hear the same loud humming in our room. Couldn't open the window at night due to noise from other rooms / lift. It would be easy to soundproof the rooms better, and put a few rugs down to middle sounds. Double doors in room did help with sound, but not enough. Also the corridor stank of smoke. 
I see from other reviews this is a common complaint, so it's time the hotel did something about it and didn't just ignore it. If full you cannot just move people, so fix the problem, people shouldn't have to complain when you are well aware there is problems. 

Toilet stopped flushing in the middle of the night, so we ended up taking the top off the cistern and fixing it ourselves. I know we could have contacted reception, but 2 lone females don't want a stranger in their hotel room at 3am or to have to move rooms while repairs are made. 

Good points for the hotel: 
Good location, 15/20 minute walk to Placa Catalunya but lots in the local area and some great restaurants and loads of small supermarkets.
Breakfast was very good and breakfast staff helpful and friendly. Tried both hot and cold options and very good. 
Comfortable bed, so big, and large room with sofa and desk (this was just a standard double room).
Nicely decorated hotel, both public areas and rooms. 
Roof area / pool is small but I imagine lovely on a warm sunny day, we sat up there a little and read but it was a bit windy. 
Hotel happy to store cases while we waited for return flight (not until evening)
Well stocked mini-bar. ",3,2018,11,10
59,Lovely hotel,Lovely hotel and staff. Excellent location with only 5 minutes walk for metro station/bus stops and restaurants. Only ate breakfast once but was very nice. Reception very helpful for suggestions for eating out and will definitely be back when we're next in Barcelona.,5,2018,11,07
59,Great place to stay,"We stayed 2 nights at Hotel Astoria and really enjoyed our stay. It is an older building and very charming in that way but the rooms have been renovated to provide all the comfort and amenities that we enjoy. The room was very clean with very nice linens and toiletries.There was a breakfast available although we did not have breakfast there.The location was great. We did a lot of walking and found ourselves close to so many of the places we wanted to visit, as well as to the Metro system and the express bus heading for the airport. The staff were very friendly and informative.",4,2018,11,04
59,Very good hotel,I have nothing but to commend all the staff in this hotel. They are truly professional. The hotel neighbourhood is safe. The Metro/subway station and hop on and off stops are within walking distance. Couple of supermarkets are nearby. The hotel location is very convenient. The hotel and the rooms are clean.,5,2018,10,27
59,A delightful hotel,"This hotel hits on all points - scrupulously clean, accomodating staff, great location and reasonable cost.  I would return without hesitation.  It is easy to get to every major attraction, walking or using the Metro. ",5,2018,10,25
59,Great location,"The hotel is very clean and well maintained. The location is also very great. It’s very safe to walk around the neighborhood day & night. Very accessible to public transit, and lots of cafes & restaurants. Walls are thin and you can hear other rooms but very quiet to outside noises. ",5,2018,10,24
59,Surprise ,"We booked this 3 star hotel without big expectations but we were nicely surprised at the end. Clean hotel, smaller rooms (but still with little couch), slippers, daily cleaning and chocolate on the pillow, little gallery at lobby and very nice stuff. Hotel with good address, walking distance everywhere (but we don’t mind to walk 20km a day), many great bars and tapas around. When in summer small rooftop pool available. Didn’t try the breakfast as we wanted to experience outside. 👍",5,2018,10,21
59,Good hotel to your money,"Linens and bed was real good. Cleaning every day. Staff was very helpful. Location good, nice restaurants near. Two blocks to the metro station.Bad was really noisy water pipes in bathroom. Shower was in bath and it was dangerous to get up from there.",4,2018,10,21
59,Excellent,"Great welcome, neat room, bathroom and linens. Superb breakfast. Great location. Nice terrace. Simple and elegant. Will highly recommend it. Should be a four star hotel. The staff is excellent . 24 hours reception. Great value / quality.",5,2018,10,19
59,Very enjoyable stay,"My boyfriend and I visited Barcelona this weekend for his birthday and stayed at this lovely hotel. The staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming, especially the lady who worked behind the bar. Our room was clean and we spent our last day up on the roof top terrace and in the pool which is very romantic. The only criticism we have is the mini fridge wasn’t stocked up the whole duration of our trip and when we went to eat some Pringles, the tube was already open and half full (obviously hadn’t been replaced since previous guests) However, they did provide us with a free bottle of Cava on his birthday which was a really kind and personal touch. The hotel is in an ideal location, not directly in the main tourist area but walking distance from it. Overall, its a lovely hotel and we couldn’t thank the staff more!",4,2018,10,16
59,Home away from home,"Perfectly located in quiet street of L’Eixample district just half block away from Diagonal with plenty of shops, cafes, restaurants, cocktail bars and clubs. 

All the staff is extremely friendly and  ready to help at any time always with a smile in their face. 

Rooms are modern, quiet and comfortable, although pipes are a bit noisy but not disturbing. 

The whole hotel is full of  beautiful modernist pictures and posters. REAL ones, as the hotel owner is an art collector, and also owner of “Egiptian museum” (also worth a visit)

I would just mention a couple of things for further improvement: the whole ground floor is a bit “cold”, some carpets or different lighting would help. Also, the elevators surely would benefit from a more “intelligent” programming. ",5,2018,10,15
59,Great location and staff,"We stayed at the Astoria for 8 days and wow, it was amazing! We did not opp for the breakfast but it looked delicious. The location is what really makes this hotel perfect! It was central to everything. The taxi stand and transportation was available right next to us. room was always clean and staff was informative, accomodating and greeted us every day. Plenty of resto around as well. We enjoyed Pizza Roma and Paribas Bar.",5,2018,10,13
59,Before cruise stay.,A lovely boutique hotel. The staff were very friendly. Our room had a large patio. Very good location. After we checked out we were able to keep our luggage at the hotel until we went to the cruise ship.,5,2018,10,12
59,Lovely hotel close to all amenities and sight seeing places to visit,"This hotel is a little gem and the staff is simply amaizing. Hands down one of the best hotels we’ve stayed in and felt most welcomed by all!  Two lifts are available, it’s very convenient. Highly recommended!",4,2018,10,10
59,Great place to stay in Barcelona,"We were a group of 3 couples and stayed in the Astoria for 3 nights before a Mediterranean cruise. This was a fabulous place to stay in the Eixample district. This elegant hotel offers small but well-equipped rooms, a lovely lobby and a roof-top bar and swimming pool. The highlight for us was the helpful and friendly staff who made us feel at home for our stay. We highly recommend this hotel!!",5,2018,10,08
59,3 Nights at Hotel Astoria,"Returned yesterday after staying at the hotel. Room was comfortable, air conditioned & clean. Room 421 has no view. Good shower, staff very helpful & pleasant, good location in Eixample which has bars & restaurants. A 3 star rating is about right. ",4,2018,10,08
59,A Gem,"Spent three nights here in September 2018.  Staff was super.  They could not help you enough with directions, recommendations, etc.  Rooms were compact, but they were modern, clean, well appointed and very adequate.  Location was good for getting to metro and walking to various sights.  Great value for the money.  Would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,10,08
59,Pleasant & Moderately Priced,"If you are looking for luxury, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a room in pleasant surroundings in which to embrace morpheus after a long day, this is it. The room itself was clean and compact. The bed comfortable, with shutters that blot out the day with Nordic efficiency. The lobby and common areas are festooned with interesting prints and I looked forward to the simple and uncomplicated breakfast.

Its located away from the teeming masses that parade like wilderbeest on Las Ramblas, but close to metro stops, shopping and good restaurants (like Can Bonita).",5,2018,10,07
59,Fab Trip,"We had a great stay at Astoria hotel. It is located in a nice area with lots of restaurants located a stones throw away. Lovely terrace area with pool and the air con in the room fab. Rooms are really clean and quiet, bed was really comfy and the shower was great. Also had a room safe which was very handy. Would have liked there to have been a kettle etc in the room - perhaps this is something they could introduce? 

Our shutters were broken when we arrived (wouldnt close) but the staff were very helpful and came and sorted it out straight away - thanks!

Overall great place to stay and would recommend.",4,2018,10,03
59,Hotel Astoria is great hotel,"The Astoria is a great small hotel in one of the best sections of Barcelona. The hotel staff were wonderful and most helpful in providing directions, outstanding local restaurants, etc. We learned that the Derby hotel chain prides itself in having beautiful and unique art throughout the facility giving it a delightful museum quality. Highly recommended!",5,2018,10,01
59,An experience worth having In Barcelona,"I had an unexpected 4 day trip in Barcelona turn into a little over a month! 

I stayed at Astoria for a little over a month! My work projects kept being extended, causing me to make multiple reservations that accumulated over a months time! This also raised a small issue in which I kindly asked to speak with the highest manager or /finance department in  which she didn’t get back to me til my last day of staying there. This was a bit disappointing because I sent the Hotel director Josep multiple emails and he mentioned/reception mentioned  they could not connect me with who I was requesting...

The Astoria hotel in (Exiample) Barcelona is rated-as a 3 star hotel! However I do think this hotel could very well be a 4 star hotel just to be based off of my experiences at many 5 star luxury properties! If it’s a 3 star I’m pretty sure it’s because of the professionalism with trouble shooting small issues... not sure.

The quality of service that they provided overall at Astoria is very authentic and they really do their best to make sure their guests needs are met! (But not entirely my little situation) 

This is a very busy hotel! However that does not take away from each individual experience that they try to make great for each guest.

This hotel is well placed in a great location in Barcelona just meters walking distances from great restaurants and some of the best shopping boutiques/stores in Barcelona!

I’m a bit surprised their night rate is as low as it is being that the rooms are very clean and the marble bathtubs/rooms are great! 

They also offer a great variety of breakfast in the morning /small buffet and of course you can order anything else specifically that you would like with the kitchen like Omelets , toast or anything significant that you would like to have that’s not ideally on the breakfast “menu”

Astoria also has a wonderful terrace on the 8th floor with wonderful views of Barcelona and a nice small swimming pool that you and your friend/loved one can enjoy to soak up some sun or just lounge around. There’s also an attendant at the bar for any immediate beverage or food requests at the terrace which is quite nice and more relaxing for a great experience!

The staff is very wonderful and professional in most situations I only had one small misunderstanding with a guy at reception who was being very un professional about addressing a certain issue. 

I would also like to raise a another small issue that if you don’t speak great Spanish (depending on whose working at the reception) you might encounter a bit of a language barrier which should not be the case when dealing with Funds, Reservations and other important things regarding your travel and stay.

Astoria overall does a wonderful job at making you feel comfortable! The rooms are clean and house keeping is always on point! Every single day! 

As I mentioned I stayed over a month and I had very few minor issues here. If I could give any advice to management. I would advise them have guest speak with someone who can properly trouble shoot issues in English if there is a language barrier. 

From my personal experiences and the minor issues based off of that ...

I won’t be staying Astoria again as everyone is super friendly and charismatic I don’t think they handle small minor issues in a professional way.. they kinda sweep certain things under the rug and everyone is on a different “protocol/agenda” my decision doesn’t negate the fact that I had a wonderful experience over all. But certain things turn me off! I have to be completely open and honest as this is what Trip Advisor is about. 

For new visitors you’ll definitely get a bang for your buck for a “Short Stay” at Astoria! 

Best to everyone at Astoria!",4,2018,09,27
59,Thank you,"We had a lovely stay in Barcelona and hotel Astoria.
We truelly think we got value for our money.
The staff was friendly, reception staff helped us more than once by giving good advices of routes, places to go, restaurants etc.
Rooms were very clean, aircondition functioned well, breakfast was fine. 
Defenetly nothing to complain about.",4,2018,09,25
59,Barcelona trip,Very nice hotel and service was very good. Good location and the staff were very helpful with suggestions for restaurants and sites to visit. It would be nice to have a coffee maker in the room.  Some noise was noticed in the late hours but not too disturning,5,2018,09,20
59,Short City Break,"Lovely hotel, near the metro stops and lots of coffee shops. Perfect for me and my friend. Pool was nice and quiet when we went in the afternoons. Overall we felt very taken care of and its a good busy area to stay in next to lots of shops.",5,2018,09,15
59,Great Hotel.,"The hotel was in a great area. Room was comfortable,clean and cool. There were plenty of cafes in the area and good shopping. You were able to walk to Las Ramblas for more shopping and cafes. We would use this hotel again the staff were friendly and helpful.",5,2018,09,09
59,Excellent value,"Excellent value. Smart, modern and clean hotel. The staff were great, especially two ladies with the same name! Maria Jose. The location was a little off the best and bustling parts of the city, but we still walked everywhere. I am happy to highly recommend the Derby Astoria.",5,2018,09,08

Thank you Astoria see you soon 

Keith and Louise ",4,2018,09,07
59,Perfect stay,"Beautiful hotel, clean and accommodating. The rooftop was nice , didn’t get to use it but would of if we had the chance. Location was in a quiet but lively neighbourhood, close to the metro and shopping area ",4,2018,09,04
59,"A good stay in Barcelona, one small complaint ","Me and my boyfriend stayed at this hotel for a city break for my 18th birthday. It was a good location with a restaurant / cafe strip near by which was like Las Ramblas (but quieter and cheaper) and near an underground station (Diagonal). We were located on floor 8 next to the gym and pool and the room was lovely. The bed was extremely comfy and the air con worked really well. There was just one slight issue regarding the safe, which is the only thing we asked for during our stay. We asked for the safe key and they said they’d send someone up (they never came). Anyway, the hotel or the person previous had lost the safe key meaning that we had to carry around 500€ and our passports around Barcelona (not ideal!). They did offer us the safe behind the reception but at this point we just took it into our own hands.

Overall, a nice, clean hotel which we did enjoy, but just one slight issue that let the side down a little (would give 3.5)",3,2018,09,03
59,Good value for small family.,"The hotel is good value, with friendly staff, good breakfast and nice rooms. Good location under 2 km from placa de catalunya, and away from the normal turist areas, with many good local restaurants near by. only 5 min. walk to nearest metro (Diagonal). There is a roof terrace with a small but good pool. We and our 7 year old daughter enjoyed our stay there and would gladly return.",5,2018,09,02
59,Lovely Stay,"I was 3 nights at the Astoria, very well located. A beautifully clean hotel, very fried,y and helpful staff in every department. Room was small but well equipped, very adequately and the aircon is very efficient. Recommended.",5,2018,08,30
59,Beyond a 3* hotel! ,"What can I say? If I come back to Barca I will definitely stay with them again. Despite being rated as 3*, Astoria definitely delivers beyond that. It’s in a lovely neighbourhood that’s a short walk to world class restaurants and shops. It’s also very close to subway (diagonal) which can get you around Barca very easily. 

The rooms are quite modern but definitely requests higher floor room. Staff was extremely friendly and professional. I feel like it’s their service that made my stay much nicer. 

If you aren’t coming for clubbing, or tired of La Rambla, this can be your call. 

The only downside is the lack of facilities and quite distant from beach. The rooftop pool is rather small, but if you are only hoping to chill, this isn’t a bad option. ",4,2018,08,28
59,Comfortable,"We stayed here for 3 nights and were quite satisfied. The rooms and amenities are basic but we had no complaints. It's quiet and clean. The neighborhood has good cafes, bars and restaurants. The staff were polite and helpful. It's about a 10 minute walk to the subway station and sightseeing bus stop.",4,2018,08,27
59,Great location for sight seeing and high end shopping. Family trip. August 2018.,"We stayed for a week. Located on Paris in Eixample it was a real gem of a find! Classy Art Deco lobby, very helpful staff, large enough rooms, roof pool with great views, clean and inviting (our room decor was a bit dark but very functional and it’s not like you are there to admire hotel rooms, small problem with a very loud toilet flush, woke my son up several times). We travelled with a 12 yo so our room had  a small foyer with a sofa and a door which became his domain, very helpful! Slippers, chocolates on the pillow and a complimentary bottle of red upon arrival! We did not take advantage of their restaurant, tried to eat like the locals but heard it was very good. The hotel is near great cafes, surrounded by beautiful modernismo and classical buildings and classy restaurants! And  It is about 6 blocks to the part of Passeig de Gracia  with with Casa Milla, Casa Battlo and the Illa de Discordia, etc! 15 minus walk to Rambla and Placa Catalunya. 20 min  stroll to the Port. 5 blocks to the very clean and efficient (trains very 3 to 4 min) Metro of Barcelona. Also Chanel, Gucci, Ives Saint  Lauren and such Tax Refund shopping. 1/2 block to a very beautiful stretch of Diagonal. Don’t rush to book across the street from SagradaFamillia even for the views! I did not like the area as much even with Hospital De la Santa Creu and Sant Pao thrown into the mix. Sweetest personnel ever, courteous and very helpful. Thank u!",5,2018,08,27
59,Nice hotel in Barcelona ,"The hotel location is fantastic, in L'Eixample. Close to Rambla Nueva and Passeig de Gracia. Parking available (must be reserved in advance).
Nice building (art deco).
Comfortable room, bathroom. 3 pillows to choose, all of them comfortable. 
Nice views from the terrace (and from the room they assigned to me).
Nice staff.",5,2018,08,26
59,Very nice hotel,"Helpful and kind staff. Clean and nice rooms. Very comfortable beds and really nice shower. Quiet and calm. Bus stop right outside. Checked in very late due to a our flight beeing 4½ hours delayed, but no worries, the staff settled us in in under five minutes, helped us all the way in to our room. We were more a sleep than awake, som that was very kind. ",5,2018,08,14
59,You must stay here.,An awesome place to stay. The staff were friendly and very helpful. Location is great as just minutes away from the city. We had a great stay. Thank you to the staff for making our first time in Barcelona a great one.,5,2018,08,07
59,Beautiful hotel,"It’s a lovely hotel in a great location. There,s a bus stop directly across the road, which goes to Playa Catalyunia, from where you can get a bus to the airport. The hotel is clean and comfortable and very nicely decorated. The staff are very pleasant and helpful. I would definitely return and I would recommend it.",5,2018,08,06
59,Really good,"We stayed at this hotel as an emergency when our other accommodation fell through, they found us a place in the middle of the night, stuff was super nice and friendly and super helpful. Additionally, the hotel is really beautiful, really clean and has a lot of unique artwork that is interesting on its own.",5,2018,08,04
59,Hotel Astoria,"Clean, old facioned, sleepy, good location. Everything was ok. Staff was friendy, no one was really intrested on customers satisfaction. Bar on terrace was expensive, otherwise would used more. Terrace was closed quite early. ",4,2018,08,01
59,Very nice hotel and very well located!,"I stayed here for one week with my husband and son and we felt very comfortable here. The room was spacious and the bed was soft.  All the staff were very friendly.  The location is also great, very close to many ""must see"" buildings in Barcelona, and also near very good restaurants, stores and transportation.  ",5,2018,07,31
59,Nice hotel with rooftop pool,We enjoyed our visit at the astoria hotel. The staff was very friendly and rooms were cleaned everyday. Staff opened the doors when we came in and took our bags into our room and they were very polite when we asked about for example getting metro cards. Only thing that could bother you during your visit is that pool area is quite small and the rooms were also. Hopefully I get to visit here soon again!,4,2018,07,23
59,No internet,It a nice hotel but when they put you at the back hotel with no lift I think someone should carry there bags and have a decent tv I have chucked better ones in the rubbish also to have a decent internet that was the worst I have tried to use in 2 months of traveling ,2,2018,07,14
59,Very clean and comfortable.,"We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights. The staff was very welcoming and warm. They greeted us nicely and since we arrived a little earlier than the check-in time, they kept our luggage while we just roamed around for a bit. The room itself was very clean and as expected. The hotel is surrounded by many cute cafes, please check out brunch and cafe that's around the corner, the breakfast was so good! And there are so many shops nearby too. The metro was approx 8min walk, not hard to locate either. Very convenient. Can't recommend it enough!!",5,2018,07,12
59,Perfect for short stay,"Lovely hotel in fairly central location, restaurants, bars, shopping and mini markets very close.  With a group of 4 wevwalked a lot and got taxis back - always under €10. Friendly staff. Accommodation spacious and clean. ",4,2018,07,12
59,Good value hotel,Clean well presented rooms some with good city views. Excellent beds in spacious rooms. Excellent breakfast with great fresh orange juice. Excellent free wifi. More TV channels in English would be appreciated,4,2018,07,04
59,Lovely tourist hotel,"Great local Metro links and fairly well located for sightseeing. Well presented hotel with very helpful staff. Spacious nice room with good facilties but no view from window. Buffet breakfast available for additional price (deal available when we were there) and cooked breakfast on request. Bar facilities, plunge pool and sun loungers available on roof with lovely views. ",5,2018,07,01
59,Excellent,"I stayed for a week at the Astoria hotel. The room was very clean and equipped with every comfort, the staff was very kind and helpful. Regarding breakfast was the best I've found in Europe. Very close to two important metro stops, Diagonal and Hospital Clinic. Smooth throughout. 
I'll come back surely!",5,2018,06,18
59,Very good value,We stayed at this hotel for three nights.  The staff were extremely friendly and helpful when we checked in. Our room was small and  everything we needed but was quite dark as the window faced a internal wall.  The location is fantastic for any sightseeing trip and we found all of the things we wanted to see within walking distance.  The hotel is surrounded by restaurants and bars that are reasonably priced.  The breakfast in the hotel was excellent.,4,2018,06,08
59,Strategic Location,"The location is what I love mostly about this hotel. A lot of restaurant around the hotel and not far from tourist attraction which only takes 5-10 minutes to La Rambla using taxi. 

The room space is quite small but enough to store our luggage. The furniture is little bit oldies.

The staff is also which they always help us with our luggage",5,2018,06,03
59,Lovely hotel in a awful situation !,"EasyJet places us here for one night after our flight was delayed, we were very well looked after! The staff did everything they could to help us, the food and the service has been fantastic. The manager came out and introduced himself to us - lovely man!",5,2018,05,30
59,"Good value hotel, would stay again","Hotel was good value, with an excellent location. Everything was fine throughout the stay, the only slight negative would be the breakfast and mini bar being rather expensive. Overall though this is a very good hotel and I would recommend to anyone.",5,2018,05,22
59,Nice hotel in a good location,"Nice hotel with a very convenient location and reasonable pricing. The room I got was on the small-ish side with no view, but enough for me alone. If we were a couple, it probably would be a bit too small, but for one it was enough. Breakfast was nice, standard buffet, not spectacular but enough to start your day.  

Downsides:
- no view (of course it may be different for more superior rooms but I describe what I had)
- no alarm clock (sometimes one needs one if one has an early departure tour)
- no coffee/tea machine, and no mini-fridge in the room except for minibar
- bathroom has a weird setup where instead of shower curtain there's a half-length glass pane which, due to it being half-length, ensures everything outside is wet when you're done showering
- elevators are kinda clunky and make noises like they're going to fall apart (they did not, but would be nice to fix them anyway)
- pool is tiny - you could maybe soak in it but swimming would be tricky. Wasn't really an issue since the weather was such that is was too cold for outdoor bathing anyways, but don't count on it being of any use. 

Upsides:
- the staff is very welcoming and nice and helpful
- hotel is clean, nice sheets and towels, a lot of pillows too, the bed was very comfortable
- you get slippers in the room, which is very nice
- bath is of a nice size, in some hotels they skim on it and I, being slightly taller than average, can't really make any use of it. But here it was good. 
- pricing is reasonable
- 5 min walk to bus stops and if you'd like, ~10 mins to Paseig de Gracia. 
- a lot of nice restaurants in the vicinity, close to Diagonal which is said to be nice shopping venue (no idea, I don't do shopping ;), also a couple of grocery shops very close, so you can buy any small things you need like water, fruit, etc. 
- wifi is good (common problem for hotels, but not this one)",4,2018,05,17
59,"Milý a vstřícný personál, kvalitní ubytování","Astoria is a very good, and moderate priced hotel. with very good location. Especially I appreciated very close access to public transport, mainly underground lines. Barcelona is nice city with plenty of sightseeing possibilities.",5,2018,05,06
59,"Nice location, sub standard hotel","Let's start with a positive, the staff here are very helpful and friendly. Unfortunately, that where it ends.
We had smokers in the next room (not allowed) and we were getting smoke coming into our room throughout the evening on our arrival. We asked to be moved, we were moved to an older room. The biggest problem is the noise, you can hear everything from the next room and from the street. Speaking of the street, there's a Night Club next door, meaning 3am on the weekends it's very loud outside.
Other issues...From the (2) elevators (1) was broken pretty much our whole stay, the ventilation is non-existent in the bathroom...You get the picture. The building itself is very nice to look at but not at all functional.",3,2018,04,29
59,Comfortable and clean,"Our room was large, comfortable and clean. The hotel staff were pleasant and the complimentary bottle of wine most welcome. We used the small pool but didn’t venture into the gym. We didn’t have the breakfasts as there are plenty of cafe’s and bakery’s around the area to choose from.
Happy to recommend.",4,2018,04,29
59,Barcelona for the weekend!,"Good hotel, very warm and friendly staff. Good location just over 30 minute walk to Las Ramblas and plenty of bars and restaurants nearby. If you need to soak up the sun the rooftop terrace is good after a day of walking and sightseeing.",5,2018,04,24
59,Elegant common areas,Nice hotel in convenient location.  Nice art work in all common areas and you have sense of being in nice hotel of late 19th century. My only complaint is that there is no english language tv and no premium channels or movies,5,2018,04,22
59,Good quality hotel,"I used this hotel on a 3 night trip to Barcelona in April. On arrival we were greeted by the friendly staff. We arrived before the check in time but they were more than happy to store our luggage while we went out exploring. I had arranged for football tickets to be delivered to the hotel beforehand, this was recognised and they gave us the tickets on arrival. 

The room was very clean and good quality. The beds were comfortable and air conditioning worked just fine. The bathroom was good, the shower for some reason was not at the tap end of the bath, meaning you kind of had to lean in as it was at the steep end of the bath but this was a minor inconvenience. The TV picture was not of ideal quality and had no English channels but this did not bother me at all (I wasn't planning on staying in watching TV). 

The beds were made and the rooms cleaned daily. We had little reason to contact staff during our stay but when we did they were always friendly and happy to help. Most staff spoke good English and were very understanding of language barriers.  

This is a good quality hotel and ideal for a few days stay. Clean and tidy and very little to complain about, thank you for a lovely stay.",5,2018,04,22
59,Barcelona Network meeting and Cargo Wine,"The Hotel Astoria is very good I felt very confortable like being home :-)
they are in the center area, very good as walking area with few pedestrian zones and shopping area.
next door You have few Coffee shops and most important the Taxi are on the other side of the road from the Hotel front entrance.",5,2018,04,18
59,Nice hotel well connected location,"Stayed for a long weekend in a standard double room as part of a BA package. Our room was located in the middle of the building on the first floor, it had a window but no view. The room was small but very clean, had a nice comfortable bed. Included lots of fresh towels, slippers, lockable safe and a mini bar. Our price included breakfast with lots to choose from including cooked upon request. The interior common areas of the hotel maintain an older classic look to provide pleasant surroundings. The staff were all very pleasant, helpful and welcoming. The hotel is well located within  walking distance of many tourist attractions, cafes and bars, and close to public transport for metro and buses links. I would highly recommend this hotel for a short break as good value for money.",5,2018,04,18
59,Very comfortable stay and lovely staff,"We stayed in Hotel Astoria for 4 nights and enjoyed our stay. Room was very neat and clean and they had all basic amenities available in bathroom. Only thing missing in room was provision of coffee or tea nor was there any common area to make your own hot beverage. But hotel staff was veryhelpful and hospitable to provide us a kettle, coffee and tea bags in our room on request. The best part of our stay was how Hotel and it's staff made our stay special. It was my husband's birthday and I had ordered a cake as surprise for him to be delivered during midnight. I was so sceptical that it will not be delivered on time and I spoke to several staff members to cross check so that they shouldn't miss. To my surprise whoever I spoke to, knew about it and helped me keep it a secret :) To top it all, at midnight, Hotel staff gave us complimentary bottle of Cava and chocolates along with the cake that I ordered. It was a pleasant surprise. 
And cake was amazingly delicious. Great choice of flavour. Thank you for making our stay special.
Coming to more practical details, Hotel is located very close to famous Casa Batllo and Bus stops are located in less than 5 mins walk & Metro stations is located in a distance of 7-8 mins walk. Good cafes and restaurants are also located just within 3-5 mins walk. 
Great place to stay, easy to reach to several locations and very polite and friendly hotel staff.",5,2018,04,06
59,"Home from home, lovely atmosphere","I last stayed at the Astoria about 13 years ago, and this was my fourth visit, and WOW i was not disappointed.  The hotel has been updated and the pool terrace was a wonderful addition to what was a delightful stay.  The staff were so helpful, and accommodating to anything we asked for, and very knowledgeable.  It is close to everything you need and a great base.  The room was very clean, and the towels were lovely and soft, the little extras were also a nice addition.  I was in a room at the back of the hotel with a window and the view looked over private patios, so was pleasant.",5,2018,03,26
59,Lovely hotel and staff,"We stayed in a basic double room, there was no view as the window was in the middle of the building, stills fresh breeze tho when opened.

Room was lovely and clean, chocolates on pillow, slippers, lovely towels, mini bar prices very good and a brilliant shower,

When we arrived the price of there bill was different to our price we were quoted on booking.com this was dealt with very quickly and a complimentary bottle of champagne sent to the room. 

All the staff were very helping and hotel is in walking distance to most tourist attractions. ",5,2018,03,24
59,"Great stay at Hotel Astoria, Career Paris, Barcelona","This is good hotel and good value for the money you pay. Everything was clean and delicate. Nice towels and sheets. But the best thing about this hotel are the people that work there. So service minded and kind and helpful. It was really a pleasure to stay there and we will come back.

The only thing I have to mention is a bit the noise from outside, but this is not the fault of the hotel. We took down the window covers and since we stayed there the weekend it was a bit noisy, but nothing we could not tolerate.

We really appreciated the positive atmosphere of the hotel and see you soon.",5,2018,03,17
59,Conveniently located with technical difficulties,"Hotel is in Eixample, close to many restaurants and beautiful Modernisme buildings. It is about a 20-minute walk to Sagrada Familia (or you can take the metro) and 15 minutes to the Gracia neighborhood with many local shops. The room was quite small, but very quiet because it was ""interior"" which means windows are not on the street side, but also means zero view.  Our television didn't work properly and the management never fixed it. We were bummed because we wanted to watch the Olympics! But it didn't matter too much because we spent most of our time enjoying the city. Staff were very responsive and friendly, except for the TV problem.",4,2018,03,06
59,Great hotel in a great neighborhood,"This was my 2nd stay at the Astoria for Mobile World Congress.   The hotel is near the metros, good restaurants, shops and in a nice quite neighborhood.  The rooms are very clean, the wifi is fast, the staff is very friendly and accommodating.   After a long day of work the roof top pool and lounge area is a great place to enjoy a cava and watch the sunset over Barcelona.  The daily breakfast is a great way to start any long MWC or sight seeing day; continental buffet plus hot food made to order.  I would recommend this hotel to any business or holiday traveler.  ",5,2018,03,02
59,Short Break in Barcalona,"Spent 2 nights at the Astoria and found it a very nice hotel. Well located close to all the major sites in the centre of Barcelona. Friendly and polite staff and excellent service.
Would certainly stay there again.",4,2018,02,24
59,5 stars,"The hotel is in a friendly neighborhood with some eat places around the corner. Its a nice walk to the sagrada familia. 

The staff were very friendly and kind. 

The rooms were big and clean. The bed was soft and nice with warm bedsheets for the cold nights.

The little swimmingpool at the roof was a nice eyecatcher. At the roof were comfort beds to lay in the sun.

",5,2018,02,23
59,Very nice hotel for a good price,"The hotel is very beautiful and big. The rooms are comfortable with a good bed, a minibar and a lovely bathroom. Also the staff is very kind and helpfull, the staff at the reception and the restaurant as well. They serve food of good quality. Very pleasant hotel to stay! ",5,2018,02,23
59,Highly recommend ,"Lovely hotel. 
Really nice breakfast, spacious rooms, friendly, helpful staff, I couldn’t be happier with this choice. 
The bed is very comfortable and the bathroom is spacious and clean. 
The hotel is also in a really good location, near a subway making getting around very easy and quick. 
Other reviews/hotel pictures show a sauna, but there is no sauna. And the gym is three machines that don’t work. But I wasn’t too fussed about that. 
No complaints. ",5,2018,02,11
59,Astoria hotel barcelona.,"lovely hotel and staff very friendly and helpful. a special mention to Maria in the bar area who was lovely. beautiful hotel ,room and bathroom were great. breakfast was delicious with almost too much choice.. it was also very central without being too noisy etc. will definitely be back. ",5,2018,02,10
59,Nostalgic decors and cozy,"Nice hotel, strategically located and the employees are welcoming.  Nice buffet breakfast for €15, Cozy rooms, WiFi is accessible anywhere in the building, but there’s a little problem with the toilet flush and no cable tv channels for international news.",4,2018,02,06
59,Great Hotel,We stayed at the Astoria January 26-Feb 1 and really enjoyed our stay. The staff are friendly and helpful and the hotel is beautiful and full of character. The room was clean and super comfortable. This hotel was well worth the cost and I would recommend it for others. The location was also a bonus. ,4,2018,02,05
59,On my permanent list!!!,Loooooved the location - close to public transport - La Pedrera is within walkinfb distance. Very friendly and helpful staff. Breakfast is exceptional for the price. Room size is enough for two people - very clean. Will definitely go back.,5,2018,01,09
59,Astoria Enhances Barca Memories,We thoroughly enjoyed The Hotel Astoria.  You couldn’t ask for a better front desk/bar team.  The location was perfect...a few blocks from La Rambles with cafes/bars/restaurants right outside the front door.  The hotel also had a great rooftop view where they would deliver drinks to you there as well.  Astoria was instrumental in making Barca a phenomenal trip.  HIGHLY recommend!  Enjoy!,5,2018,01,09
59,Birthday weekend,"Took my hubby for his 60th birthday, we had a fantastic time the hotel was absolutely beautiful, rooms were decorated to a very high standard and included slippers, the fluffiest towels I have ever seen, staff were so helpful and very friendly, breakfast was gorgeous and as much as you wanted, rooftop pool was amazing would certainly be visiting again.",5,2018,01,05
59,Friendly staff in a quiet hotel,"Located a 5 minutes walk from metro station Diagonal. Posh lobby and restaurant / bar area. Easy check-in, room a bit on the small size, well stocked mini bar, good night's rest during 3 consecutive nights, more than a decent breakfast. The main assets of the hotel are the low noise levels during the night and the friendly staff. ",5,2017,12,21
59,Relax and explore in the city centre,This hotel is wonderful and the staff extremely friendly and helpful. The breakfast is relaxed and offers a good selection from continental style to cooked.  Walking distance into the commercial centre if you are able but it is on the edge of the centre for those less able. I will happily return for a third time. ,5,2017,12,03
59,Everything Local and Exceptional,"Hotel Astoria has comfortable rooms and accommodating staff. We stayed there at two different times on the same trip. Their breakfast buffet is exceptional and includes local dishes, breads, cheeses and more. They fix eggs to order. It was also quick and the ambiance is wonderful. The hotel is located near several Gaudi houses- within walking distance and in a safe neighborhood. The front desk staff were always helpful when we had questions. It is one block from the main upscale shopping area and and has several restaurants a few feet from the hotel door. The area has a substantial nightlife- full of locals eating out. You can walk for blocks and feel comfortable. It was a great experience and I will stay there again when in Barcelona.",5,2017,11,29
59,Fantastic,"Stopped here courtesy of Indulge UK, for a weekend celebration of 2 boys 13th birthdays. Excellent service. Immaculate accomodation, fine breakfast included in price. Thank you Astoria and thank you Anthony at Indulge.",5,2017,11,23
59,Hotel Astoria,"Fabulous Hotel & Facilities right in the heart of Barcelona.
Close to Top Class Restaurants and the Avenue Diagonal.
Highly recommended for Families or couples visiting the Beautiful City of Barcelona.
",5,2017,11,14
59,Simply excellent - We will be returning without a doubt!,"In a nutshell, all I can say is that the Hotel Astoria has excellent staff, an excellent location, excellent cleanliness, excellent facilities and I wanted to stay longer.  They even provided a bottle of fizz for my husband's birthday which was very unexpected!

It doesn't deserve its 3 star rating; it should be a 4.  Thank you for making our stay so special.",5,2017,11,08
59,Longer weekend comfortable hotel in BCN,"The hotel is located just 5 min from metrostation in rather calm street. Comfortable double bed. Good and friendly service. Unfortunately rather poor TV-signal quality ( it was quite important as that was the weekend when Catalonia declared independence from Spain ).
Aircondition made the room ice-cold when turned on.",4,2017,11,07
59,“Highly Recommend if you want to be central!”,"When I was looking with my friend as where to stay in Barcelona we were a bit perplexed with which area. We, like many people, read reviews and therefore decided to stay at this hotel in Eixample area. I can say I agree with reviews I read about this area as in - if you want to be central and hit all the main tourist attractions then this is the best place and very safe neighbour hood. The hotel was in perfect location and very central which allowed us a 5 min walk to our left of the hotel and right; we hit the main road - Diagonal venue -which runs through Barcelona and is very central. There were lots of coffee / breakfast places around our hotel- we did not try these but looked very nice and clean. We were able to walk to all the main attractions such as Sagridia Familia, guadi's works such as Casa Bastilo, Pedro, the Gothic quarter, La Rambla, citadel parks, you name it- we walked to all the tourist attractions by foot and roughy took us 20/30 mins each time but we got quicker as we learnt the routes. If you don't mind walking then I recommend walking as it was the best way to see the city. The hotel provides a fab map and give information about the best routes etc. The hotel itself was as mentioned in a perfect location and the staff were AMAZING! The hotel Manger Mr Pepe was particularly helpful and attentive to our needs. He always asked how we were and what our plans were and then would recommend places for us to visit. We listened to his recommendations for food and bars and they were all brilliant. Other hotel staff such as Mr John, Valencia, and Manuel (all Italians) were FAB! Manuel, was funny, courteous and always had time to listen to our requests and would help us with walking routes and gave us fab suggestions as to where to eat etc. However, on a down side we had one hotel staff member (Spanish) was always rude, abrupt, didn't want to help because we didn't speak Spanish and made us feel inferior.

negative: As mentioned just one employee put a downer on the stay. The breakfast is a little pricey and maybe think of more vegetarian options.",4,2017,10,29
59,Beautiful Hotel with Nice Staff,"On the third day of our honeymoon we couldn't stand being in our mold ridden Airbnb disaster when we decided to book Hotel Astoria. We are SOOO glad we did. We walked up to a beautiful building with our luggage and greeted by the hotel staff with open arms. The hotel is GORGEOUS. The interior is marble, a grand piano in the entrance and a marble staircase goes all the way up to the roof. They knew we were on our honeymoon and welcomed us with a bottle of champagne. The rooftop pool is a wonderful addition. We stayed up there for hours several days taking in the beautiful view of Barcelona and relaxing. Would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2017,10,26
59,Molto bene,"Nice hotel, lovely staff, clean rooms and great position. The only downside is that ı found the price high for the quality, other than that it was a lovely stay. I would recommend if you get a convenient deal.",5,2017,10,22
59,Great wee hotel,"Very nice hotel for the price, the man at reception even managed to change our room from a double to a twin ( we booked a twin with agency but when we arrived found that the double had been asked for!) 
Room was nice and comfy and overall the hotel was veey clean! The location of the hotel is great with good access for anything you require. 
Definately recommend
",4,2017,10,21
59,Lovely Hotel,"This was the perfect location for three nights stay in Barcelona at the end of our vacation. It is in a quiet neighborhood away from all the tourist noise but within walking distance of everywhere we wanted to go. The accommodations are first class and the staff are extremely efficient and friendly. Breakfast in the morning had lots of variety and was delicious. 
I highly recommend staying here. ",5,2017,10,19
59,"Nice hotel, nice staff, room a bit average","I visited Barcelona for 4 days and stayed in a twin room. The room was fairly small with a small bathroom and a view of a wall. The room was perfectly clean and everything worked as it should (except the safe which needed resetting when we arrived). The location is good at the top of the Ramblas and there is a taxi rank opposite. The people on front desk were nice, not over friendly but also not unpleasant. The whole experience was perfectly fine, just a little underwhelming.",3,2017,10,18
59,GREAT PLACE TO STAY IN BARCELONA!,"In Barcelona to attend a Trade Show, I booked this hotel in town and far from venue for cost reasons. I arrived at hotel with some trepidation, expecting small room and nothing exciting. I was wrong! Check in was fast, staff very helpful, room available despite it being only 10.00 a.m. My Premium room quite spacious. My other fear - WiFi quality quickly dispelled, it was free and great! Tried room service twice, really good food, allow some 40 minutes wait. Breakfast really excellent, has all you want and eggs to order included. Location is centric, you walk out door and there are eateries and shops all around. Would definitely stay again!",5,2017,10,12
59,Good weekend in Barcelona,"A well placed hotel in an area with many restaurants and bars. Also close to the metro stop at the diaganol. The rooms are small but quite and the beds are comfortable, TV picture was not very good but spent  little time in the room as so much to see in the city. 
Staff are friendly and helpful, recommended for a weekend in Barcelona",4,2017,10,09
59,Great Staff and Beautiful Hotel,"Although I have to say, the Metro is at least a 5-7 min walk from here, we did a lot of walking to nearby places. We were able to walk 15-20 min to Casa Batllo and a 5-10 min walk to a great restaurant, Bellavista del Jardin del Norte. Walking around your Hotel is a great way to learn about the different offerings in the neighborhood you are staying in and we love to do that while traveling. 

The Hotel is beautiful, it has an old world charm and is maintained very well and we walked in and theres a great flower-like smell. Although my husband is prone to allergies and sensitive to some strong smells, he also liked it. The rooms are a good size for a couple and large closet space. We had a very small tv which we would use to get ready in the mornings. The room we had, had a window facing other windows, so I cannot speak to view. 

The breakfast buffet was very good compared to other breakfast buffets at hotels. The staff were very friendly and helpful. There is a computer in the lobby that we used to buy tickets online and print them. There was either no charge or a small fee to print. The wi-fi was reliable ad we were able to use it in the hotel room. This was a hotel picked for us by our Groupon package through a travel agency and sometime they are ok hotels but this one has been my favorite so far. If we every return I would be love to stay here again.",5,2017,10,02
59,Great hotel,"Great hotel, very central, clean and modern furnishings and lovely large towels, great wifi, nothing too much bother for the staff. Very interesting art collection. Highly recommend. Would definitely stay here again if coming to Barcelona.",5,2017,10,01
59,OK apart from location of room,This hotel is located in the  Eixample district of Barcelona.  It is an old style hotel with character.  The staff are welcoming and helpful.  The nearest metro station is a 10 min walk.  We had the breakfast on a special deal of 10eu per day.  It was excellent value.   There is a bar but it is haphazardly manned which can be frustrating.  Our main problem was with the room.  The view from the window was a brick wall.  I know somebody has to occupy these rooms but when it is you then the hotel can expect to be marked down.   Would we stay again?   Probably not.,3,2017,09,28
59,A pleasant stay,"I am very happy with the hotel itself as well as the location. The staff is friendly, the rooms and hotel are clean, and I love the location of the hotel. It is far away from all the touristy madness while being close enough to the public transportation and the night life. The room was small but very nice. I would stay at the Hotel Astoria again if I return to Barcelona. ",4,2017,09,27
59,"A few days in BCN- perfect hotel, perfect location","First, thanks to Luis - and his staff - for his assistance from check-in to check-out... along with suggestions to make our stay/visit to Barcelona very nice!
CheckIn was seamless and easy, room was well appointed and comfortable, breakfast menu plentiful - we will certainly be back !",5,2017,09,25
59,Recommended,"Well located, clean, comfortable and quiet hotel at a decent price. Staff were friendly, breakfast was decent continental, cooked was available for order. Bed was very comfortable, shower was great - just need tea and coffee making facilities in the bedroom!",4,2017,09,21
59,BARCELONA,"The stay at the Astoria hotel exceeded our expectations. The room was spacious very comfortable and quite.All facilities were excellent even the rooftop plunge pool with amazing views. We walked to most of the  ""must see"" places of interest in Barcelona. ",5,2017,09,20
59,Excellent stay! ,"Arrived at the hotel late due to flight delays, check in was easy and fast and the staff were more than helpful. The room was pretty big and very clean. Air con was amazing at night to keep us cool. Staff were really helpful even supplying us with a plug to charge our phones as we forgot our one! Free wine for booking with the hotel. We didn't eat at the hotel but the breakfast looked good. We took the metro from diagonal (about a 5 min walk) to Cataluna (only 2 stops) which takes you to the top of las ramblas where the tourist part is and lots of bars/shops. Nice walk to the beach down las ramblas. The pool at the roof was small but more than big enough to cool off (or as we used it to put out feet in while having a nice cold drink in the evening). Lots of little bars and shops close to the hotel (and a few big toy shops for those with kids) overall an amazing stay and we would definitely return here, in fact were all ready trying to fit another stay in around work as we didn't want to come home! The hotel should definitely be rated higher than a 3 star. The maps provided by the hotel were very detailed and helped us make use of the metro which became centre of our stay",5,2017,09,18
59,Oasis of Calm,We had an emergency trip to Barcelona and managed to get the last room in the House!!!! We chose the Hotel due to its close proximity to the Australian Consulate and the Metro. Absolutely delightful stay but the gem in the crown of this Property is it Staff - they were so helpful. professional and welcoming - nothing was too much trouble. PS the decor is wonderful,5,2017,09,16
59,Pleasantly surprised ,"Choose this hotel based on its location, glad we did. We found ourselves well located to walk to the Ramblas, Passig de Garcia and La Diagonal, all streets heading to points of interest. 2 Metro stops close by. Lots of cafes and restaurants within 100 meters of the front door.
The hotel was very nice, very comfortable beds and pillows. Our room was larger than I was expecting, as was the bathroom. Best shower head I have ever experienced while travelling.
They served a great breakfast which was included with our stay. Fresh fruit, yogurt, cheeses and cold meats, granolas and fresh juices, coffee and tea were all buffet style. If you wanted any type of eggs with bacon, sausage or ham all you had to do was ask and it was brought to your table, no extra charge. Dining room staff were very accommodating.
Lovely little pool area on the rooftop where we could relax with a drink after our days adventure.
Staff were pleasant and helpful, I asked for a few more hangers upon arriving and they were at the door within minutes.
If we ever find ourselves back in Barcelona, we will be staying at the Astoria.",4,2017,09,15
59,Location great.,"Loved this hotel. It is in a great location and the bus and train stations are right beside you. The staff on the reception desk are so friendly, pleasant and very helpful. The rooms were good and the little chocolate nut sweet that was left in our room was such a nice touch. We felt safe around this area walking to and from the hotel at night. Nice area and would definitely recommend this hotel. I would stay here again if I was to come back to Barcelona. ",5,2017,09,12
59,"Stay in Hotel Astoria in Barcelona, Spain.",Excellent stay in a hotel whose staff was very professional.  The daily breakfast one of the best that my wife and I ever had.  The Hotel is located in a great area of town accessible to the best tourist sites in the city.    ,5,2017,09,09
59,First class accommodation ,Lovely well- situated hotel. Nice comfortable clean room and bathroom. Soft big white towels. Wonderful breakfast served until 11am daily. Front office staff very friendly and helpfull. The hotel is just off a main street where one can catch the hop-on hop-off bus. Lots of good restaurants in the area.,4,2017,08,30
59,Nice personal and cozy hotel,"Very nice reception, good service, near the main tourist attractions and amenities. We asked to change the room since the one we stayed at first was a bit noisy and it was no problem at all. Small pool but nice view.",4,2017,08,29
59,Quiet but quality,"We stayed here for 4 nights and certainly enjoyed our stay.  My wife thought our standard room was a bit small for the two of us, and I have to agree although it wasn't a major issue.  The AC was fine, the bed was comfy and the room and bathroom was clean and well fitted. The only thing that was a bit of an issue was the limited lighting in  the room itself. Even with all lights switched on, it was still fairly dark.  We were near the lifts but didn't hear them or any other noise in the hotel at all, so we slept well.  We did end up asking for a bigger room and moved to a superior room, which indeed was more spacious and was better lit.

The check in and reception staff were very efficient and friendly.  Check in and check outs were quick and easy.

We stayed room only, but did have breakfast in the hotel on a couple of mornings. A nice selection of fresh fruit, cold meats, cheeses, breads and pastries.  All very good and recommended.

There are however various small and medium sized tapas bars and restaurants in the local area.  These range in price and quality, but plenty to choose from to suit everyone I would think.  Some are open for breakfast, other open later, some are open quite late, so no problem to eat out if needed, particularly as the hotel doesn't do evening meals.

The pool is clean but small.  More of a plunge pool than anywhere to swim.  The rooftop area is quite pleasant and we spent a day there chilling out and enjoying sangria from the bar.

We got to the hotel by cab from the airport which took about 30 mins.  We went to a few sights via the hop on hop off tour bus, which is about a 10 minute walk away.  We got a cab back from Park Guell which cost about 8 Euros and from the Sagrada Familia which cost about 7 Euros.

Not a cheap hotel, but clean and relaxing with good service.",4,2017,08,22
59,it's ok....but for this price I would expect more.,"Room was small but clean. The beds are fine. bathroom is old. The shower is at 1.75m, in a bathtub. I couldn stand under it. The elctricity is old, having a buzz in the room permenantly. Rooftop pool is small. It was all ok, but a little overpriced.",3,2017,08,21
59,surprising,"Very friendly staff, who helped us out any time we needed it. Very nice rooftop terrace with swimming pool. Easy to get to plaza cataluna. Nice neighbourhood with great restaurants away from the busy centre. ",5,2017,08,20
59,Perfect little place,"Loved this hotel. Clean & comfortable. Brilliant little rooftop pool. We particularly enjoyed nipping round the corner to a little cafe for breakfast on our way out to explore. We found a route to walk from the hotel to the main road, and although a good 20 minute walk, we enjoyed the walk every day in the sunshine.",5,2017,08,16
59,"Great stay, my home in Barcelona","The room are big enough, the place is quiet despite being high season, breakfast is very diverse and can accommodate all tastes with quality and quantity (buffet). The staff is super friendly and useful/responsive: from the front desk, people making the room and the room service manager who cooks so well and cares for special needs. Highly recommend.",5,2017,08,10
59,Clean hotel and nice staff ,"We where here a short week in the end of July; two adults and one tiny baby. 

The staff was very friendly and helpful. Super clean rooms and nice cleaning staff too. 

A few negative things, though: our room was very tiny and with no view at all. And it was pretty thin walls between the rooms, so we could very well hear other people in the other rooms. 

On top of the hotel, there is an area with a very small swimming pool and some sunbeds and a bar. Nice place to relax in the afternoon sun. 

Astoria is located a little distance away from la Rambla, it's in a walking distance, but easier to take the metro a couple of stops. 

All in all, we are very happy with our stay. ",4,2017,08,05
59,Please be wary of your personal effects,"I unfortunately had a poor experience with this property. I had purchased a small bracelet early on in my trip and noticed upon check out that I no longer had the item. I realized by then that I had kept the item in the shopping bag at the time and it was most likely thrown out with the garbage. At the airport I spoke with the front desk and they mentioned that ""the item was not in the room and not in the trash"" and ""they unfortunately could not check the trash from earlier in the week"". The most unfortunate part was that I did not have time to file a police report and thus cannot submit an insurance claim. I was not offered any concessions or condolences from the hotel, either.

In all my years of travel I have never lost an item, it is very frustrating and saddening to say the least.",2,2017,08,04
59,Nice place to stay,I will recommend to all my relatives and friends. Convenient to all high end shops and tour buses. And safe place to stay even you walk at night time.The staff are all friendly and easy to approach 😀,5,2017,08,03
59,Nice stay in Hotel Astoria i Barcelona,"Very Nice hotel and the pool on the top of the building was very Nice on a hot summerday. Everything was superb. If I had to say anything negative it was the service at the breakfirst. Nobody came and taken ordets for egg, bacon and sussage. We had to Call and then it tolk a long time to be served",5,2017,07,31
59,Lovely hotel ,"In a great location, friendly staff, modern lovely rooms (however was a little noisy from other guests) 
Gorgeous white company toiletries (can't tell you how many hotels I stay in with terrible toiletries) 
Didn't have the breakfast but all In all lovely hotel ",4,2017,07,30
59,Excellent hotel. Great location ,"Had the pleasure of spending 3 nights in the Astoria. Excellent hotel in a very convenient location. 5 minute walk to the Metro. Didn't dine at the hotel so can't comment. The rooms were very clean. Beds extremely comfortable. The ""feel"" of the hotel is high end so it represents excellent value. The rooftop pool area is an added bonus. All in all an excellent base for a Barcelona stay ",5,2017,07,28
59,Nice Hotel,"Nice Hotel convenient for Shopping and Sight seeing.  Loads of great local places to eat.
The Hotel Room is quite small but comfortable.  The Shower is nice an powerful.
There are loads of wonderful pictures throughout the Hotel as it is also a Museum to the Painter Ricard OPISSO.
The Swimming Pool is very VERY small, large enough to cool down in, however not realistic to Swim in.
Staff were friendly and helpful on the rare occasions we required.",4,2017,07,25
59,I love it!,"I consider it as 5 stars hotel, all pple working there were super professionals and friendly! 
Highly recommended!! 
We were a group of 6 and we were super satisfied with the service 
Dont miss it!!!!!!!",5,2017,07,19
59,Great stay,We spent 3 night at this hotel. The location is awesome and close to shopping stores as well as to the touristic bus station. Service was great and the receptionist were more than nice and respectful. ,5,2017,07,19
59,Excelent location,"Nice, but small, rooftop with swimmingpool more like an extended bathtub.
Good cleaning, feiendly staff, vert central  location.
Some traffic noice (5th floor), but that is hard to avoid in a city like Barcelona.
Dinner was poor, so better find restaurant outside the hotel.
Anyways, good value for the money!",4,2017,07,15
59,Review ,My family and I stayed at the hotel astoria for a week. This is a beautiful hotel and very clean. The people at reception are very helpful. Its a great neighborhood to stay in and you are within walking distance to alot of attractions. The only downside was that the hotel did say it had a gym. When I arrived there was no gym available and they had taken it out of the hotel. Other than that it was a wonderful place to stay. ,4,2017,07,13
59,Astoria hotel,I have just returned home from staying at this wonderful hotel. Brilliant location very classy area. Beautiful roof top pool and nice comfortable beds in our room. Staff were extremely helpful and always polite. we asked for extended time for check out on our last day which was granted free of charge. All in all a nice 3 night stay and break in sunny Barcelona. :-),4,2017,07,13
59,Very nice hotel,"I only stayed here for one night whilst I was stopping in Barcelona on the way back from Majorca but from what I did experience, it was a very nice hotel. 

I arrived late at night from the airport, but I was welcomed by the two staff members on the front desk. Check in was quick and I was escorted to my room by one of the staff, who took my bag on the way. 

From what I could see, the hotel looks traditional but with modern touches. I passed through an impressive room with many things on the wall, the place had a classy feel about it. 

I was shown my room which was more than decent for my night's stay. It was big enough for me, with a bathroom en suite. 

The bed was very comfy and welcomed after my long day. The bathroom was clean and well equipped too. There was a TV which I did not use and there is wifi. 

I did not have a view from the windows but this was fine as I was only stopping for the night. 

I think this is a very nice hotel in the city, good location for walking to main streets and sights, although taxis are readily available outside. 

Apparently there is a pool in the hotel which I was not told about but I wasn't bothered as I wouldn't have had time anyway in my schedule but good to know for future visits. 

Everyone I encountered at this hotel were helpful and friendly. I would stay here again.",4,2017,07,11
59,location is very good. rooms are clean and nice,"I recommend this hotel. 
Pros:
1. Good location, 5 mnts away from metro station
2. rooms are nice and clean
3. Staff are friendly
4. Wifi is available
I can't comment on food or breakfast because our offer didnot include any.",3,2017,07,08
59,"Must book hotel, perfect location, happy staff","Hotel staff made us feel that they really care about us and they are happy to see us. The room was cleaned very fast and neat. Rooftop pool and drinks from the bar are great, make sure you try Sangria because they make it from scratch.",5,2017,07,05
59,Great Hotel for Barcelona,"Considering the Other 3* hotels in Europe , this Hotel is Definitely unique. He has a wonderful art gallery in The Lobby and he is good centered in Barcelona . Everything is accessible either by Train or Walking.",5,2017,07,03
59,Great location away from the crowds,"Very comfortable room with good bathroom and shower.  Good wifi.
Great coffee bar on the corner with excellent croissants and coffee.  Close to public transport, and friendly, helpful staff.
They will provide you a kettle for  in room coffee upon request.  Nice rooftop pool area.",5,2017,07,02
59,Good Location,"My friend and I have just returned from a five day stay at the Astoria.  A couple of days before travelling I noticed when checking the paperwork that it confirmed a double room, when I thought we had booked a twin.  I emailed the hotel direct and they very quickly agreed to change the booking to a twin.  The hotel was in a good, quiet location, close to the HOHO bus, local bus routes and the metro.  There were numerous bars and restaurants close by.

Our room was on the small side but clean and perfectly acceptable. It   The shower over the bath was very powerful but the shower screen did not fit closely to the bath so water did escape onto the bathroom floor.   Staff were very helpful and friendly.  We asked for extra coathangers and a kettle and both arrived within 10 minutes.  We initially had problems with operating the safe and a lovely young man arrived very quickly to unlock it for us and then demonstrate how it worked.  We appreciated the huge, fluffy bath towels, the free wifi, which worked very well and the free safe.  Reception staff were always happy to help us with bus routes and where the stops were.  I left a purse on the bed containing about €40 one day and wondered if it would still be there when I returned and was very happy to find it still on the freshly made bed.

The pool on the roof of the hotel is very small but useful as a plunge pool for cooling off, although we did not use it.  We did however sit up there on a couple of occasions to relax after a long day sightseeing.

On checking out we expected to be charged €1.50 each city tax but it must be per room.  We were not charged for the kettle we had asked for.

I would definitely recommend this hotel for a visit to beautiful Barcelona.",5,2017,07,02
59,Nice staff and close to the action in  Eixample nieghborhood.,"We were bumped from our flight out of Philadelphia (Thanks, Air Canada) which gave us only one day to explore Barcelona. We notified the hotel through Hotels.com that we would be arriving a day later. They held our room so that we were able to check-in first thing in the morning. The front desk manager could not have been more helpful and kind toward 2 very tired travelers. The room was clean and the hotel was small, but with beautiful marble floors. Close to the metro and great cafes.",4,2017,06,29
59,"Nice Area, Would like to recommend but difficulty sleeping from room noise","Nice, safe feeling area with restaurants and car to chose from nearby. Fresh towels every day. Staff were helpful. For me it was expensive for what it was. There was one window with no view, with the shutters down at night it was a bit closed off. Had difficulty sleeping throughout from the general room noise of running water from showers and taps. With hindsight, would have mentioned this from the off as to be honest it was a big problem throughout. No tea and coffee making in the room. The roof and pool area is nice, relatively quiet, closes late evening. Would give it another chance if it offered better value for money.",3,2017,06,28
59,GOOD HOTEL IN ACCESSIBLE PART OF CITY,"Shuttle bus to hotel,although Diagonal metro not too far away. Very good service on check in. Hotel quite dark, but room clean and a good size. Overlooked the street, but had shutters and no noise. Bathroom very good, clean, plenty of room, excellent shower/bath. Fluffy towels. pool on roof was very small and warm. Didn;t use it, but could have happily sunbathed up there with bar service. Would recommend.",4,2017,06,26
59,A super great hotel,"really nice hotel with good staff
it's clean
the swimming pool & the roof top are amazing
rooms are small but it's ok 
good location - center of Barcelona
quiet place if your room is not on the street side",5,2017,06,26
59,Located in an excellent position!!! Very close to the metro station and within walking,The hotel is located in a great central position! The staff was very helpful. The room was clean but very small. Breakfast could be better especially coffee....overall i would suggest it for a visit in Barca. ,4,2017,06,22
59,Five star quality from a Three star hotel,"The Astoria is one of the best hotels we have stayed at, the staff are friendly and really helpful. The room was very clean with fresh bedding daily along with good quality towels. The sun deck and pool on the roof is a must try out place to spend some time. We never had a single fault or issue throughout our ten nights stay. The hotel is within easy walking distance of all the main attractions making our route planning for each day easy. I would state that we had four or five star quality in a three star hotel its that good. We will use the Astoria every time we go to Barcelona from now on.",5,2017,06,20
59,Good hotel for exploring Barcelona,"Not smack in the middle but situated conveniently close to city center and Rambla de Catalonia and Passeig de Garcia (only 3 minutes away from the top) which honestly is much more attractive than La Rambla when it comes to vining and dining.  If you get a room facing the Calle Paris on the lower floors you can hear the traffic in the street, but not at an annoying level. And air conditioning is delightfully quiet. We had a room on the 1.st floor and slept soundly. Nice roof terrace, but not too many sunbeds. Skip the hotel breakfast and eat at the cake shop around the corner - delicious! 
A small caution for the double beds - not too spacious at 140cm width. Ask for twin beds if you're not comfy sleeping close. ",4,2017,06,16
59,Nice and cozy hotel,"Nice and cozy hotel almost in the middle of Barcelona. Short way to most Things in Barcelona. Nice bar area, and a small roof top With a small pool. I hereby does not want to Call it a swimming pool, only pool. It is about 2,5X3,5 meters big, and hence not swimmable. But the sun beds are Nice and if sunny and warm, a perfect place to stay. Breakfast is a bit expence though. 15€ for a Continental breakfast buffet With several choices of ham, cheese, bread etc. There is a nice patio cafe right over the street where you can buy bocadillos and coffe for 3,5€. Nice hotel staff, always kind and available. Always holds the door if we want go out. There is also a taxi station right over the street, next to the bocadillo cafe.

All in all a perfect hotel for business or sightseeings.",4,2017,06,15
59,Good central position,"The hotel is  lovely art deco but with a modern feel. The staff are helpful, it is very clean. The position is excellent for getting around. The down sides are breakfast was a very slow service and it is also positioned along the road from a nightclub, so if you have a bedroom at the front of the hotel you hear the noise when it closes.",3,2017,06,13
59,Hotel Astoria - Barcelona - A good choice,"We were a total of 6 people for some of our week here, and we all had a great time.
Pool and sunbeds on the roof were nice, and thus occupied quite often.
Our room was a tad smaller than what we're used to from Norway, but was quite nice.
Cleaning Staff was a bit too eager to clean in the morning and didnt always respect the Do Not Disturb sign, but it only happened a couple of times.
Bar on the hotel was nice, with a friendly and good bartender.
We did not try the restaurant or breakfast, lots of good choices just around the corner for this as well. Especially recommend Brunch and Cake.
All in all I'd really recommend this hotel both on price and location.
",5,2017,06,13
59,Great hotel,"This hotel was amazing. The second we were dropped off and stepped in we were immediately greeted by someone helping us with our bags. We were then greeted by two more people behind the front desk welcoming us. Our flight was early (7am arrival) and we got to the hotel around 8. Were figured we would not be able to check in so early but instead were told ""no problem, we'll have a room ready in an hour."" I have never found such great customer service anywhere not even in the US. Our room itself was a perfect size for 2 people. There were 2 single beds, a couch, a desk, a huge window that opened up and overlooked the street/shops below, and a rooftop pool that we didn't use but looked at. Breakfast was included everyday and it was delicious. You could order hot items made to order and/or help yourself to the cold items served buffet style. I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely choose it on future visits to Barcelona. ",5,2017,05,26
59,Nice Hotel in central Barcelona ,"We spent 2 nights here and found the hotel very comfortable, convenient location, lots of restaurants and cafes nearby and more great architecture.  The hotel staff were very helpful in arranging transport to the airport & recommending the hop on hop off bus- with a nearby stop- great way to get around the city!",4,2017,05,25
59,"Nice hotel, shame about the dark room","The hotel was nice but we had 3 issues for the cost. Firstly, there was next to no natural light in our room as it looked onto a wall, which is rather depressing on holiday in a sunny location. Secondly, the wiring was very strange and one night we couldn't get all the lights to go off. Thirdly, the sauna was out of order so I had to go 4 blocks down the road to a sister hotel. Not great for over £100 a night so be careful before you book.",3,2017,05,25
59,My stay at The Astoria Hotel in Barcelona,"Prior to our Western Mediterranean cruise we stayed at The Astoria Hotel for two days. The hotel has a great location close to Via Diagonal. Walking distance to HOHO  bus. Room was clean, well decorated, updated bathroom. The staff was friendly and helpful. The price was reasonable.",5,2017,05,24
59,Great location and friendly staff,The location was easy and close to the Metro to get around.  They even held our bags for free for us at the front desk the daybof checkout so we could enjoy an extra day in Barca.  The staff was very friendly and helped us get around.,4,2017,05,23
59,Lovely hotel,We were here for a long weekend sightseeing and were very pleased with our stay. The rooms were clean and modern. The staff were friendly and helpful and servings at the bar very generous. We did not dine or breakfast at the hotel as we were out sightseeing. The hotel is in a reasonably quiet area but convenient for the metro. I cannot think of any improvements and would happily stay again / recommend the hotel to friends.,4,2017,05,23
59,Good Staff. Good Location.,"Impressive lobby, artwork and entrance. Great staircase spiralling to the top floor and with such a first impression, I had great expectations for the bedroom! Unfortunately, this was the complete opposite, it was big enough for a small child. I was extremely disappointed and when I requested a new room, my only option was a studio, which was even smaller than the double room! I couldn't use the gym in the morning because it was located close to the guest rooms and it wasn't a soundproof gym. O_O
I don't see myself returning to this Hotel with these conditions.

Pros: centrally located and across from a taxi stand for airport runs.",2,2017,05,21
59,Alright hotel,"Nothing fancy but alright.
The pool looks bigger on the hotel pictures, it's actually really small but it's there.
The hotel is in a nice area just a couple of streets from the nice end of the Rambla. Lots of small good restaurants and bar close too.",3,2017,05,20
59,"Mostly just good, but some highlights","On my second trip to Barcelona in a month, the bar was quite high after having stayed in a different hotel. My initial response was that the Astoria is quite nice, but ... That's all I could say. 

However, the personal attention I received throughout my stay from the kitchen and room service staff was exceptional.

What the hotel may lack in modernity, it makes up for in personal attention - and the food is delicious!",3,2017,05,19
59,Well placed to see Barcelona,"Impressive entrance lobby and imposing facade, hides the fact that the rooms are particularly small. That said, I was really not in the hotel that much, only to sleep as the rest of the time I was either working or exploring Barcelona.",4,2017,05,19
59,Nice hotel,"Tea and coffee making facilities should be available in rooms. Rooms are very small. 
On the plus side the hotel is clean and staff very helpful. It is near to the metro which is very convenient for the airport.",4,2017,05,13
59,Caring staff at hotel in excellent location,"Located one block from major metro station, Hotel Astoria offers quality rooms/linens with generous breakfast buffet. We especially liked hot items offered for order as part of the buffet. The best part of Hotel Astoria is its staff. Everyone was so helpful, orienting us to the city as it was our first stay in Barcelona.  My sister fell ill while we were there & needed a doctor. Juan called doctor who came to our room(!) and aided us in trip to hospital. We needed to extend our stay into the week-end. I know they were busy, but Juan and his assistant-wish I could remember her name-allowed us to stay in same room extra night. Domingo(?) helped me obtain new train tickets when we could move on in our journey. At a vulnerable time, Hotel Astoria offered shelter and assistance perfectly. I am ever so grateful!",5,2017,05,11
59,Very clean and comfortable facility. Very close to restaurants and shops,Very good hotel. Would Reccomend to family and friends. Very close to restaurants and cute cafes. Also very close to metro station. Staff was very pleasant. The shower head broke and as soon as we told the staff about it someone was there to fix it in 10 mins. It was fixed in a short time and we were very satisfied ,4,2017,05,02
59,Good location,"This hotel was fine - the common areas were nice, and we found the location to be good.  I wish I had known, in advance, that not all of the rooms are the same.  Our first room was bad (8th floor) - it has not been renovated, and was incredibly musty smelling - especially in the bathroom.  The air in the room even looked and felt thick.  I couldn't believe that it was the same hotel that I had seen in reviews! Fortunately, when we asked if it was possible to move to a different room, the staff very graciously allowed us to move the next day (the hotel was full the first night).  Our new room was much better (and looked like the pictures we saw on the website and in reviews).  So, this is simply something to keep in mind.",3,2017,04,28
59,Nice hotel,"Lovely clean room, could do with hot drinks tray, although u can get on if u ask. Could not get a coffee till 8am on first morning. Better when they brought tray, shame the had a large group whos children where allowed to run riot by parents although hotel tried there best to control situation. 2 young children on a piano not a good start to day.",4,2017,04,26
59,"We did not choose this hotel as we were part of a group, but SO VERY happy we got to stay here","This hotel was a great surprise, both in location and facilities. We have been travelling with a large sporting group and the staff here have managed our group beautifully.

Breakfast is fantastic with many buffet options as well as al a carte. Rooms are impeccable and the city is on your doorstep.

Nothing was ever a problem either at reception or at the bar! ",5,2017,04,24
59,Great location in Barcelona,"Really good location as you are 10 mins walk to Gaudi's Casa Milla, about 20 mins from the Placa Catalunya and the start of the Ramblas, and their is taxi rank opposite for longer trips. Do not expect rooms with a view, there isn't one as the rooms face inwards as an atrium. The rooms are well sizes, comfortable air conditioning, cleaners were great and thorough. No kettles or tea/coffee making facility but we requested one and they happily provided, as they did an iron and ironing board. Staff were friendly and very helpful. We didn't try the breakfast as was mostly continental, fruit etc.and there are cafes very nearby. Rooftop pool is much more of a big birdbath and the water, even after a full sunny day, was freezing. Great little bar for drinks etc on the ground floor. would very much recommend for a brief city break.",4,2017,04,22
59,Fab Hotel,Great location for access to all the main attractions. The hotel had large rooms and a powerful shower. The staff where very friendly and extremely helpful. They even supplied a kettle and tea making when requested. I would highly recommend this hotel. There is even a great little café across the road that all the locals go to that had the best coffee.,5,2017,04,22
59,The Football Trip,"We staying cus the Champions League Quarter Barça vs Juventus for 5 days at the hotel! The welcome was friendly and the hotel was calm.
The room was very comford, maybe a Bit small. The Service we dondt really use and their was nothing special about it.",5,2017,04,21
59,Well priced well located hotel for Barcelona excursions,"Stylish hotel well located in Barcelona as a hop-off point for walking excursions and shopping. Hotel offers a quaint bar and great breakfast fair, staff are very friendly and do their best to help and accomodate requests, I highly recommend this hotel for the business traveller or couple on a weekend getaway to Barcelona. A short walk away are some very good bars & restaurants, perfect place to escape the hustle & bustle to chill and re-energise",4,2017,03,31
59,Excelent,"The best area, the best service, highly recommended for everyone interested in a quality stay in that marvelous city called Barcelona :-) I will  definitely return with the first opportunity  and recommend my friends to do the same.
",5,2017,03,27
59,Fabuloso lugar con excelente servicio al cliente.,"There is no recommendations at all. The person at the front desk, his name is Domingo has an excellent customer service. There is no other one like him. I appreciate your service. Defiantly on my next trip to Barcelona, this will be my hotel.",5,2017,03,26
59,Awesome hotel! But very loud construction noises!,The hotel and the staff were great but the only downfall is the loud construction noises in the morning and throughout the day. The staff was very pleasant and fulfilled all of our requests right away.,5,2017,03,25
59,Great hotel,"Great hotel, friendly staff, comfortable, clean room and great food. Ideally situated for exploring the city as it is just a short walk away from the main road and approx 30min walk away from the Nou Camp. Would definitely recommend it. ",5,2017,03,24
59,Comfortable hotel with good access to city and Camp Nou,"Three couples on a weekend break to Barcelona for football and the sights found the Hotel Astoria a good venue.  Administration at the desk was very good throughout and the ground floor is well laid out with a fascinating artwork gallery.  The rooms were very good as well, smartly furnished and comfortable.  Breakfasts were straightforward, although the service from some members of staff a little slow.  It is quite a noisy street, so rooms out the back or higher up may be a better bet.",5,2017,03,21
59,Perfect for a city break,"We were given this hotel as part of a booked football package and loved it. The hotel itself is beautiful (there's even a small art gallery in the reception), very clean and staff all friendly and welcoming. The roof terrace is small but again clean and well presented. Good choices at breakfast and most of all fab location to explore the city. Rooms are small as 'boutique' would suggest but again clean and all you need. Only complaint is that it was a bit noisy. Our room was next to the lifts and also clearly had a water/waste pipe running through one of the walls but that was just
 where our room was. It wasn't enough to ask to move but I'm sure had we they would have accommodated this. Highly recommend ",4,2017,03,19
59,I do not understand how this place is only 3 stars,"This hotel is fantastic, the staff were lovely, the room was big, clean and comfortable, this is a great location as it's so close to everything we wanted to do. If we couldn't walk their we were close to the metro which was really easy to use. I loved that this hotel was on a Main Street and really brought the Barcelona life close to you. I spoke to the hotel before hand to arrange a surprise for my partner and they did so well. The only two things I would have liked would have been complimentary bottles of water in the hotel and lights on the roof terrace. Apart from those I would 100% stay here again! ",5,2017,03,18
59,"Great find, will definitely visit again","Just returned from a 3 night stay at this hotel and could not fault it. It's a beautiful hotel, the staff are lovely and it's close to many attractions including La Pedrera. There are lots of great bars and restaurants nearby too.  It's very reasonably priced and we will definitely be making a return visit.",5,2017,03,16
59,Hotel for a short stay,"Stayed for 1 night and it was enough to get some impressions of hotel.
Positive:
- good location
- good breakfast with quality products
Negative:
- cool in the room in January
- problems in bathroom with cold and hot water (only very hot water in shower)
- not comfortable beds with bad pillows
- tired room that needed renovation
- a lot of noise outside at night (even on high floor with closed windows)
It's ok for budget stay at Barcelona if you are ok with noise.",3,2017,03,11
59,Barcelona ,"Stayed at The Astoria Hotel in the business district of Barcelona from 3rd March until 6th March 2017. 

The hotel was situated in a quieter area of the city which suited our visit but was close enough to the busier end Las Ramblas etc. 

Taxi's were plentiful to the hotel and on the occasions we used them charged about 6-7 Euros from city centre to hotel. 

The hotel is clean and very comfortable - continental breakfast was good with all the usual offerings. 

Lunch and Dinner were optional extras should they be required. 

Rooms were adequate for our visit however our room (528) was fairly warm and unfortunately when we tried to use Air Con it didn't appear to work. 

The AC control behind the door didn't respond. 

Now I should point out we acted like true Brits and didn't make a fuss. 

I'm sure if we had mentioned it it would have been resolved. 

The AC wasn't going to spoil our break. 

The other negative was the lack of view from the window. 

Our view was of the lift shaft and I noticed several rooms had the same view on the different floors. 

Staff appeared friendly and reception staff were pleasant and welcoming. 

The hotel had an authentic Spanish feel about it. 

If you want a good priced hotel in a great area then consider this place. 

",4,2017,03,09
59,Pleasant - once we moved rooms ,"The hotel is about a 25 min walk from La Rambla (it is a down hill easy walk) and about 20 mins walk from Sagrada Familie Basilica. There is a taxi rank on the corner and a metro stop nearby - so fairly well located. 

It is 3 star - some touches like the toiletries, slippers, mini bar, room services are at the top of the 3 star bracket but it is appropriately rated.

We originally were allocated room 529.  It is a tiny room and faces a blank internal courtyard wall. To the right we could see directly  into another bedroom.  The room was hot and because it is winter the air con was not available.  Leaving the window open was not possible 1. Because of privacy and 2. Because it made it difficult to move around the bed as the window opened inwards and took up space.  As soon as we went back to reception, we were offered another room and offered an apology.  Some of our colleagues were in similar rooms and they didn't complain to reception, but it affected their experience. 

The rest of our stay was really pleasant. The beds were comfortable and breakfast was really good. The staff were pleasant, helpful and polite and we are grateful they addressed our concerns without any question.  

We didn't swim as it was cool weather.  The swimming pool would be a good way to cool down on a hot day: It isn't big enough to swim in for any exercise.  The sun beds on the roof are high quality and well maintained.

Thank you Astoria. ",4,2017,02,25
59,Beautiful hotel / art museum .,This boutique hotel combines art ( opisso) with  friendly people and good quality food that I would expect from a 4/5* but it's only a 3* ! WELL DONE ASTORIA :-) . Central located ...close to everything ... easy to get to from airport .,5,2017,02,22
59,Excellent hotel!,"We chose this hotel for a couples break away and we're so glad we did. Within 10 minutes walking distance of nearest tube and surrounded by bars and restaurants. 
The room was spacious and cleaned daily with complimentary essentials and a mini bar. 
The staff on reception were very helpful when recommending places to eat or how to get from one place to the next by providing maps and routes.
Would recommend purchasing a T-10 card for those who will be using the tube to get around! ",5,2017,02,16
59,Great medium size hotel,"This is a nice hotel.  In a lively area of Barcelona about 30 mins walk from the centre.   The rooms are small but comfortable.  Interesting art collection everywhere you look.   Super helpful staff.  

Can be noisy at night. But it's in the middle of a lively city so you should expect that.
Didn't try the food. There are so many food options around the area we never felt like eating in the hotel.

Excellent value for money.",5,2017,02,13
59,Best hotel once again! We had a brilliant stay,"We visited the hotel astoria this year as we had such a good time last year and they did not let us down. The room was spacious, clean and we had a wonderful view. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful in fact they can not do enough for you. The location of the hotel is perfect 10/10",5,2017,02,12
59,Great little hotel ,"Had a great stay here - lovely helpful staff, good free wifi, short distance centre but a nice walk - we clocked 75 thousand steps during our 3 day trip. Loved exploring etc. Pool was not heated therefore we couldn't use it and the sauna was broken - very helpful reception staff called another hotel and we were able to use their facilities for free. Rooms were comfortable and we managed a good nights sleep. Would recommend this hotel 👍 ",5,2017,02,12
59,Modern boutique hotel,"We found this hotel to be clean and modern. The shower in our room (227) was amazing, normally we find showers in hotels to be weak and run out of hot water quickly but not this one!!! Big soft fluffy towels too.
We did find our room unbearably hot during the night though, our room faced the main road so it was too noisy to have the window open overnight and the air conditioning did not seem to work even though we had it set to 5c it was still hot.
We did not eat at the hotel as there are a lot of little restaurants in the local area.
Tea and coffee facilities in the room would have been nice rather than a minibar.
As we stayed in February we did not use the pool facilities.",5,2017,02,12
59,Good staff and amazing location,"The room we had was very clean and we loved the room service. As for the location, the best! Restaurants and pubs just around the corner and 2 supermarkets across the street. It is a less than 10 mins walk till the nearest subway station. I would definitely recommend this hotel. ",5,2017,01,27
59,A fine stay,"The airline-connected price made the stay in a fine hotel even better!  The front desk was very helpful for us tourists. There are two elegant dinner spots, one informal (e.g., lunch), plus superb breakfast/lunch and pastry shop, all within approx. 50 yds. of the hotel, in addition to the hotel's offerings.",5,2017,01,19
59,Fin de semana en Barcelona,"The hotel is old and need some maintenance, but it's very clean. It's good situated and ideal for a short stay.  The staff is super friendly and helpful. They always help you with a smile. And they can give you good information about the surroundings. I will recommend this hotel. ",4,2017,01,17
59,good,"good location and facility.
it's near the metro and cataluya plaza but it's far from the espanya plaza and airport 
i paid 20 euro's and 7euro to go to the airport. it' too long say the 200 letters 
anyway it;s comportable   ",5,2017,01,13
59,Good location,"The hotel is very good and comfortable,even more  it has a good location .its located near passeig de gracia  and the nearest metro is 5 min walking from hotel.Staff is friendly. 

Highly recommend.......",4,2017,01,07
59,DISAPPOINTING HOTEL IN BARCELONA,"The first room we were given was tiny with a very small bed and looked onto an interior light well.  When we complained that the room was too hot and airless, we were told that the air conditioning throughout the hotel was closed down for maintenance.  We were awoken at 5 a.m. by the loud sound of the occupants of the adjacent room using the shower as though they were in our room.  when the people in the room above ours used the shower, water poured through the ceiling of our bathroom, soaking the floor and making it unusable.  the reception staff were surly and unhelpful.  The only good thing about the hotel was that it was very clean and the cleaning staff were cheerful.",1,2017,01,02
59,Beware of this hotel!!,"I do not normally write reviews like this, But my advice is to avoid this hotel unless you can be sure you do not have any chance of repeating our experience.
Our room 429 was small, with a standard double bed, no tea/coffee facilities, one chair, no mirror apart from in the bathroom, a single window which over looked the blank wall of a light well. It was hot, airless and the a/c didnt work. We complained and we moved to the 7th floor, room 729 (same size and features as previously)which had exactly the same view, also no a/c but we were told as we were at the higher level there was more chance of some airflow!! This move coincided with a short period of no water in the hotel, which admittedly was soon solved. Room 729 had the additional issues of the cistern continually flushing unless it was manually re-flushed which bizarrely stopped the problem. The over bath shower flooded the bathroom as there was no sealant beneath the opening panel, there was also no bath plug which meant a bath was not an option. 
You may wonder why we didn't complain about the additional problems encountered in room 729. The answer was we only had another 2 nights to endure it and we didnt fancy trolling around the City on what was our vacation looking for an alternative.  I  also believed the hotel management were well aware of the shortcomings and had cynically accepted the booking in in spite of knowing the problems, so what were they going to do!!. How could they not know the a/c didnt work, did the room cleaner simply ignore the flooded bathroom each day without reporting to management. Our fiends who came on the same booking and had a similar experience which is likely also to be on Trip Advisor.  Finally, the reason I dont normally write such reviews is because if things go wrong in a hotel or restaurant they are usually mistakes and generally corrected and therefore I dont think it fair to condemn any establishment of that basis. The difference here is that for the reasons stated above I believe the Astoria  hotel management were fully aware of the issues and accepted bookings in full knowledge of the poor quality experience they were about to unload upon their clients.",2,2017,01,02
59,A fabulous stay,"We really loved this hotel. It was a great location with an easy walk to most places to see in the city. Our room was super clean and comfortable. I especially enjoyed the bath tub after a long day of walking everywhere. 

The breakfast at 10 euros was a great deal. The buffet included fresh fruit, cheese, ham and rolls. Most days you could also get cooked eggs so we were able to get a good bit of sightseeing in before we wanted any lunch.  

The staff were also very kind and patient with my many questions via email before our stay and with our very limited Spanish during our stay.

I don't know if we will ever get back to Barcelona but if we do, I would stay here again without looking elsewhere.",5,2017,01,01
59,Exceptional service,"Good room, location ok, front desk service was exceptional.  Would have preferred to be in old city to avoid needing subway, but the subway hub nearby was convenient.  TV service was subpar, but I seldom watch TV so it really did not affect me.",4,2016,12,26
59,Wonderful Astoria,"Beautiful quirky hotel.  Staff were absolutely wonderful.  They were polite, respectful and helpful.  We met the manager who was very much like part of the hotel staff as he engaged in conversation and banter with customers which is always pleasant.  He was more than approachable and had the utmost respect for all guests using the hotel.  No criticisms, just a suggestion which would be to have tea/coffee making facilities in the room for your stay.   Other than that, Excellent hotel with wonderful staff and a wonderful manager.  I would definately recommend it to others and, return. ",5,2016,12,07
59,Great location great hotel,"We wanted a hotel that was reasonably priced and in a great location and we found both in Astoria.  We upgraded to a larger room but even so the total cost was around £70 a night for 2 people.  Really good value.  The room was clean and spacious.   Location was great - a few minutes onto Avenue Diagonal, around 5 minutes to Metro and from Diagonal Metro or Passeig de Gracia metro we got to all the

 places we wanted to visit.   Area is a bit quieter than right in centre and loads of great restaurants nearby.  Taxi rank just opposite and we got taxi to airport for around 30 euros.     Would definitely return to this hotel when visiting Barcelona again.",4,2016,12,01
59,Fantastic,"Brilliant staff, nothing too much trouble, made our anniversary special. Can't fault it. Comfortable bedrooms, safe location, 5 minutes from the Metro, nice roof terrace with good views.
Thank you so much.",5,2016,11,19
59,Good hotel for a conference,"In a good part of town, convenient for taxis, with useful shops and other ammeties nearby. I particularly like the decor with 19th and 20th century art nouveau posters and advertisements - for instance for the Barcelona Exposition of the 1920s.",4,2016,11,18
59,Lovely and quiet place,"Lovely and quiet place to enjoy Barcelona or for business trip-
Closed to the rambla street ;  a real choice of restaurant just around-
Nice service and better and better. i came here from six years now.",5,2016,11,15
59,Comfortable stay in Barcelona,"We booked 4 nights at the Hotel Astoria via Booking.com and found it to be a comfortable, well-run operation in a convenient location. There were lots of bars and restaurants nearby and it was easy to walk to various tourist spots or use the Metro (Diagnol station the nearest, about 10 minutes walk away). Our room was on the 7th floor with a ""void"" outlook from the window and very quiet for most of the time...got a bit noisy in the mornings after 08:00 when the cleaners started and the plumbing kicked into life. No problems connecting to the free Wifi, which ran at a decent speed and uploaded our Facebook pics with no issues! Had breakfast every morning and benefitted from a 5 euro discount pp...good selection of continental fare. We were very well-looked after by a lovely lady who ran the bar and room service in the evenings; she made us very welcome and provided superb Baileys nightcaps! Didn't catch her name but made sure she was appreciated. Our only small observation would be to make the public areas more welcoming and comfortable....the bar and dining areas were a bit souless. Interesting art on the walls, though.",4,2016,11,12
59,I want to come here again,"Nice location, nice ppl, nice service, nice breakfast n nice hotel. Room was kind of small. But it was so cheap, so its fine. N everything was nice. I want to come here again if i can come to spain. For real!",5,2016,11,11
59,"Decent room, slightly overpriced food, thieving cleaners","Room size is decent, and the bathroom is really nice with a powerful shower.
Staff were very professional and friendly. I had breakfast and room service dinner for the 4 days I was staying here. While the menu is limited, the food is not bad, but I'd say its overpriced for what it is (15 euro for a continental breakfast). Room was slightly colder than I would have liked, but the staff provided extra duvet when asked.

While I was content with most things about the hotel, one of the cleaners seem to have stolen 30 euros from my wallet. I never took my wallet out of my room as everything was already paid for by my company. Partly my fault for not keeping it in the safe provided, I was naive to think these things happen at 'proper' hotels.",3,2016,11,11
59,"Great staff, good location",Lovely hotel with gorgeous lobby and roof terrace. The rooms are small but clean and very comfortable. Location is an easy 20 minute walk from La Ramblas and there is a good choice of bars and restaurants nearby. The hotel staff are fantastic - big thank you to them for looking after our large group. Hope to visit again in the future.,4,2016,11,11
59,Mixed bag,"Spent 2 nights there due to a business trip. 

The location is really downtown Barcelona, most attractions are within walking distance, so no complaints on that.

Check-in was easy b/c the guys at the reception spoke English - although they required to pay the whole stay right upon arrival (citing amex doesn't support pre-authorisation - my experience suggests differently). Wifi instructions (free, available around the whole building) were also handed over.

My room was on the first floor and... the good news is that what is advertised on their homepage is all true: there is a dedicated seating area, the bathroom is covered with marble, you can't hear what happens in the room next door - BUT it was not mentioned that the furniture is decade old, you can hear every single drop of water via the utility pipes crossing the room and on the first floor the street is really noisy, because the windows are not sealed properly. Nevertheless it was clean and maintained and services run as expected.

The breakfast was a positive surprise, among all the hotels I visited it had the most local flavors and dishes. Despite it was a limited range and one had to look for the waiter girl to get some coffee, I really enjoyed that they dared to be local.

Since everything was paid upon arrival, check out was a breeze.

Because it was booked via our travel management, I have no idea if the price is acceptable in BCN - but for a similar price I used to stay somewhat better rooms in other cities (Moscow/Dubai).

It's ok for one or two nights, but try to ask for a room on the upper floors if the street noise bothers you.",3,2016,11,09
59,"elegant, accessible and fabulous!","The sheer elegance, beauty and splendour of the hotel left us amazed.  The welcome was second to none and the Reception Staff were wonderful.  The room was beautiful and well maintained etc.  We enjoyed the Continental Breakfast each morning and were set up for the days walking.  The city centre sights are well within reasonable walking distance for most people.  We will definitely return!",5,2016,11,05
59,Good pool,"Nice hotel in a nice place. I really like a lot the pool. The relation between price and service is quite good, and te service of the waiters are good too. I recomend this place to the people who wat to visit Barcelona a few days",4,2016,11,02
59,Modern amenities in a genuinely traditional--and sophisticatedly artistic--place.,"I live a fourth of my life in hotels, and this was my first time in this one.  Just entering the place, I felt that I had missed out on a grand experience, having always stayed at other hotels in Barcelona.  Such a great treat!  It is not that one feels that one is walking back into another era, rather that the best of the past has been judiciously retained and usefully built upon, so that one is lacking none of the modern amenities that are givens in the present day.  The superb taste in the art that graces not just the lobbies, but also the upper halls demonstrates a sophistication that is almost unknown in almost all hotels.  Oh!, and the shops nearby are some of the best in the city.  It's one of the few places in Barcelona where I can forgive a lack of Gaudi-esque touches.",5,2016,10,27
59,Central and Comfortable,"Hotel Astoria is a traditional hotel situated right in Eixcample. We had an executive room on the 7th floor, with a lovely private terrace. The room is large and has a private room with a large seating area.
The breakfast room could be larger, there were many guests there that time we stayed in the hotel.
We ate one of these days breakfast on our patio, it was lovely.
In the lobby there is a computer for guest use. To operate it should be Spanish, translated not into English. Nor are there any printer attached to it.",5,2016,10,24
59,Commendable location.,"We drove into Barcelona from Valencia. The hotel was easy to find and traffic was pretty straight forward. The receptionist allow us to park the car in front of the hotel for twenty minutes while we checked in and unloaded our bags. That was fine as we were returning the hired car that evening. The room is a little small but the location and service was good. For those who aren't too particular about sizes of rooms and bathrooms, I would say it's a good hotel to stay in. Although there are plenty of restaurants to choose nearby and many good shopping within walking distance ( in fact many other tourist attractions are within 30 minutes walking or slightly more), the hotel is situated in a pretty peaceful and quiet street. 
And, housekeeping did a good job with the daily cleaning. For those who've been traveling a long time like us,  my husband found a good laundry nearby - that made him happy.

59,"Good location, comfortable stay","Stayed at Astoria for 2 nights for #VMWorld2016, price was correct given the seasonality, location is very good, near av. diagonal. Personnel is very friendly and open to requests. Room was standard one, spacious, clean and silent thanks to good isolation (even if it was on  road side)",4,2016,10,21
59,Good location a little away from the hustle and bustle!,This hotel was ideal for us.  Two couples travelling together - primarily to visit the Barcelona Boat Show.  It is perfectly possible to walk to La Rambla from the hotel but its probably a good 30 minutes.  The hotel was clean and the rooms were perfectly adequate although fairly small.  Our room (421) overlooked a void with no view but then we were not in it much so it didn't really matter to us - at least we could open the window and have fresh air.  The bathroom was well appointed with a shower over the bath with fantastic pressure.  My personal hate is hairdyers in the bathroom as this means only one person can use the bathroom at a time for all functions but that is my only negative comment really.  The bar is a bit soulless - we never saw anyone in there but they do make a fantastic gin and tonic.,4,2016,10,19
59,Good location,"Whilst on a map it looks away from the city center, shopping, sightseeing, restaurants & bars are all close nearby. We walked everywhere to the main attractions Ramblas, Picasso museum etc and where we couldn't get the underground wasn't far away. The hotel was clean and rooms were good size. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Whilst it claims to have a pool, it would describe more as a big bath!! The roof terrace is a good spot though.",4,2016,10,18
59,Great hotel,"We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights, the lobby is so nice and authentic Spanish decor, the rooms are a great size, comfy bed, its a 10-15 mins walk to the underground and is in a lovely area, staff were very nice and pleasant, its about 30euro for a taxi from the airport and also a note that if you book it on their website you will get a free bottle of wine.
It was too cold for us to use the pool and its also tiny, so if your booking for a pool dont book here.
Do not buy the breakfast on the booking site as its 15euro each and when you get there they offer you breakfast for 10euro each, we preferred to get our own breakfast in a coffee shop close by called El Fornet, great value. Lovely bar close by too called Monkey Factory",4,2016,10,14
59,Classical and intimate city hotell with good comfort,"A nice and quiet hotel within walking distance (20 minutes) to Placa Catalonia. The best way to reach the hotel from airport is tube or taxi. Good resception service, and discrete piano music in early afternoon. 
Different room sizes, medium sized. Comfortable beds, and lot of pillows.
Nice bathroom, but not separate shower. The shower combined with bath tube.
Room service and cleaning excellent.   We did not have breakfast.
Nice little roof terrace with swimming pool (warmed).
Lot of eating places around.",4,2016,10,13
59,Barcelona after the beach ,"After a week at Palma Nova for Scuba diving and a beach break we decided to visit Barcelona.. 
The hotel Astoria was recommended to us and we were not disappointed.
Perfect old school character but with modern facilities including small roof top pool and sitting area .. 
We didn't use restaurant or bar but both looked nice but can you eat cheaper at cafes directly outside .. 
Staff great .. friendly and very helpful at all hours .. 

A nice clean and comfortable hotel well within reach of transport and tourist attractions .. 

Would definitely use again . ",4,2016,10,13
59,Kind staff. Clean.,"Good location, easy access to public transport. Nice room, clean. Noise street at weekend. Good breakfast. Welcoming staff, helpful and friendly. Great shopping possibilities in the area.There are restaurant with tasty local food around.",4,2016,10,13
59,Decent stay,"Nice looking hotel, amazingly friendly staff, particularly on check-in. The room was nice, although it was too single beds pushed together to make a king which is not quite the same as having a king bed! Breakfast spread was tasty and was refreshed regularly. The only thing I didn't like at breakfast was the juice. It wasn't fresh fruit juice, more like a sugary cordial with water. In the bedroom a couple of minor things I noticed - the hair dryer did not work and each day when the room was cleaned, they did not replace the vanity kit that I used, even when I had used all of its contents.

But all in all, I liked it a lot. Nice vibe, nicely decorated and the location was fabulous. I would go back.",4,2016,10,09
59,Great hospitality ,"I came with my friend .for 2 nights .
Hotel located in super easy to all transportation.  very modern .staff was super helpful. And many thx to nilson from F.B .and reception  staff they are very nice and professional of handling  complain .apart that room wz king bed while we are 2 mans !!

59,"5 nights visit to Hotel Astoria, Barcelona.","The Hotel Astoria is delightful, we thoroughly enjoyed our 5 days there. The staff were excellent and the situation excellent too. There are plenty of good places to eat nearby and a bus stop across the road from the hotel. The open top 'tourist bus', is just around the corner too.",5,2016,10,02
59,This is NOT a 3⭐️⭐️⭐️,"This hotel should be a 4⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ at least, the staf are brilliant they cannot du enough for you, the manager Pepe was especially good to us he invited us to dinner on him and gave us two breakfast on him as well. It was my birthday while we where there and when we got back from a day out there was a bottle of wine in a ice bucket in are room, the hotel its self was beautiful with art work all over the hotel the room we where in was a basic room but it was perfect. We stayed for 3weeks and could not fault it, the location could not have been better easy walking distance to bus and metro stops, but we walked to places and found it better. We would recommend this hotel most highly. Julie and Tony would like to express are thanks and appreciation to the manager and staf for a great stay in there hotel.",5,2016,09,30
59,Very helpful staff and a handy location,The hotel was ideal for us as it had parking just over the road and even though we arrived late in the evening we were given a warm welcome. A concierge helped us to park and assisted us carrying our bags as well as giving us maps of the city and some advice on our stay. We didn't eat at the hotel but the room was very comfortable and well located to get to all the main sights - as well as for the hop on/hop off bus!,4,2016,09,28
59,Lovely Hotel,"Stayed here for 5 nights and honestly couldn't fault it, lovely, clean friendly hotel. Rooftop pool was a bonus & great for relaxing after a busy few days exploring the city. 
Location is great if you are happy to walk, La Rambla is easy to get to, prob half hourish to get to the top & then carry on to the marina. We also had a nice walk back from Sagrada Familia, about 45min, but lots to see on the way.
The metro is about 10min walk, but easy enough as Barcelona is pretty flat.

Thanks for a great stay Astoria.
(Tip: if you want to do a tour of the city go with the free walking tours, honestly the best & most informative, we did the gothic & censored Barcelona tours, fantastic)",5,2016,09,24
59,Couldn't have asked for better,"What a beautiful hotel. The location is perfect (walking distance of everywhere for those who like to walk, if not, great transport links). The marble reception is an amazing first impression. 

The staff were always happy to help, always smiling, not matter what time of day or night.

We stayed in a twin room, couldn't fault it. And the rooftop pool was definitely a bonus.

Overall, we loved the hotel and will 100% stay there again on our return to such a beautiful city. ",5,2016,09,23
59,Great choice!,"Gem hotel in Barcelona. I have been in Barcelona multiple times but this hotel stunned me.
It has a fine swimming pool and the view is the best.
We got a free upgrade to a suite, lovely view too.

Thank you for such a great experience!",5,2016,09,19
59,3* hotel with kind of vintage/old ,"It's a 3* at medium distance between  a vintage and old hotel. It has a nice collection of posters of commercials from the late XIX and beginning of XX century as part of the furnitures in the halls. 

My double room was small, in the same way of the small hotels in Paris. I found also the bed small for a 6feet person but the price wasn't small, again it recalls me the parisien hotels. 

The maintenance could be better, my room had a crack in the wall (see picture attached). 

The staff was the best part of the hotel, not best I've ever seen but they were polite and also have this kind of catalonian ironic sense of humour. 

Bottom line, my feeling was that I should search better my hotel for the price I've paid. 
",3,2016,09,17
59,I'd stay here again,Front desk staff were very helpful. Room (228) was clean and quiet. Our window (as with many rooms in the hotel) looked into an internal light shaft. The lobby is old school marble and the guest rooms are modern (think IKEA). We didn't avail ourselves of the 15 euro nice looking full breakfast buffet because we could meet our more modest needs (coffee and pastry or quiche) for 4 euro at one of many cafes within a 90-second walk of the hotel. The location is on the edge of the upscale Eixample neighborhood and we felt safe walking in all directions. Lots of good shopping and restaurants in easy walking distance.  ,4,2016,09,17
59,Booked direct and got a great deal!!!,"Stayed for 3 nights, as we had booked direct with the hotel, via their own website got a great price, free entry to the Egyptian Museum and a free full size bottle of cava!!
Last stayed at this hotel 15 years ago - since then it has seen a make over in the rooms but the level of service has been maintained. Advertised as a 3 star hotel, but always has been more on a par with a 4 star hotel as far as I am concerned. Location worked well for us, as we enjoyed being slightly out of the tourist belt, but was still only a 15 minute walk to Plac de catalunya. The swimming pool/terrace on the roof was a great place to cool down in the late afternoons before hitting the streets again for tapas!!",5,2016,09,17
59,A Good Choice ,"We were well satisfied with Hotel Astoria's location, service and facilities.  We've paid a lot more and gotten a lot less.  Astoria is really close to the five star rating. 

We arrived from the airport, via the metro.  Emailed directions sent by the hotel were spot on.  We had no trouble finding Astoria even in the dark.  Two staff members were on the desk, including a trainee.  Both were pleasant, informative, and English-speaking. 

The room was quite nice:  attractive furnishings, adequate closets, comfortable bed, modern and spotless bath, windows that opened for fresh air (if desired) and a stocked mini-bar/fridge.

The breakfast was a slight disappointment.  For a hotel of its size and character, we expected eggs and some meat (fish) besides pork.  We overheard a server tell another guests that eggs were only served on weekdays.  

The other disappointment were the fitness and pool facilities.  The pool is smaller than it appears in the ads.  The gym was hot and stuffy.  For all practical purposes, it wasn't usable in hit weather.  

We'd probably stay at Hotel Astoria again because of the great staff, rooms and excellent location.  ",4,2016,09,11
59,Astoria Barcelona,"Excellent service, very helpful friendly staff, loved our stay. Good location, great bar within 20m of the door, supermarket 50m away. Bustling area but nothing to suggest this when inside the hotel. Pool and terrace on the roof with great views over the city.
Would definitely use this hotel again.",5,2016,09,09
59,Pleasurable,"Hotel very clean and warm - welcoming the interior is very contemporary and beautiful which suited my liking, enjoyed viewing at the different portraits on the walls thought that this gave it a really nice touch!

When I arrived with my partner we had a very nice welcome from the receptionist at the desk and all staff were very polite through out the time we stayed. I would definitely recommend this hotel for a mini break away as it offers amazing views of Barcelona itself. 

Everything was on the door step, beautiful neighbourhood full of friendly residents. 

Would pick out something though - we had to change rooms due to excessive amounts of noise couldn't really make out what the noise was but it didn't sound pleasant, more or less sounded like an aeroplane taking off. But all was okay as the receptionist took this on board and moved us promptly and efficiently! 

Praise to one of the restaurant and bar team members for giving me a bucket of ice and delivering it to my room thought that was very generous of him! 
 
Overall beautiful hotel and will definitely be returning. 
  
 ",4,2016,09,05
59,Nice Hotel for a short break in the city,"Hotel is in a nice location, very pleasant and safe neighborhood with some nice restaurants around. An easy walk to the top of La Rambla or to a metro station. 

Room was very clean and the staff are very friendly - even walking us around the corner to show us a restaurant to eat in on the first night we arrived.",4,2016,09,01
59,Boyfriends Birthday,"I took my boyfriend to Barcelona for his birthday and I chose to stay here. The location was very good. A good hours walk to the beach, safe to say my feet were sore after. We decided to use a hop on hop off bus and get a 2 day pass, definitely a must!! The breakfast isn't cheap. We were impressed with our rooms every time we went back, very clean. In all honesty we didn't have much to do with the hotel or the staff. We didn't realise until we were getting a taxi back to the airport that there was a taxi rank opposite the hotel... We always walked onto the main street to get a taxi! I'd stay again, purely because of the location as we were pretty central. ",4,2016,08,29
59,Travelling in style,"A very nice chic hotel in the centre of Barcelona. The staff is incredibly friendly, the price is reasonable, the service is of a high quality. La Rambla is just in the vicinity ;) There are lots of cute coffee places/cafes just nearby. Really loved my stay here and will come back for sure. Barcelona is one of my favourite places on this planet, and this hotel makes your stay in this fabulous city even better. Thank you!",5,2016,08,17
59,"Clean and Well-kept hotel, Friendly and Helpful Staff","I only stayed here for three nights, but the hotel greatly enhanced my stay in Barcelona. The hotel is only short walk from La Rambla and the metro. Breakfast is served in the hotel for a fair price and hotel staff was extremely well-informed and useful in helpful us plan our itinerary for our short stay. Rooms were clean and tasteful, with a mini fridge, desk, and television. Bring your own conditioner.",5,2016,08,17
59,Lovely Hotel,"very friendly, well located to the metro, food was excellent, rooms cleaned to a high standard, really enjoyed our stay will be back as good value for money,  great to have a kettle coffee tea making facilities, Some really good restaurants about and bars, check out some of the museums too.",4,2016,08,15
59,"Beautiful hotel, excellent value for money!","This is a beautiful hotel and excellent value for money, I can not believe it has only three stars. Nice modern rooms with lovely en suite facilities. The bonus is the outdoor space on the roof, small but really make a difference.",5,2016,08,12
59,Friendly hotel with good local eateries,"A welcoming hotel with friendly helpful staff. Art deco in appearance, the hotel has its own small art gallery and a wonderful spiral staircase. Rooms were kept clean and had double glazing and air conditioning. The bathroom was well equipped with toiletries and had bath, shower and bidet. Situated near some good restaurants and bars in a street running off the Diagonal avenue, the hotel had good metro and bus links to tourist areas. It was quiet and conducive to a peaceful night's sleep.
Every member of staff was extremely helpful and even gave us complimentary tickets to the Egyptian museum, well worth a visit! We would stay here again.",4,2016,08,10
59,Beautiful boutique hotel,Very friendly and helpful staff.  Well located  close to Diagonal Metro. Lovely artisan bakery opposite for breakfast. Clean rooms and bathrooms but room safes were a bit 'delicate'.  Rooftop view is lovely. Could do with kettle and coffee/tea making facilities in the room. Handy having a fridge. Bar makes lovely coffee. ,5,2016,08,05
59,Never again ,"The hotel is placed in a central area so it's comfortable to visit the town. 
Old building and old rooms, mostly 80' style.
At our arrival they assigned us a small, dirty, old room in the upper floor. The room was not even reachable with the elevator so we had to climb the stairs.
The room was in a word disgusting!
Very disappointed we claimed for a different accommodation so they moved us to a bigger apartment.
We didn't pay the breakfast as the next morning we checked out the food and there was not fresh food while the cost was euro 15,00 each! 
Never again.",3,2016,08,04
59,Excellent hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"This is an excellent hotel with extremely friendly and helpful staff.
The hotel is close to shops and many good restaurants and cafes. While it is not particularly near to the main tourist attractions, it is well served by local transport.",5,2016,08,01
59,Great Hotel,"My daughter and I loved this hotel, an amazing array of art.  All of the staff are so welcoming and hospitable.  The rooms and rest of hotel are very clean and all of the rooms have a small fridge - which is handy to keep your water in, there is a supermarket just around the corner and many places to eat.  In addition, the pillows are very comfortable and clean, crisp bed linen, also the bathroom towels are a good size, and the shower is great!
The roof top terrace at the hotel is great, ideal for a dip to cool off and relax.  The wifi is free at the hotel for 7 days and works well.    
We had no trouble walking around and felt quite safe, we also tried the public transport - there is a bus stop just across the road from the hotel where you can take a bus straight to Las Ramblas/Cataluyna for around 2 euros each.  We also used the metro, which is a good form of transport and well directed.  We visited Park Güell, would recommend to go earlier - around 10am before too many people arrive.  There are various street sellers just in the park selling trinkets, keyrings, fans, paintings etc and frozen bottles of water (1 euro)  which are refreshing! (all cheaper here than Las Ramblas!)  We took a taxi from the hotel to the park which cost 10 euros.  Overall, the hotel is in a great position within easy access to many places.  We would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,07,30
59,Great Stay,We stayed here for 3 nights as 2 couples before joining a cruise . We found the hotel to be clean and the staff helpful . Our room was great the only thing missing for me was a full length mirror . We didn't eat at the hotel so can't comment on the food but the cafe's and bars nearby were great and reasonably priced too . It's a good walk into the centre of Barcelona which we enjoyed doing but if that's an issue the hotel would be happy to call you a taxi which we found to be very reasonable when using them. I would definitely return to the Hotel Astoria if I ever have the pleasure of returning to Beautiful Barcelona  .,4,2016,07,27
59,worth 4 stars,I stayed in this hotel when I was in Barcelona for a business trip. It's a beautiful hotel with plenty of art deco features. There is a bus stop in front of the hotel that takes you straight to pl. Catalunya. Breakfast is excellent. Plenty of nice Bars and Restaurants in the area. The rooms are not big but who wants to stay in the room when you can go and explore Barcelona?,5,2016,07,25
59,Good but not outstanding ,"Overall hotel was good for a 3star and the price we paid but we marked it down because the twin superior room we booked and had paid for was not available when we checked in so we spent one night out of 3 in a very small double room.  Although the night manager was very pleasant he wasn't apologetic but did offer to resolve things the next day. 

Pool and roof top terrace small but was to be expected and was fine for our needs. Location good but not very convenient particularly if you have mobility issues or want to be very close to specific things. walking distance to everywhere if you're prepared for a long walk in the heat!! 

We had breakfast there on the first morning but frankly it was expensive -15€ or €10 if we had eaten there each day. The menu indicated eggs but it was entirely self serve - including tea/coffee and there were no waiting staff visible to order them from until we were about to leave - maybe luck of the draw but fairly poor service for €15

",3,2016,07,20
59,Nice hotel with very friendly staff,"I have stayed in this hotel twice now. It strikes me every time that the staff is extremely friendly when welcoming you to the hotel. They check if everything is fine, and always propose to help if you have a request. Very good price/quality ratio !",4,2016,07,17
59,Very mixed experince and a warning,"All the things you will read in other reviews are true. It is well located, the staff are attentive, it does have a pleasant old fashioned ambience and the picture collection is terrific- it really is. But the rooms are small and dark, the walls are paper thin, the wifi is rubbish and the pool is the size of a postage stamp.

But my visit was marred by a wholly preventable accident which the hotel does nothing to warn people about and did not attempt to compensate me for. I was interested in the pictures and looked at all of them including those in small ante room just beyond the main entrance. The pictures are displayed in pairs parallel to the ceiling- except tat after a certain point they are not parallel with the floor. There is staircase l did not notice as l was looking at the pictures and fell down the marble staircase. I think l am lucky l did not break my neck. I have come back from hospital in the UK. Luckily there is no internal damage but l am in a lot of pain. I was not x rayed but it is possible l have cracked ribs.

The staff were sympathetic but despite asking l did not see this recorded in an accident book and no sign appeared warning people of the hazard, nor was l offered any compensation. I think the hotel simply does not appreciate they have created an accident waiting to happen and do not really know how to react when there is an accident. At no point did l get the impression my accident will result in any change. That is why l have given a one star rating-  something l would never normally do. The welfare of paying customers should be a top priority in any hotel- this fell below the standard l would expect in any establishment",1,2016,07,14
59,Excellent location,The location is great! near top night clubs but far enough to avoid the noise at night.  Also great coffee shops and spots to stop by for a drink and tapas after a long hot day. The guys at the reception are very helpful and provided excellent guidance on places/beaches to go as the tourist beach downtown was too crowded. The hotel is just 10 minutes from Barcelota beach and Las Ramblas and the taxi charged us only 6 euros!  The surroundings are very safe!,5,2016,07,12
59,Overpriced ,"I staid here 3 nights with my husband. For what we paid I was definitely expecting more - the room  and the bed too were really tiny; the view from the window was a nice big wall, meaning no natural light of course; bathroom was very small too. The rooftop pool quite sad looking to be honest. 
The hotel itself looks nice but I wouldn't come back for that price.",2,2016,07,11
59,Misleading,Having visited Barcelona many times and staying in various hotels I have to say that this hotel was the worst. It is VERY misleading and be very careful when booking. I paid an average of £100 a night for five nights. When we arrived it was quite late and we had booked a 'superior' room'.....we was shown to a 'studio' room on the top floor of the hotel with a bedroom window that was 5foot away from the rooftop pool (if you can call it that) the pictures online are shot at an angle so looked a lot bigger than it actually is. The room itself was horrendous. It had damp patches under the windows by the pool and there was a funny odour. There was a flight of stairs up to another room that had just a chair in it? The air con unit was from the 70's and didn't work. There was no safe that we could see either. The room was tiny. I immediately went down to reception and they did move us to another room. This had two single beds and the safe did not work. We stayed there the night and then the next morning I went back to reception and they then moved us double room. The pictures on the website must have been taken a good few years ago as the rooms are very shabby. The bathrooms flooded every time we took a shower. The housekeeping staff were useless. We put the following not disturb sign on the door and on several times staff just knocked and walked straight in....one offering us a chocolate? A little bazaar. Reception tried to charge me 50 euros for a dangerous leaking kettle even though I had emailed regarding tea and coffee making facilities and should I bring my own kettle (I love a coffee!). But again this was not included in the 'superior'room'. I would avoid this hotel at all costs.  We had a group of screaming young girls next door....I give up. I need another holiday to get over this. Hotel staff are useless and many times only a guy of about 17-18 on duty who seemed very inexperienced. My advice is to avoid -go stay at the 'axel' hotel a couple of blocks away.,1,2016,07,10
59,"Nice hotel, hommage to Artist Opisso","Stayed July and was a nice place. I was pleasantly surprised that it net our needs. Rooms were small BUT they had a bathtub big enough to soak in nice hot water, the air conditioning worked. Also nice rooftop that had small swimming pool. Breakfast was also decent. Enjoyed the 'tour' of works of the artist Opisso. Basically comfortable, affordable, GREAT location-- could walk to plaza Catalunya and Passseige de Gracia. With amenities as well. Would stay again! Shout out to Pepe who did tour;).",4,2016,07,09
59,Excellent stay,"Stayed for a couple of nights and hotel was great. Nice little plunge style pool on the roof, great after a hard days sightseeing! The guys on reception were superb, special mention to Lewis. And Daryl at the bar. Bar is bit pricey but it's a hotel in Bar Leon's so no surprise. Room was internal facing and quite small but great shower! All you need for a city break. I'd recommend popping out the door for breakfast, turn left out the door, first right then patisserie on your right called L'Artesa. Great chocolate croissants, coffees, Danishes etc... For dinner just look for what you like, it's all here! Enjoy.",4,2016,07,07
59,Weekend away,"The overall stay at Astoria was amazing, it's in a peaceful location but only a 5 minute walk to the main high street in Barcelona. 

The rooms were cleaned daily with fresh towels and bedding and the room itself was immaculate. 

There was loads of little restaurants to eat at near by and a pizza place opposite the hotel where you could eat in or takeaway and have a glass of beer while you wait. 

However, the pool terrace is very small with only 5 sun beds, it says the pool opens at 11am, but get there earlier as we arrived at 10:40 and it was already open and all the sun loungers were taken. However it does only cost 10€ in a taxi to get to the beach/port which is beautiful. 

We did have a problem with our room, we arrived at 11:30pm and checked in. We had booked a double superior room, however when we got to our room there was twin beds and the room did not look like the superior room on the website.
When we went down to raise our concern the member of staff on reception was not helpful at all. He told us he had no double superior rooms and said the hotel was full, he seemed offended that we had a problem. Eventually half an hour later his colleague showed us to a room which was already occupied then finally to a double room, which seemed like a standard room. The member of staff said this is the only double room they have and we can sort out a room change in the morning after people had checked out. 
We went downstairs to go to the supermarket (which is right outside the hotel) and thought we'd just check that they had a superior room for us in the morning. However the member of staff said that the room we had been given was a superior room and even showed us on the computer, even though it had no separate seating area that was specified on the website. In the morning we decided to not waste more time changing rooms as the room we had was nice and we were only there for 3 days. So if you book a superior room it won't look like it does on the website. 

Apart from the room situation our stay at Astoria was great and we would definitely go back, it's in a great location and has everything you need nearby, we really enjoyed ourselves. 

",4,2016,07,05
59,Great location,"The room was fine.  The breakfast is adequate but not great.  The staff in the reception is helpful.
The amenities are minimal in the bathroom.  The tub has no handle and could be dangerous if a person is not careful getting in and out of the tub.
The location however is great.  You are in the heart of the city.  Can walk to many attractions",4,2016,06,18
59,Stunning!,"This was a great place to stay and check out Barcelona. The staff was great and the hotel was perfect! We wondered around and had a great time. The room was clean and well equipped, but no AC. I would stay again in the future.",5,2016,06,15
59,Boyfriends 21st,"We came to Barcelona for my boyfriends 21st in January for a family holiday. We stayed for 3 nights and it was perfect for what we needed! Location is brilliant and near by to all the restaurants/local shops. Not to mention a 5 minute walk from the tube which allows you to get around the city really easily! If your looking for luxury I personally wouldn't chose this hotel as it was more convenient than luxurious, but definitely worth a stay if your looking for somewhere nice and in a good location!!",5,2016,06,11
59,Good location,"The location of this hotel is perfect. Close to several metro stations and also situated at walking distance to some main attractions of the city (Casa Bathlo, Sagrada Familia). There are a lot of good restaurants in the area and no tourist traps.
The hotel, on the other hand, could use some improvements. The double bed is composed by two single beds. The toiletries and the items of the minibar were not replaced once finished. Also, there were no blankets in the room. I think you are supposed to use the bed covers instead. 
Overall, the price of the room can be considered unjustified for a 3 stars hotel.",3,2016,05,31
59,Great hotel ,"Visited this for a 3 night stay in a superior double (internal) room. Hotel was brilliant , well located , fabulous, friendly staff and great service. Highly recommend will definitely return. 

Only small negative was the wi-fi - although free somehow managed to block apps which provided you with your own to etc.  BBC World news was a little boring. ",5,2016,05,26
59,A most enjoyable stay,"Quaint hotel in walking distance of the Rambla and other sights. The hotel staff were all friendly and helpful. We upgraded our room after the first night as fourth floor street side was a little noisy with traffic. Had a very reasonable quote for a room with a balcony on the 7th floor which was quieter and had a great bad and a dressing room giving more bedroom space. Room was very clean with lovely towels and sheets. 

Didn't try the breakfast as 15 euros a person was a bit excessive and there were plenty of places to walk out to and enjoy the morning air. The Bar Paris is a good place to go, friendly, great food throughout the day. 

All in all a good experience. Yes the rooms are old and the facilities aren't modern, but if you want that then look elsewhere. What you get is a quaint and enjoyable stay in a very pleasant hotel.",4,2016,05,25
59,Touring the city,"The hotel is extremely well situated for getting around the city, in a nice quiet, safe part of the town. The hotel is very clean, the staff friendly and a perfectly good buffet breakfast is available if you don't want to leave the hotel.
It is very noisy, as are the majority of Spanish hotels, the sound of people walking around late at night with high heels on wooden floors drives me crazy. But that's normal in most other places too.  The towels in the bathroom are luxurious and I love that!
It served us well and we enjoyed our time there, would we come back, yes I think we would most definitely!",4,2016,05,25
59,Truth about Airconditioning,The hotel was clean and rooms were nice. Front desk staff helpful. The aircon in our room automatically switches off at 12am and comes back only at 9am the next day. When we complained the first day I was told by one staff that the generator has been set up like that. When I spoke to another front desk person that same evening he denied such practise and said he will get it sorted. It still happened the next night. The staff did offer alternative rooms and as they were small we did not move. In all my travelling I had not encountered this. Thus for the next 5 nights we had to leave our window open when we slept as it was stuffy with no aircon. Another issue is the bathtubs/shower do not have an emergency handle to hold on if one slipped. There were no hot water/ tea making facilities in the room. The hotel is good if they can overcome these shortcomings,3,2016,05,19
59,Ideal short break,Ideal place to stay for a visit to Barcelona. Rooms very clean and comfortable lovely white linen plenty of nice soft white bathtowels helpful and friendly staff. Bus stop just opposite the hotel takes straight to the centre of barcelona no problems at all what more can you ask for.,5,2016,05,18
59,Only a one night stay...,"I took pot luck and booked online, pleasantly suprised. A very elegant hotel just 10 minutes walk from Las Ramblas. The room was well appointed and the shower excellent.
A lovely Bar with generous quantities of Gin in the G&T!
Would certainly use this hotel again.",5,2016,05,18
59,A great place to stay at if you wanna be close to La Rambla,"The best hotel from all perspectives: Location (it's close to all important destinations -La Rambla, Metro stations, Sagrada Familia, Camp Nou), value for money, staff are very helpful -esp. Senor Manuel. I will definitely stay there in my next visit. Strongly recommended for all types of travelers.

No Negative feedback. However, the only setback is wireless -not available in rooms- you must pay for it",5,2016,05,17
59,"Excellent service, great people and very nice location.","Let me start by saying that the service was EXCELLENT since day one of our arrival. The staff were very polite and helpful with all our questions. My wife and I stayed there for two weeks and they always treated us in the best possible way. 

My mother in law was also staying at the same hotel and she mentioned the service was great. Maria, the housekeeper on the 5th floor was extremely friendly and helpful at all times. We spent a night at a different location and she was immediately concerned that she had not seen us during a whole day. She was legitimately concerned and wanted to know if we were OK. The next day she knocked at my mother in law's door to make sure we were all OK, and to ask if we needed anything. 

Maria Jose, the lady in charge of the bar/kitchen in the afternoons was also amazing. Gave us plenty of tips for places to visit during our stay and shared great stories with us. We were honestly feeling at home with all the nice people and the great service. We would come down do the bar to have some coffee and a couple of drinks at the end of the day and she always welcomed us with a big smile.

Now, to the actual review of the hotel. In my opinion, the location is excellent. We had plenty of places to eat at a walking distance (some of them were actually next door). Places such as Gaudi's La Pedrera or Casa Batllo are about 15-20 minutes away if you decide to walk. We visited Camp Nou, La Sagrada Familia, Park Guell, amongst others, and all these places were easy to reach by bus or subway. The area itself is on the quiet side, with plenty of coffee spots to choose.

The rooms were on the small side but always clean and well organized. There is a small fridge, a safe, a desk, closet, and a small TV. We honestly did not need anything else in there as we spent most of the time outside getting to know the city. The hotel also has a small rooftop pool and small sauna, which are perfect for a relaxing afternoon with views of the city.

The reception staff was great and offered their assistance at all times. I wish I would have caught the names of all the helpful people but THANKS to all. You made our stay very pleasant and we will be recommending this hotel for sure. Looking forward to visiting you again!

59,"Friendly staff, comfortable room ","My husband and I stayed here for three nights and loved it. The staff spoke English well and were incredibly helpful. The room was very comfortable with everything you need for a great stay. The roof spa is also lovely and has a great view. 
Would stay here again! ",5,2016,05,07
59,I would book again,"This hotel was suggested to me by a colleague due to its closeness to some of the meetings I would have in town. But right from the beggining, the Staff was so considerate, accomodating and friendly, that i liked it. The location is great! Close to some of the relevant public trans´portation lines, you can access virtually every part of Barcelona in little time. I booked the same hotel in a matter of few days, again, and AGAIN, I got a great sense of delivery from the staff from the moment you walk in. The rooms were comfortable in both occasions.",5,2016,04,21
59,Good Location,"Booked a superior room here for a short break. The staff were friendly and very helpful when I needed directions for getting around and all spoke English well enough. The room although very clean was not as described on their website. Mine was definitely not soundproofed. Traffic noise was quite bad at night and I could hear the shower in the room next door, hence the average score.  Good buffet breakfast,or cooked on request and good location for shops, restaurants, tour buses etc.",3,2016,04,21
59,"Bag""napping""","Watch out as security is worrisome... A lady's bag was stolen during breakfast by a non resident guest pretending to have bfast. Housekeeping also tends to barge in on you uninvited but ever so quick to offer ""pardone"" meaning sorry in Spanish. ",2,2016,04,21
59,Super hotel - excellent value,"We booked this after reading other reviews on Trip Advisor no also because it seemed extremely reasonable. The Metro is about 8 minutes ( Provençal ) or 15 mins ( Diagonal ) walk away and there are plenty of restaurants nearby to suit all budgets. We liked the ones on Carrer Enric ? best. The cake shop just round the corner from the hotel was yummy and there were several little cafes nearby serving excellent coffee, croissants and fresh juice, so don't bother paying €17 for the hotel breakfast.",5,2016,04,20
59,A beautiful hotel and great location,We stayed here for 4 days and the service was excellent.  They could not be more helpful from the word go. They gave us a map of barcelona straight away and recommended a superb tapas restaurant.A great location with a metro station just around the corner.They printed our boarding passes for the return flight. I would recommend this hotel to anybody thinking of staying in barcelona,5,2016,04,08
59,Anniversary Celebrations in Barcelona,Our stay at the hotel was brilliant.  All members of staff were friendly and approachable and quick to put you at your ease. Staff could speak English sufficiently enough to answer any questions that we had or explain things to us.  We took advantage of the breakfast promotion that was offered to us at check-in and also had lunch at the restaurant on our last day - the food choices were excellent and the service spot on. Rooms were clean and nicely decorated. It is a little away from the centre of Barcelona but once we got our bearings the walk only took about 15 minutes.  Would recommend the Astoria for anyone visiting Barcelona,5,2016,04,02
59,Should be 4 star,"Just returned from a five night break with my daughter at Hotel Astoria. The location of the hotel is approx 20 mins walk from las rambles and 10 mins from nearest metro which is Diagonal , therefore quite easy to get around. There is also a taxi rank opposite the hotel , we chose to get a taxi back to the airport which cost 35 euros. 
The hotel is very clean and rooms warm and extremely comfortable. The reception staff are very friendly and always there to help with any enquiries. 
We stayed on a room only basis however did have a look at the dining area . Again it was very clean and the breakfast looked lovely for anyone who is thinking of having Bb .
I would definitely return to this hotel and recommend it to others. The hotel is rated as 3 star but I have stayed in 4 star hotels that have not been up to this standard. 
I would recommend for anyone visiting tourist attractions in Barcelona to get tickets online before going . We wasted a lot of time queuing for tickets . ",5,2016,04,02
59,"Friendly, informative staff","I decided to go to Barcelona for my Birthday and this hotel was well within my budget. Very cheap and the staff were friendly and helpful at giving directions. A little bit out of the way, in terms of it being a good walk to the Ramblas and other tourist attractions, but it is easy to navigate yourself around. Also, has good public transport links around, if you don't want to walk everywhere like I did.

The hotel room itself was nice and had everything you needed. ",4,2016,03,29
59,Beautiful Historical Hotel,"I decided to stay at Hotel Astoria for 2 nights for a birthday weekend and for the price I was not expecting much. When we arrived I was shocked at how beautiful the place was, It is located just 5 minutes away (in taxi) from las Ramblas which was perfect. 

We didn't plan our trip much but the receptionist was very helpful and helped us plan some daily activities and he was very helpful.",5,2016,03,28
59,"Average hotel, nice staff","- Air conditioning does not work
- toilet sink is draining very slowly
- bed is only about 185 long?! 

Staff is nice and polite. 
Rooms are looking nice
Roof balcony is nice
Free pc/internet at lobby
Free wifi (7days) at hotell",3,2016,03,27
59,Charming Hotel with history,"Hotel Astoria is located in a good location, fairly quiet but good eating places nearby and within walking distance of the city sights.  The hotel has lots of history within its walls.  My friends and I used this our main base for 3 days.  

We chose to eat outside for breakfast each day for the variety.  We discovered the rooftop on the last day. Check it out for its great views back over the city.  

I’d be very comfortable recommending the hotel to other travellers. ",4,2016,03,13
59,Good Value,"This is obviously an old building, however the bedrooms, whilst being fairly basic, have been sympathetically refurbished to a very pleasing modern standard. Rooms include a flat screen TV, mini bar and safety deposit box.
The building is part of a square of buildings. Our room was to the inward facing side of the block, so the outlook wasn’t brilliant, however as the room was only used as the base for a mini-break, we weren’t intending to spend time looking out of the window so it didn’t matter, and it was probably quieter than a room facing the road..
The public areas had retained an old fashioned original feel, with old paintings, pictures and theatre posters adorning the walls, and with quirky little rooms leading off. Breakfast was buffet style with cold meats, cheeses, fruit, and cereals. If you fancied a hot breakfast, the staff would cook bacon, eggs, sausages etc., on request.
The Astoria is situated a few hundred yards from the Diagonal Metro Station, and, although it doesn’t serve evening meals, there are plenty of bars and restaurants within a short distance if you don’t fancy going into the City centre.
To summarise, this hotel is well located and provides a good standard of room and service at a reasonable price.",4,2016,03,10
59,Quiet hotel in a great location,"Loved our stay here for 5 nights. Very quiet location, but many restaurants in the neighbourhood,  and close to metro/trains and buses. You can be at Place de Catalunya in 12 minutes for less than €1,and terminal 1 for €5 in just under an hour. Felt very safe strolling the area even after midnight. Would definitely stay there again.",4,2016,03,06
59,Short stay,"Excellent bijou hotel in the center of Barcelona, clean well serviced rooms all ensuit, polite friendly staff and parking arrangement with a secure car park across the road.just off the Avenue Diagonal getting in and out of town is easy. Walking distance to La Rambles,  Sagrada Familia Cathedral etc. Open top tourist bus route passes by evry 10 mins or so if the walking is getting too much.",4,2016,03,04
59,Stockholmo-girls-trip,"The pool on the ruftop, was a perfect space!
We had one day by our selfs in sun-chairs.
Nice personal tripadvices from the reception, like plaza Espania galleria with elevator to the weiw. They allso booked a nice Spa-visit in town. Ok breakfast. Good service to book taxi to the AirPort. ",4,2016,02,22
59,I couldn't believe it was a 3 star?,"When booking an affordable three star hotel, one's expectations should be in line.  I thought it was good value for money and wasn't too fussed with staying in luxury.  I was most surprised on my arrival to be greeted by friendly staff who were attentive and very helpful with any query I had.  The lobby is traditional in design and beautiful in detail.  The rooms are very clean, towels are VERY soft and fluffy (that matters), good water pressure and plenty of pillows!  The free wifi provided was lightning fas as well enabling me to email and work quickly.  They even have a turn down service.  Many of the extras are far superior to a three star hotel.  The only thing they didn't have was a kettle in the room but quickly supplied one when asked.  A great place, great location and I will definitely be going back.",5,2016,02,20
59,Art & Design gem,"Friends who live nearby recommended this place for its location, convenience and interesting history. The building' s origins go back to the late 19C - early 20th and some  of the rooms though needing a touch-up definitely have that original  lovely art nouveau/deco design. Location is terrific for the Eixample district with fabulous shops and restaurants - and all the iconic modernista buildings at walking distance. We walked everywhere - even downtown though you can take the metro or buses easily directly. Our deal did not include breakfast but it was not a hardship since @ half a dozen cafes outside served breakfast .  Have a look at the Opisso Museum in the hotel-  an unexpected gem..",4,2016,02,17
59,Long Weekend,"THE HOTEL is 3* and is finished to a high standard, the reception is impressive and if you have a minute take a look at the art and pictures in there and over the ground floor. 
All the staff are very friendly and all speak a modicum of English some better than others but enough to make your checking in quick and easy. 
WiFi is available and is free for the first 7 days after that I think its payable but not sure.

THE ROOM, are also a high standard they have a mini bar, T.V, but NO tea/coffee facilities, although they do have room service, (we never used it)
There is a small tariff card by the mini bar for you to fill in each day. It will be restocked each day if you let the maid in. (do not disturb) on the door means that they will not come in. Due to the mattress's being firmer than I am used to I did not sleep too well. 

THE BATHROOM, again is quality with complimentary shampoo etc and shoe cleaning kit. Towels will be changed each day again if you let the maid in. the shower is powerful, so you know you have been in it.

MEALS, breakfast is not included in the price of the room and it would be better to ask at reception for any deals, we were informed by the staff of such a deal but paid full price of 15 Euros each day. There is a large selection to choose from and is continental, I know there is NO evening meal available and the restaurant is open in the afternoon.

THE BAR, I am not sure if they sell beer but they certainly sell spirits and wine, even champagne, but beware its expensive if there is no one there go to reception (we waited for 5 mins pressing the bar bell and no one came)

SURROUNDING AREA. The hotel is only one street down from the main road and I advise you to get out and walk around get to know the area the street lay out if you have not been before is very simple. There is a small supermarket on each and every corner and lots of café/diners about. Go and find one of the Ramblers one such is the Rambler De Catalunya  which is left out of the hotel. There you will find all the big name high street shops and even more café than you will ever need. if the weather is nice (which it was) we strolled the length of the Catalunya which took us all the way down to the sea front you will be surprised just how far you have walked in such a short time. Also from this point it is just a short walk to the Gothic church a beautiful place. We they took a taxi to Sargrada Familiar, we stayed outside as it was a bit expensive to enter.

OVERALL. Use the hotel as a base it is situated in the middle of everything and the bus service 67,68 that stops outside will take you to Pl Catalunya, from there it is just a few minutes walk to the magic fountains (dancing waters) again I urge you to get out and walk the city there are some fantastic buildings.

The city of a weekend does not wake up until about 10.30 - 11.00 during the week its very busy from 7am, the main shops don't open till 10am but there are café/diners open from early morning.",3,2016,02,10
59,"Great hotel, lovely staff","We stayed at the Astoria as part of a sports holiday package and we definitely weren't disappointed. The hotel is gorgeous and the staff are so helpful they upgraded our room without charge for my boyfriends 30th birthday. The location is perfect, we will 100% be back to stay.",5,2016,02,09
59,Winter break in Barca!,"We stayed for 3 nights at the Astoria.  It was in a really convenient location.  We had a room only arrangement and the price was excellent value.  The room was very comfortable and clean.  There were quite a few cafes and bars close by including a lovely cake shop which was open all hours for coffee and a good range of snacks both sweet and savoury.  
We arrived well before our 3pm check in time but were given our room keys which was a bonus and a pleasant surprise.  I would be happy to stay again and would recommend as a comfortable hotel for people on a budget.",5,2016,01,19
59,Good hotel not great location,"This hotel was lovely, very clean, modern and comfortable. 
The rooms were to a good standard and the pool on the rooftop was a nice added touch. 
It is very small and there is not much space up there but it never seemed to be busy. 
The hotel is a little out of the way of the centre where the shops and beach is etc probably a 20 minute walk, nothing too drastic if you like being out of the way. 
There were some nice restaurants and cafes near the hotel.
If I was to go back to Barcelona again I would try to stay more central.  ",4,2016,01,16
59,Average,"Stayed here Fri-Sun it's in a great location. 
I have to say the two downsides to my stay were the mattress and the view from our room.
I had terrible sleep on both nights there I found the mattress far too hard.
The view was just of three walls which were part of the exterior of the hotel.
Other than that it was OK. Staff very helpful and friendly. Very clean. ",3,2016,01,13
59,Not new year,"No food at all for evenings from Tuesday - new yr night, no bar New Year's Eve and unable to access roof to view fire works of Barcelona, these should have all been available no excuses!
Not a comfortable bar area and public areas.

Thanks",2,2016,01,02
59,Excellent for a 3* hotel,"I stayed at Hotel Astoria towards the end of December 2015, the hotel from the outside does not look special, it is a bit hidden as it is well camouflaged into the street. The hotel is also in a good location, just a 15 minute stroll to Catalonia square
The hotels reception area is quite pleasant, it is bright and welcoming. The rooms are also very good, especially for a 3* hotel. The rooms are well equipped and they also have a couple of English channels too. 
The breakfast at the hotel is rather poor, this is due to lack of option available for guests, there was a cold buffet which did not seem too appetising. Later, the waitress would bring a very small menu, this included a very small range of hot food (sausage, eggs, bacon) The food was not great.
the hotel has a very small swimming pool but it is more like the size of a large jacuzzi,

All in all, the hotel is very good and im surprised that it is not a 4* hotel",4,2015,12,31
59,Great value hotel in Eixample area of Barcelona,"I really enjoyed my stay at Hotel Astoria. I would describe it as a boutique hotel. It is located in the lovely Eixample area just off Av Diagonal, surrounded by cafes, restaurants, bars and shops. It is about a 10 minute walk to the nearest metro (Diagonal) which can get you to where you need to go very quickly and efficiently. The lobby is very pleasant and interesting, housing a permanent art display by an artist named Ricard Opisso.

My room was a good size being plenty for a solo traveller, and would have been comfortable for 2 people. It had no view to talk about as it faced an internal atrium. I thought this was an advantage as it only had a small window letting in natural light fitted with a shutter that blocked out any light and noise when required. I slept very well as there was no noise. I would pick these rooms rather than the street facing ones if you are a light sleeper.

The room was kept spotlessly clean, and was fitted with a safe and mini bar, was pleasantly furnished and had a very comfortable bed along with free wifi.

I had a couple of issues with the room, all minor. The TV really only had 1 english channel (BBC news), but you aren't in Barcelona to watch TV. The aircon didn't really work. It only had the fan working, which wasn't a problem as it wasn't hot but probably would need looking at if it was summer, and the shower was a little difficult to enter or leave. It was quite a large step over the bath into a smallish shower.

I have to say that while the hotel is well located, I found that I was continuously on the train to the Las Ramblas/old city areas and after 5 days the walk to and from the metro got a bit tiring, so keep that in mind.

Also, I only gave the service 3 stars, as the staff I interacted with, while always helpful, were never overly warm and friendly ... more business like.

I stayed 5 nights, and would definitely consider staying at Hotel Astoria again if I found myself travelling to back to Barcelona.",4,2015,12,27
59,Wonderful Hotel,"Stayed here for a week, had breakfast included in my rate. I had a great week. No issues, room was nice, cleaned well, breakfast was good, loved all the art. Sat upstairs on the roof everyday when the sun was warm. Location was convenient as I walked to many places vs taking metro. Sagrada Familia, Placa de Catalunya, Gracia, El Raval, etc.  Friendly staff. Just a great hotel overall.",4,2015,12,21
59,One of the best locations/price ration in Barselona,"Excellent location exactly in the Centre. Just a few minutes of walking from Diagonal, and subway, 25 minutes to the beach. Very nice room for couple with huge bed and really good bathroom. Clean and cozy. 
Look for special offers from the hotel to get the best price. 
Don't forget to visit all nearest cafe for perfect breakfasts and romantic dinners.",5,2015,12,19
59,Beautiful hotel-museum in a great location!,"Location: The Astoria hotel is located near famous Diagonal street with metro access in less than 5 minutes. From El Prat airport,  I took a 3 days Barcelona Card and came to the hotel using Bus 46 to Plaza De Spanya  and then with metro L3 to diagonal station. After a 500 meters walking and looking for Carre de Paris I found the hotel. Overall, this is a great location and you can easily access to all attractions and sightseeing. In addition lots of bars and restaurants are around the hotel.
Room: My room was a bit small with no view to outside. But it was very clean, well-designed and comfortable.Internet speed was very good. All the rooms and hotel walls are decorated with beautiful old paintings that turned the hotel into an art museum.
Staff: Hotel staff were very polite and friendly. It was interesting that  the staff were all men !
Breakfast: Breakfast was nice. Although for the omelet you should order it to the staff.
Overall, this is a nice budget hotel and I definitely recommend it.",4,2015,12,05
59,Loved this hotel,"Great location, lovely accommodation + really lovely staff. Will definitely stay here on our next visit to Barcelona. Loads of great restaurants + bars in the immediate vicinity.
      Bus stop opposite for bus to Plaza Catalunya but only 20 minute walk if you wish.",5,2015,12,03
59,"Nice location, and perfect stay!","Beautiful hotel, we stayed here for 4 nights. The room was nice and clean!. the staff was very friendly. The breakfast we thought was a bit expensive 10 euros per person, but there are a lot of other cafes that offer breakfast around the corner.",4,2015,12,01
59,Perfect for visiting Barcelona!,"It was a perfect location, friendly staff, the roof terrace is amazing, good value for money, nice atmosphere, the bathroom could use a renovation though but it was clean and had everything you needed. We really enjoyed our stay here.

59,Perfect location and quality hotel,"Beautiful hotel, comfortable, room service quick and friendly, perfect for quality/price. The staff is friendly. The room is very clean and well decorated. Wifi free for the whole stay. Very quiet at night. ",5,2015,11,26
59,Nice place to stay,We stayed at the Astoria for 9 nights. The room was fine. We slept great as it was quiet due to not being on the street side (room 619). Shower was hot & towels large but not soft. The value at $66/night made this a great find. There's a wonderful pastry & coffee shop around the corner for breakfast as opposed to eating at the hotel buffet. Small markets are everywhere should you need something. There's easy metro access as well. Barcelona is a beautiful & lively destination.,4,2015,11,22
59,Lovely hotel......,"We stayed here in October '15 as we had a short break in this marvelous city...
The hotel is lovely and very welcoming and helpful  staff.l The hotel is probably a 10 min walk to the town centre and it's a very pleasant walk whilst you take in the beautiful buildings that surround you !! The local metro station is just round the corner and plenty of restaurants within a 10 min radius.
We stayed in one of the studio rooms and whilst it's not the most spacious of rooms it was perfectly acceptable.....  We was out all day and evening anyway...  The bed was very comfy, towels changed daily if required and the free wifi was handy.
The restaurant area is very nice, as is the continental breakfast... I believe they will do you a hot breakfast if required but we didn't want that...
There's a small, very small roof top pool and terrace but probably nice for a quick dip.if it's very hot ...
All in all a very nice hotel with and we had no complaints  and we for sure will be returning here...",4,2015,11,21
59,a taste of France in Spain,"Recently returned from a 5 night break here. The hotel may be in Barcelona but has a distinct Parisan feel. Beautiful art deco hotel, city views from the terrace, near to shops, bars and restaurants. Clean, large rooms. Helpful staff, couldn't find fault",5,2015,11,18
59,Art Deco,"If you like art deco this is the hotel for you. Impressive decorations with a permanent exhibition of Ricard Opisso also on site. Staff very friendly and helpful - good breakfast in lovely room. Just a couple of minor niggles but would stay there again. Surrounding area also very good for access to City and attractions. 5-6 minutes to Diagonal station and 30-40 minutes walking from the Old Town.
      ",5,2015,11,13
59,Unique,This hotel has an unique collection of drawings and posters characterising it's Parisian theme. The hotel is in an area which has many good shops and restaurants and is a pleasant alternative to the crowded tourist centre which is only about 20 minutes walk away. To those who know London a good comparison would be it being similar to Kensington rather than Oxford Street.,5,2015,11,12
59,"Localization, localization and great staff","Perfect to get around in Barcelono on foot, except the far away places. If you ove seep there is three places for breakfast around the corner, one open all day long. Near to Gaudis known Houses and Church, the Shops at Paseo da Gracia and the endless bars at Rampla Catalunia. The staff is 5 stars make it all happens, whatever you ask for!",4,2015,11,02
59,"Great hotel, great location","I spent 4 nights at the Astoria in October whilst visiting this beautiful city with a friend.  It was a lovely hotel, the
Staff were very friendly and helpful and the rooms very clean.  The first night we were in a twin room at the front of the hotel but it was so noisy that neither of us slept well at all.  The next morning we asked if we could be moved and were given another room at the back, which although a bit smaller was much quieter.  We opted to have the buffet breakfast in the hotel which was fine for 4 days but any longer and it would have been a bit repetitive as the the choice was limited.  The hotel decor is quite beautiful with lots of unusual artwork on display.  The wifi is a bit temperamental but the bellboy on reception was always happy to help with devices.  The location is great, within walking distance of the centre and close to the metro and tourist bus stops.  We didn't use the leisure facilities but the roof garden is a  small but lovely space to relax and the pool is too small for a swim but would be great for cooling off in the summer.  I would definitely stay here again.",4,2015,10,28
59,Very satisfied.,"We stay 4 nights, and Are very satisfied with Hotel Astoria. Very close to everything, cleaning very good, good brekfast and friendly hospitality. Nice Roof terasse with a small pool. Overall good service
      
      
      
      ",5,2015,10,25
59,Great hotel for the money,"I would highly recommend this quiet, clean hotel!  3-4 blocks from the Metro. We didn't eat in the restaurant, but had a glass of wine in the bar in the evening. The work-out room is nothing to write home about but we walked so much we didn't need it.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!

59,Good for short stays,"Room was a good size but no view and little natural light in the room. Beds and pillows were a bit hard for my taste. Could hear people walking on floor above from 6am, we were on the 4th floor. Reported the hair dryer as not working and took a couple of days to fix but was attended. Great location for metro and cafes etc. Price of breakfast seemed expensive but plenty of other options close by so didnt bother. Overall a good central hotel.",3,2015,10,18
59,Very nice hotel,"The hotel is very nice and the location is good, within walking distance to the sightseeing.
      Nice terrace on the roof with a small swimmingpool.
Taxi station just opposite hotel
Restaurants and cafes close to the hotel",5,2015,10,17
59,Good hotel in the Eixample neighborhood,"We stayed here for a week in September. The hotel staff was extremely nice, helpful, and friendly.
 
I thought the room was well decorated. We had a room overlooking the street (no balcony). It was a nice view, but could be a little noisy at times. All of the streets in Barcelona are very busy, so I don't think street noise is avoidable if you get a street facing room anywhere. I will say that the bed was a bit hard. But, they provided lots of pillows that were very comfortable. The a/c worked very well. The wifi could be just a bit faster. It was good enough to check emails, and make plans. I was able to watch some YouTube videos without trouble. But I think it slows down when demand is greater. The rooms (and hotel) were very clean, and it's located in a safe neighborhood.

It's fairly well located. The Diagnal metro stop is close by (about a 5 min walk). It's about a 40 min bus ride (bus is right across the street on Paris) to the beach. Everything is still very walkable. There are lots of cafes nearby, even a few grocery stores. I would stay here again. Definitely get a T-10 metro/bus card, you can share it and it will save you lots of $ for transportation.

I didn't use the pool or the gym. Like others have said, the pool is small. It's good enough for kids though, and the view from the roof is really nice. The gym only has cardio equipment, and no weights. I would suggest running on the streets instead, all the locals around there run the neighborhood. Maybe bring resistance bands if you want to strength train. The superior room is large enough to do yoga or body weight exercises.",4,2015,10,08
59,"Very Good Hotel, Great Location","We loved this hotel.  Room was great, lots of room and great bathroom.  Rooftop was wonderful with views and a pool.  This area of E'ixample was perfect, a nice neighborhood with cafes very near by and about 3 blocks to La Ramblas and 4 blocks to Metro.  Staff was very nice and helpful.  We would definitely stay there again!",5,2015,10,08
59,It's ok,"The hotel is located quite central, although walking to the sea takes quite a long time. Some nice restaurants can be found nearby. The staff is friendly and it is clean, the breakfast is ok.
I recommend to ask for a room on the higher floors, especially the first floor I can not recommend.
The pool on the roof terrace is more a bath tube than a real pool. Looks nice on the photos though, bit small in real life.",4,2015,10,04
59,Perfect Memory,"Light Music, Champayne from our mini fridge, Sun setting, Roof terrace. Perfect yes from my girlfriend when asking her to marry me. The Astoria will always be a happy memory. We will return at some point

59,"Clean, Comfortable, Well Located, Full Facilities","Friendly effective staff, beautiful art work everywhere, large lobby, cafe bistro, lounge, bar.  Our 1 bedroom suite on 7th floor was excellent. Large comfortable bed, softer than most european beds. Linens were soft luxurious cotton. Bathroom was large and modern. Safe in room. Wifi was spotty. The outside pool on the room was small but beautiful and the view excellent. exercise room and sauna clean. Elevators were fast and reliable.  I cannot understand the 3star rating on this hotel as I would rank it 4 star. Maid service excellent and friendly.  Chocolate on pillow at bed turn down. The breakfast buffet is more than continental as it had cheeses and meats along with granola and fresh fruits and endless coffee.  The entance way (atrium) in our room had a large couch that converts into a pullout bed, in case of children.",5,2015,09,25
59,Traveled with my family,"I would go back to this hotel. It was convenient and the neighborhood was safe. There are good restaurants and a great cupcake pastry place next to the hotel. Look for Cup and Cake. Also look for Bar El Velódromo. The breakfast was worth the cost as they have a flat rate if you are staying there. Plus, pharmacy and groceries within walking distance.

Public transportation is also close. We plan on going back one day.

Remember hotels in Europe are strict with Occupancy! Also, Bathroom is separate if I remember.",4,2015,09,23
59,A very good  option,"Excellent location, breakfast with a great vary with yogurts, fruits, breads, nespresso coffee, orange juice (natural one, not artificial)  and other options. Subway station in front of the hotel and a lots of point of interesting in walk distance. The room was very spacefull with mini-refrigerator inside, and the use of the safe locker is free. The only thing I should complain was about the room service cause one day we arrived at 14:00 and the room was not cleaned yet but they fixed it very fast. Front desk workers very friendly and always ready to help.

      ",5,2015,09,19
59,Art Deco Elegance,"The rather unassuming entrance to the Astoria Hotel hides a rather spectacular Art Deco lobby and sweeping spiral staircase inside. The location (in the Eixample district) is perfect for a visit to Barcelona, placing you in walking distance of most of the ""big"" tourist sights; Sagrada Familia, Casa Batllo, La Pedrera to name but a few. It takes about 15 minutes to walk to Passeig la Gracia, where you can either keep on walking to the Old city or hop on one of the many metros or buses. Reception at the Astoria was professional and efficient - but not overly friendly. Very helpful with tips and directions though when asked. Our room was modern, clean and quite neutrally decorated. Lots of wardrobe and storage space. The bathroom was nice, but don't expect a full size bath tub.Air conditioning worked very well, almost too well as it seemed to blow directly onto us from somewhere above the bed. Easily adjusted though from the panel on the wall.  We didnt have a view from our window as it faced onto an airshaft, but to be honest it didnt matter as we hardly spent any time in our room at all. Room cleaned every day and a little chocolate left on our pillow, which was nice.
The roof terrace is nothing special but it does offer nice views of the neighbourhood. I bet it's nicer in summer when its the season for hanging out by the pool. Didn't have breakfast at the hotel, but the breakfast room looked very elegant - also in an art deco style. We didnt frequent the hotel bar either, preferring to visit the multitude of small bars in the immediate vicinity.
I would definately recommend this hotel to couples and /or business people visiting Barcelona. Eixample is a trendy, but somehow more authentic neighbourhood, not yet overrun by tourists, and so the restaurants are still relatively good value.",4,2015,09,18
59,hotell review,"It is a good hotell, with good service and very helpful approach. Internet could be easier and faster to access, not having to go into it every day.

Location is quite good but a little to long distant to walk to the old town etc.

59,"Comfortable, well located hotel, offering good value","The standard room was simply but nicely furnished and was a good size.  There was also plenty of wardrobe space which often isn't the case in standard rooms in the city centre.  The bathroom was nicely done in marble and the towels were large and fluffy.  The room didn't have any kind of view (other than into a quadrangle with other rooms but there was plenty of provision for privacy) and the bed was comfortable.  The buffet breakfast offered a good range of rolls, pastries, cakes, fruit, cereal, yoghurts, meats and cheeses.  All staff were helpful.  The hotel was within easy reach of rail and metro stations offering good access to all parts of the city.  Barcelona itself is absolutely beautiful.",4,2015,09,13
59,A great place to stay!,"Having never been to Barcelona we weren't sure what to expect.  This hotel was fantastic! It was great value for money, close but not too close to main attractions and shops and the rooms were clean and comfortable.  Staff could not have been more friendly and helpful! Although wifi was free, it was a little intermittent and you had to keep logging in.  If we ever come back to Barcelona, we will certainly come back to this little gem!",5,2015,09,12
59,Nice place ,"Very nice hotel, not huge rooms, but well appointed. The lobby felt very nice and had a pretty upscale feel to it. The bathrooms were nicely done and the rooms had a very good shutter on the window which helped block out noise and light while you sleep. ",4,2015,09,12

Lovely amenities great location the hotel is a great stay for a trip to Barcelona. About a 15-20 Min walk to las ramblas. Definitely reccomend an enjoyable stay here :),4,2015,09,07
59,Nice and quiet hotel for shorter stay ,"Quite good hotel not too far from subways and busses. Only a 5 minutes walk from the subway station ""Diagonal"". 
The staff at reception was efficient and friendly and helpful with information we needed. 
The room was quite big and had a good air-conditioning system almost with no noise at all -  very good! 
Nice and clean room with a good WiFi. 
The hotel has a nice and cozy atmosphere. 
Breakfast was good as well  -  just remember to ask for hot meal, as they prepare it for you on request and there is no information about this in the breakfast area.
The swimming pool area on the roof was quite small often crowdy but still a nice place to relax in the afternoon after many hours of walking in beautiful Barcelona. 
All together a nice place to stay when visiting Barcelona. ",4,2015,08,27
59,Ok but only Ok,"After reading the last few reviews on Trip advisor my partner and I decided to book Hotel Astoria. 
Upon arrival  we were greeted and asked if we would like a room with a double bed or one with twin beds we wanted the room with a double bed but the receptionist seemed hesitate and said that he would show us both rooms and we could decide from there . I was very glad that he had decided to do this as the double bedded room had a very small bed and was by the swimming pool and would have been by a walk way which would have been quite noisy, so we settled on the twin bedded room.
The rooms are very small and this particular room had no balcony ( extra charge )this would be fine for a 2 night stay at most 4 but after 7 days although not spending much time in the room it did feel a little claustrophobic.   Beds were very hard and not comfortable. Free Wifi whole stay and really good speed. 
The ladies who serviced the room were lovely and did a great job clean towels everyday and made beds and upon meeting in the hallway they would always were friendly and happy. Breakfast is a continental affair and decent they also have an offer that if you dine 2 days in a row you get if for 10 euros pp instead of 14 pp. 
Swimming pool area is tiny and only has 6 sunbeds and they were always taken , not really a pleasant area to be as you feel that you are a little on top of each other , Gym area well cant really call it a gym it has a outdated treadmill and cycle bike and a sauna that was not working.
Hotel is a long walk from the main areas of Las Ramblas, Barri Gothic and beach. Public transport in Barcelona is fantastic and couldn't fault it . 
All in all a average hotel which is adequate but didn't met our expectations.",3,2015,08,26
59,Bad vibe,"The reception was cold the man who served me was unfriendly and i did not feel welcome at all.  The room was nice and clean but lacked atmosphere.  The water pressure was good.  Breakfast was below average.  no hot food just usual dry cereal, fruit and pastrys.
The pool is just a paddling pool like only waist deep.  And the pigeons drink from it. It just had a bad vibe throughout the whole hotel. ",3,2015,08,25
59,Perfect for Barcelona Trip,"Really liked this hotel, hotel staff are helpful and will tell you anything you need to know about Barcelona. 

It has a grand, elegant decor and feels like you are coming home to your posh apartment building! Rooftop terrace small but nice, pool too cold for me but did enjoy a late afternoon chill up there with my book. 

Our room (629) didn't have a view of anything and window looked out onto a blank wall and other windows, however not being in the there very much I suppose it didn't really matter. Only problem was we couldn't really see what the weather was like when we woke up in the morning (we popped up to the terrace to check!) If this worries you, perhaps mention this at booking. 

The hotel is a few blocks away from the diaganol metro stop (I'd say about 10-15 min walk). The diagonal metro is an ideal starting point for exploring Barcelona- if you carry on down this road on foot, or along the metro line, you will walk down the main shopping mile & eventually onto las Ramblas and then onto the port! An ideal walk for your first day in order to get your bearings. 

From the airport we took the aerobus to Espanya station, then got the metro to Diagonol. On way back we got metro to Catalunya and caught the aerobus from there.",4,2015,08,21

59,Quiet and convenient ,"We stayed here for 1 week on B&B. The hotel was lovely- it is in a quiet area but close to the rambles de Catalunya. We were able to walk to most of the main tourist attractions within half an hour. The breakfast was nice with a good continental selection.
There is a small roof terrace with a few sun beds which was very sunny and there's a small pool for cooling off. ",4,2015,08,12
59,A great hotel in a great area,"The Astoria which is located in the Exiample district, is within easy walking distance of many of Barcelona’s major attractions. From the airport it was an easy journey on the RENFE. (The RENFE is equivalent to a commuter line that transfers commuters from the suburbs into city center) Ride the RENFE to the Passieg de Gracia station, and from there a quick transition onto the green L3 line in the direction of Trinitat Nova one stop to Diagonal station. The entire commute form the airport is approximately 40-45 minutes, and far less expensive than the 35-40 euro taxi fare. The walk from the station to the hotel is approximately 12 minutes if you know where you’re going, if not it could easily end up being 40 minutes. Just like New York each station has multiple exits so depending on where you exit the train that will determine how you should proceed to the hotel. If you exit on Ave Diagonal, (it is a big wide ave) you will proceed in a westerly direction for approximately 4 blocks, (long blocks) until you see Carrer de Balmes, ( street names are usually posted on the side of the buildings) from there turn left and proceed one block until you run into Carrer de Paris. The hotel is located on Carrer de Paris. 
Exiample is great neighborhood to lodge in. It is in close proximity to many activities and sites in the city, but far enough away from all the hustle and bustle of La Rambla, (Barcelona’s Times Square). There are many restaurants and bars in the neighborhood with La Tagliatella being one of my favorites. The hotel has a small but quaint rooftop pool that offers a moderate view of the surrounding neighborhood. The staff is very accommodating and friendly. The lobby of the hotel is attractive, neat and spacious. Guest received free internet service. The standard room is a bit tight, but comfortable. If you’re concerned I would ask for the suite which offers a lot more room. However Barcelona is a city that begs to be seen, I doubt very much that you’ll be spending too much time in your room. The rooms are very neat and clean. I’ve been to Barcelona 5 times and when they were able to accommodate me the Astoria has always been my hotel of choice. It is not a 5 star hotel, but it is certainly deserving of a solid three stars, (perhaps more but I’d hate to exceed the reader’s expectations). If you enjoy walking as much as I do then you can easily walk to La Sagrada Familia from the hotel, or if you are really feeling peripatetic then I’d suggest walking to the beach via La Ramblas. 
Barcelona is a very safe city. You can stroll through the streets at all hours of the night unencumbered with the threat of crime. However like many cities in Europe you need to be aware of your belongings at all times as there does exist an element of beings who are particularly adroit at relieving you of any valuables without your knowledge. It has never happened to me during my visits but you should be advised.",5,2015,08,11
59,Excellent location!,"This hotel is in a lovely area of Barcelona close to a range of café's, bars, restaurants etc but is quiet and the area still retains some character rather than being too touristic. The hotel provides excellent access to all districts and we explored most on foot because you get to see so much more - it is worth exploring little roads which are not the main tourist route. However the Diagonal metro line is just a few minutes walk and a taxi rank is out front - so all options are available. The hotel staff are welcoming, the rooms very clean and ours was quite spacious. The hotel pool with rooftop views of the city & sea is a real bonus at end of a busy day exploring. Will definitely return. Do try the Cup & Cake shop for coffee/ tea and recommend the yoghurt, granola and fresh fruit for breakfast. Cup cakes are delicious (just walk 10 yards to left as you leave hotel!!",5,2015,08,07
59,Amazing value for money,"Nice staff, nice room, swimming pool on the roof is really small, more like a jacuzzi but for the price of the room it's impossible to complain. a bit far from the lively areas of Barcelona but still about 20 min walk.

59,"Great hotel, great location!!","I highly recommend this hotel! It's located in a convenient and trendy part of the Eixample district. It is a 5 minute walk to the Diagnal metro stop, a 15 min walk to Casa Mila and 20 minutes to the Block of Discord. The hotel is well air-conditioned and the second room we got was clean and a good size. The bathroom was a little small and the bidet seemed to get in the way of getting into the shower. Do not reserve a Superior Room. There is supposedly a benefit to a bi-level room but the small air-conditioning unit for the room barely covered the bedroom, let alone the little loft area outside the bedroom and the 2nd area upstairs. Despite the inconvenience of switching rooms our second day from a Superior Room to a Regular Room, I still highly recommend the hotel and suggest that you stay here on your next visit to Barcelona.",5,2015,07,22
59,Wonderful hotel,"Stayed for 6 nights in July 2015, we were planning to spend five nights at the Astoria then have a blow out in a 5 star but we were so happy and comfortable we stayed 6th night too. Hotel is reasonably new (I think ) but designed so you feel like you're in an old fashioned palace, marble, mirrors, gilt and loads of old film posters, swirling staircase looks up to seventh floor is amazing, walk down the stairs and you feel like a film star! Rooms were reasonably large for Barcelona, very clean, air con at perfect temperature for us. Bathrooms have good shower and bath that filled quickly, plenty of hot water, nice clear bag of toiletries (useful for flight home) also contained shoe shine. Bath towels really large fluffy and sparkling clean. We emptied minibar fridge and filled with our own stuff then put it all back when we left. Fridges big enough for large bottle water, 12 small beers and 2 red bull, perfick! 
Swimming pool on roof not big enough to swim but great to cool off in, terrace on roof in two sections, about six sun beds and two table and chairs, lots of potted palms, lovely atmosphere and great views. There is a fitness room with running machine, bikes etc but looked far too energetic given we were there during a heat wave......
Breakfast? Didn't make it out of bed in time but was meant to be good, food served in Hotel restaurant at lunchtime till 4pm which we also didn't try but frequented by Spanish which is a good sign.
Across the road from hotel good little tapas bar, if you walk down the street from there is a 'Suma' supermarket with all you need open till 1am but stops selling beer/wine at 11pm. Further down road turn right there is a good bar called BB+ sells great mojitos, sangria and caramel vodka shots for a euro.Diagonal metro stop is about 10 min walk from hotel, the ramblas is about 20 mins walk,as is sagrida de familia (spelling?!) albeit in a different direction.

All in all would highly recommend the Astoria and will definitely stay there again",5,2015,07,12
59,Excellent,"I have been staying at this hotel for quite some years and would not want to stay anywhere else in Barcelona. Pleasant reception area, polite and courteous staff, comfortable rooms, and a very convenient location with some excellent restaurants nearby.",5,2015,07,07
59,Quiet and convenient location,"I have to agree almost 100% with a previous reviewer (Chris P) in that I find if difficult to understand how this could get 5 stars. I spent 7 nights here, June 2015 and agree that the hotel is adequate, it is clean and reasonably well presented. The rooms are an adequate size but I live in Tokyo so am used to spaces being tiny!

The 14€ breakfast price tag (10€ if you book it ahead) didn't seem like a good deal so I skipped it and good thing. There are plenty of good cafes in the neighborhood, all with lovely outdoor seating available where you can fill your belly for a great deal less than 10€.

The complimentary Wi-fi was slow and took quite a bit of effort to constantly have to log into. The staff did a fair job right up to the last night I was there but check out was a huge disappointment. There was one guest being served ahead of me while two other front desk workers remained in the office looking at the computer monitor. They didn't try to come over to help me to check-out so I wanted patiently while the person ahead of me was checked out. Upon checking out I asked if I could have a taxi called and was told, not rudely but certainly not very nicely, that there was a taxi stand on the corner. After checking my ""city tax"" bill in the taxi I discovered that I had been overcharged. That situation has since been fixed by the management but it showed a lack of attention to detail that I've become used to when I travel. Overall, I'd say that my stay there was adequate.",3,2015,07,04
59,Astoria Hotel Barcelona,"Nice hotel set in the main part of the city. A few blocks away from the Avenue Diagonal (central) makes it an ideal base for exploring the city. A walk down the hill will get you to central Placa de Catalunya within 5 minutes, whilst the bus tour routes places it ideally between the northern and southern loops. So good location for starters.
The actual hotel itself is nice and clean with good amenities and a modern yet classic look. Hotel staff are warm and helpful, breakfast is good and rooms are comfortable with air conditioning. Swimming pool on the roof is hardly olympic sized, but will provide a welcome cooling dip after a busy day shopping or sight-seeing. Overall I would rate the hotel 4/5 - negative being dodgy wifi (couldn't get it to work)",4,2015,06,30
59,Adequate hotel,"I see some great reviews for this hotel - and while I realise that people have different experiences, I find if difficult to understand how this could get 5 stars. I spent 5 nights here, June 2015 - mostly on business but tagged on some holiday.

The hotel is adequate, it is clean and reasonably well presented. The rooms are small (not really enough room to work at the desk). We didn't eat an evening meal here - there are plenty of restaurants in the area and the poor range on offer for breakfast didn't encourage us to eat here any more frequently than needed. We did use the basement 'meeting room' one3 day which was truly terrible (hot, stuffy, smelly) but this would not effect most people. Staff are not over friendly or over helpful - they just do their job.

On the good side is the location - not too far to the metro, bus into the city is closer (ask reception). Walking distance to Rambla de Catalunya which is lovely at night, stacked with restaurants for open air eating. Also walking distance to the pretty Casa Mila.

Barcelona is fantastic - if you cant get anywhere else, or you get a good price, you will enjoy your visit even in an average hotel!",3,2015,06,29

Hotel is near enough but far enough awsy from las rambles, close to train station, however to my memory there are four train stations.the important one was near us,as we had tickets for the grandprix.reception staff were very helpfull in giving us info as to where to get off the train etc, mont mello if anyone needs to know.breakfast was good,and we ate out and about on an evening.basic,clean,and helpfull.we have seen 4 star hotels that are inferior and would not stay in them,charming hotel,enjoyed our stay",4,2015,06,25

59,Blissful stay :),"For the price of this hotel, I found my stay very good! It was certainly cheap to book a room here but it is a not a cheap expereince.

I stayed here with 3 other friends last summer during a short city break to the city. The rooms were very clean and spacious and the bathroom had everything we needed. We had a lovely view from our window of the city. The rooms were cleaned every day and towels and bed sheets were replaced every day. Only thing is the fridge was not big enough for us to keep any drinks in which resulted in a lot of pre drinking for a night out ruined. The wifi in the hotel was fast but you had to keep signing up for it every day.

We never ate in the hotel but we did have a peek and it looked lovely. We also went to the hotel bar one night due to weather but we found it very expesnive and was limited in choice of drink.The roof top pool was excellent and was a great place to just chill out, you could also order some drinks to the roof top. The hotel was very secure, it was locked every night and we had to ring a bell for the security guard could let us in. The hotel was perfected located, a short walk away from the major shopping street and also very near the open top bus stop. There was not any local shops to buy drink or mibbles around the area however and we had to walk a while to get some basics.

Apart from that we had a wonderful stay :)",4,2015,06,16
59,Decent stay,"We found the location of this hotel to be perfect. It was a long walk to the beach (5km) but close enough to walk into the city comfortably. 
We were woken up by construction work 2 or the 4 nights we stayed but that didn't effected our sleeping too much. 
The room had no natural light but was clean. 
Overall it was a good stay at a decent price ",4,2015,06,14
59,Perfect - How a hotel at this price should be,"I stayed here on business and my host recommended this hotel.  

Upon entering you notice a large open space, columns and many many paintings, photographs and other artworks on the walls.  I was greeted by a nice man who swiftly concluded my checkin and sent me upstairs to my room.

The room was perfect - clean, tidy, neat.  All the amenities you need, but nothing fancy that you know upon first sight that you're probably paying too much for.  

The café felt nice, people having coffee and drinks, echo-y in a very Spanish/Mediterranean way - with a nice lady helping everyone out.  I did not get to try the restaurant but the setting seemed very nice, again surrounded by artwork of a famous local artist.

What won me over in this hotel was how it nailed the simplicity and elegance of it's offering - for the price it was in many respects perfect.  No fluff, no ritz, just a straight-up, proper hotel.

Nice.",4,2015,06,14
59,Barcelona Weekend,"Excellent Hotel, with good location and roof top pool.Weekend experience made all the better as able to watch Barca beat Uve in a fantastic tapas bar near the Esglesia de Sta. Maria del Mar.- fantastic food, Rioja & football!",5,2015,06,10
59,"Loved it, excellent for the price","We booked this hotel after a fiasco with an airbnb reservation - we were pretty much hoping for any hotel that had a room with private bathroom and  without a high price. For our surprise this was a great hotel. Clean, comfortable and very modern and cozy. The little pool in the roof was a bonus. Rates were very affordable for the prices in Barcelona. It was not located in the heart of everything but we walked to las ramblas very easily. Restaurants around the hotel were actually much better than in las ramblas.
      
      ",4,2015,06,09
59,An outstanding base for your Barcelona adventures,"Astoria Hotel greatly exceeded my expectations in a recent stay in Barcelona. We had stayed at two pricier and larger hotels in previous Barcelona visits, but Hotel Astoria was a much better deal - good value, nice atmosphere and a great location in a neighborhood near sites and shopping. The Hotel has a boutique feel starting with the room of prints off of the elegant breakfast room. Our room was smallish (by American standards) but well appointed and functional. 
The breakfast had a wonderful choice of fresh fruits, beverages, cereals, and pastries. I overheard mostly spanish or french spoken; there was a nice mix of business people and tourists. 
Off of the hotel lobby are some well appointed and comfortable waiting and reading rooms.
In general, a stay at the Astoria seems more like a stay at a wealthy Spanish friend's elegant urban home than a stay at a hotel.
I thoroughly enjoyed the neighborhood, especially several cafes on the corner.
It's a very short walk to shopping, the train and the Gaudi houses.
My only complaint is that no one at the front desk told me about the hotel pool (I'll know for next stay).  The pool would have really clinched the deal - but I highly recommend a stay at this hotel.",5,2015,06,05
59,Great staff and clean hotel,"We stayed here by chance as my friends and I were booked in to a sister hotel's apartment which they had changed last minute (annoying) and put us up here.
There was a group of 7 of us girls for a long hen weekend so we didn't know what to expect as we were expecting an apartment. Wouldn't recommend for hen/stag or large groups as the walls are thin and complaints were made due to noise when we weren't really rowdy. 
The staff at the reception desk were always very helpful. No query was ever a chore and they went out of their way to help us in any way they could. Even helping us order dominoes one evening lol!
The rooms and bathroom were small but clean. None of the rooms (all rooms we had were on the 1st floor) we had had a view! The only views we had were of walls or pipes!! Choose a higher room!! Cleaning staff were also lovely and helpful.
The hotel has free wifi which was great. The rooftop has sun loungers and a pool (freezing at all times despite the sun being out and it being hot).  
The breakfast was included and was also lovely. 
It's in a lovely safe area with a close walk to shopping (designer) and the metro.",4,2015,06,05
59,"Very nice, friendly and well located hotel in Barcelona!","Hotel Astoria is a really nice hotel which is really well located in Barcelona. My room was really comfortable and personnel at the hotel, especially at Reception and Restaurant are really friendly. As a guest you really feel hier like at home!

      ",4,2015,06,05
59,EXCELLENT,"We are an American family living abroad for a year in Europe.  We have traveled to many countries in Europe and stayed in many hotels over the year both for business and pleasure.  Hotel Astoria is one of the best hotels we have stayed at for many reasons, most notably great customer service, great décor, nice sized and clean room and excellent location.  

Although the hotel is part of a hotel collection, it feels more like a boutique due to the warmth and attention we received.  In particular, Pepe Camps, the Astoria hotel manager, greeted us each time he saw us at breakfast, told us about local events including the FC Barcelona team news and made us feel very welcome.  We only wish we could have stayed an extra day to watch Barcelona play!

This was excellent I think everything was great. It really is a great hotel and city. If you are coming in Family and Friends check out the castle and beach.",5,2015,05,31
59,Nice hotel!,"Free wifi, lots of restaurants and bars near by. Big shopping center quite near (L'illa)- only 1,5 km.

Nice and clean hotel. Pool is in the 8.floor and only 6 sunbeds, but there was room for us everytime. There is also 3 tables and chairs where you can enjoy the sun.

Metro is about 5 min walk ahead. Very nice neigborhood and it didn't take long to walk to the center",4,2015,05,27
59,Great old building with great posters and art,"The hotel is a great old building, contains an extensive art display and has friendly staff. The IT needs an upgrade, the wifi was difficult and the English TV channels were frozen. The hotel was reasonably priced and has good restaurants and tourist attractions within easy walking distance.",4,2015,05,24
59,Great neighborhood,"This is a real nice hotel in a great neighborhood.  Right next to the hotel there were several nice restaurants and cafes.  Near by in the neighborhood there were several nice restaurants.  It was very easy to work to any of the sights in town or to get on the metro.  We really enjoyed ourselves in Barcelona and this hotel was a great base of operations.  It was clean, well situated with a comfortable bed and good amenities.  I would recommend this hotell.",5,2015,05,22
59,"A nice hotel with a pool, but wifi too slowly","I stayed at this Hotel the last Year for 10 days and was very satisfied. I found it on the hotel map of hallst.com (it was very close to my working place), compared the prices and just booked. Advantages: it has a swimming pool on the roof, the room was clean and very comfortable. Disadvantages: no balcony and the breakfast a little bit too expensive. Wifi was a bit too slowly. The hotel is sutuated directly on Diagonal and ist very  good reachable from any corner of Barcelona (30 minutes with metro to the beach).",3,2015,05,14
59,Great visit!,"We enjoyed our visit to Barcelona, which was made even better by the Hotel Astoria, the hotel was very clean, the room was comfortable and the breakfast was good value with plenty of choice.  The location was very good, handy for the metro and the sites around the Eixample area.  I would recommend this hotel.",4,2015,05,08
59,A week in Barcelona,"The hotel is excellent. Staff is efficient and service oriented. Rooms are clean, comfortable and well equipped. (I would recommend a more modern TV and an easier way to connect to the free wifi). Service level is 4**** without a doubt. We will rwcommemd the hotel to our travel agent and friendS.",5,2015,05,08
59,A gem of a hotel!,"Excellent location within walking distance to good eateries/shopping/metro. Good, all round, customer service with friendly, helpful and approachable staff. Rooms including general areas very clean and tidy, varied breakfast offering, both delicious and nutritious and filling! Worth spending time on the prints by Catalan illustrator Ricard Opisso and pieces of art that decorate the walls. Thoroughly recommend it. Will visit again!",5,2015,05,06
59,Great stay at Astoria Hotel,"Great location and walking distance to a lot of things yet a nice quiet respite from the busy streets of Barcelona.  Clean lobby and room and very helpful staff.  Only complaint was that the beds are very hard.  
              ",5,2015,05,04
59,Good location,"We stayed for 3 nights .Very good location. Convenient for sightseeing and for food. The hotel is clean and close to the metro but also walking distance to many of the attractions.The staff were very helpful.

59,Hotel Astoria Barcelona,"A very cute Art Deco/Noveau style hotel (even has an art gallery on the ground floor) in close proximity to La Rambla, metro & other key sights (incl Gaudiana) but quiet, very nice local restaurants & tapas bars, friendly staff, value for money, highly recommended. ",4,2015,04,25
59,Stylish hotel in a good location,"My sister and i have just come back from the astoria in a lovely area close to everywhere! the public areas lobby bar and restaurant extremely lovely with an interesting permanant exhibition on display of oppisso works.wonderful art nouveau posters ,crystal and figures.the staff very friendly and efficient.great bar serving food all day and the breakfast was fantastic especially at the reduced price of 8 euros!very good quality with alot of selection.
The bedroom although we booked superior was slightly tired looking,
Very nice bathroom though.the other thing was that it was to the  front although we were 5th floor very noisy thurs fri sat nights, sun fine.we were offered to move on the sun left it a bit late.would probably be ok if you can wear ear plugs.however we enjoyed our stay very much and a big thank you especially to breakfast staff who work very hard as very busy.i would stay again

",4,2015,04,21
59,WELL WORTH A VISIT,"The Astoria hotel is situated in a quiet area away from the centre of Barcelona yet close to all travel links (bus, metro, rail and taxi) to get you wherever you want to go. The hotel has character with marble floors, a beautiful spiral staircase which can be viewed in its entirety from the top floor and artworks displayed in the foyer/lounge area. From the moment of arrival, the staff were all friendly and professional, all speaking English and very happy to deal with our enquiries. Our rooms were of a good size and very clean and were serviced daily. The bathroom was spacious with over bath shower and a hairdryer. There was a room safe for which a deposit of €10.00 was required, returnable on the safe return of the key. On the eighth floor is a terrace with a pool and although the pool is very small (it was still inviting in April), this was a perfect area to sit with a bottle of wine and just unwind. There is also a small fitness room on the eighth floor.
While we were at the hotel they had an offer on breakfast, normally €14.00 per person but if booked for the entirety of the stay this was reduced to €8.00 per person. There was a good choice for breakfast, cereals, yoghourts, fresh fruit and juices followed by cheese, cold meats, bread and pastries and tea and coffee. Cooked eggs could be ordered from the restaurant staff.
There were some nice restaurants and bars within easy walking distance of the hotel, one of which we visited was Via 45, where we enjoyed a lovely meal.
A ten minute walk from the hotel gets you to the tourist information office where tickets for many attractions can be purchased including the Hop on Hop off, Bus Turistic. This is a good way to get around Barcelona and points out many of the tourist attractions. There is a commentary in various languages included in the ticket price as well as your personal ear phones. If booking this mode of travel it is worth noting that a two day ticket works out much more cost effective than a one day ticket.
Our stay in Barcelona was a most enjoyable one due in no small part to the staff and facilities at the Hotel Astoria (we were celebrating our Silver Wedding Anniversary) and it was also nice that the General Manager made himself known to us on our day of departure, when we were able to discuss the hotel, Barcelona and football.",5,2015,04,18
59,Huge disappointment ,"I chose to pay more to stay at this hotel than similar-sounding three stars because it got great reviews on TripAdvisor, but I've been extremely disappointed. I came here to do sightseeing during the day and get work done on my computer in the evenings. The location is nice and safe and the front desk staff were very kind, however, most of the amenities did not work. The wifi was broken for my entire stay (making it impossible for me to work), the hair dryer in my room didn't work, and none of the gym equipment functions, which was hugely upsetting because I specifically sought out a hotel with a gym. These are basic travel necessities (especially wifi...) and I am incredibly disappointed that I paid $150/night when other nearby hotels were cheaper. ",2,2015,04,16
59,Great value and location!,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the hotel for 4 nights in April and had a wonderful time! Just off the large avenue Passeig de Gracia (9 min walk). Closest subway station 7 min walk and 10 min away from Casa Mila. The Room is spacious, clean with a large closet. The A/C works great; didn't use it much but when we did it cooled the room quick. The restroom was clean, they provide toiletries, plenty of towels and hair dryer. What I believe is a good addition is that there are two doors between the bathroom and the room, you wouldn't be able to hear any noise in the room.They offered us a special of 2X1 on the breakfast buffet which was a great deal! This helped us save time during the morning not looking for a place to eat. Everywhere they would serve pastries and coffee. This helped us have a heartier breakfast since it included eggs, fruit, cereal, assortment of cold meats, cheeses and pastries/breads. It is located in a safe neighborhood. They do have free wifi but I would not be able to say how reliable it is as I didn't use it.

We did have one issue with the restroom, the water would take long to drain in the shower; but the day that we let them know it got taken care off. 

It is a lovely hotel, with bilingual staff, clean, great location and price. I would stay there again and I highly recommend it.",5,2015,04,16
59,"Spotless, central, helpful and comfortable value for money","Here with my best friend for a 3 night city break.  What a lovely place!  The hotel itself is beautiful.  Art nouveau and marble everywhere.  The staff are a joy and go out of their way to help.  Most speak good English too!  We booked a superior twin room.  We got a road side room on the gift floor.  No complaints, spotlessly clean, the bathroom was amazing and the beds are hard but comfortable.  Quite an expensive mini bar fridge in the wardrobe and the safe is free to use with a ten euro deposit.  On arrival the staff recommended ways to get around and gave us a voucher for money off a tourist bus (highly recommended to get your bearings) and a free pass for the Egyptian museum.
They were more than happy to print out our entry tickets we bought for La Sagrada Familia, La Pedrero and our boarding passes for our flight home just by emailing them to the hotel do they could print them.  There is WiFi in the hotel, a bit patchy sometimes but not enough to spoil our holiday!  If you really need to get on line, there is a free to use pc in the lobby!
We didn't eat in the restaurant on site so cant review that but there are some lovely cafes and an amazing bakery right round the corner.
The walk to the metro, tourist bus stops and Diagonal shopping I just 4 blocks away on a level route. If you want to get a taxi, there is a taxi rank right outside!  When we return to this amazing city, we will definitely stay here again.  Thank you to all the staff for helping us make the most of our stay!",5,2015,04,15

59,Friendly staff. a little dated and definitely not a business hotel,"This hotel may be convenient in terms of location and relatively less expensive compared to the others in barcelona, but the its not worth the money no matter what you are paying. definitely not a business hotel. 

Staff is helpful and courteous. not sure if this hotel goes for a good price in off-peak season. nothing to write home about.",3,2015,03,14

59,Urban peace,"Very nice hotel to visit Barcelona.

Location is OK. You have to walk around five minutes to get to Diagonal tube station from the hotel, but you can also go to the city centre by foot (good choice as the weather is usually good). Plenty of good restaurants in the area.
The rooms are clean and tidy, same as the bathroom. The closet provides plenty of storage as well. Had to pay for Wi-Fi connection as the free option was terribly slow.
The pool area on the top floor is amazing, with great views of the city.

I would recommend this hotel if you are going to Barcelona for a city break.",4,2015,01,16
59,Nothing better,"Barcelona is fabulous--and completely enhanced by a stay at the Astoria.  Every little thing was perfect--food, room, hospitality, helpfulness.  We've considered using the hotel rather than renting a home for a longer trip to the city.  Can't recommend it highly enough.",5,2015,01,11
59,A little of the way,"If a central location is critical for you, then this is perhaps not the hotel for you. Situated on Paris, taxi costs to central Barcelona vary from 10 - 17 Euro depending upon route taken.

That said, sitting in it's own small neighbourhood with cafes, restaurants, taxi stand, pharmacy close by, it might be a good choice, in particular if you want to be away from the hustle and bustle of the city.

An Art Deco hotel, also does not provide a warm and fuzzy feeling in reception or in the rooms. It ""feels"" and is functional. It is clean and the staff are very helpful, but it really lacks that comfort and warmth I like when coming back at the end of the day.

The seating in the reception area does not lend itself to getting together with a group of friends for that late night glass of wine.

Our room looked inward, and the noises during the night were obvious.

Food wise, the small restaurant provides an adequate breakfast where you can order eggs, bacon etc over and above the classic cold meats and breads you would expect. Price is normally 14 Euros. It was reduced to 7 Euros when we were there for New Year. They also provide a small lunch menu which we did not try.

Our room was small, and the bed not overly comfortable.

I like comfort; this hotel does not provide that.",3,2015,01,05
59,Great Location,"For the money this was a great little hotel. The location was perfect. I did not know my way around Barcelona at all, but from the hotel you can walk straight down the La Rambla all the way to the coast (or get the metro). 

The rooms were clean and the bathrooms were nice, cleaners did a good job each day. However I would recommend booking a superior room as they are not very big. We also paid for the superior room hoping for a balcony and there are only a few rooms with balcony's, so unless you pay for a suite, you are unlikely to get one. 

The pool on the roof top is very small but ideal to just cool off, if it isn't too busy, there is not a proper bar on the roof and not much room to sit. Found if you went late afternoon it was better. 

For the money though, this was a great little hotel, with a great location, personally if I went again I wouldn't pay for breakfast as I personally didn't eat much of it.

I would stay there again though, loved Barcelona! 
",4,2014,12,19
59,Good place to stay in Barcelona,"Stayed here solo in Nov 2014 for my first trip to Barcelona. It's about a 10-15 minute walk to the Metro station, but there was also a taxi stand out front for convenience. Most Barcelona attractions were a 10-20 minute Metro ride away and the Metro is very easy to use, however some points of interest are within walking distance. There are lots of restaurants and shops around, and the hotel is kind of in an upscale type neighborhood. The neighborhood seemed safe to me, even when walking around by myself late and night. Barcelona is beautiful overall! Even though I did not understand the Catalan spoken, I could usually get by with Spanish and most people do speak English as well.

The staff was nice and the room was clean, quiet, and comfortable, well besides the hard bed. The bathroom was nice even though the shower drain was clogged and the tub would fill, huge pet peeve of mine. Anytime I needed something (i.e. towels or an iron) the staff was quick to bring it up. The room was also a nice size with a nice closet area to be organized. Pretty great value for the price paid.",4,2014,12,07
59,Could be better,"Great location. Close to the metro and a safe area as well. Walking distance from some great eating places and close to a supermarket as well so perfect location. Rooms were decently sized, clean and room service was fairly prompt. 
No view from the room and wasn't well ventilated. got extremely stuffy from time to time. Another small negative was - called for ice and was charged for it. Its the first time at any hotel that I've had to pay for ice. For a decent classy hotel that this seemed to be, seemed a little cheap for them to charge for ice. 

Overall, would still recommend it. maybe ensure a room with a view while booking. the location and general quality of the room make up for the negatives.",3,2014,12,05
59,one night on Barcelona,"All around the hotel is  located, well appointed and lovely hotel for the money.  Unique and interesting lobby art - the bar and restaurant are pleasant - old world charm in the hotel public spaces, clean modern rooms and a great roof top terrace!
              
              ",5,2014,11,29
59,Extremely classy and good location,"As mentioned by others on this site, this place could get perfect value for money with just a little effort. 

To get the important matters out of the way:

The rooms are fine
The lobby is exquisite
The breakfast service is okay, although the staff could be a bit more forthcoming in offering bacon and eggs
There is good wi-fi
Location is top-notch, close to the diagonal and within walking distance of metro as well as Las Ramblas

For me, the major fault lay in the gym where none of the three second-rate machines worked. 

I will recommend this hotel any time.",4,2014,11,27
59,Not a bad place to stay,I stayed here four nights. My room was clean and comfortable. My room was a little dark as it did not have an outside window. The bathroom was very large and nice. I would stay here again. Great location. I felt the staff could have been friendlier. Breakfast does not come with the room. They have a decent breakfast.,4,2014,11,20
59,Hits and misses,"The lobby has an old-style charm, the staff were quick and helpful. The room was small and faced a wall. Terrace was heart-warming with a great nighttime view. Pool was tiny and the gym merely a holding area for three (count 'em) garage-sale aerobic pieces. The area around the hotel has a great vibe with lots of eateries. The sauna needs to be filled with concrete and never used again. The rate per night was excellent. The comforter from the bed needs to be put in the sauna before the concrete is poured. The wifi was strong and steadfast.

I was all over the place about this hotel and ultimately left feeling that, with a certain amount of effort by the owners, this place could break through to the next level of value.",3,2014,11,09

We dont eat at the hotel: plenty of cafés, restaurants, bars are waiting of you around. it was a great
pleasure to stay here. OK, we stay in the best room and dont know the quality of the ""normal"" rooms. I will recommend rooms 727 and 724.",4,2014,11,08
59,Nice with great details,"Cute small rooftop pool and a few sunbeds on the terrace. Very nice bathroom, pretty quiet room towards the neighbour's wall, just noise from water running in pipes. Comfy bed and OK wifi, just need to reconnect many times. The ""fitness room"" is  joke though, 3 cardio machines that seem to have seen better days, and no view from the room.

Good service at reception, although they charges us different (much higher) price from the reservation made through Booking, but got it adjusted before leaving the hotel.",4,2014,11,05

59,Authentic Barcelona,"We have just returned from four nights staying in this wonderful hotel and already we are talking about making a return trip in 2015. Price was the main reason we booked the Astoria this time but if we go agsin we will stay here without hesitation.

If you enjoy being slap bang in the middle of the tourist area then this is not the hotel for you. However, if you want to explore the real Barcelona and you are prepared to lace up your walking shoes, or else hop on a metro, then I heartily recommend this hotel as a perfect base to explore the city from.

We booked this hotel directly through the Astoria's own website having seen on Tripadvisor that there was a special offer on of free breakfast. During the booking process we were also able to avail of an extra saving of 20% as we stayed for more than three nights. Each night, per person, cost approximately €47 which was incredible value. A similar standard hotel nearer to Las Ramblas would have cost us almost €90 each.

The Astoria is in the area of Eixample which is an upmarket residential area north of Plaza de Catalunya. We felt safe there all the time, indeed we looked forward to getting away from the madness of the tourist areas each evening and returning back to stroll around this area which is full of quirky little shops, stylish boutiques, bars and fine restaurants. There is a sense of the 'real' Barcelona here. 

Diagonal is the nearest meto station and two lines meet here offering easy access all around the city. It is only three stops from Las Ramblas or else a nice 25/30 minute stroll. 

As I said breakfast was free for us, so we were happy with it. Next time we visit unless it is free again then we will eat elsewhere. I always like to eat breakfast in the hotel, then go back up to the room, get my bits and pieces and head off for the day. This hotel has such a super location that you could still do that even if you eat breakfast in one of the many nearby cafes. There are numerous places literally a stone's throw from the front door of the hotel so you could nip back easily before heading off for the day.

Check in was speedy and easy, there was a slight hiccup as there wasn't a record on the computer of our breakfast deal but I had brought the confirmation letter with me so there was no problem.

The hotel is spotless and our room was very well appointed. Our window was facing out into a large internal courtyard on the sixth floor so it was extremely quiet at night, no noise at all.

The staff were all very helpful and pleasant, eager to advise with suggestions for restaurants etc 

I look forward to returning to the Astoria next time I'm in Barcelona, couldn't imagine staying anywhere else.",5,2014,10,31
59,Good location with great Rooftop Area,We had a small room with only a view of a brick wall but it did have a good size bathroom. It was quiet and had good wi fi. The location is fine and close to metro stations as well as walking distance to Las Ramblas. The bar service was limited at times due to multi-tasking staff and breakfast was satisfactory. What gives this hotel the extra star is the rooftop area. The size of room is not important as out all day and then early night head upstairs and watch the sun set. Plenty of excellent eating and drinking options right next door.,4,2014,10,31
59,Far above a three star hotel,"This is the second time that we have stayed in this hotel and I am so glad that we made the choice to come back again!

This is not a large hotel by any means, in fact its relatively small by city centre standards however the quality of the fittings are extremely high and with its fantastic marble entrance and staircase and lovely rooftop bar, plunge pool and gym area it does feel like its punching way above its 3 star rating.

OK, so it does not have a great view, I grant you - we were on the 7th floor facing a wall, however this is a central city hotel - not a beach base!

We have visited Barcelona allot over the years and despite this hotel being north of the city, it is extremely close to the main shopping area and far easier to navigate from than some other hotels that we have stayed in such as the commercial area at the bottom of the diagonal.

If you are after a stylish, practical hotel to stay in whilst exploring the city, I highly recommend the Astoria!",5,2014,10,29
59,Not a great stay!,"Booked this hotel very last minute and would not stay here again. 
The room was a ""Supreme room"" but was far from that. The window consisted of a view of a brick wall and you could not even tell what the weather would be from it, which meant the room was very fark There was no coffee/tea making faciities in the room, nor an iron or iron board. 
The location is not great either as takes a good 10minutes to get to the closest metro and it was never easy to find.
Overall i would not reccomend this hotel to anyone and i am sure there is a lot better hotels at a cheaper rate in Barcelona. apart from that Barcelona as a city is incredible.",2,2014,10,26
59,"Good location, efficient staff.","My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights in October 2014. The hotel is clean and the staff are efficient. Our room was basic, situated on the 6th floor with no view to speak of. We did not book breakfast with our accommodation and found the local cafés etc good value for money and frequented by local residents. 
The hotel is situated central north of the city centre. This means it is quite a walk from the hotel to the beach area but we did not mind walking through the streets of Barcelona as there is so much to see. However, if you'd prefer to be closer to the center of Barcelona The Astoria maybe a little too far out. Overall, we feel the hotel was a good base for us to explore Barcelona.",4,2014,10,23
59,City break,"Booked at the last minute but definitely not disappointed! Lovely clean hotel in city centre near to Metro, Sightseeing bus stops etc. Room spacious and modern, with good shower and very large towels! All in all a great place to base yourself whilst visiting Barcelona.  ",4,2014,10,21
59,Excellent Hotel,"Myself and my partner stayed at Astoria Hotel for 6 nights. Found it to be excellent value for money, in an excellent location - just a short 5-10 minute walk to Metro stops nearby. Plenty of fantastic restaurants and cafes nearby. Lovely little restaurant next door (The Jockey) serving main meals, lights snacks and tapas, which we visited several times whilst in Barcelona. Breakfast was expensive for the time that we visited in July (13 Euros each), so we utilized the many supermarkets around the hotel and nice patisserie opposite hotel for breakfast each morning. Hotel was excellent condition. Air con in room was brilliant, bed really comfy, facilities very good. Room was quiet and had no problem with noise or being too warm. Rooms were cleaned everyday, fresh towels provided, staff very friendly and helpful. Free wifi available at hotel, reception staff exceptionally helpful, advising on places to visit and allowing us to use lobby computer for free and as long as we needed. Receptionist advised us to book for Sagrada Familia visit online on the computer and printed the pass/booking out for us to avoid the 2-3 hour wait if we just turned up. Rooftop terrace small but lovely to go onto in the evenings when back from sightseeing all day.",5,2014,10,18
59,Great choice!,"The location is excellent, just 2 km from the Sagrada Familia and very close to metro stations. 
The reception and the staff were very helpful. 
Cannot comment on value for money because I did not pay for my trip. 

      
      ",5,2014,10,17
59,Astoria Hotel Barcelona,"The Astoria Hotel is a great value hotel that is conveniently positioned close to La Rambla Catalonia and within easy walking distance of the Diagonal metro station. The rooms are spotlessly clean, comfortable, modern and quite spacious. The bed was very comfortable with really good quality bedding and there is a choice of pillows. I was very impressed by the quality of the hotel considering the price we paid and would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,10,10
59,Great value for money,"We spent 4 nights here and overall was very pleased with all the facilities.

We had a front facing twin room which had a sofa, desk, chair, flat screen tv, separate bathroom, small hallway, air con, phone, large wardrobe, mini bar.

There was plenty of space and we really relaxed after long days in Barcelona.

The hotel itself was very classic in an art noveau style. Very high ceilings awash with marble throughout- the staircase was Art Deco- all 8 levels again in marble- the photos show how amazing this was. There is a lift too...

The room did have lots of light, however, this could be counteracted by the noise from the road below, although the window was double glazed and the shutters can be be fully lowered if you wish. I see some guests have mentioned that the rooms at the rear have no windows but I bet they are quiet.... We quickly got used to this and I suppose it would depend on what you are used to and which you would prefer?

The bathroom was again awash with marble and way higher than the expected 3 star standard. Bath with over shower, toilet, bidet, sink with a large marble top, large mirror and a large glass shelf under the sink for extra storage. Hairdryer and socket on wall. The water pressure was fantastic but take note that the hot water was scalding. The towels were changed daily if required and had the hotels monogram on them. There were plenty of shower gel, shampoo and body lotion bottles left. Shower cap and shoe shine were also provided. Lots of toilet roll provided too.

Unfortunately the in room safe was out of action but reception were more than happy to place items in their safe. 

I found the bed to be extremely hard, too hard in fact, but my husband said it was ok for him, so again, down to personal preference. I loved the soft pillow ( spare one in the top of the wardrobe) but my husband said it was too soft for him!...

We didn't try the breakfast even though it was offered for a discounted rate of 8 euros. We can recommend a nice bakery around the corner, they did lovely croissants and take away tea - I found out after a couple of days that the hotel tea was in fact cheaper than theirs (2 euro in bakey, 1.60 euro in hotel). 

Every evening we sat on the roof terrace, a lovely area with around 6 sun loungers and 3 tables with chairs. The pool is a plunge pool only, not big enough for a swim, and the fitness room is on this level too. Good views over the area towards the sea.

Wifi was good. Night porter was great, brought my cup of tea up to my room even though I said I would wait downstairs for it!

The staff were all lovely and very friendly, we were given a discounted rate on the 'bus touristic' tickets and can really recommend doing this as you get to see most of the city and can hop off as many times as you like.

The area around the hotel is considered as a more upmarket area and we felt completely safe throughout our stay- although we were in the room from 10pm onwards. This was an important factor for us. We did walk from the hotel through the city and in and around the beach area and back again but it was a hard slog. So I would say that it was on the most northern edge of the city sights, hence the use of the bus. We didn't use the metro or regular buses.

We wanted a budget break and on that note were more than happy here and would recommend for that reason. A stay in a premier inn/ travelogue would have cost the same per night but considering we were in a major city and the facilities on offer in this grande dame of a hotel impressed us.",4,2014,10,09
59,great location,"1	Astoria hotel, Barcelona, Spain
In an upmarket neighbourhood of barcelona;5 minutes walk from Passeig de Gracia.The room was rather small with a good sized  bathroom. You can sleep with the window open if you have a room to the back of the hotel. Plenty of good restaurants near by. This 3 star hotel offers excellent value for money. It has a terrace on the roof with a small plunge pool.",4,2014,10,09
59,Nice hotel in a great location,"The hotel is nice, the reception is helpful and friendly. The rooms are well decorated, level of comfort was good.This hotel a roof top pool (small though) where you can chill out. Staff and the service quality is good. The housekeeping is good as well. They provide free wifi for only 3 days and the speed is not very satisfactory. The buffet breakfast is not up to the mark compare to what they charge (may be ok for business travellers). There are many places around this hotel where one can enjoy real spanish style breakfast.The nearest metro station (Diagonal) is 10 minute walk and train station is almost at the same distance (provence). Many good places to enjoy catalan food around the hotel.Very pet friendly hotel.",4,2014,10,09
59,Good Location and Value,"Great neighborhood and not far from subway. Quiet and clean room. Good places to eat closeby. Room was small but compact and bathroom very nice. Good deal on breakfast for 2 + nights, otherwise overpriced. Front desk staff were often too busy, but helpful when available. 
Price was right. Rooftop was nice with a very small pool and sauna, but no time for that. Might stay again but would explore other options.",4,2014,09,30
59,"Not bad hotel, nothing amazing!","The room was small but clean. No complaints. Roof top pool is tiny do not be fooled that you can swim in it, it's more of a jacuzzi. Would recommend for budget travellers. Service wasn't great either.",3,2014,09,28
59,Good location. ,Good service. Clean utilities and nice personnel. 2 blocks from train station that takes you to the main Sancts station for airport transport. Didn't try the breakfast but it seems that for 2.50 euros you can get coffee and bread at local coffee shops. ,4,2014,09,21
59,"Good clean hotel, great location","After a wonderful stay at Astoria in August this year, I would happily stay again!
The room was comfortable, typical inner city hotel room, with good facilities and very clean throughout
We got really good service from the hotel, and the staff were pleasant and helpful.
The breakfast was expensive, I would recommend eating outside of the hotel because of this, but they do a deal for the whole stay which makes it cheaper.
The hotel is ideally located for all the main attractions of Barcelona, and in good vacinity to the Metro.
Overall a very good hotel, in a great location",4,2014,09,19
59,Would recommend,"We chose this hotel for its quieter location and were not disappointed. A short walk away from the metro, restaurants and ample taxis made our break easy and even more enjoyable to get to everywhere we wanted to go. The accommodation was very good, soundproofed & comfortable room with air con, mini bar, hair dryer, free wi fi, fluffy white towels & toiletries,extra pillows and very clean..........Continental breakfast was good and if requested eggs cooked to order....... The only downside I can think off is the pool area is small and in peek season would not cater for the masses...........overall for a three star hotel in my opinion it exceeded its rating. We will return and thank you Hotel Astoria.",4,2014,09,18
59,Lovely Location,"Hotel itself is OK, we had a very small room (barely any room to walk around the bed) with a window that looked out onto a wall (despite a request prior to arrival that we had a window to an actual view!). Staff weren't particularly welcoming or friendly, they never greeted us as we walked past reception each day and on check in we didn't feel welcomed and were not asked if we needed any help with anything. Just little aspects like this can really help make a stay extra special.
Rooftop pool was nice for a dip, the loungers and chairs were always taken though from the morning until later in the evening.
The location of this hotel is excellent though, out of the way of the touristy parts of Barcelona and surrounded by wonderful quirky cafes and restaurants
If you can find a cheap deal for this hotel on a website then it's worth staying here but if not then maybe try and find somewhere a little more special.",3,2014,08,11
59,Wonderful hotel in a fantastic location ,"We've just returned from a 5 night stay at the Astoria & our first ever visit to Barcelona. 
The hotel is faultless, lovely design & decor, very friendly & helpful staff & lovely location. 
We felt our room was lovely & large for a hotel, the bed was very comfortable & we had a sofa as well. The bathroom was great too, good shower/bath & separated from the main bedroom by a door off a small hallway which made the room feel much larger. 
The hotel was very clean & our room cleaned perfectly everyday. The staff were very efficient when we asked for an extra pillow & help operating the window shutters, both queries dealt with immediately. 
We had breakfast included & it was always a very wide choice of continental style breakfast, the pastries were particularly nice & replenished regularly so even if you go down later you still have full choice.
Having toured most of the city by open top bus & metro we have to say the area the hotel is in is definitely one of the nicest. Lots of lovely, traditional bars & restaurants near by, boutique shops & great transport links.
The open top bus is a great way to see the city & we got a 2 day ticket from the hotel as it was slightly discounted. You get to see some fantastic sights & can get on & off as you like. 
We also must mention a Chinese restaurant called Can Melo which we stumbled across, a block down from the hotel. The food is home cooked, traditional Chinese & melts in the mouth, exceptional value too. If your looking for an evening meal, give it a try.
We will definitely stay at the Astoria when we visit Barcelona again. ",5,2014,08,09
59,Great value hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for one night and were very pleased with the service, and the helpfulness of the staff. The room was clean and spacious by European standard. 
It was a very short walking distance to La Rambla de Catalunya. I would definitely recommend it.",4,2014,08,01
59,"Relaxed, friendly, quality.","Found a great price on booking.com and loved the feel of the hotel as soon I walked in. The guys on reception were really going out of their way not only to ensure that your hotel stay was enjoyable but also that your stay in Barcelona was exactly what you hoped it would be with great advice about where to go and what to do depending on what you wanted. The rooftop pool is small but has a great ambience and the views from up there are so nice. You can see across the rooftops to the sea. 
The rooms were comfortable, clean and spacious. ",5,2014,07,28
59,Nuetral Feeling.,"The hotel was clean and the reception staff were very professional albeit a little stiff!
The room was clean and the bathroom had all the amenities needed but as it was advertised with a seating area, I was disappointed that it only had one club chair and no table, other than a work desk, not by the seating area. 
The roof terrace was nice, although the pool is more like a large bath, but it was closed each evening, my guess is because there are rooms adjacent to it, but it would have been lovely to sit up there in the coolness of an evening and enjoy a drink or two!
We didn't have breakfast there, as it seemed expensive and the one night we went looking for dinner the restaurant was closed, and as there was nowhere in our room to sit and eat as mentioned earlier room service was not an option either!
It is close to some very nice restaurants , if a little far for some from the action so to speak!
The in room wifi was Ok, as was the shower and the bed was comfy.
I left without any real complaints but it is one of those places that you think, oh well, nice but next time we'll try somewhere else!",3,2014,07,24
59,Excellent evening,"I was invited to a birthday evening party and it was a great discovery. The first drinks we had them on the top roof with nice views (and a convenient small swimming pool) and dinner on the street level dinning room. Even being a quite group we had an excellent dinner, with nice athmosphere and excellent service.",5,2014,07,23
59,standard hotel,"we got a good price through hotels.com, so it was really worth the money. good location, not as beautiful as in the old town, but it seemed as all parts of Barcelona we saw were nice and beautiful and with lots of restaurants and bars. The small roof pool was nice. The personell were a bit short and formal. Since breakfast wasn't included, we were given a price of 8 €. Luckily I asked again before i started eating, because the actual price was 14 if you stay one night. We found a nice little street bar on the corner to the right instead, which had a breakfast offer for 4 €. Room very clean and cool design.",3,2014,07,20
59,Not bad,"Positive points : large room, loved the area as there r plenty of restaurants to chose from and the staff although understaffed keep their cool
Negative points : no hot water for many hours in the eve .....situation could have been handled better by the management simply by displaying a big sign in reception.Breakfast as in most hotels nowadays very bland .....to be fair they offered 50% off the bkt rate when I checked in....skip and try the local cafés around",3,2014,07,19
59,"Great location, great staff, great rooftop - will definitely be back again!","We've just returned from a weekend away in Barcelona and I could not have asked for a better hotel. It’s in such a great location with incredible restaurants nearby, the friendliest of hotel staff who went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed and the rooftop terrace was great to wind down on before heading out for dinner.

I agree with some other reviews about the rooms being small and not having great views however the rooms were nicely furnished and very clean, as was the whole building, so I was definitely happy to overlook this.

We're already planning our next trip out to Barcelona and we would absolutely, without a doubt, stay here again!",5,2014,07,18
59,"Average hotel, clean but nothing else","I was here on a a half business (during the week), half holidays (weekend) trip to BCN. I have to say that location is 5 minutes walk to metro diagonal and the area is nice and safe but quite faraway from main place of interests so you would probably need to use taxi or metro on many occasions. Breakfast is good, the hotel is clean, definitely more than many other hotels I have been in my life and there is no noise coming from the street (my room- window was facing the internal courtyard).
It would need to be refurbished a bit and free wi fi is very very slow. 
Overall ok, but in my opinion, If you just need a quiet, cheap and clean place it is ok (but remember the transporation costs), if you want to be close to attractions and restaurant or need wi fi for business (although I believe I remeber that they have also the higher level wi fi at a reasonable daily price), maybe you should check check some other place.",3,2014,07,17
59,A great find,"We booked the Astoria well in advance with very little knowledge of Barcelona. We were quietly surprised on check in, the location is very good. It's easy to get everywhere with a metro station just 5 mins walk away, a taxi rank opposite and many bars and restaurants in easy walking distance. 

The entrance to the hotel was very grand with some fabulous style. Whilst our room didn't quite emulate this it was clean and perfectly functional for our short stay. The shower was fab and the bed / pillows very comfy. 

The breakfast was OK not spectacular and I wouldn't have paid €14 which is the standard charge but for €8 on an offer it was alright value. If we did it again we'd probably look elsewhere. 

Despite the breakfast this is a great hotel which for the price and location we would definitely re-visit and recommend. Barcelona is a wonderful city to visit and the Astoria the perfect base to explore.",5,2014,07,08
59,Amazing hotel!,"What a great hotel. I can't say enough about it. Lovely property in a great location with the most helpful staff. Close enough to Ave. Diagonal where you can walk to La Pedrera, Casa Battlo, and the Sagrada Familia and there are not shortages of restaurants in walking distance from the hotel. The rooms were comfy and cozy and the property itself was beautiful. With an in-house art gallery in the lounge, a beautiful bar with happy hour, and a pool/spa and rooftop deck to enjoy, this hotel exceeded my expectations. The staff was wonderful and was always happy to answer any questions and whatever requests one might have. My spanish is not great and I tried to go from Barcelona to Madrid via train and the staff (forgive me, the gentleman's name who helped me escapes me) and he basically did it for me via computer and saved me a huge headache and apparently a long wait instead of going to the station. Breakfast wasn't included in our stay but for 8 euro a day it was well worth it. Delicious! All in all, I would highly recommend this property to anyone who is planning on visiting Barcelona. Reasonably priced, excellent location, wonderful staff, and divine property. When I return to Barcelona (which I hope is sooner than later) I will be staying at the Astoria Hotel!",5,2014,07,06

59,A Wonderful Hotel In A Great Location,"I visited this lovely hotel for a long week end recently. In a fabulous location it is ideally situated to visit the many sights of Barcelona, a 20 minute walk to Las Ramblas passing great architecture and plenty of bars to stop off and relax. The hotel is very comfortable, my friend and I shared a twin room which was spacious and clean. The maids cleaned the room every day and there was fresh fluffy towels. There was the usual complementary toiletries. The staff were very friendly and helpfull, a special mention to the lovely tall dark haired lady who was very kind to me when I was taken ill one morning, thankyou. The posters and paintings in the lobby and dining room are very interesting! Overall a fabulous experience and I don't hesitate to recommend this establishment! Will certainly stay there again in the future.",5,2014,06,30
59,Lovely hotel in a great location,"This hotel comes very highly recommended. It is very clean and tidy, the staff are very welcoming and helpful. A special mention has to go to the lovely tall slim lady in the breakfast room who was especially kind to my friend when she was feeling unwell.  Our room, a twin on the sixth floor, was very spacious and the bathroom was clean and well stocked with large fluffy towels and the usual toiletries. 
Check out the wonderful pictures and illustrations in the foyer (especially the risqué ones behind their special covers!!!) 
The hotel is in a quiet area with some good bars and restaurants nearby. Las Ramblas is about 20 minutes walk past plenty of cafés, bars and nice shops.
All in all a great experience!",5,2014,06,24
59,Big rooms but not a design hotel,"Rooms are good size but the hotel is not so modern, still ok but not a design hotel, it really depends on what you like. I was there for business therefore it was ok but i wouldn't choose it for a romantic break. Breakfast is ok, a bit of everything but not outstanding.
Staff is gentle and helpful.",3,2014,06,19
59,A real find in Central Barcelona,"This was a real find.  It was excellent value for this part of town.  When we first arrived I was seriously wondering if I had confused the price for 3 nights with the price per night - I hadn't!

It's a smallish, stylish hotel in a great location.  The room was not huge, but it had everything it needed.  The art on display on the ground floor is very interesting and merits a visit to the bar even if you are not staying here. Get a (reasonably priced) drink from the bar and spend an hour or two looking around.  At the cost of  3 or 4 euros for the drink, this is rather better value than some of the museums!

Unusually for a city hotel at this price, there is a small roof terrace and a tiny pool.  These were very welcome after a hot day's sightseeing

The hotel was immaculately clean.  Staff were helpful but unobtrusive.",5,2014,06,18
59,Seriously impressed,"I've never bothered to write a review before, but I was genuinely blown away by this hotel. We arrived early in the morning, we got a warm welcome from the staff on the desk, they immediately checked us in (even though check in wasn't technically till the afternoon). Our hotel room was spotless (I've never stayed in a hotel so clean), we had a twin room, it was very spacious and the shower was excellent (power shower). We then went up in the lift to the top floor where the pool and sun loungers where, its spacious, clean, well equipped and there is a phone to ring down to the bar so you are able to order drinks. The cleaners do a fantastic job at this hotel, our room was cleaned spotlessly everyday (even down to tidying our room and we where two messy young girls). It was honestly a fantastic stay. The area where the hotel is located is also businessy and hippyish, lots of lovely restaurants, fresh squeezed juice places and bakeries. 5 min walk to the nearest metro station and a 20 min walk to la ramblas. 

Lovely place and I have already began recommending it to other people.",5,2014,06,15
59,Poor expensive hotel,"We found the hotel very bad, the room was small, no balcony, with a view to some interior walls. The shower door was broken making it impossible to shower without flooding the whole bathroom and on top of everything, there was no toilet brush or any cleaner for that matter (the comments above are based on seeing two different rooms, at different floors and different sides of the hotel, not only our room, as we stayed there with some friends). 
The internet connection is really bad, unusable beyond a Google search. And the price is, really, too high for what the hotel offers. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",2,2014,06,15
59,Great hotel at a perfect value,"Being a little north from the city center (but still easily within public transportation distance), this is a a hotel that is able to offer a very affordable rate for the value in Barcelona. It was perfectly convenient for me because I was staying for business several blocks away, and I took the bus to the Rambla and the waterfront one night, and walked to the city center easily the second night.

The room I was given was clean and spacious - in fact I had a suite with a separate room up a flight of stairs including a couch and a desk. 

The front desk staff were courteous and helpful, giving me recommendations of restaurants as well as directions.

All in all the Hotel Astoria was a breath of fresh air in an otherwise unaffordable city, and provided great value and quality that made my business trip productive.",4,2014,06,12
59,Great Location to catch Bus for us!,We stayed here in May and it was perfect for my daughter and me.  The location was very nice and safe and we enjoyed the On/Off Bus as well.  Rooms were clean and quiet!  Shower was amazing!  The staff was very helpful!,4,2014,06,05
59,Good Hotel In a Good Area,"The Hotel Astoria is quite stylish and clean. It's in a safe area of Barcelona so we felt OK walking back from the Metro at night.

The nearest Metro (Diagonale) is ten minutes walk away but depends on which line you want. It's a large station and can involve a lot of walking underground.

The hotel bar and restaurant only seem to open rarely though we didn't use them. Breakfast is expensive so go out of the hotel, turn right then right again and sit in the sun at Bardot cafe and have excellent food and coffee at excellent rates. Try the Spanish omelette for breakfast.

There are no drink making facilities in the room though there is a mini bar.

Parking is available a few metres away but will cosy you around 28 EUR per day.

The staff on the desk were great - friendly and very helpful.",4,2014,06,04
59,"Nice Hotel, Perfect for a short City Break!","We stayed from 8th-11th April and really enjoyed our stay. We arrived just after midday and although we were told we would not be able to check in until 3pm, we were let into our room straight away. Staff at reception were very helpful, and seeing as this was our first visit to Barcelona, they helped us to book the bus tour and told us about the best restaurants in the area.
Our room was on the 5th floor, and although small, was spotless and well equipped. There was plenty of storage space, a working TV (although no English channels, but you don't go to Barcelona to watch TV)  and the bathroom was always clean and had a working hairdryer. The only let down was our view. Obviously I wasn't expecting glorious views from an inner city hotel, but our room was on the inside and the window opened out onto a covered courtyard, actually more like the size of a lift shaft which meant the room was quite dark. 
Originally we had not arranged to have breakfast at the hotel, but upon arrival we decided to opt in because instead of 15 euros per day as we were expecting, the breakfast was only 8 euros each when we arrived. The breakfast finishes at about half 9 and we really enjoyed it. It is continental, with bread, ham, cheeses, fruit, cereal and pastries; a perfect opportunity to stock up before a long day of sightseeing!
The rooftop is the highlight of this hotel in my opinion. There is a fair sized pool, plenty of sun loungers and tables, it is a perfect sun trap and has fabulous views over the entire city. We didn't get a chance to actually get in the pool as we were always out during the hottest part of the day, but would often sit up there after breakfast. 
The location of the hotel is really good for shopping, restaurants and catching the tour bus. Literally right behind Astoria is one of the main shopping roads Diagonal, and there are plenty of restaurants in the area- but word of advice- have a proper walk around the surrounding blocks before you choose a restaurant for dinner because as we found on our final night, there are some amazing restaurants just two blocks down from the hotel that we wished we would have tried! Likewise, the stops for the Red and Blue routes of the Bus Tours are just a couple of blocks over from Astoria. It is quite a long walk to get to the more touristy parts of the city such as Las Ramblas and Placa de Catalunya, a good half an hour walk (for fast walkers), but we found that cabs are not too expensive. 
Overall, the hotel was great value for money and was perfect for a short break, would definitely recommend it for its luxury feel and pleasant location.",4,2014,06,01
59,Amazing! From A to Z!,"We booked the hotel on a very short notice, as we literally decided to jump on a Place and celebrate my sisters birthday in Barcelona! Just before arrival I sent an email to the hotel and asked if they could wish my sister upon arrival to surprise her. We arrived and the amazing staff(one younger and one midaged guy) welcomed us, explained everything...and well informed us about Barcelona! We went up to the room which was very clean and Nice( a little bit small for my normal taste, but cant complain!) they had left a Nice note for my sister!

We stayed here 3 Nights, and the service was just amazing. I think what really was special about this hotel was the staff. All of them are just really Nice and sweet. They always helped us get a taxi..and just small stuff. On Our departure date, the manager also spoke to us and asked us about Our stay, we really felt they cared about everything! 

Also have to mention the location: GREAT!!! Love it!
Will def come back and stay again!:)",5,2014,05,29
59,Great Location,"I stayed at the Astoria Hotel for 2 weeks last year. Great English speaking staff who was cheerful and helpful. We had breakfast every day and found it a great buy for a genuine meal. Room was clean and quiet, but a little small with plenty of light. Close to most attractions and transportation. Many good restaurants and bars in the area, and lots of upscale stores.",5,2014,05,28
59,Great Stay!,"We stayed at the Astoria Hotel for 6 nights in late April. We were celebrating our 10th wedding anniversary. We had a great stay! Check in was easy, the staff speak fluent English, and were very pleasant and helpful. They gave us excellent restaurant recommendations. Our room was a nice size with lots of light. The bed was comfortable. Hotel has a nice, sunny rooftop area with a small pool where you can sit and read a book or talk. 

The hotel is located in a very nice, kinda ritzy neighborhood: the L'Eixample District, A short walk to the Metro, many great restaurants near by and some Gaudi buildings you can tour. Overall, we were extremely pleased with our long stay at the Astoria Hotel. We would definitely come back.",5,2014,05,14
59,A nice break,"My wife and I stayed at the Astoria for 4 nights in April, a shortish break. The staff were very helpful and informative during check in. The room was a decent size and quite we'll appointed, however the outlook from the window was another part of the hotel about 10 feet away and in a dark ""well"". So not much in the way of natural light. Quite a firm bed and too few pillows led to a stiff neck in the morning. The hotel is a shortish walk to Rambla Catalunya with its bars and restaurants, as well as the obligatory Gaudi designed buildings. Breakfast is a continental (funnily enough!) buffet, normal assortment of meats and cheeses as well as cereal and bread. All in all the hotel is rated as fine for a short stay, reasonably priced, clean, welcoming and quite close to the ""action"".",4,2014,05,01
59,Group Weekend,"Booked 8 rooms for 16 people from 4-8 April and we're not disappointed. A fair walk but nice walk to most touristy places. Personally it suited me as I think the further in to places like the  Ramblas the more you are likely to meet pick pockets etc. Only complaint about the rooms was the lack of light which meant me thinking I'd misplaced my cash cards, cancel them only to find them in the Safe. My fault I know but not but not helped by the lack of light. 
Breakfast was included in our price with VAT of €120 per night. I personally found plenty to eat BUT the water was not hot enough for a decent cup of tea. The was a lovely Italian restaurant La Piemontesa about five minutes walk away, out of front door turn left  and first right, then about 400yds on left. Lovely food great service.",4,2014,04,14
59,Excellent value hotel in a great location,"We returned yesterday from a 3 night stay at the Astoria. The hotel exceeded our expectations. It was a lovely building beautifully decorated in the public areas with interesting art. The rooms were extremely clean, well maintained and comfortable. The staff were all incredibly friendly and helpful, as was everyone we spoke to in Barcelona. The hotel is well located to reach all tourists spots and the underground was only 4 blocks away, and was excellent. 
Our only complaint was the breakfast- we only paid €8 each which was good value for a cold continental breakfast but there wasn't enough variety compared to larger hotels, and no hot food on offer. There are many bars, cafés and restaurants within a couple of minutes walk though, so more than enough choice if you wish it have breakfast elsewhere. 
We will definitely return to the astoria!",4,2014,04,08
59,Great place,"Lovely hotel, really nice decor, quiet rooms and amazing roof terrace with a pool.  Only complaint was breakfast - it was mainly meat, plain yogurt, some fruit, a bit of bread and stale croissants.  Not exactly worth £12 each, but loads of little cafes nearby to make up for it.  I would stay there again but probably give the breakfast a miss and pop over to Cheri around the corner instead and sit in the sun on their patio and have a fresh croissant and cafe con leche for €2.",4,2014,04,07
59,"Excellent price, excellent service, excellent place, excellent situation",We were looking for a good situation from where to get walking to every point of interest. And Astoria gave us the perfect answer. The location is perfect. And it was a grateful surprise to find such a good hotel for the price we paid. The room was large and nice looking the front street. The service was good and the breakfast more than that.,4,2014,03,25
59,A little gem at a great price,"Having to book a central hotel in Barcelona for 10 people on a budget we were a little apprehensive about what we would get for our money.  I am sure I am not the only one who is always a little sceptical when the price is low.   Turns out that this hotel in Barcelona was a great find.  It is located about a 15 minute walk from the top end of Las Ramblas but with plenty of nice cafes etc nearby.  There is also a taxi rank immediately in front of the hotel and we managed to secure lifts for all ten of us at the same time with ease.  The hotel itself is spotlessly clean, the staff extremely friendly and with the added bonus of a sunny terrace with small pool on the rooftop we could not have found better.  There is also a good nightclub Club Astoria next door which was free to enter and the drinks were not expensive.  All in all if I were to go back to Barcelona I would definitely stay here again.",4,2014,03,15
59,"Very nice stay in Barcelona -- Great Location, Wonderful Staff","Stayed here in February for Mobile World Congress. The room was nice, clean and tidy, overlooking the front street. It can be a bit noisy at night, but nothing that kept me awake. The staff here are wonderful - eager to help and provide assistance in any way. They recommended a nice restaurant right around the corner one evening (Cheri) which turned out great --- they gave me a card which gets you a free glass of cava as well ;-)

Breakfast was good -- reasonable selection of pastries, youghurt, cereals, etc. You can ask for a cappuccino or espresso as well. 

The bar in the evening is very quiet -- you have to ring the bell for service. Not a big deal really

Easy to get to the metro -- 5 minute walk to Diagonal station. Very easy walk to get to the main streets as well.",4,2014,03,05
59,Good Value City Break Hotel,"Stayed at this hotel on a 3 night mini break with BA Holidays in Feb 14. The hotel is not in the main tourist area but was easy to get to, not far from Diagonal Metro and on a good bus route, the 67 and 68 buses pass outside the hotel door for easy access down to Placa Catalyuna and the rest of the central area. There are several bars and cafes just round the corner but we had difficulty finding many restaurants in the area, which were open.....maybe it was the time of year, as the locals appeared to eat at lunchtime and tapa in the evening. This did not suit us though as the breakfast provided by the hotel was excellent with a wide variety of continental breakfast fare and English breakfast cooked to order on request. The hotel reception and communal areas are extensive and house their own museum....quaint and quirky. Our room was a standard double, a good size, plenty of storage with comfy bed, clean with free Wi-Fi. We were quite pleased that the only window faced inwards to a central courtyard that was open from the ground to the top 9th floor, not a good view. This though was not a problem for us as we did not spend any time in the room apart from sleeping and being away from the road it was really quiet.
Staff at reception were always friendly and helpful.
I would recommend a friend to stay here as long as they were fully aware that it is a good walk to the busy tourist areas or they were prepared like us to use the local metro and bus services.",4,2014,02,23
59,Short Stay,"I stay in this hotel for 3 days. The hotel is in good location. The hotel also near in restaurants & shopping place. The staff of the hotel is helpful, polite & kind. The room is good & clean. My stay here in this hotel is awesome. I will recommend this hotel to my friends.",5,2014,02,21
59,very nice stay!,"I stay here, 10 days.
the staff whas very Nice and helpfull whit me, acpesially the ladys working in the restaurant, there I did eat breakfast and dinner. Food whas good too. the room whar clean and the bed god to sleep in. there whas a roof terace whit swimmingpool on the top of the hotel.",4,2014,02,20
59,Pleasant surprise,"Our travel agent Mark Andeerson booked this and we didn't know what to expect. 
What a pleasant surprise! From the moment we walked into the loby and were surrounded by over 300 pieces art dedicateed to Opisso and Lautrec we felt we were staying in a museum. The staff was courteous and helpful. The hotel, an elegant building in the Eixample district was located next to shoping,numerous restaurants and the metro was a few blocks away. It has a gym, terrace, great restaurant,outdoor pool, although November was not good choice to take a swim. It was a great value with our room and cooked to order brreakfast was less than $85 Euro per night. We look forward to going back to Barcelona and will stay at the Astoria.",5,2014,01,15
59,Affordable and nice,"This hotel is in a very nice location in Barcelona.  Also, it is reasonably priced, and it has well proportioned rooms and a nice little bar/restaurant area.  The best thing about the hotel, however, is the excellent staff.  They were all very helpful, and we relied on them frequently as this was our first trip to Spain, and we don't speak Spanish.
Free wifi, very nice decor and a cool rooftop with a nice view where guests can hang out.",5,2014,01,05
59,Wonderful Experience,"From the moment we checked in to this lovely restored building we were impressed with the staff and the wonderful décor in the building. The free wifi was excellent and the rooftop was lovely to relax. The hotel was in a very convenient location with lots of lovely restaurants  around. Although in a quieter part of Barcelona was still convenient. We had Dinner at the restaurant  and must stay they made a fuss of the 5 of us being there and prepared a great meal for us even though they were not open on that night. We spent hours checking out all the paintings and photos in the lobby area . The rooms were not huge but clean and comfortable 
Great experience was had by all would love to return.

59,"Quiet location, comfortable beds and nice decor.","We only had one night at the Hotel Astoria before starting a cruise. The hotel arrangements were made as part of an all inclusive trip. We were pleased with the selection. The lobby is very nice with art exhibits along the walls on the first floor. There is a circular staircase that is very attractive but we opted for the small elevator.

The hotel is situated close to restaurants and the main boulevard, the Diagonal, with buses, and subway stops close by. We arrived early morning coming off an all night flight from the US. A twin bed room was ready for us for which we were very grateful. The website photo for the standard room is accurate. There is a glass top desk, night stands and lights on each side of the beds and a large closet with a light that comes on when the door is opened. The beds were comfortable. The room is not as large as chain motels in the US but that is more typical of European lodging.

Our room was on the 6th floor with a view overlooking other apartment backyards or courtyards. It was quiet for sleeping. The free wi-fi worked well during our stay.

We did not eat breakfast at the hotel. There is a nice bakery cafe that opens at 6 am to the left of the hotel and north a block. There is a pederation friendly street next to the hotel with restaurants with outdoor seating areas. We enjoyed tapas and sangria a few doorways away. We enjoyed walking in the area and felt safe. We did not check out the pool area which is on the roof. The front desk staff were helpful and friendly and spoke English.",4,2013,12,03
59,Short business trip,"Nice 3 star hotel in the middle of Barcelona.
I asked for a quiet room and that is what I was provided with. The room was not very big but had all I needed for a two day business stay, other than the Wi-Fi, although free, was like going back to dial up! Staff were very good and I would recommend the Astoria for both business and holiday makers. Very good price for a nights stay.",4,2013,11,13
59,Perfect service!,"In fact, I did not stay in this hotel. But I have what to say about it, you will see. 
I booked a room in Astoria through the Internet (HRS). But when I arrived, I was greeted by the administrator who told me that unfortunately they cannot give me the room. He was very polite and friendly and he immediately said that instead they would like to send me to another hotel of the same hotel chain and the same level. He also added that because it's such an inconvenience for me, they will pay the taxi (the other hotel is in 4 quarters) and also they invite me pfr the breakfast the next day! It was very pleasant that they not simply arranged the other room but took a nice care of me. Indeed, I could find a taxi on the corner (10 meters from the hotel) and  it was paid by the receptionist in the other hotel. Next morning I enjoyed a wonderful breakfast, which I didn't plan to have because they are so expensive now! So I guess that a hotel that takes such a nice care of people who even don't stay there must be a very nice place! Next time I go to Barcelona, I will stay there. Just to check.",5,2013,11,08
59,good 3 star hotel,ideal location for a city stop and good with relaxing pool area on roof top. hotel exhibits art exhIibition which are extremely good. hotel clean and pleasant aswell . I would go back as it is relaxing and the staff were helpful .,4,2013,10,28

59,"Comfy bed, clean spacious room.",Spent 3 nights on second trip to Barcelona. Hotel good location and room very clean and spacious. Bed was very comfortable but shower had wobbly floor tile. Excellent cafes and restaurants close by. Recommend this as good value for money. Deserves a 3.5 star rating!,4,2013,10,20
59,Great location and nice staff.. nothing else,"We spent 3 nights in this hotel. Nothing special except really great location. There is no hotel parking, so you need to use public parking nearby and to pay extra for it. There are no rooms for smokers so if you smoke - do it outside, it`s not always comfortable. We did not take breakfast, so cannot say anything about it. The room was not very big but comfortable, the bed also was not bad. We had a window looking into the street and sometimes it was a little big noisy, especially in the evening.
During our last night I was attacked by very big cocroach in the bathroom, it was unexpecting and terrible because of it. I have told about it to reception manager but I think he did not believe me.",3,2013,10,17
59,"Great location, stinky fridge","We spent three nights in Barcelona prior to a Med cruise, and stayed at the Hotel Astoria. The room was very clean, and the beds comfortable. Our only complaint was that the minifridge, stocked with items for sale, had a horrible odor that hotel staff denied existed. We used the fridge for our leftovers and beverages anyway. Great shower, but impossible to not get water on the floor. ",4,2013,10,11
59,Nice clean modern & historic,"This hotel was great. We had a clean room away from the street and it was perfect to sleep in. The tub was hard to get into, I slipped a little and really bruised my shin. Be careful. 

Located near a hub of the metro. This made metro easy. But without the noise & bustle of being right next to a metro stop. 

The hotel staff were very helpful. The pool on the roof and its views were awesome. Breakfast was great. You can order eggs (FYI). 

Thanks to Lisa Zwissler from Beach Bum Vacations for booking this for us. 
",5,2013,09,30
59,Could have been better,"Our original hotel was still under renovations so we were bumped to the Astoria Hotel. Unfortunately, we were given a room with the only window looking into the interior courtyard so we didn't get much light. The room was very small but the bathroom was large. After the first day, there was a strong smell of sewage. So strong we had to close the doors to the bathroom and I had a hard time using the facility. We should have complained but I am always reluctant to do so. Only having wifi for an hour was annoying as well. But we spent most of the time out of our room enjoying our first visit to Barcelona. The rooftop deck was a nice place to relax after a busy day.

We paid extra for the breakfast but it wasn't until the third morning that we noticed others having eggs so we ordered an omelet. It would have been nice to have been asked as we'd paid the full price for all 3 days.

Location is good. Central to sights and restaurants.  We went to a great restaurant around the corner, Bardot.",3,2013,09,29
59,Excellent hotel at the right price,"We spent three nights at the Astoria,prior to embarking on a cruise.It is a small hotel,away from the noise and crowds of La Ramblas but close to transportation networks and excellent restaurants (check out the little pastry/coffee shop 
around the corner on Diagonal.)
The fact there is a taxi stand across the street made it easy to get to the ship .The staff even took our luggage to the taxi and made sure everything was right before we left

The hotel was immaculate. The staff was extremely helpful and solved two significant problems for us (Domingo and Josef).
They even printed our ticket for us to get into Sagrada Familia which saved us an hour of standing in line.
The roof top pool and deck although small is a place to ""get away from it all"".The rooms are well appointed but not large and our safe worked fine.

Barcelona is a beautiful city to visit and when we return we will stay at the Astoria.",5,2013,09,29
59,Nice hotel fo nice time in Barca,"This hotel is much closer to down town, which gives to you comfortable connection to the all nice places in Barcelona. You can easily walk to the metro station Diagonal, just 5 minutes. Also near are very nice restaurants on street Rambla Catalunia also just 3 minutes from the hotel. Rooms are clean and comfortable. Breakfast in the hotel is sufficient for this type of the hotel. In reception desk is high level of services. I can highly recommend for 3 days stay in Barcelona!!",4,2013,09,26
59,"Astoria hotels in Barcelona, a great place to stay!!!","The Astoria hotel in Barcelona is great, you can enjoy the great hospitality of the entire staff. Very professional and kind. In addition, the location is wonderful, close to everything you want to see!! Best hotel in Barcelona, for sure.",5,2013,09,26
59,Great hotel in a good location of Barcelona,"Hotel Astoria is located in a great section of Barcelona. It is within an acceptable walking distance to Gracia, Catalunya Plaza and La Rambla. We felt safe while in the hotel and on our walks to and from it. The hotel itself was clean, new, rooms were a good size and we were in the smallest room you can book, and the staff there were helpful when called upon. There is a taxi stop, and bus line right outside the hotel, and the metro line is only a block away. Would highly recommend this hotel.",4,2013,09,21
59,"Good location, good value","We spent 7 nights in this hotel, located a few minutes away from a central metro station and surrounded by a few quality dining options. The room was a little simple but clean, and the staff friendly and helpful. We really enjoyed the large enough swimming pool and terrace on the roof... There are five sunbeds available so you may want to get there early. All in all we're happy with our stay there and can recommend the Astoria Hotel.",4,2013,09,09
59,"Great location, excellent rooms, more than expected","The location was by a metro hub, allowing us to get practically anywhere in a jiffy.  It also was close enough to see many Gaudi places within a decent walk.  Everything felt very safe there.  The hotel was immaculately clean and tidy.",5,2013,09,07
59,Enjoyed our stay; very convenient.,"Very clean room, had a frig and coffee/tea making; was a little small but was a standard room and great value for the price. Breakfast may initially seem a little expensive (extra cost)  but worth it; good variety of food, clean and nicely served.
Excellent and helpful front desk staff; very pleasant staff at breakfast.
Convenient and quiet location near ""the top"" of La Rambla.. it is a long walk if you want to do the full length of La Rambla but an advantage of being close to the action but not in the middle of the action (quiet). Metro close by.
We picked-up a Budget rental car at an office very close to Astoria..very convenient and easy to ""get out"" of the city.
Only problem we had was with the WiFi which was quite unreliable in our room and also did not work well in the lobby. Could use a hotel computer in the lobby but it was often already in use.
We had a very enjoyable stay and recommend the Astoria. We would come back!",5,2013,09,05
59,Nice break in Barça,Rooms were small and the room safe was quite hard to fathom out. Try to make sure you don't get a room facing the internal courtyard as they are a bit dingy. The property has a nice lobby and is in an attractive area of the Eixample district. Didn't have the breakfast as thought it was a bit pricy and you had to commit to it at the start or pay a higher price. Good value for money and there were cafes and restaurants in the locality. Probably not the best area to stay if you want to go out in the Barri Gotic at night and I might stay closer to this area if I return to Barcelona in future. Reception staff were very helpful.,4,2013,09,04
59,Satisfied very much with stay,"We have stayed in this nice hotel for  tree nights from 25th of August. 
Hotel's location is perfect. Not far from city center but very quiet distinct. Metro station Diagonal is 3 minutes walk away. You can reach city center even by foot walking toward nice Ramble de Catalunya street
Room was very nice especially bathroom. However wifi connection in rooms are bad, but you can go down and use lobby's wifi which is much more better.
Reception works very good.
In the evening we started here constant noise which will not allow to sleep. However when telling about it in reception we have immediately given another room to sleep till source of noise will be found next morning. New room was nice and when we ask for staying here for remaining nights they give it to us without any problem although it was superior room(we have paid for standart one). 
Special thanks to staff of receptionists for quick response and problem solution. All of them are cool guys, very pleasant and helpful and make our stay in Barcelona  an unforgettable one!!!
The only issues with hotel is poor breakfast.
I will definitely recommend this hotel to everyone who plan to visit Barcelona",5,2013,08,30
59,"Nice stuff, very clean and very good location","We have stayed 5 days for vacation in BCN, and the hotel was very good in general, only rooms are little bit small ( standart rooms). All other things were perfect. Location is very good, because you are very close to the Diagonal metro station( 2 stops to Sagrada Familia) and the shopping street. İ abaolutely recommend you to stay there gor your short holiday trips.",4,2013,08,22
59,Reliable hotel as base for visiting Barcelona,"Good breakfast.  Room quite basic but nice enough.  Not soundproofed although this didn't cause us a problem.  Good, solid, reliable hotel in a good location for visiting Barcelona.  An average 3 star hotel.  Very clean. ",3,2013,08,20
59,Luxury through marble,"This is a fine hotel, especially for the price. we did get an upgrade to a superior room, so the price was extra attractive for us.

the hotel is in the eixample district, with al major attractions at walking distance, or easily reachable by subway. eixample has some fine restaurants, some of them right around the corner. visit paco meralgo if you have the time. we had breakfast from the supermarket, so i cannot comment on that.

when entering the hotel and the room you first have a wow experience, because of al the marble that breaths luxury. however al the marble can not hide that the design of the hotel is a little bit dated and could use an upgrade to todays standards. 

the people in the hotel were very friendly and willing to help. beds were fine, airco worked perfectly. the rooftop pool is nice if you want to have a day in the hotel and still do some swimming.",3,2013,08,20
59,Awful room but helpful staff!,"Me and my boyfriend were suppose to stay here for two nights after already staying with my parents in their flat for a few nights before. The greeting was warm enough and as soon as we were checked in a young boy showed us to our room. As soon as he left and we got the chance to look around we were both very disappointed. The room felt very dingy and dirty and small. The air conditioning didn't work, we had slide doors into a little seated area that was surrounded by windows (we were on the same level as the 'pool') so we had all the sun bathers and children right outside our window, which didn't feel private at all. The pool is not a pool, as people have said before its more of a plunge pool. Either way we were not pleased with the room, we complained to the front of desk and they didn't seem shocked by our claims of the room being rubbish. They transferred us very quickly to The Gran Derby Hotel, which is a 4 star hotel rather than 3 at no extra charge. The relief when we entered the room there was unreal. I wouldn't recommend this hotel but I very much would The Gran Derby. All I can say is thank you Astoria for not making us stay in your hotel!",2,2013,08,13
59,Great value for money.  Would definitely stay again,"Great hotel.  Within €6 taxi fair away from la ramblas. Situated around the corner from av Diaganol which has a lot of expensive designer shops. Within walking distance from la pedera. Very clean, good breakfast, nice rooms, friendly and helpful staff, and a little rooftop swimming pool to top it all off.  Taxi rank just around the corner and metro within walking distance.  A great hotel for the price and would definitely stay there again",4,2013,08,11
59,nice hotel,"The hotel was nice and friendly, 5minutes walk from diagonal metro.
The room was clean and the bathroom was nice. The air conditioning was good.
Not a great view from the window but it was quiet.
Breakfast was excellent.
The roof pool and terrace were very small.
Good value for money",4,2013,08,08
59,Nice 1 night stay.,"Stayed here with my boyfriend for 1 night before going to the FIB Festival in Benicasim.
Room was basic but spotless, with nice bathroom and lovely powerful shower.
No view from room, it was facing a shaft and the back of other rooms, but this wasn't an issue for us. Didn't eat at the hotel, so cant comment on food. Hotel was clean and friendly.
This was just a stop over for us and met all of our needs, the pool on the roof terrace was small, but lovely to cool off in and a lovely bonus.
Location was fine, 10 min walk from Las Ramblas and metros within a stones throw. If you like walking, you can walk to anywhere from here.
Would stay again, but only on a short stay basis.",3,2013,08,08
59,Good value hotel in a nice neighborhood,"The Astoria 3 Hotel is in the middle of the Eixample neighborhood of Barcelona, within walking distance of several Modernista buildings and only 2 subway stops away from the Sagrada Familia. We chose this area instead of the old city, which reportedly is noisy at night (Spaniards seem to party all night, especially on weekends). The room was nice and the staff very helpful (e.g., they printed out museum tickets we obtained on-line to avoid big lines at places like the Picasso Museum and Sagrada Familia). The rooftop pool is tiny (we first thought it was a Jacuzzi), but refreshing nonetheless on a hot summer day. No breakfast comes with the price of the room, but this seems to be standard in Spain and there are plenty of cafes serving breakfast right next to the hotel.",4,2013,08,01
59,A little out of the happening,"The hotel was generally nice manned by a much mature staff to my surprise. The rooms were nice and spotless however it was difficult to get any sort of replenishment. The reception assumed that whatever was left on day 1 should be adequate. I think the hotel should realise its pretty hot in July and guests are normally taking showers more than usual and therefore they should be generous on bathroom supplies. This part was what I did not like about the hotel and its staff in reception - absolutely rude. For the price one pays, I am sure having stayed at many hotels now that replenishment should just be given and not questioned. The location is a little out of way so if you like pay a little bit more or look for something similar on the main streets...we spotted many on the way mainly boutique type hotels.

Also we arrived around midnite and the hotel couldn't find our fully paid reservation...took forever for them and finally we were given the keys. But instead of offering us a map of the city they simply and now its way past midnite handed us all brochures of sights they were booking....so first impressions really bad....I think hotel should really give its staff  a briefing being part of a reknown chain. Making us stand so long after our flight and then explaining their tours etc.",4,2013,07,31
59,Second fabulous stay,"My husband and I stayed at the Astoria for five nights in an executive room. The hotel is clean, with the rooms promptly cleaned each day to a high standard. The integrated air-conditioning systems are top of the range, maintaining a constant temperature rather than just blowing air around. The small rooftop pool area is fantastic. Reception and housekeeping staff are very polite. Service behind the bar was unreliable - staff took rather a long time to serve customers, and we were charged a different price each day for coffee, so we ended up getting a takeaway coffees from the cafe across the road. There are plenty of lovely restaurants and cafes in this area, especially on Enrique Granados. It's not a 'tourist area' so the menus are not always translated into English - a phrase book is handy!",4,2013,07,24
59,Lovely,"We stayed 10 days (broken into 7 and 3, allowing us to see two rooms) at Barcelona's Hotel Astoria in July. It's an easy walk to the metro, to a main shopping road, restaurants, and to many good sites. The hotel lobby is nice and staff are friendly, helpful, and welcoming. We were greeted every time we walked into the building, and when we checked in we received maps and were directed to the display of local attractions. The rooms presented well, and to reduce sounds at night from the hallway and bathroom, there was a much appreciated sliding wooden door. (Especially appreciated late late Friday night when the revelers returned to the hotel.) Otherwise, our rooms were pretty quiet, facing the backs of buildings so the view was pitiful, but we appreciated not facing the main street. There were a few minor issues with both rooms: in the first the drains in the sink and tub were painfully slow and the safe stopped working and needed repair; and in the second the toilet made an awful sound after it finished refilling. Other than the safe, none of the issues were important enough to mention to staff until we checked out. Beds were very comfortable, though pillows were flat and I didn't discover the extra pillow until the last day. Breakfast is nice, but not worth the money they charge unless you're a really big breakfast eater. Better to spend 3 euros on a good cup of coffee and a croissant at one of many places nearby. Note: If you do want their breakfast, we were offered nearly half price when we checked in, but the condition was that we all had to eat it everyday. We took them up on it. The one day we ordered eggs and a Spanish sausage (the name of which I don't recall), the order was forgotten and we had to repeat it to another waitress. So we didn't order again, just ate the bread, cured meats, cheeses, lettuce, and fruits at the buffet. The pool isn't really a pool, it's about twice the size of a hot tub and a nice place for a refreshing dip after you've been in the sun. Unfortunately, the pool is on the top floor and the bar is on the bottom floor, so it took some effort to have a glass of wine at the pool. As drunk as a couple of the people in the pool were, it didn't seem to bother everyone. Overall, it was a nice stay; I'd rate this as a nice 3-star hotel.",4,2013,07,24
59,A good choice,"We spent three nights there in June.  The location is good - walkable (20-30 minutes) to Las Ramblas and the Gothic Quarter, not far from the subway, and several very good restaurants nearby.  Our room had a good view onto the street below, but motorbike noise at all hours was an issue.  The lobby is lovely and our room was large and comfortable, yet the price was much lower than what we paid for smaller rooms and less central locations in Paris and London.  I'd give an excellent rating if the front desk staff made more of an effort to be helpful.  They checked us in without smiling or offering local maps or advice, as should be routine in such a hotel.",4,2013,07,22
59,Does what it says on the tin.,"This hotel is good, but it's not amazing. It does have a nice little terrace on the roof, which was the reason we chose to stay here, but the claims of a swimming pool are a tad misleading. It's more a plunge pool, which is very welcome after a little time in the sun. There was no bar upstairs though, so to get a drink you had to go from the 8th floor to the bar on the ground floor. 

The room we were in was large, but very sparsely decorated. However it seemed that was being remedied as someone came in and out up a mirror on the last day we were here. 

One big complaint that we had was that there was a safe in our room but when we asked for the key we were told that they didn't have it, they offered to keep things in the safe at reception for us, but it seemed more inconvenient to us to have to go to the front desk every time we wanted to get iPads or cameras, so most if the time we just carried everything with us.

Service was hit and miss. there was a lovely guy who was very helpful, but most of the time it was very curt and to the point. 

Before we booked we saw a lot of reviews saying more like a 4 star. I would say not. It's definitely a 3 star hotel, but that's not a bad thing, and it's a good 3 star hotel.

The location is good by the way, your a way back from the center of Barcelona, but there is still quite a lot going on, the local streets are packed full of great restaurants and bars which serve a lot better food at cheaper prices than you'll get in the center. I heartily recommend Brunch and Cake, which is about a 15 minute walk down Enric Granados. Best food I had while here.",3,2013,07,10
59,Away from high tourism traffic,"This is a great location if you want to enjoy the local activities and not get bogged down with a bunch of tourists and tourist traps. Location gives you plenty access and various travel options to include walking to many shops, genuine cuisine and very helpful English-speaking staff who's willing to give you great advice on where to eat and be apart of the culture. Beyond the hotel's location, be warned.....do not stay on the 1st floor. We had a terrible time getting sleep or rest from the day's activities due to the hotel's kitchen is just below the 1st floor. We heard conversations, banging pots and stacking dishes from 2am until breakfast. Then, you hear the breakfast crowd. The hotel's staff were pleasant, accommodating and hospitable willing to assist with any and all our requests except for switching rooms. I believe it is a 4 rating if we were on a different floor, but all I can go by is my experience and not expectations.",3,2013,06,30
59,Barcelona beauty,"My Hubbie and I booked into the Astoria only a couple of days prior our four night break. We generally research extensively but on this occasion it was a last minute unexpected treat. We were not disappointed. The hotel is an excellent 3 star hotel, it has beautiful architecture, fascinating pictures on display (some could make you go red!) and is generally clean. The pool area is small and has limited seating which was a little frustrating after a long hot day. But generally we would wait maybe 30 minutes and seating would become available. The pool is on the roof, bar staff were more than happy to bring drink orders. This is fine however on occasion younger residents were a little rowdy. I feel if staff were present in the area it would minimise any general disruption. This is only a small gripe. Overall a very enjoyable stay. I would recommend the Astoria to friends and family.",4,2013,06,17
59,Probably would not recommend,The area of town is great and highly recommend. Not far from La Rambla but not in the heart of the tourist part. Great restaurants and shopping nearby.  The hotel appears nice in the lobby but the rooms are tiny and our view was to the dirty inside of the hotel building face a dirty building wall.  Bed was not to comfortable.  Did not know until the next morning our room was located next to the maids closet which was in full use and slamming doors starting early in the morning.  Not the most pleasant experience and there are many hotels in the same area that potentially are nicer.  I stayed at the sister property Hotel Balmes and would choose that first before this one.,2,2013,06,13
59,5 day stay in standard room (6th Floor)  Astoria / Carrer Paris / Barcelona 6/2013,"Generally a fine stay and breakfasts made all the more pleasant by the waitress staff who smiled and made my day. NB Breakfasts seemed to include cooked eggs/bacon and chorista (mild chorizo - this is a must) but not every day was there a little card on the table advertising this but staff were happy to make up the hot plate every day.

Room OK but being used to peaceful surrounds there is some clatter from the marble halls and next door but to be honest its a city, I was on holiday and after walking 7 hour days it meant nothing (at the end of the day .. sorry terrible expression).

Room furnishings good (standard room) and lighting OK but a little dark and the reading lights were not directing light at a book but at the bedside table. Not major but when researching a new destination the next day a bit of a pain.

Free exhibition of Opisso's work in reception area absolutely brilliant and we visited this several times so now very interested in his work. Reception and breakfast area tasteful

Taxi rank outside v.useful and area safe and easy.

I asked for a room facing a sad 'courtyard' really an exadurated central utility shaft but not interested in complaining as no desire to stare out of a window in Barcelona but I think this makes it quieter than a room overlooking the main road. All roads in Barcelona rumble and scream with cars and bikes more than in London but I got used to this so it's not problem.

Generally a good stay but if anything exists in the Barri Gothic (old city) where the streets are filled with walkers and not cars only I would try this next so I could have a view and limited noise.",3,2013,06,10
59,Great for the pirce,"had 3 lovely Days here, the hotel location we loved as it is quiet area, the rooms clean and the staff friendly. We had a quick dip in the pool but it is small but thats all you need, your in Barcelona your out all day !!",4,2013,06,06
59,Convenient location and reasonably priced,"Great location for shopping, next to la ramblas. Central to many bars, and clubs. 
Hotel reasonably priced, good size rooms and bathroom. 
Less than 10min walk to a metro stop that has multiple lines.
Near to central station as well, taxi was about 7euros if I remember correctly.",4,2013,06,01
59,great !!,"Stayed at this hotel a few years back but I was impressed with the great service provided to the guests. I recommend this hotel anytime. Clean rooms and a great breakfast !! The location is also very good but you must bear in mind that the city is huge and therefore you need to take the bus to certain attractions. However if you have an urge to walk, then go for it !! The other guests also seemed to like this hotel as every service was given out with a smile. Congratulations to the hotel staff.",4,2013,05,31
59,"Place to stay,","Upon arriving, the hotel is simply beautiful, the pictures don't do it justice. We were first shown a quite small room and a bad view, after going back to reception and saying that we have paid for a superior room we were then shown two more rooms. One was on the 7th floor and had a couch and a TV on a separate floor accessed by spiral stairs, (we didn't see the use for this) so we chose a room on the 5th floor, this room had a couch and a better view. 
Do not be confused by the way superior rooms are advertised on their website, you may not receive the room with a balcony with tables and chairs, the hotel said that there are lots of different types of superior.
Staff couldn't be more helpful, when trying to find out about visiting Salou for the day one staff member talked us through the trains and info over the desk, then later rang our room to tell us about an offer we could get if we booked the next day - very kind.  However when leaving, not even a simple 'hope you enjoyed your stay' or even a goodbye, that's just me being fussy but I think that with the hotel choice available in Barcelona, it would have been nice and I appreciate the small things! 
Roof terrace is beautiful, main reception is also gorgeous - we didn't have breakfast so cannot comment however we were offered it for 8euros upon arrival.

Overall a lovely hotel, short walk to metro and walkable distance to Barcelona Sants. However, If we returned to Barcelona I think we would look at somewere a little more central.",3,2013,05,22
59,"Friendly staff, clean rooms","I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights and I must say that this hotel is wonderful. The staff are helpful and friendly, rooms are clean, price is good, location is great and breakfest is very good. 
I recommend this hotel to everyone!",5,2013,05,21
59,Great stay in nice area,"Hotel Astoria is a great place to stay if you want to be a bit away from the most touristic areas of Barcelona. We loved the surroundings with a great number of restaurants, bars and cafes...and mainly catering for the people living or working in the area. A bit upscale district with very good connections to old town and the Rambla. Small rooftop pool, good in the morning or after a long walk in town. Very nice rooms, big enough and well taken care of. The hotel is better than we expected and very nicely decorated. Great service and clean and tidy. We will definitley stay there again.",4,2013,05,20
59,"Astoria Hotel Barcelona, do not miss!","We went to visit Barcelona in mid- April to get so much needed sun. We have been to Barcelona a number of times and booked the Astoria when we got a great 4 day deal. The Hotel is excellent, very clean and modern. The staff were excellent and very helpful and patient. The rooftop terrace is great for relaxing after a long day. A glass of wine and just sit and look out across the city to the sea.

The hotel is in a great location which is a residential and commercial area with lots of good shops and restuarants. It is not a heavy tourist area and you get to have your morning coffee and breakfast with the locals (I recommend Cafe Paris which is just on the corner, excellent!) The Trobador Restuarant is right beside the hotel and the staff were excellent and helpful. The manager was particularly helpful and replaced a bottle of wine which was undrinkable with a very good wine without fuss. The Argentinian style steak is worth waiting for. 

There is a taxi rank right beside the hotel and a metro withing 10 mins walk which will bring you down to La Rambla (why you need to go there is your business, we found it crowded and tacky) But try the Patagonia bar mid way down as the staff are friendly and there is a good atmsophere there with good views from upstairs out onto the streets.

Overall I cannot recommend The Astoria any stronger. It is convenient to the sights but has a lovely laid back feel and you get to mix with the locals and not the crowds of tourists working to an itnerary. It suited us just fine as all we wanted was a place to relax and take in some warm sun.",5,2013,05,16
59,Good location for a good price,"We were very happy with our 5 night stay here. Good location in a pretty calm area with lots of close by restaurants. it is also just a few blocks away from both passeigio de Gracia and Catalunya with all its sights and restaurants. The staff are also very friendly and helpful. 
We were initially given a room with no real windows facing a side Wall in a shaft, but they offered us to switch rooms which we did after one night. We then ended up on the fifth floor in a very much newer, quieter and cleaner room with a large window facing an inner garden. All and all good, but i wouldnt recommend accepting the rooms in the back.",4,2013,05,10
59,Stylish elegance!,"We have just got back from a 3 night stay, we had such a great time, the hotel was a step back in time to an elegant period, marble throughout, beautiful spiral staircase leading to a rooftop plunge pool & sun terrace. There was a large collection of vintage musical & theatre posters decorating the breakfast room. It is located just away from the main tourist area, but walkable to all the landmarks. The staff were very welcoming & friendly. Best Tapas & meal was a 10 min walk away at ""Crosmas"", on the Carrer Corsega. Overall a perfect city break!",5,2013,05,10
59,Very good value,"We could not have made a better choise. We enjoyed everything about this hotel,comfort ,quietness, cleanliness, friendly, and a great location. We will recommend this hotel to all of our friends, having been recommended by friends in the first place!!",5,2013,05,08
59,Elegant!,"Booked this through hotwire, which of course doesn't provide the hotel name so we were happily surprise and got a great price. 
It's a very elegant, and stylish hotel with a marble entrance, and two small, but attractive elevators. 
It's strategically away from main venues like La Rambla, but if you're really here to see Barcelona you won't mind at all walking a bit in this beautiful city that's just a smorgasborg for the eyes.
Trains are a short distance as are any buses. 
We had a problem with sound emanating from construction in our room, and the staff moved our belongings for us to another without a fuss AND provided us with a free breakfast.
Reviewer jessjessp stated ""buffet breakfast all that was provided was basic cereal and juice, no toast, no eggs, no meats, nothing that you would expect at a buffet breakfast at all and the price is expensive for what you receive!""
Nothing could be more wrong. The breakfast is quite extensive with the staff available to prepare eggs any style and plenty of  croissants and other breads, cheese, ham, juices, fruit, coffee etc. readily available. It's quite extensive AND they have cereal and granola if you want that too. 
And at a price of only 8 Euros this all you can eat buffet is a steal, compared to your average breakfast which runs around 5 Euro and up for coffee and a baguet with some cheese.",5,2013,05,06
59,"Nice, old fashioned hotel.","I stayed for 4 nights to explore the city after a business trip and found the hotel perfect. The service was brisk and friendly and the shower hot, although wall-mounted above the bath. The bedroom had a separate door to cut out passage sounds and, since I asked, I got a dark inward-facing room. You can swing a cat in it, but if it wasn't dead when you started it would be when you're done. Not large, but fine for two people who appreciate that Barcelona is too thrilling a city to spend time in your room! Larger than a UK hotel room though. Close to public transport in a very quiet, safe, upmarket area. The bed was ok, but the pillows too flat. I also think €10 is too much for breakfast, although I normally try not to eat in my hotel if I can avoid it since they're hardly ever good value and more exiting offers abound just a block away. No coffee in the room, but the sheets, bathroom and bedroom were very clean. The laptop safe was also nice and roomy. Aircon worked fine. I would stay here again, even with a companion.",4,2013,04,29
59,What a nice surprise!!!,"One of my friends made me change my previous reservation in Barcelona at the last minute
Before my leaving. I am so happy I did!!! The hotel is so personal, people there made you feel
Welcome and help you with everything, rooms are clean, the situation of the hotel cannot be
Better, breakfast are very good. And the prices cannot be beat.  We will certainly stay here when
We are in Barcelona.",5,2013,04,07
59,Not impressed for what you pay for!,"The hotel is quite far walking distance from the beach and la rambla.  The room was terribly small and the wifi Internet did not work in my room, even though the receptionist insisted that it did.  I had to go down to the lobby to use the Internet every time.  I came back to the hotel around 14:30 for a siesta and the room had not been cleaned yet.  I was just about to make a complaint when the maid came in to clean the room, so I left.  I was not impressed for what I paid for and some of the hostels I stayed at were much better.  It's not conveniently located unless you want to do lots of walking.  I would not stay at this hotel again.",3,2013,04,04
59,Stylish Hotel,"We stayed in this hotel for a weekend break in August. Hotel is a short walk from las ramblas and all main amenities in Barcelona city centre.Rooms are great all modern style, there is no view from the room (ours was elevator shaft) but who stays in the room when you are in beautiful Barcelona. The hotel has a roof top swimming pool which was very handy to relax in the afternoon. 
Very pleasant stay!",5,2013,03,20
59,Perfect,The Astoria Hotel and it's staff are very good. If you should have any questions or problems the staff are there to help. The accommodation and location is brilliant. I am a senior citizen and have visited Barcelona many times and always stay at The Astoria because I feel safe and am out of the really busy parts. I can visit those whenever I want to (and do!). The buffet breakfast has everything you need and is good value. Metro and buses are very close by. I recommend this hotel to everyone who wants a stress free holiday in Barcelona. Can't wait to go again.,5,2013,03,19
59,Not impressed,"This place has good reviews and was recommended by the travel agency in Australia as a luxury hotel. This was the worst accommodation we had while travelling around Europe some of the middle class or budget hotels we had were 5 star in comparison. Our room was on the 8th level, the lifts do not go that high (which are also very slow) and the stairs to the room are not luggage friendly. The roof in the bathroom is on slant making having a shower for anyone over 5ft5"" difficult, not to mention it flooded the bathroom every shower, this caused issues as the hotel would not provide any extra towels for this or to use the pool, they expected us to use the bath towel for shower and pool use (and that's luxury??) Dont waste your money on the buffet breakfast all that was provided was basic cereal and juice, no toast, no eggs, no meats, nothing that you would expect at a buffet breakfast at all and the price is expensive for what you receive! Lastly the location, its not ideal if you want to look around la rambla, be close to the beach end of barca and also be where it is all happening, this location is more suited to business travellers and families that dont want to be near the loud night life, keeping in mind if you want to walk to these arrears it takes a while. The metro is close enough which is good.",1,2013,01,11
59,Very good location and nice staff,"The Astoria hotel is located in a very central area of Barcelone. For those who like to walk you can almost do everything walking. The area is very safe and we found the very best restaurants in town just nearby !
Some rooms have been newly renovated and are very comfortable (we really loved the room facing the courtyard we had as it was really quiet).
Staff is really kind and would always assist you the best way they can.
We found this hotel a very nice quality for value...",4,2012,12,30
59,very good because of the central location,"We have been there several times - the last time we spend 3 nights in July.
The hotel is very central but in a narrow street. So it is quite calm during the night. 5 minutes walk to the next subway station. 2 minutes walk to the avenue Diagonal and 5 minutes walk to the Passeig de Gracia.
Hotel was build in the art deco style which is very nice. Nice rooms with good beds. Very clean.
Breakfast buffet is great.
Very nice terrace on the roof top with a terrific view over the roofs of Barcelona.",4,2012,12,28
59,Great hotel if you get for 120-140 USD dollar range,"I want to start by saying I love the city of Barcelona! I lived there in college and returned for a visit with my husband. The last time we were there when I was 19 then 22 and we stayed in hostels. THis was certainly a nice upgrade. The hotel was worth the 120 dollars a night which we paid for in September through hotels.com.  It didn't include breakfast but the hotel was modern and decorated tastefully.  If you can get it on sale around this price it is worth it. Also, the front desk staff were so friendly. If you stay here Bar Paris on the corner great for a quick tapa.  Even better, for dinner GO TO:
 Cerveceria Catalana
C/ Mallorca, 236, 08008 Barcelona, Spain (Eixample) 
It is AMAZING...reasonably priced and I dream about it. AMazing. One of the BEST meals of my LIFE!!!!

ALso, it is a 20 minute walk to Placa Catalunya where you catch the bus to airport. The hotel concierge said there was a bus that goes to Placa Catalunya but we walked instead. OUr flight was early and we didn't want to chance getting on wrong bus. This is a great neighborhood to stay in.",5,2012,12,09
59,Great location,I really loved Barcelona so I don't know if the I am too exciting in writing this review. I felt that the hotel was in a perfect location to go and explore and see the sights. It wasn't in a tourist area which is part of the reason why I chose Astoria. The staff was friendly and spoke good english.,4,2012,12,05
59,Good 3 star hotel,"We chose this hotel because it was the best price - quality ratio we could find, plus it had a pool and was still within walking distance of several major attractions. 
The room and bathroom were fine although the pillows could have been a bit more substantial, but that's a personal preference. The bathroom amenities were great and the everything was cleaned well on a daily basis. The pool was also a lovely addition - it wasn't ideal weather but we braved the terrace one late afternoon and it was well worth it. 
We didn't have breakfast here and the wifi was a bit hit and miss but that wasn't overly important on a holiday.
I would definitely recommend this hotel for a short break in one of the best cities in Europe.",4,2012,11,05
59,Great little hotel,"Stayed here for four nights and we were very pleased, the hotel is clean and classy rooms are fairly large and modern. The hotel is situated in the middle of everything the Diagonal station is a short stroll away but still away from the hustle and bustle of la Rambla so not very noisy. The only thing that was annoying but this has already been said by another reviewer is that the room we were in didn't really have any natural light so I felt confused by what time it was, and the room needed more light. Reception staff were helpful we didn't have breakfast but it looked very nice. You can get a taxi from outside the door and we easily navigated ourselves around with help from the top 10 things to do in Barcelona book. We bought a T10 metro ticket not a 3 day as it was cheaper and it lasted us the whole trip. Be prepared to queue for the Picasso museum and other popular attractions, and for a longtime. We ate in a place called Tragaluz one night which was expensive but very special and visited Hard Rock ( Hard to get a table here) We got a taxi from the airport It was about 30 euros but it was 10 euro extra as it was a Sunday, it only takes about half an hour. Ladies there is a hair dryer in the room which was great. The shower was powerful and the beds comfy not much in English on the tv but we didn't watch it much. On the whole we had a fab time and would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2012,11,01
59,"Great hotel, great location",The Astoria Hotel is a beautiful hotel located close to all attractions in Barcelona. The room was very comfortable and clean. The employees are very welcoming and helpful. Fine restaurants are within walking distance as well as shopping and major sights. I have to also say that the employees were very honest. My parents left a wallet in their room with money and ID's. After a week of leaving the hotel for another destination they realized they were missing the wallet. They called the hotel and the wallet with all the money and ID's was returned. We will definitely return to this hotel.,5,2012,11,01
59,Central 3 star hotel,"The hotel is very central and clean. We were very pleased with this hotel, we booked the superior room and it was good value. The people at reception were always very helpful.

We walked everywhere from this hotel.

My only issue would be that the wifi is not free. I find this disappointing and most hotels nowadays have this included. 

You get 90min per day but once you log in the clock starts ticking so even if you log off you will still be running out of time. After that you can buy more time. 

Otherwise you can pick up the free wifi at the reception. Note that that this is a different account and you need to cancel the one in the room before you can log on.

A cab to the airport on Sunday night was €35.",4,2012,10,29
59,Enough but not the best,"I stayed 3 nights with my Friends. Clean and accessibility is satisfying, but not that safe. One of my friend got stolen her bag at the cafeteria of the hotel in the morning. I found that this hotel is not liable for pickpockets and cannot protect guests from pickpockets. So you should be careful by yourself. 
But other than that, I was satisfied with hotel condition and overall mood of the hotel. ",3,2012,10,27
59,Worth staying slightly off the beaten track,"This hotel is about a half hour walk from la ramblas.
I personally prefer this area to la ramblas as it feels much safer and abit more classier. 
I booked the superior room hoping to get a view and terrace/ balcony. 
I did not realise when booking though, that the hotel has only one room with a terrace, which is used on the website to represent their superior room category- so please be aware of this as it is a little misleading. 
Our room however, on the third floor was spacious with a seperate sitting area. This was a little awkward to use though as it was almost like an entrance hall and not very comfy. 
Upon speaking with the staff, I was shown two alternative rooms on the 8th floor- a duplex and a room with a conservatory. Whilst I preferred the living spaces in these rooms, they had not bring refurbished and were a little old and smelly to be honest. The rooms on the third floor appear to have been completely refurbished compared to the eighth floor. 

The room was immaculately clean and the bathroom finished to a very high standard. Albeit the furniture is very basic. 
The daily cleaning was very good and unobtrusive. 

The pool on the roof is very small but to he honest we didn't use as too cold, but we did sit on the roof with a drink and a cake one afternoon to take in the view of the city. 
To summarise- 
The Astoria is a truly lovely building, exceptionally clean with extremely polite and helpful staff. It was relatively quiet for a hotel in Barcelona. I would recommend this for couples wanting a peaceful place to stay. 
If I could change a couple of things about this hotel, it would be to add tea and coffee making facilities to the superior rooms and for all the rooms to be of the same decor standard as the one we stayed in as I would be very disappointed if I had been allocated one of the rooms that hasn't been done yet. 
",4,2012,10,26
59,Make sure your room has a window,"The astoria is in a GREAT location in Barcelona, close to Paseo de Gracia, Rambla Catalunya and lots of great shops and restaurants.  It's a unique location that allows you to walk to Plaza Catalunya or to Touro Park or Gracia neighborhoods.  The hotel is clean and recently rennovated and has an excellent breakfast buffet.  And the rooms seem well-priced,  a good value.   One problem, my room basically has no window... just a window facing an interior corridor with almost no natural light coming into the room.  This is especially bad if you are coming from many time zones away and are trying to adjust to a new time.  Also, free wifi is limited to 90 minutes, but you can purchase a day pass if you need to work.",3,2012,10,21
59,Barcelona Delight. . .,"We took a long weekend (Thursday to Monday) to Barcelona at the end of September and specifically booked the Astoria Hotel based on the feedback given on tripadvisor. 

We weren't disappointed at all !

Whilst the Astoria is in a quieter part of Barcelona, it has lots of lovely bars, restaurants and terraces nearby and overall felt safer than the hustle and bustle in the Las Ramblas area.

The Hotel itself was lovely - very clean, beautiful marble everywhere, fantastic staff (in particular Louis and Fernando on Reception and the Restaurant staff), lovely food and service.   The roof terrace and pool - albeit small ! - were a welcome retreat and a chance to see all of the city from a height. 

There's a bus stop literally across from the Hotel which can take you to the Placa de Catalunya (where Las Ramblas begin) and it only takes about 8 minutes or so for 2 EUROS each way. 

Thank you so much tripadvisor and Astoria - we will DEFINITELY be returning again soon and would highly recommend this Hotel to anyone!!!!",4,2012,10,13
59,Recommended,"This hotel served our purpose, excellently. We needed a pleasant room prior to boarding a cruise, it is ideally situated, with helpfull & friendly staff, making a very  enjoyable stay.",5,2012,10,08
59,Great hotel with excellent staff!,"This is the second time that I stay in a Derbys Hotel in Barcelona. The first time I stayed in Derby Hotel near diagonal. And this time I stayed at Astoria Hotel and it was a pleasure as well. The location was very good, not too far from the city centre but far enough to not be disturbed during night time. The service was exceptional and the hotel itself is very clean and acommodating. I found the staff very helpful, nice and if there were any problems they fixed it within a short period of time. 
The terrasse was also a pleasant surprise with a beautiful view over Barcelona as well as a pool, although I didn´t use it, it looked very nice. 
Another thing I found great was the breakfast buffet; cereals, bread, juices and my favourite, croissants and a lot of others things, I could also order eggs and bacon, without any additional cost. 
It was also interesting with the exhibition of art, I don´t remember the painter´s name, but there was a little gallery which we enjoyed as well. 
The next time I go to Barcelona, we would love to come back to Astoria, and I really recommend this hotel if you want a nice hotel with very kind and helpful staff!",5,2012,10,04
59,Terrific hotel & staff!,"We spent many hours online reviewing the many hotels in Barcelona and finally selected a different hotel.  Two days before our trip we found out they could not accommodate us as planned, so we had to go with plan B, Astoria Hotel.  We are SOOOO glad to have made this change.  The location was perfect, right off Avequina Diagonal and two blocks from Playa Catalunya.  We got to the hotel very early, 9:45 but were given access to one of our rooms within the hour and the second room 30 minutes later.  The rooms were very nice, exceptionally clean.  One of our rooms had a small sitting area outside the bedroom and although our rooms were low and on the street, we could barely hear anything from outside.  We walked (long walk) to Sagreda Familia, to Las Ramblas, to Palais Gaudi and La Padrera, a flamenco show and home from the L'llia Shopping center with no problem. The lobby of the hotel was utilized all day by us and other guests; the staff was extremely friendly, helpful and accommodating.  We had breakfast each morning in the hotel restaurant with rolls, croissants, cheese, meat, cereal and didn't realized until the last day that we could order eggs to go with the breakfast.  Everything was delicious.  We also had a fantastic lunch there our last day, when the staff told us we could hang out as long as we needed to get our afternoon train.  I can not think of a single negative about the Astoria Hotel.  Oops one thing - workout equipment needs updating!",5,2012,09,21
59,Great,"near the shops, metro, restaurants
friendly people, room is very clean
pool to small
will be back again",4,2012,09,08
59,Good location and reasonable price,"We used trip advisor to help up select this hotel for our summer trip in July 2012.  We arrived to a very nice lobby but our room was not ready so we had to wait until about 3pm.  We entered the room and my son went to use the bathroom and the door fell off the hinges, so we requested another room and were given another room but it was much smaller.  We did have a refrigerator in the room but it was already filled with Hotel snacks and drinks that they want you to buy from them.  We removed and placed most of the drinks in a plastic bag and put it on the desk near the fridge so we could store our own food and drinks in the fridge.  (just remember to replace all the original contents of the fridge or you will be charged probably more than you spent on the room)  You may want to take a picture of the contents of the fridge to help you in this process and to use as proof if there are any issues at check-out.

The hotel was clean and within walking distance from the ramblas (about 20 min walk)

You should use the Diagonal metro stop because it is the closest to the hotel.  If you plan to be in barcelona for several days you may want to get the metro/bus daypass it pays for it self if you plan to take 5 rides per day on the metro or bus, plus it gives you the flexibility to get on and off the buses or metro as many times as you want.

We also rented bikes to ride along the boardwalk near the beach and that was really enjoyable.

Near the hotel there is a supermarket about 3 blocks away and lots of restaurants nearby that are reasonable.  

There is free wifi/internet in the lobby, and you can also use it for 1 hour in your rooms.  They also provide a PC connected to the internet in the lobby, but they do not enforce a time  limit so you could wait for a long time for people who think that the hotel PC is their personal PC to chat and view FB.  They should enforce a 30 minute limit per session like other hotels where you have to enter your room number and name and it allows you to connect for up to 30mins at a time them it kicks you off for at least 30mins.  there were some people that were on the pc for several hours.  Overall the hotel has clean rooms, a pool, wifi and is a good value.",3,2012,08,27
59,Brilliant hotel and staff,"I stayed at this hotel with my teenage son from 19th - 23rd August 2012.  We could not fault it in any way.  The room (424) was large with plenty of cupboard space, very comfy beds and reasonably priced mini bar.  It, along with the bathroom was immaculately clean as were all the public areas in the hotel.  The hotel was quiet and well located for the Barcelona tourist bus and other public transport.  Staff were very polite and helpful at all times, even at 01.30am when we got in from seeing Barca play!  Very quick wifi in the front of reception - just ask for the network and password.  We had a great stay and would reccommend to anyone.",5,2012,08,24
59,It was really good - good place and best location for living,"I stayed several times in Barcelona and now I understand it's one of the best areas of the City. It is quiet and lovely.
I dont like to stay next to Rambla, in Gotic area or Chinese ... It's noisy, smells bad and dangerous when you walk home in the night. There are a lot of people from Pakistan  who sell everything and run from the police... as well as different kind of punks, tourists and others who are really noisy. 
It's better to live in next residential area to this one. 
The atmosphere is nice in this place. It's great to have a swimming pool in the roof. But there are 2 rooms which look at the pool - you can not trouble them in early morning (swimming calm ;) and it's closed in the late evening.",5,2012,08,24
59,Room with daylight would be nice!,"
Got back last night. Never usually write reviews despite being a frequent holiday maker. However, this appalling hotel infuriated me so much that I need to get this off my chest! Booked this for a romantic summer break fort my fiancé and I.

+'s
It's in Barcelona .... Need I say more! Beautiful place!

-'s 
Here we go ....
Window opens on to a a concrete void/internal wall. Room as a result does not receive daylight/fresh air! Had to switch on the tv every morning to check the time as we were unable to confirm sunrise!!!!

Filthy water in the pool - toenails, feathers and empty beer cans.

Room was tiny!

Crack in the bathroom sink.

Beds extremely small and uncomfortable

Had a 5 euro note stolen from the worktop in the room by cleaning staff that I accidentally left out whilst sight seeing in Barcelona. To see whether or not this actually happened, I deliberately left a one euro coin on the floor the following day as 'bait' and low and behold, it also disappeared!

Staff very rude and have no time for you at all. Felt a total inconvenience.

On day of departure/checkout, I asked to book a courtesy room to shower and freshen up before setting off for the airport. Was told that they didn't have one and that we would have to use the shower on the pool deck in the open air/full view of every Tom, Dick and Harry! Unbelievable! I have always had access to a courtesy room - isn't this common/good practice? Staff didnt even apologise or bothered!

Once I had come to terms with the 'tramping manner' in which we had to shower and change before heading for the airport, I asked could I at least borrow one towel to share between my fiancé and I. I explained to staff that as a result of traveling with easyjet and binging one piece of hand luggage, we did not bring towels knowing fully well hotels provide towels for the guests. However, staff refused point blank to lend us a towel as we had in theory checked out 12pm that day! Crazy!!!! Staff did not seem bothered at all. When I questioned this, the young receptionist asked a senior member of staff. He simply said no and shrugged his shoulders. As a result, we had to shower in the pool area in full view of sunbathers, traipse down 8 floors sopping wet with cases and get changed in the toilets in reception, using our dirty laundry to 'towel dry'!!!

Hotel accessible by anybody as hotel is open 24hrs a day with no security measures in place.

Do not visit this place!

59,Great value for a 3 star hotel,"My family and I staid at the Astoria from August 12th to august 19th 2012 and really appreciated the hotel.  I used the pool on the roof and, even though it is small, it was really appreciated after a day of walking around Barcelona.  The service was always curteous and fast.  I did asked for extra pillows and they were provided within minutes.  The location is excellent because its is in a quieter area of the city and only a few minutes away from buses and metro station.  The breakfast was included and was good.  Card infroming guess that hot selections like eggs, bacon and other things were avaialbe on request were left on table so all guest woukld know about the service.

Our rooms were on the first floor.  The one with a view of the street had a view however it can be noisier ( not a real problem since the area is in a quiet negihbourhood and the patron from the bar across the street did not make much noise).  The other room was an inside room which was quieter but with a view of a inisde wall.  Size of the room was good for europe standards.",4,2012,08,20
59,was robbed by two men in the lobby and the hotel staff did nothing,"Safety is a big concern here since there is no control over who enters the hotel or where they wander. Also they do not honor the prices you book on the internet ""prices change daily madam"". My particular room had a view of the elevator shaft for 84. euros a night. Dinner is only for reserved group bookings not hotel guests. Also, I was told to move my car by 9 am or it would be ticketed. It was towed at 7 am which cost 170 euros.
No internet connections in the rooms even if you pay for it.
I was concerned for my safety and that of my teenage children staying in this hotel.",1,2012,08,18
59,A clean and tidy hotel...but in need of of few improvements.,"I had a fairly pleasant stay here. There were a few let-downs....like the gym!...no treadmill and no kettle bells as shown in the online picture of the gym. One reason I booked this hotel!
The pillows in the room gave me a bad neck and the bathrooms are not big enough for bidays as they were in the way.
Most of the staff were really lovely and helpful apart from the guy that does the late/night shift on reception......very rude!",3,2012,08,16
59,Convenient Location but with rooms of dungeon view,"As mentioned in the other reviews, the location of the hotel is not far from the actions. It is only a 10-minute walk to the famous shopping streets (Passeig de Gracia) where there are lots of restaurants. There is also a supermarket near the hotel and a very nice Italian restaurant down the road (Aribau). It is a 20 minute walk to the nightlife down Calle de Aribau to the discos and bars in L'Exiample.

The hotel provide free wifi in the lobby. If you bring your own device, you can have access to the internet but there is only one computer for guest use.

The room I was given was bigger than I expected. There is even a two seater. The bathroom is quite clean and spacious. However, when I looked out from the window in the bedroom, I could only see pipes and windows of other rooms. It is very dark even in daytime. I bet the design of the building is like two squares if you look at it from the top. If you are staying in the rooms around the inner square, pipes and windows are all you can see. It feels like being in a dungeon as the inner square in quite small.

I did not use the pool on the rooftop. It seems nice but very very small. 

Don't bother about their breakfast. The listed price is 14 euros per person but they do offer a discounted price. There are several cafes right next to the hotel. They offer breakfast for less than 3 euros.

The staff of the hotel are nice in general but not professional enough. When I ask one of the staff how long it takes to go to the airport, he gave me a very uncertain answer and was not very informative, polite though. By taxi, it would be around 20 euros excluding the lugguage charge (5 euros for my two baggages).

Anyway, Astoria is not a bad hotel but would choose a hotel with a view.",3,2012,08,14
59,"Fantastic hotel, would definitely recommend","Lovely hotel, with very helpful staff. Prior to arrival I requested a room with a view if possible, and was given a fantastic room with a brilliant view...I could not have asked for a better room.
The staff at reception were very helpful with providing directions, as well as answering room service requests within minutes.
The hotel was very well maintained, and very clean- the maids left the room perfectly.

Only minor downside was that the WIFI in the lobby crashed a couple of times, but this was only for a few minutes.

Overall- a brilliant hotel, and one I would definitely recommend and stay in again.",5,2012,08,12
59,Decent but nothing special,"Apparently they have refurbished the rooms but this is nothing special.  Not bad, not great.

Rooms are ok, big enough and bathroom is nice. Toiletries are good too.

Breakfast is continental buffet with nice local meats and cheeses.

Location is a little out of it of you like to walk but it's 10 minutes walk from the underground.",3,2012,08,03
59,good hotel,good hotel! nice little pool on the roof an terrace but get there early if you do not want to fight for a sun bed.. location was good if you want to be in the centre the beach and la ramblas and the cathedral are far to walk maybe but thats expected with how big barcelona is. to get on the city tour bus is only a short walk away. i liked the hotel my only concern was the room we stayed in 131.. the security in the room is bad! in the bathroom there is a square loft type door on the ceiling you can see up and push it up an see that there is a light on up there. the windows open out onto a fire exit that anyone from anyother room can access and could step into your room if your window was open plus the area did not seem to be monitored by any cctv and looked easy for anyone to gain access to this area from the reception. other than my worry of the security in the room i liked my stay just wish we were given a diffrent room.,3,2012,08,02
59,Nice location but overpriced place,"As a couple we did not stay much in our room, we preferred to walk around the city and explore as much as possible but we did ask for a quiet room. Breakfast was offered for a ''reduced'' price deal but still expensive for what they offered and also it should have been INCLUDED for the amount we paid. View from room wasn't nice but then again we used the room to sleep, not for the view. On the positive side, the location is great with various subway or Metro stops nearby (walking distance), not in the city centre where it gets very noisy and crowded. Rooms are reasonable in size, NO kettle or cups/mugs to prepare tea or coffee, general cleanliness is good but be warned if you are six feet tall like me or more, your feet will be hanging out of the bed. When staff was informed about this, NOTHING was done about it, and they just said that was the standard size. Being a 3 star HOTEL with people arriving from all over the world they SHOULD really have bigger beds for this kind of situation.
Rooftop pool area extremely small for the size of hotel with no bathrooms or bar/drink facilities. Room service and service delivered to rooftop extremely expensive!. Always crowded as you might expect, we managed to use it only one day for 20 min just before closing time at 9:00 PM.
The reception staff are very helpful, except for the bed size problem they try their best to please the costumer with good advice and recommendations and a nice chat when they are not busy. One computer in lobby with access to internet proved useful but again it was ALWAYS in use so be prepared to wait for a while to be able to use it.

Overall, we had a nice stay but for the rates they charge they should definitely include breakfast to make up for the tiny rooftop and pool area plus look into longer beds, include toilet and bar on terrace and please it should be a MUST to put a kettle and mugs in the rooms for tea and coffee.",3,2012,08,01
59,Nice location and reasonable rates,"We were at the Astoria in August 2011 for a family vacation.  Great location, near subway stops and close enough to walk to most attractions if you enjoy walking (we are New Yorkers and walk a lot).  Rooms a good size, comfortable bed, and nice bath.  No view from windows, looked into an alley. I think the rooms with views have noise issues as they look out onto the street and there is a bar across the street.   Rooftop pool area was very nice but small and always crowded when we were there.  Several times we went up after a day of touring and there were no chairs available.  Reception staff helpful.  Internet in lobby was good, but internet reception tends to be spotty in the city overall, so not always fast.  Breakfast was very good, we got a good rate on it and if you get offered a deal on the breakfast you should take it.",4,2012,07,31
59,"Nice place, fells like more than 3 star.","We stayed in the Astoria for 4 nights in June 2012. Was Really pleased with everything. Was a lot nicer than what we were expecting. Rooms were a nice size, Great shower and bath. REALLY good bed and pillows. 

Rooftop terrace was nice, with a good view of the city. The pool is tiny however. Don't expect to be doing laps in it lol. (photo's on site make it look bigger) but thats a common thing I have noticed in our travels.

Would be nice to have: 1, A toilet on the rooftop terrace. 
And 2, a bar on the terrace also... You can get food drinks delivered to you but the price is a bit much (more expensive than the regular menu).

The staff are very nice also, and speak English. We checked in around midnight as we got ""sidetracked"" with some local friends, still got checked in no problems.

Overall very nice hotel, worthy of more than it's 3 star rating. 

Can't rate the breakfast as we were never up early enough to have it.

Loved the spiral staircase also leading up from the lobby.",5,2012,07,23
59,Great hotel,"I'm not sure how good the location is as I stayed here with work and didn't get chance for sight-seeing so can't comment on that.  Easy to get to from airport was recommended to get metro to diaganol and walk from there but found it easy enough to walk from Passeig de Gracias, about 15 minutes (though not ideal if you have a lot of stuff!)

The rooms are spacious and nicely decorated, I think they were refurbished not long ago.  The breakfast is good, I wouldn't say outstanding as there wasn't a huge range of choice but was good enough.  The best advantage to the hotel is the terrace on the 8th floor which as sun loungers and a small pool (more like a plunge pool, couldn't swim in it) the terrace gives a great view of the city and I didn't have trouble finding somewhere to sit despite it being on the small side.

I would stay here again",4,2012,07,19
59,More than 3*,"Ideal position in town, nice residential area but close to metros/bars/cafes - hotel breakfast is extremely overpriced but lunch for 2 can be found in nearby restaurants for less than breakfast for 1. Definately worth more than its 3* rating, room was nice and big with a large bathroom. Pool is too small for lengths but perfect to just cool off in the afternoon. It was ideal for us and we would definately recommend for young couples.",5,2012,07,16
59,"Great Staff, Great Location, Great Value-for-Price","The hotel staff is extremely friendly and courteous.  Various front-desk clerks helped my colleague and me print boarding documents for RyanAir, gave us directions and restaurant recommendations (multiple times), and always greeted us as we left and returned to the hotel.  The staff erroneously charged us for breakfasts -- an error that I didn't notice until leaving Spain -- and a classy manager (Mr. Fernando Hernandez) worked with me via e-mail to ensure that I received a refund.  As for location, I think that this hotel's locale is perfect.  It is a 5-minute walk from the Diagonal metro station.  It is close enough to Las Ramblas to enjoy all that the boulevard has to offer, while being far enough away to be super quiet and extremely safe.  It has nearly a dozen restaurants within a one-block walk ... these restaurants are more likely to be populated with local folks than with tourists, who instead flock to the lower half of Las Ramblas.  This stately hotel is more than well worth the price.  I will recommend this exact hotel to anyone who travels to Barcelona!",5,2012,07,14
59,Great Hotel,Spent 14 nights at the Astoria and it was a fantastic experience. The location was amazing - close to everything but in a safe and quiet neighborhood. There was great shopping and restaurants within a few blocks of the hotel. The roof deck and pool were a plus. The staff was very attentive and responsive to all of your needs. The staff was also very helpful with suggestions on restaurants in th area. I can't wait to return to Barcelona and the Astoria!,5,2012,07,11
59,"Great value, nice hotel!","We really enjoyed our stay at Astoria Hotel, the rooftop pool is small, but does the trick and we enjoyed an afternoon up there.  The rooms are comfortable, clean and have a unique look to them - we did wish we had a better view, but cant complain over all about that.  The staff were friendly and attentive and we would recommend this hotel!  Great value too for what you are getting.",5,2012,07,09
59,"Quiet, Great Location, and Big Rooms","My wife and I stayed at the Astoria for 4 nights.  Our room was clean and modern, and very large for European standards.  We had a room away from the street, although it is not a major thoroughfare.  The hotel staff were cordial and helpful.  Breakfast was a typical buffet; nothing special.  We arrived early in the morning, but they had a room for us ready.

The hotel is located a few blocks from the Diagonal metro station; many of Barcelona's lines pass through this station.   Using the metro if Barcelona, once you figure out a couple of nuances (if no glass barrier, pass to the right of the ticket counter; if looking for a  particular line, you may be directed down to another lines platform and then up again to continue to the line you are looking for).

Three blocks away is Gaudi's Casa Milà (La Pedrera).",4,2012,06,19
59,Great Location Comfortable stay,"The hotel was clean, modern, nice staff and great location. I will surely use it again.",4,2012,06,19
59,Lovely hotel,"Really lovely hotel in a much quieter area of Barcelona, away from the crowds and noise.  Had a very enjoyable stay with the added bonus of a rooftop terrace which didn't seem to be used very much. Our room was very clean, if not a little small, but not a problem as only there to sleep. Hotel had plenty of restaurants nearby for breakfast, and only about a 20 minute walk to La Ramblas, and 30 minutes to the Waterfront. Definitely recommend and definitely return if in Barcelona again.

59,"Great location, large rooms","We enjoyed our stay here very much.  It is a classy old hotel with large, relaxing rooms.  The lobby is very comfortable and the staff is helpful.  The rooftop deck is also a nice place to have a drink.  There is free wifi in the lobby, but not in the rooms, which is a little annoying.  Before you book, check online for great discounts.  We would definitely stay here again.  It is in a great neighborhood with plenty of a cafes and restaurants nearby.",5,2012,06,10
59,wonderful place to come back to,"We stayed at the Astoria 5/09 to 5/14/12 ( 5 nights).  We arrived early with friends. We had a Superior room with a balcony and sitting area.  It was a lovely, big room on any standard.   We had plenty of room to get together with our friends after a long day of sight seeing etc.  We would sit on the balcony, enjoy the evening, drinking wine and discussing the days events. the hotel staff were wonderful, polite, very helpful with everything.  Our location was great!  Not in the middle of too much but close to everything.  We had no problems getting around to the Sagrada Familia, Las Ramblas and the Gothic quatre on foot or by bus or metro.  Taxis are very reasonable also.  we had no problems with anything with the staff ( they were wonderful!!) .  We cant say enough as to how nice, helpful, professional and honest they all were.breakfast was good with the typical european fare but you could get eggs cooked to order.  the small roof pool and patio were nice but it was closed at night and the bar was not open yet.  I know it would've been nice to sit up there at night with drinks if we didnt have our own balcony.  thankyou for a wonderful stay.",5,2012,06,02
59,Nice hotel but no free wifi in rooms,"I recently stayed at this hotel on a business trip, and this review shows best that the little things can taint an otherwise enjoyable stay.

On the plus side, the hotel is in a good location, has a classy look in touch with its surroundings, there is a taxi rank right outside the door, and many nice restaurants and cafes within walking distance.  I stayed in room 415, it was a decent size with dark wood themed panel decor, a big nicely layer out bathroom area

Minor points, when first checking in the staff seemed a little standoffish, there was no warm welcome or nice smile, but in fairness later on when I asked to borrow an iron and ironing board there was some friendly banter.  One of the picture frames had cracked glass in the room.  It is worth checking the bill carefully as some mini bar items had been added to my bill which I had not used but this was easily resolved by reception no fuss

My only big moan (although a small point) is that I asked for wifi access and was told that there was free wi-fi in the foyer but if I wanted wi-fi in my room then there was a charge for 24 hrs.  My point here is that in this day and age hotel wi-fi should be readily available and free, it tainted my stay and realistically all things being equal I would always favour a hotel with free wi-fi over one where you had to pay for it",4,2012,06,02
59,Very Good Staff!!!,The hotel has an old feel but very elegant.  Its in a quiet area which works for us after a day of exploring and mingling with other tourists. The staff are superb and really very attentive.  I would like to thank the manager who was very patient to give me directions in getting to places outside of the city. Never had the chance to dine or use other facilities but I was working so late one night until 3:00 am in the lobby and the night staff was kind enough to offer me some drinks. The room is always clean and tidy .. so tidy that even my PJs was always fold nicely. We were in the 2nd floor and the only thing I can comment is that its noisy on our  side of the hotel.  I can hear the cleaning staff in the morning very clearly talking outside our room among other noise.  There are lots of nice little cafe and restaurant around. All in all it was a very good stay and what tops it all was the great attitude and service of the staff.  Ill come back again.,4,2012,05,26
59,Great Value Hotel,My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights in early May.  We had a standard double room on the 2nd floor.  Room was clean and quiet.  It's well located and the staff is very friendly.  The desk manager has been there for years and is well versed in the local area and Barcelona in general.  The pool deck and facilities are great.  We are planning on staying here again when we return to Barcelona later this year.,4,2012,05,17
59,"Very good hotel, great location if you want some peace and quiet","I loved this hotel. My room was decent sized, quiet, good air conditioning. Bathroom was a nice size with good water pressure. I appreciated the bedroom area having an additional door for more quiet, I barely heard anyone moving unless they were standing in the hallway and talking. 

The roof deck is really nice, lovely views of Barcelona and the pool, while small, is still a nice touch. the spiral staircase is BEAUTIFUL. 

The staff was very friendly and very helpful with tourist information, and the lounge/bar area on the ground floor is decorated in the kind of 1920s theme which I appreciated. Lovely posters and pictures on the wall. 

I thought the location was nice, there are lovely places to eat surrounding the hotel. The hop on and off buses were about a ten minute walk away. if you wanted to, you could walk to the Sagrada Familia in about half an hour. If you want to party it up, you'll have to head into a different part of the city so if nightlife is your thing you'll want to check out other hotels. For the tourist-see all the sites type of vacation, it's a great little hotel. I'd stay here again.

The only drawback was the noisy hallways if people are lugging around bags and talking, but as I was up by 8-9am everyday it wasn't a problem for me and I wasn't woken up at night. My friend's room smelled weird, like the a/c had leaked but he didn't mention this to the staff so I can't say how expedient they are to correct issues, but judging their helpfulness for all tourist matters I'd bet they'll go the extra mile for room comfort. 

An additional buses is that there's a cab station across the street, pretty much, so it's really easy to get a cab if you need.",4,2012,05,15
59,Three stars -- but they are a bit tarnished,"I had paid for an upgrade to a deluxe room, so I was a bit surprised when my room had a view of the shaftway.  When I questioned it, I was told that it was indeed a deluxe room.  I finally checked my paperwork and realized that it was NOT, so I went back to the front desk and was finally moved into a duplex on the 8th floor.  Was very disappointed that I had to question the room twice before I was put into the room that I actually paid for.

The room was clean...the staff of the hotel was helpful and friendly.  The location was good for access to the double decker city tour bus (definitely a good value and FUN!)

But the ""gym"" consisted of three pieces of equipment -- all broken.

So make your decisions based on your expectations and budget.",3,2012,05,15
59,Excellent hotel with good  value for money,This was a lovely hotel near the centre of barcelona and within walking distance of all the main sites. Good value for money. Well worth considering. We would come back if we were to visit Barcelona again.,5,2012,05,14
59,"Very good hotel, well located and good facilities food and service",We stayed here as a base for three day trip. The room was very clean and well appointed. Bar and lounge facilities very comfortable with free wifi. Very good location. Lovely roof terrace and very small pool which gave glorious views over the city. Small gym.  Good breakfast with plenty of choice of cooked and continental buffet option. Good value. We would definitely stay there again if visiting Barcelona. Only small downside was window looked out on enclosed shaft and so no daylight in room. The benefit of this was room was quiet.,4,2012,05,14
59,Good enough hotel for the money.,"Good hotel for the money, stayed on room basis only, Plently of cafes serving breakfast about.
Rooms on the smallish side, plently of storage, Modern furnature, rooms clean and tidy. reception staff helpful. Great view fron the roof, tiny swimming room there.",3,2012,05,10
59,Excellent for the price,"stayed there july 2010, very nice clean, the only thing we were  several couples and we made reservations together but we got different room types, ours was very small but modern clean and another couple got a big studio and all with the same price...",4,2012,05,08
59,Nice Hotel,"Really nice hotel. Very friendly staff. Slap bang in the middle of Barcelona so you'll need transport to most of the tourist sites which tend to lie on the periphery. Breakfast is 'Continental' but you can ask for bacon & eggs should you wish! (Ham & cheese got a bit boring after a couple of days). Hotel bar is a bit empty & bar staff did charge random prices although we didn't question it, just didn't go again. The room was fine with space but only a view of the interior structure. The power went off once but probably not their fault. Club opposite was a problem to some guests but not us. Chucking out time at 9am! Paris bar just down the road excellent with good 'grub'. If we went back to Barca, and I hope we do soon, we would stay there again.",4,2012,04,22
59,nice hotel,Very nice hotel with a nice pool on the roof ok bedrooms although maybe a little dated.  The hotel is located in central barcelona only 10 minutes taxi  from the harbour and within wlaking distance of la sagada familia.  There are lots of designer shops close by on the diagonales.  The reception staff were very helpful giving us a map pointing out where the hotel is and the airport and had all the attractions on it also with descriptions in both spanish and english.  There is a taxi rank right outside the hotel so is easy to get anywhere you like.  The maids are very noisy in the morning so if you are nursing a hangover be warned.  The walls are made of paper you can hear anything that happens in the rooms next to you and anything in the corridor as well.  A tip if you are returning late at night the main entrance doors will be locked you will need to ring the bell on the door to the left of the hotel.   A very good budget hotel,4,2012,04,20
59,I fail to see what's so excellent about this hotel,"I must be really spoiled as I really fail to see why over 60 travellers have rated this hotel 'excellent'. Don't get me wrong, it's a fine hotel in a good part of town (right next to and across from some night clubs though) relatively close to the Placa Catalunya and the Ramblas (30 mins walk) but it is deprived of any kind of luxury. Rooms are very small (we were upgraded to a 'big'  room and even that was tiny) and although some staff members are very friendly, some hardly say hello. 

With regards to the comments that most rooms look out on a lift shaft, do ask for an upgrade as that is relatively cheap. You'll get a room facing the street then for which you really should bring your earplugs as it's, as said before, right in between a couple of nightclubs.

All in all not too bad but I wouldn't go back or recommend. One last big plus though is that the beds are great!",3,2012,04,20
59,Astoria Hotel - good value for money,"The Astoria hotel in Barcelona is a good hotel and good value for the money we paid, it's very easy to get to from the central station and in the middle of the city centre. Very nice pool on the roof. The rooms are nice and clean. Me and my friend had a quiet rooms facing the yard. Friendly staff. The WI FI is only in the lobby, so you have to go there with your phone/laptop. Good A/C in the room. No breakfast included in the room charge so we went to different cafes around the area every morning.",4,2012,04,20
59,"Reasonable, Clean, and no Hassles","A friend and I stayed here for six nights at the end of March.   The neighborhood is wonderful - central but quiet and safe, and within walking distance of many major sites.   The property is clean and neat. The lobby is charming as are the hallways.
We had no hassles whatsoever.  The desk was helpful, lending us a current convertor so I could recharge my camera.  
Our room on the 6th floor overlooked a very nice courtyard, giving us enough light in the room.  
I would stay here again in a heartbeat.",4,2012,04,18
59,Had an inside room this time which was very quiet,"This was the thrid time we had stayed here (due to it being the same location of a Day School I was tutoring).  The staff are very helpful, but had to ask for water to be brought to the tutorial room (which would have been paid for in advance).  Breakfast is expensive at 14 euros, but I asked for a 'deal' and got one (8 euros each if we ate there both days) - previous visit in January had been given a 2 for the price of one deal (i.e. two for 14 euros).  Breakfast is good, but Saturday morning saw queues waiting (some were asked to return later, so go early).",4,2012,04,06
59,BAD STANDARD rooms; be very careful in barcelona city,"we stayed here for 3 nights and that is why shifted from standard to superior room whch is much much better with good space. standard room is bad seriously, small and so cramped! breakfast ws good atleast, unlike european hotel trends they do give hot omelette and things on order. location is decent as well, one can walk to the passeig de gracia and rambas etc etc. jUST BE CAREFUL generaly in the city, the theft instances , pickpocketting is beyond imagination. within a second you will lose ur stuff if you lose sight of it . its horrible. the administration should do something about it. police at port and on the streets is generaly lame there. my handbag got stolen at the port while a couple was taking our pic, when i  put my bag beside my feet near a statue there.",3,2012,03,29
59,Great location,"Stayed for 3 nights over the weekend and would recommend it based on it's great location. We were originally put in a room with no view but when we requested a better room we were given a studio on the top floor. Friendly staff, ok selection for breakfast and nice roof terrace with pool.",4,2012,03,26
59,"Nice hotel,reasonably priced","Me and my wife stayed for four nights at the hotel. The location of the hotel is good; you have a metro station (Diagonal) a few blocks away and many bus stations around, and a taxi station across the street. Its not really a walking distance to the main attractions (it's about half an hour walk to placa Catalonia) but you have a lot of shops and very near .The room is nice and clean and the staff was very helpful, we didn’t take breakfast at the hotel but you have a lot of cafes and restaurant around the hotel.    Overall: a nice and good hotel and reasonably priced",4,2012,03,26
59,Great hotel with rooftop pool,"Room was nicely decorated, clean and spacious. The hotel is in a great location. The rooftop terrace and pool were very nice though a bit small. Still, it was great for sunbathing and relaxing in the summer.",4,2012,02,22
59,Decent for its standing,"We stayed there for two nights. For a 3-star hotel, the room was too small, the bed was disappointing (only two thin pillows), the service was correct but not outstanding. The room didn't have a view - hence limited light -, unless you consider a brick-wall as a view... In a nutshell, it was okay but nothing earth-shattering for a hotel of that standing and brand...",3,2012,02,20
59,Excellent Staff but very noisy,"The Astoria is beautifully decorated and the rooms were excellent.  Breakfast was reduced to 9 euros which was good value for money.  They don't advertise the fact that you can request hot food such as sausage, egg etc but it IS available so be sure to ask!  One word of warning, opposite the hotel is a club called 'The Seven Crowns' which, in the hotel's words it is an 'after hours' club.  There was an awful amount of noise throughout the night (Thurs to Sunday) of people shouting and car horns sounding - people were still leaving very drunk at 10am!  The taxi drivers opposite can also be heard talking during the night.  The double glazing does not stop the noise so if you stay here ask for a room that doesn't face the road. There are also other night clubs in the same road. Apart from the nightly noise our stay was excellent and the staff are very friendly and helpful.  The Ramblas is about a 25 min walk and the hotel is well situated for metro, tour bus etc.",3,2012,02,11
59,"Quiet, Clean & Convenient","We stayed at the Astoria Hotel in November 2011 for a weekend break. The hotel was located a short walk from the main shopping streets of Passeig de Gracia and Rambla de Catalunya and surrounded by cafe's, restaurants and bakeries. The area surrounding the hotel was safe to walk at night and metro access was less than 5 minutes walk away. The Astoria staff were friendly and helpful and the rooms were clean & functional. The rooftop terrace provided virtually panoramic views of Barcelona city and the sea beyond, and although a bit cold for a dip in November, the rooftop pool looked nice. I would recommend this hotel and would stay here again. 
On arrival, the hotel recommended a restaurant called Trobador - on Calle Enric Granados approx. 5 mins walk towards Avda Diagonal. We liked it so much we returned to it on our last night.",4,2012,01,19
59,"Convenient location, nice size rooms, good value","Our stay was December 24 to 29th 2011 with the Xmas(25) and Saint Steve(26) holidays in Barcelona. It was myself and 3 teenagers.

Location - the hotel is in a safe area and not on a major street. It is only a short 5-7 minute walk to the Diagonal Metro stop. You can access several Metro lines at that station. It is also right around the corner from the Diagonal street so buses are also easy to catch. A fixed taxi pickup stop is right across the street if you need one quickly. And there are many small restaurants of all types within 1-5 minutes of the hotel. Shopping is also right around the corner and up and down the Diagonal if you so desire.

Rooms - we were on the 4th floor and were simple and clean. Bathrooms appear to have been modernized recently with modern showers, sinks and fixtures. Our room faced the street and there was the occasional loud and happy drunk returning from tapas and beer at 3 am announcing to the world that he was enjoying himself or the regular (daily?)municipal trash pickup at 5 am. I chalked this up big city living. otherwise I actually preferred this room to be able to watch the daily street scene of folks going to work and people heading to bars and restaurants in the evening. I couldn't fugure out how to use the room safe on my own and wasn't sure whether there was a key that was needed. The rooms were heated and never cold (outside temps 32-45f) but did get a bit hot and stuffy when returning from the days activities. Opening the window for a few minutes fixed that quickly.

Staff - They were extremely helpful and nice. We received restaurant recommendations, directions to museums, assistance with the wifi (free in lobby area) and suggestions of good tours to take. They made copies of a few documents without fuss or complaint.

Amenities - The breakfast buffet was decent and average (the coffee was always lukewarm) but enough to get your day started and not complaint worthy.  Croissants, bread with tomato spread (typical Barca' dish) juice and coldcuts and cheeses. Service was pleasant and never rude. Free wifi in lobby was nice but reception was a little difficult if you wanted to use Skype. Since it was winter we didn't use the outdoor areas of the hotel.

Overall - Reasonably priced and always felt safe in and around the hotel. I'd gladly return.",4,2012,01,05
59,"Very good location, rooms OK","So Hotel Astoria is right about in the middle of the wide range that makes up ""4 stars hotels"" in Europe. Not bad, not great. The location is really good - on a little side street just off of Diagonal (the main street in Barcelona), with a couple of cafes and shops practically right outside the door. Staff is pretty friendly and helpful. Wifi is free which is always a big plus. The rooms are just OK, nothing special. AC is pretty weak, but that's common for Europe. Things were reasonably clean. Bathrooms not bad. Overall, I would recommend this hotel, but I will also personally check out somewhere else next time in Barcelona.",3,2012,01,04
59,Perfect Location,"We loved the location, a quiet section near C. Diagonal and the Metro.  We walked to two terrific restaurants, both tapas and C. Passeig for shopping. Nice bar and breakfast room near lobby and a lovely little terrace with pool and sauna and of course views of 
Barcelona.  Not fancy, but would absolutley stay there again.",5,2011,12,14
59,Wonderful Experience,I am in the travel industry and spend about 3 nights a week in hotels. The Astoria has a wonderful and very accommodating staff. The room my daughter and I stayed in for 1 week was more than comfortable in its cleanliness and size. The location could'nt be better it was safe at night and convient. After a few days we checked other hotels to see if we could find a better room for about the same price and size and decided to continue to stay at the Astoria. I would go back to the Astoria and would recommend it to friends.,5,2011,12,07
59,very well located,"The hotel is very clean, staff courteous, wonderful buffet breakfast, close to Diagonal subway, nice neighborhood.",5,2011,11,28
59,Great neighborhood,"Great part of town, charming and intriguing lobby, excellent staff.  My room, on an interior  courtyard, was a little small and stuffy, but super clean and a good value.  The staff printed copies of documents I requested and they were always ready at the front desk.",4,2011,11,28
59,Nothing special,Best thing about this hotel is its location. Rooms are very small but newly refurbished and very clean. The room I had was quite dark but as I was on business trip it did not bother me. There is paid wi-fi in room and the hotel guests get one hour free. Staff were polite. if I was retiring to Barcelona on business and was looking for a cheap but comfortable room I would check the rates of this hotel again.,3,2011,11,28
59,Good location but room overlooking street was very noisy,"Good sized room, friendly staff.  The room safe key was lost, so had to place passport etc. in (free) reception safety deposit box.  We had a room overlooking the street outside, which meant that it was very noisy at night as there are local nightclubs/bars which have lots of smokers congregating on the pavement.  Am returning twice more for business, so hope not to have a street view again.",4,2011,11,26
59,"Good, but could do better!","This hotel was very good but we paid way over the odds for what is essentially a three star hotel with a five star rooftop... Which doesn't level out at four stars in my opinion. Good service and a very well equipped bar - not to forget the (small) fun pool and terrace, it worked well for our trip, a 40th birthday party. The rooms are tired and need much more work to bring the place up to the level of the public spaces.",3,2011,11,21
59,A nice hotel in a good location,"The Astoria is a well located hotel in a pleasant area of Barcelona.  The staff were friendly and the price affordable if you book a little in advance.  The rooms were a touch on the small side, however they were clean, tidy and well presented to a good standard.  I had a quiet 'courtyard' room which was excellent. Would definitely recommend for a short stay in the city.",5,2011,11,19
59,Good choice!,"This is our first visit to Barcelona and after much research and advice from a friend, we booked Astoria and it was indeed the right decision. Hotel Astoria is located conveniently in the Eixample neighbourhood, close to Passeig de Gracia, walking distance to Metro station plus the famous Casa Batlló and La Pedrera are just blocks away. Shops, cafes and restaurants aplenty nearby.

The hotel room is mordenly furnished, decent room size, adequate guest supplies, comfy bed, very neat and clean. Comfortable retreat after a long day of walking and sight-seeing. Friendly and helpful hotel staff. We had a wonderful stay and would recommend this hotel to all travellers. 

If you are looking for good location and good value hotel, go for Astoria!",4,2011,11,17
59,Sweet Spot in Barcelona,"In mid Sept. 2011 my wife and I arrived in Barcelona the start of 1 month in Spain and checked into the Astoria late in the evening. We were greeted by 2 great gentlemen at the front desk who answered all our questions, gave us tips on where to have tapas close by the hotel. This hotel is located close to everything and at the centre of everything. We had tickets to the FC Barcalona game on Sat. evening and to our great joy found that the Camp Nou was within walking distance of the hotel.
This is a great hotel, wonderful staff, fantastic location and great value for money. We will stay here again and will suggest it to friends as a place to stay in Barcelona.",4,2011,11,14
59,"Good hotel, good location","This is a nice hotel close to the Passieg de Gracia and the Diagonal Metro.  The rooms were clean and comfortable.  The rate was very good.  But our room looked out on the ugly little light shaft.  Most disappointing thing was the internet access for me.  There were 2 computers but they were usually in use, (teenage facebookers).  There was free wifi in the lobby which would have been great but it would never let me connect.  The staff just kept saying to try again later.  There was free wifi for 1 hr/day in the room but that required entering a lot of data only to ask for a mobile phone nbr to send a confirmation number.  I didn't have a working mobile.  The other Derby hotel we stayed in had free wifi throughout the hotel and the rooms.  I needed to have access while on my vacation.  That would have made a difference in my rating.  I would still recommend this hotel for the value and location.",3,2011,10,26
59,Pure luxury and a swimmingpool on the roof,"A super hotel situated within walkingdistance to everything. If you are fond of walking this hotel is perfect for you. Very good shops not to far from the hotel.
The service at the hotel was excellent and very friendly and English-spoken.",4,2011,10,21
59,Might be okay if you don't have a standard room,"It is a beautiful hotel in a nice neighborhood with plenty of cafes and restaurants. However, the standard rooms are very small and do not have any daylight which is really depressing. So if you choose this hotel pay a little more and invest in a room with a window...",3,2011,10,16
59,Very slippery shower!,"We stayed at the hotel for 5 nights and liked it over all. Having read reviews about rooms without daylight, we were relieved to find we at least had a window (and thus fresh air), even though there was not too much daylight coming through, being halfway down a light shaft. It was very quiet as well. 
The room and bathroom were very clean, but I would not recommend the bathroom for older people who are afraid of falling: the bath/shower unit was extremely slippery with nothing to hold on to to step into or out of the bath.
The swimming pool was nice, with lounge beds and several tables&chairs surrounding it. Unfortunately, it opened at 10:00 a.m., which is rather late if you want to go sightseeing during the day.
The neighborhood was really safe and pleasant, with lots of places to eat and drink. Nearby Gracia offers a little more excitement in a friendly atmosphere.",4,2011,10,12
59,Great location but needs updating,"Pros: a great location, very helpful front desk, beautiful exterior, very pretty roof deck

Cons: bed was extremely uncomfortable, room was a little dingy--could use some updating, pool was also very small but very pretty",3,2011,10,11
59,01/010/11 visit to barcelona,"We loved Barcelona and would recommend the Astoria as a good place to stay. We stayed at the Astoria for 4 nights in October. Booked last minute (i.e. the day before) we were looking at 4-5* so Astoria rated 3* was a bit of a guess. The marble floors, marble spiral staircase and the extensive collection of art works on the walls, give the hotel a very pleasant feel, it is quiet and cool. The staffs are polite and efficient and there is free wifi in the reception area and there is a computer room. We arrived late, booked in, settled in to our room and had time to pop to a small bar for a drink and snack. . The room was quite small but functional it had good aircon and a free safe  it was quiet. There were cracks in the bathroom sink but generally the room and the whole hotel was very clean. There is a small roof terrace with a small pool, tables chairs and sun beds. It has a view across the city to the sea and I never saw more than two people. It was a lovely place to relax in the sun and read, away from the bustle of the city. The hotel is in a great location if you don’t mind walking you can reach most of the main places of interest and the metro is close so you can get anywhere with great ease. There are plenty of bars cafes and restaurants locally within easy walking distance. Breakfast is good and the fruit was fresh and plentlyful, you can have a cooked breakfast if required. The only criticism is that on two mornings the coffee and water were cold and this was not rectified until our last day. We had a late flight home and the staff were happy for us to check out at 1.00pm rather that 12.00 and stored our luggage for us .",4,2011,10,07
59,value for mony,"having travelled to many countries and experienced various categories of hotel, feel astoria did not offer value for money-no complementary breakfast, no wi-fi at room, besides room being like den covered by walls on all sides. felt not worth!",2,2011,10,02
59,Nothing to write home about.,"Conveniently located near metro stop (Diagnol).  Was there during La Merce and it was nice to be outside of the craziness but not too far out.  Hotel very clean and nice enough.  Double bed was small and uncomfortable.  Internet access in room limited to one hour a day.  Had to go to lobby and sit in just the right spot to log in to internet to check in on work.  Toilet seat loose and coming off.  And, on last day, got locked in bathroom.  If wife hadn't been there to call the front desk, or if she had been mad at me at the time, who knows how long I could have been stuck there!.",3,2011,09,30
59,Great Hotel,"Stayed at the Astoria on a very hot few days in Sept. The hotel has wonderful  A\C throughout the lobby and in the rooms which really  was essential in Barcelona . The room was spotless clean with a good sized bathroom with a good powerful shower. Towels changed daily. I had booked a single room but got a double for same price. Room has a mini bar ,safe and LCD tv , though the only English channel is CNN but then I didn’t spend  much time watching telly. There is a small rooftop pool and a sun lounge area to chill out in the evening if you wish. It’s about a 7 min. walk to the metro (Diagonal) The breakfast was 11 Euro extra  so just used the many little cafes in the area for breakfast. Much cheaper .Front desk staff  informative and speak good English. You can book the Tourist bus from the front desk which is really  handy  as the lines get very long  down town. The only small down point is that as the hotel is in  the upmarket Eixample area it gets a little quiet (ie dead) in the evenings….There`s restaurants and bars a little walk away on Psg de Garcia and Rambla de Catalunya but not much around the immediate hotel.. All in all a good clean ,quite hotel , just a little off the main city centre action . For the price would def stay again",4,2011,09,18
59,Very good hotel,"The hotel is very good and location, excellent. Well positioned close to La Diagonal which has lots of malls and restaurants. Rooms are well proportioned and beds very comfortable. Book early and you will have excellent value for money.",4,2011,09,12
59,"Clean hotel, good breakfast","The hotel is not very centrally located but it is an easy walk (about 20 min.) to Sagrada Familia and it takes about 15-20 minutes to walk to the city center. The famous Avenue Diagonal is only 5 minutes’ walk away and La Pedrera is within walking distance.  Alternatively, you can use the local subway to get to the main sights (the Diagonal station is within 5-7 minutes’ walk from the hotel).

The room and the bathroom were very clean, and towels were changed and toiletries were replaced daily. The bathroom was a bit on the tight side but functional. The room had a mini-bar and a safe. There is a swimming pool on the hotel roof but a very small one. One small minus point is that you can hear all the street noise but since the street was rather quiet that was not a big problem. No free wi-fi – you have to pay for it but that would not be a problem for those who travel without their laptops.

Breakfast was very good with a choice of fruit and cheeses – come early if you want a better selection.

The reception staff were very nice and helpful with all kinds of tourist information. I would certainly recommend the hotel.",4,2011,08,07
59,Amazing hotel,"If you book early, you can't go wrong with the value of this hotel.  We had a huge room - a villa practically!  The bathroom was quite large, a sitting area, two LCD tv's.  Only downside was no free wifi (although apparently you can get 1 hr/day free). The pool was great to cool off in after a hot day of sightseeing.  Don't miss some time at the beach.",5,2011,07,28
59,"Clean, Central, Modern and Relaxing","Really nice hotel, very clean, modern bedrooms and friendly staff.",4,2011,07,19
59,"Clean, cool hotel in a nice location","Barcelona at this time of year is HOT so it was nice to arrive to a cool spacious hotel (taxi from airport was 29 euro).  

Hotel is nice and cool with a quirky, modern yet charming feel to it. 

Our room was big and very clean with all important powerful air con...however the window opened out to a tiny dingy ""courtyard"" so we had no natural light whatsoever and kept curtains closed the whole time.  Had to go outside or to terrace to see what the weather was like! Also there were some sort of refurbishment works going on directly above or next to our room which was extremely annoying - drilling and banging from about 10am - 5pm, couldnt nap at all during the day.  I assume we were just unlucky though as refurb works are obviously temporary so I wouldnt let this put me off going here again. 

Terrace area is a lovely feature however could benefit from more sunbeds as it does surprisingly get quite busy.  Very nice place to relax after a long day of sight seeing and although small the pool does its job at cooling you down.  There is no bar up there but a seating area with ashtrays so you can bring whatever drinks or snacks of your own with you. 

Hotel staff are friendly and helpful.  Breakfast was also to a good standard, not sure how much it would cost as it was included in our room price, but if you can I suggest getting it included as its a nice start to the day.  Typical continental food was on offer in buffet style but they also did a cooked breakfast of eggs, bacon and sausages if you asked which was a bonus. 

There is a small room with two computers with free internet access which was a handy feature too. 

In terms of location, the hotel is situated in a nice lively area very close to bars, restaurants and shops - however about 10 mins to a metro stop and a good 25 mins to la ramblas, which isnt the best option when its hot! Very close to the diagonal road and passeig de gracia though which are both fun roads. 

Overall I would recommend this hotel but should I return to Barcelona I might consider others closer to the beach and La Rambla as its nice to not have to walk or use metro.",4,2011,07,07
59,Call ahead...,"First room they gave me was on the roof and thus hot. Second room was nice and cool, but the remodeling noise all day sux! The pool is the size of my leg. Centrally located though. Call ahead for noise and best rooms available.",1,2011,06,28
59,Hotel Astoria a clean and friendly hotel in a central location,"Hotel Astoria is a good hotel in a central location to get the best out of a weekend in Barcelona. Nice airy rooms with friendly staff, makes the experience a pleasant one. A definite place to return to, to continue our tour the city",4,2011,06,27
59,Enjoyable stay at this attractive hotel in great location.,"This location was great for all the sightseeing we wanted to do and for transportation when we didn't want to walk. The hotel lobby is elegant and the rooms attractive. We booked on the Internet, so we had a great rate; we were very pleased with our room--we stayed five nights. Our offer did not include breakfast, and we thought the cost was pricey. There are several cafes right in the area, but try to get an early breakfast!   If you get a B&B offer, I'd take that.

The reception staff was always friendly and helpful - answered many tourist questions.
Also, there were two computers available for guests to use free of charge (very popular). The pool area on the  roof was a treat; even though we did not go into the pool; we relaxed and enjoyed the sunshine.

The parking (discounted) was reasonable and right down the block, very convenient when we went to the Costa Brava. The garage was not crowded, and they delivered the car to the hotel door when we were checking out.",5,2011,06,23
59,Lovely hotel!,"We had a fabulous time in Barcelona, staying at the Hotel Astoria.  We had read a few reviews on here about rooms that had no windows (which I must admit I would not have liked)  We read all the other positives however and decided to take the plunge and book it, but to email the hotel and specifically ask for a room with windows.  When we arrived we were escorted to the 8th floor and taken to our room that had not one - but two windows! :)  The room was larger than we expected for a city hotel and had a decent sized bathroom too.  Very comfy beds and nice views of the city.  Another plus point was that the rooms have a minibar which we quickly worked out could be emptied onto the side and used it as a fridge!  We then replaced all the (over-priced) merchandise and no-one was any the wiser! (Shhhh...!)  We didn't eat at the hotel as we thought 15 Euros each was too much to pay for breakfast.   There are lots of Spar type shops around though so we just bought croissants and fruit etc.  I would have liked tea and coffee making facilities in the room, but perhaps that's just because I'm English I don't know. The pool terrace on the roof is really nice and they don't seem to mind you taking your own alcohol and snacks up there which was great.  It is locked at 11pm though.

 In terms of location, the hotel could be slightly better situated, but you will do so much walking in Barcelona that I don't think it makes much difference. The area is very safe and friendly and it only takes about 20-25 mins to walk to La Rambla and about 10 mins to walk to a Metro stop.  The tourist bus is fantastic value and will take you all around the city.  You can get on and off wherever you like and the hotel reception sells tickets 2 Euros cheaper than it is on the bus itself.   Beware of the price of some of the food though, I walked into a little bakery type shop (it looked for all the world like a Spanish Oddies or Greggs).  I bought one slice of french bread pizza that was only luke warm and a can of no-brand orangeade and it came to 9 euros 50.  I nearly died.

I would also like to say that it is absolute rubbish about all the pickpockets in Barcelona and how unsafe it is.  I feel quite angry for Barcelona that it is talked about in such a way.  We were on La Rambla every evening and always felt extremely safe.   We did not see anyone at all dodgy and noone approached us or tried to steal from us at all.  Do not let the pickpocketing stories worry you - it's all overhyped nonsense.",5,2011,06,01
59,Very good value for money and good location,"The lobby of this hotel and it's roof terrace are probably the most impressive things about it.

We found it to be good value for money as it was difficult to find reasonably priced accomodation for the dates we wanted to travel.
 
The staff were vrey friendly and helpful.

We were also 'upgraded' in that we had one of the 'suites' in the attic. Although this meant we had a separate 'living' and bedroom area, the rooms were very small. The sofa was very uncomfortable, not that we wanted to sit there for long anyway. The bed was also too hard with really soft floppy pillows - we had to ask for more as we only had one each, they were so floppy that 2 each wasn't even enough really!

We did not eat breakfast there but used the coffee shop on the corner - about 3 euros for coffee and a croissant. We ordered room service twice. Once for drinks to be brought up to the roof terrace in the afternoon (excellent service then). The second time was for coffee one morning, it didn't arrive after 20 minutes so we cancelled it!

There is wifi availabe for a fee. However, if you have BT broadband then you can connect via BT openzone which seems to be 'twinned' with the company the hotel use, but obviously make sure you know your username and password for BT openzone.

Overall I would suggest this is a good place to stay because of it's price and location and excellent staff. However, personally I feel they need to get better pillows and springier mattresses!",3,2011,05,31
59,Disappointing room,"Stayed here for a long birthday weekend with my girlfriend. We were told on arrival we were ""UPGRADED"" to a superior room. Not sure it was soo superior, the room itself was fine, good size and clean, although the walls had test paint patches on them! The biggest problem was we had to go outside/to the roof terrace to check the weather as we had no natural light whatsoever. Our view consisted of four concrete walls! Normally quite easy going travellers who wouldn't normally spend time in our room but we were really disappointed as this was a special occasion we were both looking forward. Otherwise great location and lovely restaurants/bars in the area. The roof terrace is a great way to chill out after a day in the bustling city centre. Staff could have been a bit friendlier helping out tourists. none the less a good trip and would stay again if we could choose a better room!",3,2011,05,29
59,very clean hotel and good location,"This was the second time we stayed in the hotel.
Very clean hotel, good breakfast, good location.
5 minutes walk to the Rambla, Diagonal and Passeig de Gracia.
Nice restaurant at the streetcorner .

This time the room was at the front, much more noise in the night than I had expected. That was a pity.",3,2011,05,23
59,Perfect holiday,"During a recent holiday in Barcelona we stayed at Astoria for 4 nights mainly because of the TripAdvisor reviews, great on-line room rate & we wanted to to be away from La Rambla (but not too far) due to stories about pickpockets targeting tourists. 

We checked in on a Monday night (10.45pm). The 24 hour hotel reception staff was very friendly and provided a handy detailed map of the city. We found the room and toilet to be a bit small for 2 people but as we got it for a good rate can't complain. The bedding was very comfortable, a iron & table was provided on request & hair dryer worked!. Hotel has free Wi-Fi in the lobby & couple of computers to access Internet. 

We did not have breakfast at the hotel, as there were plenty of small cafes a short walk away. The hotel is located in Eixample, which is a 10- 15 minute walk to couple of Gaudi attractions: La Pedreda (also called Casa Mila) & Casa Balto and there's lots of boutique & high end shopping close by (lots along Passeig de Gracia). 

On most days we walked to the Diagonal Metro station which is about 5-10 minute walk from the hotel in order to get to La Rambla, Sagrada Familia & Parc Guell (purchase T10 metro ticket which can be used for 10 trips during your stay).

I would definitely recommend this hotel if you just need a comfortable & safe place to stay during your holiday. We did not spend much time in the hotel apart from sleeping:-) as there will be plenty to keep you on your toes in beautiful Barcelona.",4,2011,05,13
59,"Good location, lovely room and breakfast, shame about the view!","Took my boyfriend to Barcelona for his 30th and wanted to stay somewhere central as we had 3 days to see all the sites! Astoria was definately central only a couple of mins walk from ave diagonal an the bus stops 4 the hop on hop off buses. 
The room was lovely, modern and v clean, bathroom v nice but a bit on the small side - although my boyfriend would say I'm just being picky! View from the room was the most disappointing thing- it was 4 walls an no natural light but we didnt spenc a lot of the time in the room was not a major isdue. Breakfast was great with a range of    pastries, meat, cheese, yoghurt and  fruit. The hotel staff were also really helpful. Would definately go back!",4,2011,05,10
59,Nice location and very good service!,Stayed at the hotel for two days during Champions League football semifinal. The staff was very helpful and assisted us in getting tickets to the game. Nice terrasse om the roof to relax after a day sightseeing. Ask for a room with terrasse,4,2011,05,07
59,City hotel,Just a city hotel.. Don't expect something special.. Staff is good :),3,2011,04,25
59,Nice modern hotel but devoid of atmosphere,"Nice upmarket part of town, 5 mins taxi ride north of the hustle and bustle of the main attractions e.g Las Ramblas.  Hotel was very clean with nice decor but lacked an ambience.  The bar and bar area was not the most conducive for relaxation after the hustle and bustle of Barcelona, it had the atmosphere of a dentists waiting room.  Luckily there were bars and restaurants within walking distance that offered 'life'.  Hotel staff were very helpful, however, there was so little life in the bar that we couldn't even find the barman on two evenings.
The bedroom was very small but perfectly formed.  Again immaculately clean but lacked daylight as the room looked out in to a tall and narrow light shaft.  We couldn't even see the sky without putting our head out of the window and looking up an additional four floors.  The room was not big enough or comfy to relax in and unwind after a long busy day in Barca.  We couldn't even relax and watch some TV as all channels were Spanish.
The roof top pool was lovely but only enough sun loungers for approx 5 people!!!  We visited the pool each night to see if we could get a sun lounger for half an hour to unwind (as this was not possible in the room) and chill out but to no avail.",3,2011,04,07
59,Recommend to All,"Our fourth stay here and as usual it was perfect.  Great service, reception staff cannot do enough for you.  Room was an upgrade on the one we reserved which was great.  The hotel is in a great position for signtseeing, within walking distance of most places or very near the metro which is easy to use.  We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to everyone!",5,2011,03,08
59,"Highly Recommended. Very Well Managed Hotel, Perfect Location, Professional and Efficient Staff.","I arrived in Barcelona at midnight from a very long restless flight and not feeling well, but I left in perfect shape with a wonderful experience to bring back with me. 

Astoria hotel has a team of very professional, efficient, well trained, friendly staff resulting to customer satisfaction. This is reflection of a good management. 

The Hotel Manager, Mr. Pepe Camps, takes his time out to talk to guests and asks if everything is going well, accepts feedback and takes criticism constructively. He also offered assistance in booking a hotel to my next destination (Paris). The fact that the Manager takes time out to approach the guests is indication of professionalism. 

Mr. Manuel is the best front desk staff there could ever be! I hope all hotel staff in the world is like him. Very good attitude making guests feel welcomed. 

Some of the things that impressed me a lot and might help future visitors to Barcelona:

Location:

Perfectly located, safe neighborhood, accessible to almost everywhere – bus and metro stations in and around the city, to and from the airport, shopping, sightseeing, restaurants, coffee shops – everything is stone-throw and yet away from the crowd unlike those hotels along  main street

Front Desk:
1.	Wide spacious area, very clean, highly polished floor.

2.	Very quiet – day or night… Guests checking in and out (which can be chaotic at some hotels) but because the front desk staff manage the guests properly it all went smoothly.

3.	Warm welcome, friendly staff – whether front desk or maintenance people all of them never failed to greet guests with a smile (how can you not have a great day!). One early morning I decided to go for a walk. As I walked to the door I was greeted with smile again and was advised to wait a little while as it was still a bit dark outside, although it’s a perfectly very safe area.

4.	Very helpful staff from sightseeing to medical needs… Especially Manuel who helped me with the instruction how to take the fever medicine – thank you Manuel.

5.	Check in was perfectly smooth, hassle-free, it went very quick and I was headed to my room.

Room:
1. The room was not small at all it had a couch and huge cabinet. What impressed me the most is it’s very clean condition! Astoria has very good housekeeping management. There was a minor problem with the heater but that was attended to and resolved immediately within minutes. The friendly staff showed me the other available rooms (all equally in good and clean condition) and finally got the room with a view of the neighborhood, which I really loved because it had a window allowing fresh air and I could see the locals do their morning routine… 

2. Very quiet at anytime of the day… had a restful sleep and it made me recovered from jetlag quickly. If there were some noise it’s because of undisciplined inconsiderate guests being loud and careless moving around the hallway and rooms. It’s not the hotel’s fault. 

3. Bathroom (shower and bath) was likewise clean and amenities are replenished in time. The sink had a slight crack but did not post a problem at all. 

4. Comfortable bed and pillows! I have a back problem and was concerned that the bed could cause pain, but I had the perfect bed for may back.
. 
Breakfast:
1. Quite a selection of food but the best part is the coffee. There’s a coffee brewer right on the buffet table but the nice lady staff told me she would take it to my table. She actually had a freshly brewed coffee made for me delivered to my table. Nothing better than to start a day with a good coffee and a friendly waitstaff!

2. Table nicely set, spoons and fork are clean (I always check this at restaurants).

3. As I was eating I could see a lady staff clear the table on my right that a couple used. Then a gentleman colleague of hers approached and helped her out. Very good teamwork right there! Staff working harmoniously and efficiently – again a reflection of good management.  

By far the best hotel and service by team of professionals. Will definitely stay at Astoria again in my next visit in June 2011.",5,2011,02,20
59,Just a City Hotel Don't expect anything else!!!,We stayed  two days in this hotel. Staff were not helpful and welcoming people who do not care customer and customer's satisfaction.They don't say even good morning or welcome. The room was clean and big size but there was not window. The bathroom was also clean and big. At 5 am there was too much noise on the corridor I had to wake up really early.The location was not closed to city center and La Rambla. When I go Barcelona again I am not going to stay in this hotel!! It was not a good choice for me.,3,2011,01,26
59,Great getaway!,"Just got back to uk (13th nov) We had a room on the 7th floor which had been refurbished to a very nice standard, the only problem was we were awoken the next morning to hammering on the floor above. They have the builders in which reception had 'forgotten' to tell us about. It was fine for us as we were out all day but if you fancied a quiet break from all that shopping then you are out of luck although i cant comment on the noise on the lower floors. Also the walls are paper thin, we found ourselves whispering to each other at one stage. On a more positive note the staff are great , room was very nice , hotel situated near the diagonal/ramblas catalunya and a 5 min walk to the metro. Nice cafe next door and you are surrounded by loads of nice restaurants. Oh and by the way if you come across a chinese restaurant a few hundred metres away from the hotel, dont go there. nuff said.",3,2010,11,13
59,The Astoria Hotel and Staff are just great!!!,"I went on holidays from Perth, Australia  to Barcelona, I booked the hotel from here because other people gave me excellent information about it and also I got the same opinion from the travel agency and it was just a fantastic experience. The staff was very helpful nice and friendly, food was great, value was also very good.
I would strongly reccomend the Astoria Hotel to people who wish to really enjoy holidays in Barcelona or any other activities.",5,2010,11,09
59,Ideal for short break,"My wife & I travelled to Barcelona for a short break & chose Astoria as it's close to city centre, but it's a quiet area. Hotel staff are excellent, very friendly & helpful. Room we were allocated on 1st night didn't have any view so we asked for change of room & were shown 4 alternatives to choose from, absolutely no problem. City centre is 15min walk, beach is 15min by 17 bus (next street) Park Guell 15min by 24 bus. Tip-buy a T10 journey ticket from newsagents stands etc.-lot easier to see places, cost 7.50 euros. Lots of cafes in vicinity, recommend Cup & Cake cafe around corner as it's so different. Area around hotel is safe to walk around. Few streets along from hotel is top of Rambla Catalyuna & is pleasant stroll down to Pl. Catalyuna. If you are shopping, don't wait until Sunday to buy, as all (including major) shops are closed.",4,2010,11,09
59,"Affordable, great location, clean","Staying at Hotel Astoria right now.  If you want quiet I highly recommend requesting a room facing the courtyard.  You'd never know you were in the middle of Barcelona.  The rooms are clean, bespoke and bigger than I expected for the price.  I have a double window that is open fully, letting in the cool night breeze.
The location is great - 15 minutes walking to Sagrada Familia, 20 minutes to Parc Guell, 20 minutes to Plaza Catalunya, and, of course, 10 minutes to the massive, ubiquitous El Corte Ingles, 2 minutes to the metro.  
And affordable - it's really a lot of room for the money.  What more could you ask for?",4,2010,11,06
59,"Beautifull,great location and great staff!","We stayed at this hotel after  being on a cruise for a week and we were very happy with everything except for the WIFI,I had to go to the lobby everytime I wanted to use my computer.It did not work in the room for some reason.Other than that, we loved it,we had a wonderfull lunch at a restaurant just around the corner from the hotel.It is very close to alot of tourist attractions.Staff very friendly and helpfull.",4,2010,10,26
59,Just what we were looking for!,"We booked 3 nights in an executive double room.
We were initially offered a twin room but that was changed very simply on check-in.
We took advantage of breakfast for 9 Euros a head, a little cheaper than the online rate.
The room was good; it was at the front of the hotel which was OK but a little noisy despite good double glazing. The room was very black & white but quite cool and minimal which is what we like.The bedroom furniture was a little old but acceptable. The bathroom was very clean and the shower over the bath really excellent. The air conditioning was OK, not fantastic despite it not being a particularly hot October time. The mini-bar was the usual over-priced stuff but the fridge was very useful for Cava bought at the local Caprabo supermarket.
Breakfast was very pleasant with the hottest hotel coffee I have ever tasted!
It would appear you only get offered hot food from Monday to Friday with Saturday and Sunday having a slightly greater selection of cold meats to make up for the lack of hot food. I think the breakfast was good and fairly good value for money but I would have been really quite bored with the same food had I have stayed any longer.
The staff were helpful but in very short supply. I reckon I only saw 4 or 5 different faces in the 3 nights we stayed at the hotel.
The roof-top pool and tables were very pleasant but I'm afraid the weather just wasn't good enough to make use of them.
The decor was lovely with some great old art deco/art nouveau posters, some of which I photographed and will upload.

All in all we had a very pleasant stay; the hotel is quite smart, quiet and in a very nice area, well away from Rambla and the noise down that way. The area has some excellent shops and wonderful restaurants.
It wasn't our first choice of hotel but for a late booking I would say it was much better than I expected.",4,2010,10,16
59,GREAT VALUE-WELL LOCATED- FRIENDLY STAFF-LOVELY HOTEL. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.,"Great overall hotel. 5 grown up women ALL loved this nice hotel, slept well, showered well, and enjoyed the welcome and the service. 5-6 minute walk from Metro. We would certainly use this again, and recommend it. We did not have breakfast here as there are plenty of great cafes on all corners. Thanks to Expedia for ease of booking, and Tripadvisor for the very reliable system.",4,2010,10,16
59,Great spot in Barcelona,"We enjoyed our stay at the Astoria, travelling with my boyfriend and his sister.  Her room was tiny, and only accessible by the back stairs, but when we complained, it was changed immediately.  Very close to the Metro, within walking distance to the Metro and the hop on-hop off bus lines and plenty of restaurants close by.  The rooftop patio is lovely, the pool is very small, but great for a quick dip to cool off.  Our package (Air Canada tours) included the breakfast, which was excellent.",4,2010,10,15
59,Not Great,"I am not a fussy person but I am not too sure if i would stay in this hotel again. The room was tiny. There was a window which looked out onto a shaft (hard to describe), it meant that there was no natural light at all. The room was pitch black during beautiful sunny days. I used to go down to the main door in the mornings to see what the weather was like before deciding what to wear for the day. I must admit we did see the funny side as the room was clean and Barcelona was great, but seriously you would want to be getting rock-bottom prices to put up with a room like this. I would only reccommend this hotel if it was cheaper and if i was guaranteed a room with some natural light. The hotel staff were also quite relaxed, i was left waiting in the hotel bar for 15 minutes despite ringing the bell again and again, all i wanted was a bottel of water and it took them another 10 minutes to figure out how much to charge me. They then charged me a different price every day. It's a good thing i have a sense of humour!",2,2010,10,04
59,Rooms are like box's!,"Stayed in the hotel astoria with my boyfriend, location was very good, apart from that the hotel is very overpriced, our room was terrible! very small with the window looking at the elevator shaft, so we had no outside air coming in, poor service, bathroom falling apart, bed hard, would never stay again, as there are so many hotels in barcelona, miles better!",1,2010,10,03
59,good and decent place,"it is 4 blocks walk to Pg Gracia where Casa Pedrera is. approx 15 minutes walk
There is a big grocery store - as u exit the hotel turn right and turn left in c/Aribau (which is the immediate intersection).
Asian eats: on c/Aribau across the grocery store and on c/Rosello between c/Enric Granados and Balmes.
The hotel has a rooftop pool - (small one) - and a fitness area with 3 machines. 
if you like running it is only a block from Diagonal street which runs to the port -- long stretch of street that is lined with trees.
The first 3days of our stay was good.. peaceful and quiet. until we had neighbors that were really noisy -- walking, and banging door loudly.  u would think they were dinosaurs. But this is not the fault of the hotel. It is just that most hotel in Europe have thin walls i guess and guests can be inconsiderate.
the bed could be more fluffier and it would be a perfect place. They gave us additional pillows - and that solved my problem
we were in room 827.. nice location -- we have the view of the city and the rooftop pool and fitness room  in the same level.
the employees were also good - natured.",4,2010,09,29
59,Terrible room,"Went to Barcelona for a long weekend, got a overpriced room at the Astoria, room had only one small window and was not facing the outside streed, room interior was 1 - 2 stars max. After a complaint we got a slightly Better Room, but the Next Morning we discovered Moldau all over the bathroom ceiling. WLAN was working only intermittent. Not recommendet.",2,2010,09,27
59,"average rooms, ok location: May not stay again.","I booked this hotel for my holiday in barcelona nd honestly speaking I wasn't happy with any of the hotel facilities.
1. Rooms are tiny and sparsely furnished. One can see that the rooms are old and the hotel mgmt hasn't spend money on refurbishing the same. They may have spend money on the lobby.
2. The gym as mentioned on the hotel website has only 3 stationary bikes. That's it. Nothing more, nothing less.
3. The swimming pool on terrace is a pond. They should make it a jacuzzi. Then atleast the romantic couples can make use of it.
4. Buffet breakfast was ok. Not much choice of vegetarians but it was ok. No complaint.
5. The staff at Front desk is very temperamental. It all depends on what mood or how how busy they are. This defines the time they will spend with you on phone in dealing with your issues.
6. I have heard people talk about the grand staircase. It's nice and pretty but one cannot live there so I don't see any point in envisaging the same.

The only good thing about the hotel is the location: 2 blocks off Plaza de Catalunya and 1 block off Diagonal and quite close to Segrada Familia. If one wants to stay out of the hotel doing sight seeing and be with friends, which is exactly what I did: I would say you can live here. Else, don't .",3,2010,09,24
59,Great base for exploring Barcelona,"My wife and I stayed here for four nights in September, 2010.  The hotel is around seven or eight minutes walk from the nearest metro station.

The staff are very helpful, answering any questions that you may have and recommending restaurants and places to see.  The breakfast bufet is not included in the room price but you can get it for an extra EUR 6.5 per person, per day if you take it on every morning of your stay.  It's nice with some hot options available.

There is a very small pool up on the top with six sunbeds where it is nice to lie after a day sightseeing.  It can get a little busy up there on occasion.  There is a small computer room with two computers which I never found to be unavailable.

Overall a great hotel for a short stay in Barclona.",4,2010,09,21
59,"Nice place, but my room had limited windows....","Hotel was located in the Eixample area on the far side from the beach, but a couple blocks to the metro. The hotel lobby was great, and staff are very attentive and greet you daily. I was shown to my room, which looked like it was a late addition to the hotel on the top floor of the hotel.

My room had two small windows, which were opague so I could not see outside. On the last day of my stay, I discovered that the skylight in my room, which had a blind on it, actually opened up to allow daylight and fresh air into the room. This was not really a problem though, as I did not really spend much time at the hotel.  There is free internet in the hotel which is a plus, and a tiny gym with a couple of stair masters in it. The pool is more like a hottub, but is on the roof with a great view of the city, and ocean. I was able to watch an incredible thunderstorm from here.

The restaurant on the ground floor is charming and offers a full European breakfast for an extra fee. It is a buffet, which has lots of great fresh fruits, juices, coffeee, tea, yogurt, breads, daily egg dishes, cheeses and cold cuts. They will also arrange bacon or sausage and eggs for you, which is included in the price. It is a great way to start your day.

There are also a number of furniture and clothing stores in the immediate area, asa well as a number of outdoor cafes and restaurants, which is nice. Bars are all over the place so you do not have to venture far from the hotel. 

One big plus is that the hotel is renovated, which makes it nice and it is in a very quiet area, so I never had any problems sleeping.  I would recommend this hotel to other people for either long or short stays. It is very clean, comfortable, and safe. The staff again are great, and very helpful with any questions that you may have.

I made my reservation for a single person, thinking I would get a twin bed, but actually got a double bed, which made it a great stay. The closet in my room was ample for a week's worth of clothing.  And the price makes it very affordable. I would recommend this hotel to others. Thank you Hotel Asoria.... and I am a hotelier from Canada!",4,2010,09,16
59,Nice choise in Barcelona,"Location: The location of the hotel was close to best food oportunities in the city. The subway is not very close but renting a scooter can faicilitate your travel (the reception can help or you can rent from http://www.cooltra.com/ ). There is a ""fresch co"" close to the hotel wich is a nice and cheap option to eat.

Room: the room was cozy and practical. not a pleasent window view. there was a leak in the ceiling and when the customer upstairs had a shower the water drop off. comfortable beds. The bed sheets were dirty first but they replaced it when we asked.

Hotel: Free internet and computer, amazing breakfast (except cold tea and coffe), helpful staff, nice interior design. Actually it was the best breakfast i had in a western european country (considering i hate ham and bacon). free parking lot for motors.",3,2010,09,14
59,Lovely hotel in a beautiful building,"The Astoria is a lovely hotel in a beautiful building just off the Diagonal and near the top of the Rambla De Catalunya. Five minutes walk to the nearest Metro.
The reception is very impressive when you arrive. All marble and wood. The spectacular spiral staircase is worth visiting itself.
Our rooms were as you'd expect from a three star hotel, not huge but nice. The bathroom was a good size. The rooms  were properly cleaned every day. Staff were friendly and helpful. Very close to a lot of restaurants and bars.
We were on the seventh floor so there was a bit of noise, even at night, from the rooftop swimming pool above us but that was the only quibble.",4,2010,08,16
59,a wonderful stay,the hotel was in a good location not far from the centre of the city with bus stops etc not far away at all. the staff were polite and helpful and showed us to our room on our arrival. rooms had air conditioning and an extremely nice en suite bathroom. eveyrthing was always spotless and the roof top swimming pool was gorgeous on a sunny august evening after a full day of sightseeing. we didn't eat in the hotel at all but there was a lovely bakery/cafe over the road where we had a croissant and coffee every morning for a very reasonable price.,4,2010,08,06
59,"Nice, clean hotel in Barcelona","Hotel Astoria was a nice clean hotel to stay in while we were in Barcelona. The front desk staff could be surly, or nice, depending on who was there. Two gentlemen in the afternoon would not give me three towels for the teenagers room because rooms are cleaned once a day. Yeah, but what if they forget to leave any towels? Maybe this is normal in Spain, in the US they will give you a stack of towels without blinking. They looked at me suspiciously, but gave me the towels. The bartender was very nice and helpful. Always quick with drinks, snacks and helpful tips, a great guy. The spiral staircase is amazing!!!",4,2010,08,06
59,3 days in Barcelona,"We stayed here for 2 nights in April and the hotel is very well located and less then 10 minutes from the Metro. I booked this stay from a Travelzoo promotion and paid 69 Euros all inclusive B&B per night with the room upgraded to Executive room. We arrived shortly after midday and were checked in without any fuss and shown to our room.The room was fine but had no view. The Air con was not that great but we did not spend too much time in the room during the day and was just cool enough at night.
On our first morning we had to wait for a table for breakfast and after a few minutes we were shown to a table that had not been cleared. The table was quickly cleared and  It was Buffet style cold/continental breakfast but not much to our liking. The 2nd morning we were up earlier and were shown to a table that was ready and there is a very small menu which you can order cooked breakfast from on the table so look out or ask for a menu for the cooked items. The helpings are small but  quite delicious, so much so that we cheekily asked for seconds and with a shrug from a waitress and a 10 minutes wait we were served. I must admit that we found the hotel Good but the staff were professional and competant without being friendly and welcoming.
The roof terrace and dipping pool is very relaxing after a day out sight seeing. There is a phone so you can order drinks from the bar to be brought up to you.
In Barcelona we found the Tapas Bars very expensive but the falafal bars fantastic, tasty and very good value.",4,2010,08,04
59,Great hotel for a one night stay,"We stayed at this hotel following a cruise out of Barcelona.  We arrived at the hotel around 11am, and although our room wasn't ready we were able to check in and leave our luggage.

The hotel was clean and very nice.  The staff at the front desk spoke English well.  They were able to confirm our airport transportation and give us tips on sightseeing.  Checking out was very easy too.

We would definitely stay here again!",5,2010,08,02
59,"fantastic breakfast, nice area","We really liked this hotel.  The rooms were small, but it was in a very nice location with cafes right outside, helpful staff and an excellent breakfast.",4,2010,07,31
59,Not bad...,"Stayed here last week, Staff helpfulness was hit and miss as a previous writer said. I have back problems and had to cut short my stay, they refused to give me a refund on the 3 days that I couldn’t make it due to injury, I thought this was pretty bad customer service, it wouldn’t make me want to recommend them to anyone or go back, I did give them a weeks notice on this, they could have easily re-sold the room. When I got there I asked for 2 extra pillows for my back, they could only get me one, not much good to me. And unfortunately our air con in the room didn’t work. In 40 degree heat it was very much missed! No sleep to be had at all!
The rooftop pool was a godsend, nice breeze up there! Very small, but served its purpose. Rooms were nice. Good Space, not too clean, but liveable. Not far from metro lines and shopping district. 
Am not usually one for complaining but wasn’t too happy with this hotel.",3,2010,07,19
59,Brilliant Value Hotel,The Hotel is fantastic - I went with a group of 5 other friends. The staff were helpful and polite even when we asked to extend our check out time they were very gracious allowing us an extra 2 hours at no extra cost. The location is great - close to all the action and within walking distance of Avenguida Diagonal one of the main streets. Rooms were clean and nicely presented. To top it all off there is a Rooftop pool. All in all I would definately stay here again without a doubt.,5,2010,07,16
59,"Very helpful, ideally situated for city.","Staff were exremely helpful throughout our stay - but especially when one of our party had to return to the UK at short notice during our stay - she being the least Spannish speaking of us all - they did all they could to assist her.  Hotel was very clean and cool.  Good for access to Ramblers and city tours.  Metro is just 5 mins walk away from where you can get connections to Sitges and Montserrat and very good access to several local cafes (right on your doorstep) that provide a range of beverages and meals.  Though much more is available at a short walk also.  Rooftop pool is small - and gets busy later in the day as people return from days out but is clean and well maintained with several seperate areas for groups or families to sit.

Would highly recommend if only for the helpfulness of the staff - but overall experience has a lot going for it also.  + + + Would visit again.",5,2010,07,12
59,nice place,"Nice place, room appeared new and remodeled, but with no view at all.  Location was good, metro was 10 minutes away.  I wouldn't rush back to stay here, but overall it was a good experience.",4,2010,07,04
59,The best hotel in barcelona!,"A beautiful hotel, right in the center of barcelona. The staff is very nice and helpful, and the rooms are gorgeous. Very clean hotel and bathrooms, and an excellent bar. The best hotel ive been to here.",5,2010,06,29
59,Mixed Experience- Hit and Miss Service.,"Stayed in this hotel twice within 2 weeks with 2.5 days at each visit. The location is great, away from most tourists and tour buses. A short 10min walk away from the metro, albeit a walk on not so clean streets. Conveniently located to dining, cafes, tapas bars and restaurants. Infrequent use of metro as all tourist attractions were walkable, within 30min. 
The room assigned on the first leg was very comfortable even though the room was compact, the bathroom was spacious. Bathroom appeared recently remodeled. Room and public areas were sparkling clean. Clean Bath linens were happily supplied daily; though not necessarily bed linens.
Occasional loud noise level was tolerable and generally from exuberant guests. Loud conversations from adjacent rooms audible.
Reception staff though not overly friendly or warm were at least helpful when approached. English easily used.  WIFI Spotty and generally Slow unless in wee hours of night.
Decided to also stay here on the 2nd leg since the first experience was good. 
Then was assigned a room and bathroom cramped and claustrophobic. Plumbing in sink and tub left much to be desired. No effort to address the problem even though it was immediately reported. No explanation given. Because of the drainage problem and awkward way the faucets were located wife had a fall in the tub. No, did not report this. 
Whilst somewhat disappointed by this lackluster service to a real issue, will recommend hotel only with reservation, assurance of improved service.",3,2010,06,03
59,All you need in a hotel when visiting Barcelona!,"We booked this through a deal on Travelzoo and I was worried that I had booked in haste as I am a stickler for hotels having to be spic spok clean! But when we got there it was great. We had a free upgrade to a Superior room, which basically gave us a little side room nothing more. The  room was slightly dated but clean and very comfortable. Service was fantastic, breakfast was good but standard selection. Mini bar was reasonable and the room service great! We were a bit of a walk from Las Ramblas but an enjoyable safe walk and was nice to do in the evening. We spent half a day round the pool on the roof and if was lovely - although it is a very small pool more for dipping than swimming we completely chilled out. Not sure how much you would pay normally but for me the best bargain I ever had at £300 for 4 nights including breakfast.",4,2010,05,12
59,Perfect Stay - perfect little hotel!,"We stayed from Monday to Friday at this lovely hotel... it really does have a lovely atmoshpere as you first arrive into the lobby and see all the facisnating prints.  Quite classy!  
The hotel itself is set right on Ave Diagonal and it is about 10 minutes walk to the nearest metro. (we shared a T10 metro ticket between us and got a two day bus pass to take in all the sights as it was my partners' first time visiting barcelona - and I  thought it w really was a great way to get about).
The hotel is set in a lovely area and a night we didn't bother about the hustle of the Ramblas and tried out local resturants late on for something to eat.  On the corner, Just to the left of the playpark on Calle de Paris there is a lovely big resturant that was buzzing with locals inside and outside - the food there is great!
Also we took a taxi to Negro Roja on Ave Diagonal - amazing food -fine dining fantastic atmosphere. well worth the visit for a special meal!! 
We had breakfast in the hotel each day - great continental selection
Our room in the hotel was small - however, once we got unpacked it quickly felt like home.  We were on the 8th floor and had our own private dining/ reading area overlooking the terrace.  However, at night we preferred to take a bottle of cava to the balcony by the pool... it really was the perfect hotel for a perfect stay (esp cava and rings in park guell)",5,2010,05,10
59,Lovely Hotel,Stayed for two nights with a group of friends.  The hotel rooms were tidy and clean and well maintained.  The surrounding area did have many places to eat and drink.  Was a bit of a walk into Las Ramblas but could always try metro or taxi which was farily resonable.  We did actually walk it on our last night which we found ok.The hotel staff were extremely helpful with info about tourist attractions such as times of Mass at the cathedral and booking us an airport transfer as we flew in Reus.  I had a technical problem with the in room safe but someone came to hlep within 10 mins and all was sorted.  I would highly recommend this hotel as good value but not if you want to be in the centre by Las Rabmlas.,4,2010,05,01
59,GREAT HOTEL,"My wife and I recently stayed at the Hotel Astoria for five nights.  We were extremely pleased.  To start with, our room, while on the small side, was tastefully decorated, very clean, as well as very quiet.  The hotel in general came across as very well maintained as well.  We found the Staff to very very friendly and extremely helpful.  I was especially impressed with the artwork spread across a couple of rooms on the lobby level.  The old posters were impressive.  By far the best thing about the hotel is it's location.  It is on a quiet street along the north edge of the Eixample.  It is a short walk to the Metro as well as the main streets (Ramblas and Passeig de Gracia).  Casa Mila (La Pedrera) is less than a 10 minute walk.  There are a number of restaurants within a few blocks of the hotel, along with some very good bars/cafes.  One is on the corner right across the street from the hotel.  They have great Churros con Chocolate for breakfast as well as tapas all day long.  It is also very safe area, day or night.  We would glady stay there again!",5,2010,04,22
59,"Nice, good value hotel in the Eixample area","Pros: The hotel is very nicely renovated, excellent value for money and well worth its 3 stars. The rooms are roomy enough, quiet and nicely decorated. The bathrooms were clean and new. Rooms were cleaned, beds made and towels changed every morning. The breakfast is excellent with lots of fruit, bread, meats and cakes. The staff is very helpful and polite.

The hotel is situated in the Eixample are, within easy walking distance of the tube. There are shops around, but to get to most sights you will have to use public transport, but it is very easy to use. If you're up for walking, you can walk along Passeig de Gracia all the way to Placa Catalana in a reasonable time.

Cons: With no control of the heater the rooms (we had 2) were quite chilly. The heater did turn on at night, but it didn't make much of a difference. There is not much nightlife for young people near the hotel, all the nice places seemed to be elsewhere. There were, however, a few cocktail bars nearby. The only minus concerning service (which is typical of Spanish hotels I am told) is that after your stay it seems to be impossible to get a reply to e-mails from the hotel. I left my camera in my room and tried to enquire after it, but after several e-mails have had no reply and will have to make a call if I wish to get any information.

All in all, a nice hotel and would definitely consider staying there on my next visit.",4,2010,04,12
59,"Fabulous hotel, delightful surroundings and helpful staff","Booked via Late Rooms for a girly weekend - easy to find off main roads, area felt safe to walk about in even at night.

On arrival staff were helpful, friendly and efficient and we were promptly provided with our room key.  They even recommended somewhere for dinner as it was rather late. 
The room was immaculately clean and, as requested at time of booking, had twin beds and was overlooking the street with an opening window.  It was cleaned daily during our visit.  Although you could hear noise from overhead/adjoining rooms it was not excessive and we had no complaints.  On our final day, some updating work was to be carried out on adjoining rooms but this didnt begin until after 9.30 a.m. so was not a great imposition and the staff did apologise for the resulting disturbance.

We didnt make use of the pool as it was still too cold but the terrace was pleasant to sit out on in the sunshine and offered a good view of the surrounding skyline and even the sea!  The sun loungers were new and comfortable.  The gym is small, contains a little sauna and a shower with aa few exercise bikes.  The restaurant/bar areas were clean and well maintained although we did not eat there.  the overall public areas were delightful with relaxing seating and interesting artwork. 

We made enquiries for several trips from reception and all the staff were helpful, finding leaflets and discount vouchers and cheerful and courteous in their manner.  On our final day we asked to leave our cases until our evening flight and they were immediately tagged and whisked off to a side room.  On our return (through the snow!) my case had a paper bag hooked to the handle which contained my nightgown that I had apparently left in the room - not only had they restored it to me, but it had also been laundered!

I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and would be happy to stay there again during any future visits.",5,2010,03,29
59,Clean Classy Hotel in the Eixample Area,"This is a clean, classy hotel in the Eixample north of the city center. It's about a 5-10 minute walk to the nearest Metro stop (Diagonal). Many excellent restaurants and shopping around, with some Gaudi works not too far away, either. 

The area is modern and clean, with wide streets. Taxis abound, as well as numerous good restaurants, shops, etc. Always felt very safe.

Depending on what your travel plans are, you might wish to stay nearer to the Placa Catalunya or futher into the Barri Gotic. Otherwise, this is an excellent value for a clean room, with no noise, excellent service, and a great central location for all that Barcelona has to offer.",4,2010,03,26
59,"Comfy, clean, classy, friendly, great location, excellent value","We came here for 4 nights and stayed for 2 weeks - staff very helpful, rooms comfy, wifi slow or non existent sometimes in room but always available in the very comfy and spacious lobby where you can watch the street life and enjoy a coffee, drink or meal from the in house cafe.  Highly recommend.  The only problerm we encountered a few nights was the same problem we encountered all over Spain which was the occassional smoke drifting into our room - as non smokers in a population of heavy smokers it was sometimes tricky - the staff were very helpful in locating the guest/s who were smoking in the non smoking area.",5,2010,03,17
59,Great location,"We recently stayed at the Astoria for six nights.  While the rooms are small, they are well appointed and comfortable.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  We did not spend a lot of time in the hotel as we wanted to see as much of the city as possible.  The Astoria was great for just that reason.  Just a quick walk to the metro or the Ramblas de Catalunya had you on your way to the middle of everything.  When we wanted to stay close, there were plenty of options for dining in the blocks that surrounded the hotel.  I would go back to the Astoria if visiting Barcelona.",3,2010,03,08
59,Good hotel in a quiet location,"The hotel is a little north of Plaça de Catalunya (one stop on the train) in the Eixample district. This is where most of the Modernist buildings are like Sagrada Familia and La Pedrera. My room was in the interior of the hotel so had no view but it was clean and tastefully decorated. The hotel staff were helpful and polite. I didn't try the restaurant or breakfast but there are plenty of little cafe's around to grab a coffee and croissant. For the rate I paid, the hotel was a bargain and I would definitely return.",4,2010,02,28
59,Marginal Quality - Reasonable Price,"The common areas of this hotel are lovely and give you a feeling that it is too good to be true when you walk in the door.  How could this beatutiful hotel be so resaonably priced.  It makes sense when you enter the guest room.  The furnishings are spare and unattractive.  It looks as though it hasn't been updated in years.  It is diffcult to control the temp and opening up a window to the loud and busy street (C/Paris) makes it impossible to sleep.  I was most uncomfortable with the shower.  It was not clean enough to take a bath and the grout between the tiles was covered in mildew.  Very unpleasant.  The staff was generally friendly and helpful with the exception of one desk clerk that was annoyed when asked about local restaurants and didn't like to be bothered for a cocktail in the lounge, when it was clearly his responsibility.  The wi-fi was too slow to be considered useful at all.  The reasonable price makes more sense to me now.",2,2010,01,24
59,A little gem in Barcelona,"We have said at Hotel Astoria twice this year, once in April with our 9 year old son and in October without him.  We had a lovely room in April that slept 3 comfortably and was clean, well appointed and quiet.   It did not have the most pretiest of views - been on the inside - but that did not bother us - as we were so busy.  The common areas were clean and interesting we enjoyed looking at the art work etc.   It was in a lovely location - with some lovely restaurants nearby.   We came back in October and were in a room in the loft - which was not as nicely laid out as our room in April, but we grew to like it - it had a window we could open (and the fresh air was lovely on a hot weekend) and the views across the roof tops was fascinating.   

We had breakfast included in April and it was fine, but in October it was not part of the package so we found the most beautiful deli on the Diagnol not far from the hotel - a favourite with the locals that was fantastic.   It is our hotel of choice for furture visits to Barcelona.",4,2009,12,15
59,Bargain in Barcelona,"The Astoria offers value at a convenient location.  Stayed in an inside room with no view, but it didn't matter as you want to be out as much as possible enjoying this fabulous city.  Room was clean and functional and staff was helpful whenever information was needed.  Only problem was the free wifi in the room was often painfully slow. 

Particularly liked the choice of places to eat in the neighborhood and recommend the Trobador's outdoor tables just around the corner from the hotel where we ate a lunch and a dinner during a three day stay.  Tasty food at decent prices with red wine by the glass for just 3 euros.  

Transportation from the hotel is convenient with number 68 bus stop across the street from Astoria's front door.  It's just four stops to center city's Plaza Catalunya, which took about ten minutes and a fare of 1.35 euros, where the Aerobus to the airport takes about 30 minutes for a five euro fare. Getting from the hotel to the airport in under an hour makes one truly appreciate European efficiency.

Wish I'd known this coming into the city as taking a taxi from Plaza Catalunya after taking the Aerobus from airport was a big mistake.  Driver played dumb and went in wrong direction before being corrected and would not reduce fare because of his mistake.  He also charged extra for two bags in his trunk, so fare was 17 euros when a bus would have cost less than two.  So avoid Barcelona taxis like the plague!",4,2009,11,19
59,Small InExpensive Quaint Hotel,"Found this hotel through the NY Times Travel section for great small hotels under 150 Euros per night.  This hotel was a gem...very clean and nicely furnished.  Room was small but adequate....bathroom was a nice size...had nice toiletries....Very quiet residential neighborhood.  Our only ""complaint"" and it really wasn't that big a deal was that it was a few subway stops away from the action.  Not that much to see or do in the neighborhood.  Would strongly suggest taking the Turista Bus tour to give you the ""lay of the land""  Alot of fun in the Bari Gothic neighborhood.  Ramblas was overrated...Loved Boqueria Market...the Sagrada Familia Cathedral was a MUST SEE...all the Gaudi sights were amazing!  Too much to see in 3 days!",4,2009,11,18
59,Hotel was better than expected,"We thought that the hotel was marvelous! The room was cleaned well every day, cleaning included clean sheets and towels etc. The Front Desk staff were very helpful, only one small error, the tour bus only takes credit cards in the Placa Catalunya terminus not at every stop. The  hotel is located in a good area, a mix of shops, office and residential. Our room was of a good size.  The window opened onto an inner tiny outside area with other windows closeby, this did not concern us as net curtains kept us hidden and the aircon was great.  The room was newly appointed with wooden floor, sofa, comfy bed, flat screen tv, smart bathroom with efficient shower, fridge and all faultless! Small and pleasent sunbathing area and little pool on roof was a real treat. Several cafes restaurants are very closeby. The metro is a short walk from the hotel, perhaps 10 minutes. Beware of pickpockets on the metro. I was a victim and they are very very skillful. Will recommend this hotel to all our friends. . . we were thrilled.",5,2009,10,14
59,Listened to a Tripadvisor review,"I have to say that this is a great resource for finding a great place to stay.  After reading about the Hotel Astoria on this website I decided to go for it.  I wasnt dissappointed.  The Hotel is nothing fancy but it is a quality place to stay.  Nicely located at the top of the Rambla it is a short walk to the main action.  Located in a great neighborhood with a local flare, we had everything we wanted.  Very safe at night to walk around.  We didnt use the Metro until we returned back from our cruise but it was very clean, safe, and easy to navigate.  Take the tourist bus one day and it gives you a whole overview of the city.  Floow-up the next day on the Mtro hitting the spots you missed or wanted to spend more time at.",5,2009,10,09
59,good located clean hotel,"I liked the location of the hotel. Parallel to famous Barcelona street diagonal and close to Ramblas.  Metro station is not very close but 5 minutes walk.  Decoration of the hotel was modern, room and hotel was very clean. 
Our room was looking to a space in the middle of the building, which I did not like so much, on the other hand there was no noise from window. Noise isolation between rooms was not so good they have to do something about it. I think breakfast is little bit expensive if you have time you can eat in the restaurants just next to hotel. You can also chose restaurants for dinner. 
I definitely recommend this hotel for a travelers.",4,2009,09,25
59,Honest 3 Stars,"A true 3 star hotel.  Everything is clean and new.  Small but nice pool on the roof.  Avoid the cafe around the corner-- they have ""special"" prices for foreigners.",4,2009,08,25
59,Fabulous,"We have spent past 4 nights at the astoria Hotel & I would certainly recommend it to anyone. It is a 7 minute walk from the open top bus stop. The hotel is located basically at the top of Ramblas cataluna. This is literally a 2/3 min walk & lots & lots of restaurants right through the middle. To get to the main Ramblas just simply keep walking down through the centre.Its that easy! Hotel itself is spotless & wonderful fresh bedding & towels everyday. Their are no tea /coffee making facilities so if you do like a cuppa first thing or last thing at night might pay to pack a travel kettle etc. The bathroom was gorgeous, clean with a big double shower. Only annoying thing was a noisy slab by the shower as its a wet room so can only assume the main drain is underneath. Hotel staff were polite & courteous at all times. Breakfast is continental with rolls, fresh fruit,  cereals, ham, croissants etc but perfectly acceptable. There is a bar/ italian restaurant 2 min walk away which we often would just come back & sit with a glass of wine outside. There is also free wi fi at the hotel. We did check out the pool upstairs. Its pretty tiny but if you just wanted a chill out maybe with a glass of wine its nice & relaxing. All in all a good experience. PS...A very good restauant is just off the Ramblas called Sinatras, excellent service & food.",5,2009,08,10
59,Nice Hotel - Good Location - Quieter part of town,"Stayed in one of the twin rooms - city break for a few nights - The room was clean and tidy and a good size for a european city hotel - we had a sofa as well as the beds.  En suite was a good size and clean and new.  We had a problem with the hair dryer (one of those hoses attached to the wall) as the lead was snapped - but when we told them at reception it was fixed that afternoon - so although it wasnt ideal that it was broken, they fixed the problem very promptly which was great.  
The hotel has a roof top pool, its small but the terrace is a nice area, sun beds, tables and the pool was a very welcome relief from the heat of the city. We stayed room only so no breakfast, but there is a very nice small local coffee shop/cafe next door which is great for morning coffees and just along from the cafe is a great evening restaurant where you can sit outside - Lovely mediterranean food.  The hotel is approx 20/25 min. walk from Placa de Catalunya walking slowly (going via the metro station Diagonal) or - we got the 10 journeys metro pass then its just a couple of stops to anywhere on Ramblas if thats where you are headed. 10 journeys pass was great and lasted us for almost all our stay.
The staff at the hotel were helpful and polite.
Our room faced the street so there was street noise - including emptying of city bins at night and hosing the streets - all has to be done but it was a bit noisey but didnt disturb too much and all part of city life - 
One thing about the hotel which other reviewers have mentioned - The sound proof rooms - theyre not sound proof at all - and really the hotel would do well not to advertise specifically that they are sound proof - we could hear all our neighbours, the bathroom up stairs - all the usual hotel sounds so really - not sound proofed - but again, didnt disturb - would just be better if they didnt advertise it as such - Overall a good hotel option, good location if you dont want to be smack in the middle and on top of Ramblas.",4,2009,07,26
59,Perfect Location and Value for an Intro Visit to Barcelona!,"I stayed at Hotel Astoria with my partner for a week. When we arrived, we did have to wait a couple of hours for our room to be ready since we requested a Queen (and check in doesn't officially begin till 3PM), but the front desk staff was personable and friendly, and we walked around the district (seemed mainly for business) while we waited.

I do want to say that even though this hotel is situated in the business district of L'Eixample, you are just only a few blocks from the Diagonal metro stop (L3 and L5 lines), which you can take just two stops to Las Ramblas (a major tourist attraction in Barcelona), Park Guell (a beautiful wide open park adorned with man-made caves and fascsinating sculptures), La Sagrada Familia, and many more! It was such an ideal central location for us to have since this was our first visit to the city and we wanted to see a little bit of everything. We had no problem getting around and this was key. 

We opted out of the hotel's daily breakfast and decided to explore the area each morning for a new place to grab a bite before we went exploring. This was probably one of our favorite things to do while we were there since there was a good number of cheap/affordable restaurants and mini tapas bars to choose from. I recommend BoPan for a cheap (but yummy) breakfast/lunch.

Our room was kept impeccably clean. And there was an AC, which was great since it was VERY hot while we were there. There was also a mini pool available but we didn't use it. It's barely waist deep. And a fitness room with three bikes. We didn't take a laptop with us, but apparently wireless connections were available in each room. Still, I found that going down to the computer room to use the public computer sufficed since I was on vacation after all. Their ammenities weren't their strongest point, but since we went to Barcelona to explore and learn the lay of the land, hanging out in the hotel wasn't very high on our priority.

All in all, the staff was very friendly, helpful, and accommodating. The location was PERFECT. We booked this hotel through 1 800 Hotels and got a good rate for the 6 nights we were there; I think it was great value for the experience we had and would DEFINITELY stay there again!",4,2009,07,15
59,"Tidy, clean and good value","We booked this hotel towards the end of May through the hotel's own website as this offered the best prices/deals at the time. They are pretty responsive on the email as we had asked for a room with a balcony, which we later found out didn't apply to the type of room we had booked.
When we checked in we were offered breakfast for 6 Euros per person per day, as opposed to the 13 Euros we were quoted on the website, it was a special offer but we decided not to go for it as we wanted to check out some of the local patisseries. We booked a superior room which we found out meant we had two floors with a spiral staircase, a TV upstairs and downstairs, mini-bar upstairs, bed downstairs and a sort of enclosed terrace/sun room off the downstairs.
Cleanliness was good, wasn't particularly looking for dirt but certainly didn't notice any. Rooms were services daily, clean sheets, towels, etc...
The only negative thing I would say is that we had one of the rooms that wasn't included in a recent renovation, which meant the air conditioning units were pretty old, i.e.: noisy. We had the air con on throughout the first night and couldn't get any decent shut-eye. So the second night we took the risk of being too warm and switched off the air con through the night which worked out fine.
One other thing is the pool, we didn't generally use the roof area (sunbathing etc...) as we were there for sightseeing but we did notice the pool was really small - I'd say it would be crowded with 2 people in it.
Decor was good, paintings weren't to my taste but I wasn't fussed.
We would go here again, but next time would like to try something different and perhaps a bit closer to the port.",4,2009,07,13
59,"Hotel was fine, but not great.","We just returned from our trip to Spain and had a great time. The Hotel Astoria is fine but not great. The cosmetic upgrades are very nice and the rooms and bathrooms are very attractive and modern BUT, the hotel needs to upgrade the mechanics of the place. The ceiling leaked in the kids room so they had to change rooms, when our people above our room took a shower it leaked into a tin tray on our ceiling so we could hear the drip, drip, drip. The showers blast water all over the floors because of a lack of a full curtain or glass door.No such thing as a facecloth. The first floor rooms were not at nice at the 7th floor rooms.. when we had to switch because of thel eak in the kids room we got to see the differnece. The front desk was spotty. We asked one gentleman about boat tours on the harbor and he looked at us like we were crazy. We gave him the name of a boat we had seen and he looked it up on the internet and then said here is their number. later we found 2 coupons in the book the front desk hands out with boat tour discounts. Very unhelpful. But, when our kids room leaked the front desk found 2 new rooms so we could move too. None of the rooms had great views but we didn't care.The SMALL pool is a welcome splash after a long day. We thought bfast was great and they offered a half price discount.  Also, try the Troubador restaurant around the corner from the hotel. great service and food.",3,2009,07,09
59,Perfect hotel for a break to Barcelona,"Helpful staff, clean, modern and new room. So close to la ramblas, central to everything. lovely break xxx",4,2009,07,01
59,The Hotel Worked,"We had a room that looked over the kitchen.  While the view was not great, the room was quiet.  I thought the breakfasts were extremely overpriced.  The hotel has a good location.",3,2009,06,30
59,"Good hotel, good staff, good location","Good hotel with reasonably good location.  5 minute walk from the Diagnol metro station and the same to Placia de Gracia, so you can be in the thick of it right away, however if you are wanting to be near the beach it is a long walk!  although metro does take you there and a pass is 1.35euro a journey (or for good value 7E for 10 trips over any number of days).  When checked in the man broke the card machine so when I put in my credit card pin number for all to see...not great to happen on arrival, but realise it was an error.  Got given very small room - 329 that looked out on to a vent (although read about these rooms, didnt think they would bother me) however they do, there is no daylight and you cannot see the weather.  Basically it is like a room without a window, so very confusing when alarm goes off to wake you up as the room is pitch black despite it being morning.  On 2nd night asked to change, and they said they would move us in morning.  Which they did.  Were moved to room looking on to street - 225, much better although had to sacrafice our double for 2 singles but it was a good price to pay for daylight!  Also reception offered to print out our boarding pass on their printer when we asked where nearest internet cafe was, so this was helpful.  We stayed for 5 nights and had a great time here, didnt use the pool or restaurant/bar, but as a base was great, and for £55 a night, its equally as good/better than a same priced travelodge on a motorway in this country!

Tips:

We did see pickpockets so be careful!
Walk along the seafront the beaches a bit along are nicer (and quieter) than first one
For an amazing view of whole city (free cost) go to Parc Guell, we went for picnic at night and at the very peak the view is amazing, far more spectacular than at top of Sagrada de Famillia.
Do not get taxi from station to this hotel - stupidly we didnt take an address so got train from airport 3Euro and then at station hopped in a taxi despite it saying 4Euro on the meter he charged us 15Euro and it was literally a 2 min journey, and had we have known we could actually have got a tube or taken a ten min walk.

Overall we had a great time and would recommend this hotel, its clean, simple and a good base.  if you are after luxury then this is not for you.",4,2009,06,25
59,Good hotel in good location,"The lobby of the hotel is grander than the rooms, but the rooms are fine. They are old fashioned but clean and quaint. The bathrooms are nice. We got 2 rooms on different floors because we needed larger rooms (triple rooms). 

The view was nice from both rooms, it was very quiet if you worked out how to shut the shutters properly (not if you didn't).

The staff were helpful and gave us free tickets to the Egyptian Museum as the owner of the hotel owns this nice private museum.

Barcelona is a very chic place and the location felt very secure.

The pool was very small but the kids loved it as they were the only ones who used it during the days we were there.",4,2009,06,23
59,Not a great hotel good location,"Stayed at the Astoria hotel 22nd - 25th May 2009. The hotel has a nice foyer and booking in was easy. We had requested a room with a view but were given a room that looked out into a vent shaft and had to keep curtains closed as other rooms looked directly into room. We requested a move but were told no other rooms available. The safe in the room did not work and we used a safe deposit box in the reception (free of charge).  Also had to request 2 extra blankets as the room was freezing and the air con had a mind of its own.On returning to our room at 1.00am after a nice meal in town the swipe card into our room would not open the door, I went down to reception to have door fixed and the night porter threw my card  back at me and told it was damaged!!! He gave me another card which I tried and it did not work and then another which did not work, each time I had to go down to reception on the fourth journey the night porter came up with me and he could not get access so back down to reception to get the duty manager and he could not open it either . We then had to go back to reception a seventh time and were offered free coffee it was now 2.45am. An engineer was called and evently got the door opened at 3.30am, we were not amused when the hotel staff did not even apologise.  Overall a great city but my advise is stay clear of this hotel.",3,2009,06,10
59,"first rate choice - modern, quiet, good location","Small room, no view, but clean, quiet, and modern.  Good-sized bath, loungew, sliding wood drawers for clothing, flat-screen TV, about 5 or 6 blocks to a mrtro, ample and well-appointed lobby, good neighborhood - you can walk to many fine restaurants, several cafes next door serve breakfast at a fraction of the hotel cost.",5,2009,05,06
59,"Lovely hotel, friendly staff, bad room","This hotel is in an excellent location, close to the metro and major attractions as well as great bars, restaurants and shopping areas.  It is a lovely hotel and the staff are very friendly and helpful.  We were given discounts on the tourist attractions and asked if we wanted tickets to a match at the NouCamp.  The breakfast is really good, great selection of hot and cold food.  The only problem we had was the room itself.  It was a bit on the small side but it could have been overlooked if we had any sort of a view or natural sunlight!  We had a view of an interior shaft, a grey wall down which no natural light filtered meaning we didn't even know if it was raining or not.  The other problem was that on the website it states that the rooms are soundproofed, let's just say this is definately not true for the room we got!  I have no idea if this was the same for all the rooms but I suspect it is just the ones on our side of the hotel.  All round a pretty good hotel, just make sure you get a decent room.",4,2009,05,02
59,Very nice hotel near La Rambla and away from the noise,"Hotel Astoria was a great find and a great deal.  It is a couple of blocks away from the nearest metro stop, but easy to get to.  The friend that I was traveling with and I like to walk, so it was the perfect location.  We started each day with the 10 minute walk to the top of La Rambla, and made our way down the main street.  Another main street, Diagnol, was about two blocks east, so if you wanted to catch a bus it was easy.  The hotel is in a very nice, modern part of town.  It is close to the sites, and most are easily accessible by metro (though you may have to transfer), but it is far enough away from the main streets that it was very quiet at night.  It was too cold to use the pool when we were there, but it looked very nice and I would have gone in had it been a bit warmer.  The front desk staff was nice and helpful, and they had a safe with individual boxes for personal belongings.

The rooms were very clean, crisp, and modern.  The beds were very comfortable, we had good water pressure, and there was a television in the room.  The hotel had a computer with internet for guest use, but it was slow.  

Overall, Hotel Astoria was a great deal.  I didn't expect it to be nearly as nice as it was for the amount we paid.  If I return to Barcelona I will definitely stay there again, and I would recommend it to anyone.  I would say that it equivalent to at least a 4 star hotel in the United States, and I thought it was nicer than the average hotel chain.",5,2009,04,13
59,"Excellent Hotel, Excellent Location","My Husband I and I have just returned from a four night stay at the Astoria for our honeymoon in March.

Our room and the public areas were pristine. Very nice marble bathrooms and floors ect. The staff were friendly and efficent -nothing was too much trouble and the decor was fresh and tasteful.

There were no tea or coffee fascilities in the room and if I was going to be fussy I'd say that the room was smallish. However,  these things didn't bother us but I suppose they may concern other travellers.

We didn't have breakfast in the hotel because, as other reviews have pointed out, there are plenty of lovely cafes nearby to have breakfast in in the mornings.

The best bit about this hotel is the location. Absolutley perfect. About 10 - 15 mins walk from the Ramblas or the metro station is only a couple of minutes walk away.

There ia a wealth wonderful shops, restraunts and tapas bars all within easy strolling distance of the hotel.

I would advise anyone visiting Barcelona not to get too tied up in and around the Ramblas areas and to visit other districts such as Gracia which is just North of the Astoria Hotel.

All in all, we would definately stay at the Astoria again.",5,2009,04,03
59,Beautiful art decor hotel in quiet area of the city,"We stayed at the Astoria hotel in Barcelona  for  a 4 day trip, having booked a package trip through lastminute.com and following  the recommendations from fellow tripadvisor.com travellers.  Here are our thoughts:

Location
Whilst the hotel location is admittedly a bit further out (c.15/20 mins walk to La Ramblas depending how quick you walk) than we would have preferred, it is close to the metro Diagonal in the Exiample district which meant we had easy access to the centre and main attractions via the metro.  We also felt the location was a relief in a way, as it was much quieter and calmer, sort of a retreat after a day’s sightseeing in the city. 

Breakfast
We were staying on a bed only tariff so did not experience the breakfast (11 euro’s), instead choosing to  buy fresh pastries etc on our way into the city centre.  It seems quite the norm to charge an extortionate rate for breakfast now so we are used to buying our own breakfast at small patisseries on our way into the city. 

The Room
The room was a decent size, with good air conditioning  and the shower/bathroom was perfectly adequate.  I hade noted from previous reviews guests had pointed out the problem of the elevator shaft so when I emailed them to confirm they had our booking I did mention this, and they were very obliging in giving us an outside room so thanks for the previous advice! I’d also recommend this practice of emailing the hotel in advance to confirm booking  as sometimes they may give you a free upgrade if the house is not full. 

The hotel itself was quite attractive, done in an art deco style with a lovely staircase and funky wall décor.  The main reception area is certainly done out beautifully. I think the hotel is a very good 3 star hotel, with excellent service from the front of house.  

Advice
One point I would is  that we had an attempted  mugging  at another metro station, we were accosted by a group of boys with a map, trying to confuse us by asking us questions in Spanish. They surrounded us and the boy tried to get my camera out of my bag but I already knew what they were doing. But be so careful.  My advice would be to try to look as least “touristy” as possible, try to blend in and keep camera’s hidden.",3,2009,02,18
59,Brilliant Hotel,"Absolutely loved everything about this hotel, we had no complaints whatsoever, staff very friendly and helpful, room spacious and clean, location was perfect just out of the main hustle and bustle so no noise but within easy reach of everything either by foot or metro, Barcelona was just perfect we cant wait to go again. Would definately go back to the Astoria and will recommend it to everyone.",5,2008,12,09
59,Expensive if you want 'the works',"Booked directly with the Hotel group website as other sites didn't give me the flexibility of choosing rooms and 'extras'. It was my wife's 50th birthday and other sites didn't let me select a room with a balcony. I booked direct then phoned the hotel directly and upgraded to a suite with a balcony and negotiated a 20% discount, something you can't do when booking over the web.

Pleased we got a balcony as soom rooms didn't even have windows but you wouldn't know that until you booked in.

Hotel is clean but in my opinion, the bedrooms are abit dated. That said, you can't fault it's location, far enough out so as to not charge premium prices but well within walking distance of the centre and well serviced by metro stops.

The only downside was that the lifts were out of action for the last 2 days and being on the 7th floor made the trip back to the room after a night out abit of a bind and made moving our cases downstairs when checking out difficult.

When I go again, I'll book into the Granados 83 (same Hotel chain). This is just round the corner but in terms of service, 'chic' and overall ambience for the additional money, the 4* Granados will win me over every time (stayed there in 2006).",3,2008,10,28
59,Nn nonsense clean hotel,"We stayed at Astoria for 6 nights in July 08. Its central location is the best thing about this hotel. It is just a block away from the local Metro station (Diagonal) and just minutes away from the top end of La Rambla and Pg de Gracia. Lots of great restaurants and easy access to most attractions. The hotel is very clean and the rooms are nice. The staff are nice too.

A few important notes: 

When making a booking, it is best to go for a superior room option. We were first given a room looking into the air shaft and had no natural daylight. We asked for another room and got one with a street view for 20 euros extra per night... 

If you want to chose this hotel for the swimming pool, beware. It is tiny! It is more like a tub than a pool but the roof terrace is a nice spot to enjoy the  sun after a long day of sight seeing but there are only 6 sun loungers so space is at premium.

The breakfast seemed expensive at 13 euros each (though we were offered 2 breakfasts for 13 euros if you commit to have breakfast there for the whole stay). There are several small cafes just outside the hotel where 10 euros buy a nice breakfast for 2. 

Overall, i would recommend this hotel for its locations and clean rooms.",4,2008,07,21
59,Solid Hotel in Great Location,"This hotel was exactly what I expected: clean, adequate, centrally located with helpful staff.  I was looking for a hotel under $200 per night that would allow us to reach most destinations on foot, by subway or taxi and that had restaurants around the corner.  The rooms at Astoria are small but clean.  The showers had amazing water pressure and super hot water.  We stayed in interior rooms which were pretty quiet and super dark - which is great when you are out late and want to catch some sleep.  The second floor rooms have been recently updated and are very nice.  The third and fourth floors are not as updated but I had no complaints.  The staff was helpful with requests for things like extra pillows, taxis to the airport and small things but I wouldn't look to them to offer true concierge services.  It is located on Carrier de Paris near Diagnol and we were able to walk to many attractions and it is also a good area for a jog or a bike ride.  There's a great little cafe (Bar Paris) a block away that serves the most amazing bikinis.  You must eat one of these sandwiches!  I would definitely stay in this hotel again.",4,2008,06,28
59,A decent hotel,We stayed here for 2 nights and found the staff to be friendly and helpful. We were given a recommendation for an excellent restaurant just off Carrer de Paris by the front of house manger. The rooms were clean but quite cramped. We also found that the location was a long way out of town so be prepared for a bit of a walk to get to the centre. However the surrounding area felt a lot safer than Las Rambles area so it has its advantages. The only other problem were the thin walls – unfortunately we had to listen to a very boring conversation on the English property market from the room next door!,4,2008,05,28
59,"Good value, but some way from the centre","This hotel is good value; I paid EUR 75 per night (breakfast extra). 

My room faced the back and was very quiet. The view wasn't great, but I have had bad experiences with traffic noise in road facing rooms before in Barcelona.

The room was on the small side but the decor was modern and looked recent. Good bed and no problems with the aircon/heating or shower/bathroom. Everything clean & tidy.

The breakfast buffet was perfectly acceptable; a reasonable selection of fruit, cold meats/cheese and bread etc. 

They don't serve food in the evenings, but the hotel is located in an area with a fair number of restaurants within easy walking distance.

The hotel has free WiFi but I had problems connecting from my bedroom on the fifth floor. It worked fine from the lobby tho'.

The hotel is at least 30 minutes walk to the real sights of downtown Barcelona. However, it cost me less that five euros to take a taxi from the city centre back to the hotel. The fare to the airport was just under EUR 15.

The only English speaking TV channel is the ubiquitous CNN ...

This is a perfectly acceptable hotel with good value room rates. Even if you build in the ten euro taxi fares to get downtown & back it is still an option if you are in Barcelona to see the sights.",4,2008,02,03
59,Highly recommended it to anyone visitng Barcelona!,"Initially when we arrived, we were given a small room, but upon our request the staff moved us to a much larger, clean and spacious room facing the street (with funky, black and white tiles).  The place was a wonderful deal for the money, conveniently located near the Metro, and away from all the noise and pickpocketers found in the Las Ramblas area (but not too far - we had a fabulous Saturday walk from the hotel to Las Ramblas and enjoyed every minute).  And the staff was friendly and helpful.  I have recommended this hotel warmly to anyone who tells me they are going to be visitng Barcelona.",5,2008,01,06
59,Choose somewhere else,"I stayed here with three colleagues and none of us liked our rooms or this hotel which we most certainly will not use again.
- The rooms were small
- Two of us could smell tobacco in the rooms
- We all flooded out the bathroom when we showered

To cap things off, when we checked out my handbag was stolen (passport, keys, purse etc). I was at the front desk and my bag was just behind me. There was about 5 steps between me and the doorway where there was a doorman and no one around other than two guests checking out and staff. My colleagues had just stepped out the front door so there were few ""suspects"" but I'd guess it was staff.
Even if it wasn't - the staff offered no assistance in helping me find it - and it had only been stolen seconds before I noticed -  and just looked at me like a dumb tourist and just had me sign my credit card payment that I was in the middle of doing. 

There are many other, better hotels in Barcelona to go to than this one",1,2007,12,01
59,Thanks to your reviews,The hotel was in a great location at an excellent price. The room was spacious and clean. We even had a terrace with a nice view of the city. The staff was friendly and helpful. Would definetly stay again and recommend to friends.,4,2007,11,27
59,Great value,"We stayed here in January and were very happy with the hotel.

On arrival we were greeted by helpful and polite reception staff.  We had a room on the top floor that also had a small pool and terrace area giving great views over the city.  The room we had was excellent as along with a large bed we also has a galleried area with a sofa, fridge and television.

Considering what you pay this hotel offers great value for money.  The location is good and you can walk to Las Ramblas area within 30 minutes or grab the Metro close by.",5,2007,11,20
59,great service no English TV,"stayed here for a week and staff were friendly, rooms very clean, bar staff chatty. Main gripe was no English TV and no English newspapers but then we are in Spain. Lots of restaurants nearby. Need the metro to get into the centre.",4,2007,11,13
59,Lovely Hotel Would Stay Here Again,"Before visiting this hotel i checked this website for reviews and overall i was expecting a below average hotel. I couldnt have been more wrong!

The outside of the hotel is lovely it looks very posh. The lobby is stunning!!!! I was very suprised. They also give you a map of Barcelona and some tourist information. After we checked in the guy on reception carried our cases and showed us to our room which i think was a lovely touch.

The room itself was lovely a very good size with plenty of storrage space. The bathroom is lovely all marble with complementary toiletries. We were on the first floor and the room just looked onto the back of the hotel not a very good view but that doesnt bother us as being in such a beautiful city as Barcelona we dont spend alot of time in the room and we certainely dont spend the time we do have in the room gazing out of the window. There is also a minibar in the room and its very cheap so make full use of it ! Theres air -con and heating in the room which comes in handy. The plazma telly in the room is good plenty of channels to keep you amused while your getting ready to go out. Also please note that when your checking in ask for the safe key as the safe is free of charge they wont mention it to you so you need to ask.

Breakfast was included in our price which i am glad about as the breakfast was lovely. It is between 8 and half 10 at weekends. It was a buffet lots of bread, cakes, meat, cheese, fruit etc. It was all very nice and filled us up. Its a lovely dinning room very plush.

The only wee grumble i have is that the hotel is about a 25 minute walk to La Rambla and Pl. de Catalunya  but we tended just to jump on the tourist buses which stop just along from the hotel or get a taxi to where ever we wanted to go. The metro stop diagnal is only about a 5 minute walk from the hotel so if you cant be bothered doing a long walk everyday there is plenty of transport available to you. It didnt put me off but because i would 100% stay here again. 

Overall i had a wonderfull stay here the hotel is absoloutly stunning i cant believe its only a 3star it should be a 4 star. There is also a rooftop swimming pool we didnt have enough time to use it but it looked good. The staff are all very helpfull and bend over backwards to help you. I would defo stay here again and would reccomend this to anyone who is considering going to to Barcelona.",5,2007,09,30
59,Nice lobby but not good rooms!,"Not a bad location, Metro about 10 mins walk away. (Buy 10 journey ticket for best value). Walk to Las Ramblas 30 mins. Nice exterior and lobby, with helpful, pleasant staff. We stayed in room 121. If YOU are given room 121 simply give the keys back and ask for another room! It was the worst hotel room ive ever stayed in. It was very small, old fashioned and nothing like the pictures on this site. The aircon didnt work properly and wasnt particularly clean. We only stayed 1 night but should have been staying 3. I cannot, however, comment on other rooms within the hotel. Barcelona itself is a lovely place though.
",2,2007,09,10
59,Basic Betty,"Property is clean and comfortable. Shower and bathtubs are old fashioned and cramped but lost of hot water available.  A long walk to the old city. NO ENGLISH NEWSPAPER. Front desk help a bit lacking. Overall good value for the money but not a gem.
",3,2007,06,10
59,Very nice Hotel & Location,"The hotel is in a excellent location especially if you like to walk.
It is a block from the Diagonal, 3 to 4 from Los Ramblas Cataluna which runs into Placa Cataluna and the start of Las Ramblas which will take you all the way to Port Vell and the Christopher Columbus statue. A block further is the Gracia. A great shopping street.  Also
there are two Gaudi works close on the Gracia. The breakfast buffet is average, but well worth visiting each morning. Additionally there are a great many bars and restaurants just outside the door in all price ranges. Finally there is a Taxi stand/stop across the street, very nice. The Hotel has been renovated recently and is in excellent shape. The bathrooms are typically europen for size but well done.  The shower/tub water pressure was outstanding and the towels first rate. Excellent service from housekeeping as well as the front desk. Will definitly stay there again.",4,2007,05,01
59,Great Hotel,"We stayed at the Astoria for 8 nights in October, while we visited with our daughter who was in Barcelona doing her ""semester abroad"".  Although it isn't as close to the center of things as we might have wanted, the hotel itself was excellent.  From reading other reviews, we asked for an outside room (facing the street).  Our room was light, bright, spacious, and very clean.  The staff were extremely helpful whenever we had any questions or needs.  There is a small pool on the top floor and also a exercise room (very small), but clean and useful.  The neighborhood surrounding the hotel is safe and there are little places to have coffee & delicious tapas or bakery items close by.  We didn't actually eat in the hotel, but did have a drink or two there.  The sitting areas in the lobby are very comfortable and my husband was able to do work there on his laptop.  Be sure to bring good walking shoes to walk down to the Ramblas and to the older scenic parts of the city ,as it is about a 25-30 minute hike.  There are plenty of cabs and a fabulous metro system that will take you most places.
",4,2007,02,05
59,Good 3* Hotel,"We stayed 4 nights at the Astoria in Feb 06 and found it to be a good quality hotel at a good price. Perhaps it was showing it's age a little but everything was OK. We did have a problem with our room on arrival with a leak in the bathroom above but we were soon transferred to another room without any problems. 
The Astoria is a little away from the centre of Barcelona but public transport and one end of La Rambla is only a short walk. The public transport is pretty good in Barcelona and you can reach a lot of the attractions by the underground or bus. There are enough restaurants in the immediate area and we even found one around the corner that you could eat in at normal hours for dinner.
We chose not to have breakfast in the hotel and there was a very nice pastry / coffee shop nearby where you could have breakfast very cheaply. The language was a bit of a challenge but with lots of finger pointing and other sign language you get what you want.
Language at the hotel was not a problem, the only draw back was the lack of atmosphere is the hotel, while there was a bar it was hard to get a drink or someones attention to serve you.
The staff were OK but not necessarily friendly but that seemed pretty typical of the Spanish.
Anyway Barcelona is a great tourist place to visit and we would love to visit again some day.
",4,2006,11,19
59,"Nice hotel, decent location","The Astoria Hotel is a very good 3 star hotel in a nice part of Barcelona.
My fiancée and I booked fairly late so checked at the hotels available on Trip Advisor and decided to go with the Astoria.

The entrance is very nice and we were greeted by a friendly manager. Having read the reviews on here we had asked for a room on the higher floors with an outside view (as opposed to some windows that apparently open into an airshaft). Unfortunately they had none available until the following day but we were told that we were more than welcome to move after our first night.

The room we were put in was nice enough but there was some mould on the ceiling above the shower (no extractor fan in the bathroom), and as we discovered the following morning, it was right above the kitchen so was quite noisy. Not massive problems but we decided we would ask to see the other room the following morning, which was higher, quieter and nicer, so we simply moved our stuff across.

So, good hotel, and the location is pretty decent as well. It is about a 20-25 minute walk from Plaça de Catalunya and the top of La Rambla. However, the walk is a pleasant one, either along Rambla de Catalunya with its cafes, or Passeig de Gracia (one of the main shopping streets). We walked most places but there is a metro stop near by (Barcelona metro was very good- cheap, clean, air conditioned etc.).

Breakfast at The Astoria was €12 which we had a couple of days. The choice was great - cereal, fruit, ham, cheese, yoghurt, croissants, pastries and even chocolate brownies, all washed down with orange juice, tea and coffee. If you only want a light bite though, you may be better off with a pastry from one of the coffee shops nearby.

Overall, good hotel and good location and we would recommend this hotel to people traveling to Barcelona.

59,Wonderful stay...,"My partner and I have just returned from a mid week city break in Barcelona and i just felt that i should comment on the great accomodation we had whilst there...We arrived from the airport quite late in the evening and were greeted by friendly staff who wasted no time in checking us in and whisking our bags up to the room so we could get out into the city asap.The rooms were spacious by european standards with comfy beds and i have to say that some of the comments made by my american friends about the rooms being small are probably true in comparison to the many hotels i have stayed in during my visits to the US.However this hotel exudes an air of a much higher class hotel than the 3stars it declares.Maid service was outstanding with fluffy towels left every morning and complimentary toiletries,the breakfast choice was also very good with a range to suit most pallettes and served at a reasonable time 7am-11am so even late risers can get a hearty meal before getting into the sightseeing swing of things.Never used the restaurant in the evening so cannot comment on this but the lounge area is a perfect area to chill with an espresso after a hard days walking and the roof patio area with its sun loungers and small pool is great for relaxing also.Overall loved the hotel and will not hesitate to book straight away when we return to barcelona which we will as we loved it!! Also as a small note the hotel is only 2blocks from Gaudis apartment La Pedera and the Bus touristique buses which criss cross the city and are an absolute must for any visiting the city without a car is only a short 5/10min walk away.Place de Catalunya is about a 20minute walk but with so many street cafes to stop at and enjoy the atmosphere it doesnt really matter..Happy travelling!!!

59,good value hotel,"we went to barcelona for 5 nights and stayed at the hotel astoria for all of our stay.  the hotel was fine it was clean and the maid service was excellent.  I had requested a room facing the street and got one no problem....I wish though I had requested one on a higher floor, and asked for a balcony also.  but overall the room was big anough, very clean and comfortable.  The bathroom was excellent and the shower over the bath fantastic.....very powerfull!

you only got one english speaking channel on TV which was CNN...and noramally this we wouldn't even have the tv on but barcelona was so hot when we visited we usually went out early in the morning and later at night and spent a few hours in our room out of the mid day sun!!

There is a lovelly terrrace on the roof which i think is unusuall especially for a 3star hotel.  the swimming pool is more like a large jacuzzi though!

The only problem I had was the echo throughout the hotel as everywhere was tiled/marble flooring and you can hear people walking about your corridor....unfortunatlly for us a group of about 30 rather noisy italian school boys were staying at the same time as us and we had to listen to their chatter till exhaustion finally took over them and they nodded off!

also this area would have been fine if it had not been so hot!! its a bit further away from ramblas than i expected and we walked to metro (10 mons) most nights and hopped on it......but it was like an inferno on the metro with sweat dripping off most peoples noses!!!  

Overall good value for money, but shop around I saved 150 euros just from checking different websites!  also it took ages for our bill to be sorted out and i was glad i had printed off my originall reservation as they trying to charge us full rate plus vat!!

59,"Good value, loved the location","Most of the reviews are dead on.  Great showers, towels.  We loved the location away from the riff-raff, but if you really like to be in the heart of the touristy areas it's not for you.  The one thing we had an isuue with was the staff at the front desk.  The service was fine, in fact we had some small problems with our room -- no big deal  -- that was attended to and fixed quickly.  But I wouldn't say they were the friendliest staff.  We came down to the front desk a few times to get information, even to check out and get a taxi and were'nt even acknowledged.  Not exactly attentive or warm & fuzzy.  That being said, we found this to be the case with a lot of the hotels in Spain.

59,Great little hotel,"Hotel Astoria is a great value 3 star hotel with nice touches like a small swimming pool on the roof terrace (good for kids) a small sauna/ exercise room. Rooms were a decent size with mini bar and extremely clean - make sure you get a room with external windows. Exec rooms are available with their own small terrace. Helpful staff too! My companion had stayed in a couple of 4 stars which can be hit and miss in Barcelona and he thought the Astoria was much better value for money. Situated in a nice residential area about 15 mins walk from las Ramblas or 5 euros in a cab, plenty of restaurants nearby. Would definitely use this hotel again.
",4,2006,06,09
59,Great hotel,"We have just returned from a short break at the Hotel Astoria and it certainly lived up to the Trip Advisor reviews that had prompted us to book. Good location in less touristy suburb, just off the Balmes. Cafes on each corner with great food and atmosphere. Smart city hotel. Clean, spacious room with minibar, tv, free safe. Gleaming bathroom with fluffy white towels - great value.
",4,2006,06,04
59,not bad for this hotel class,"I think, given that this hotel is ranked with only one ""star"" on this site (two stars elsewhere, i've seen), it's not bad.  Before reading on, note that we only stayed one night here and were out and about during the day, so this review is based on a short amount of time spent in the hotel.

This hotel is located fairly deep in the Eixample area, which translated into more walking to get to the Barri Gotic or other places.  For us, this wasn't a problem, since we particularly enjoyed walking around this less-touristy part of Barcelona.  

The staff were overall helpful and spoke a decent amount English.  We were politely received upon our arrival at the hotel, which has a lovely marble lobby and a pretty winding staircase.  

Unfortunately, we didn't get the street-facing room we had requested, and instead had a room with a view of the unattractive ventilation shaft.  The room, which wasn't spacious to begin with, was partitioned oddly with a dresser-TV-desk-clothes cabinet combo, making the room feel even smaller.  It was definitely showing signs of wear, as evidenced by the chipping bathroom mirror, cracking bathroom tiles, and sagging sofa.  I found it difficult to sleep because the noise of people walking by the room and talking, and also because of the hard, sofa cushion-like pillow (which I tossed away sometime in the middle of the night!).  We didn't have breakfast at the hotel the next morning, so unfortunately, we can't comment on that aspect.

During our stay there, it seemed like they were doing some construction in the hallways of the lower floors; hopefully some of the planned renovations involves the rooms too.

59,"Passed the 3Cs Test - Convenient, Clean, Caring","A beautiful little hotel very conveniently located. 

Furniture was modern and chic; room and in fact the whole hotel was spotless. Hotel staff had some English and worked hard to be helpful. We didn't eat at the restaurant in the hotel and so cannot comment on the food although the dining room and bar were very inviting. There was some renovation in progress on our floor when we checked in but the workers were very considerate; noise/dust were no problem. There was an erotic merchandise shop close by but we didn't feel uncomfortable at all when walking in the area, day or night - no unsavory characters or activities that we could discern. We'd recommend this hotel to anyone.

59,Astoria Hotel - Good choice for stay in Barcelona!,"My husband and I stayed at the Astoria Hotel for 4 nights. We are accustomed to nice hotels in the US and Europe and really did not have any complaints. I think a key to a good stay is requesting a room on the upper floors with views facing the street. The roof top pool was an added bonus. Extremly safe residential neighborhood. Close to a few Gaudy attractions and a 5 minute walk to the Metro. Under 10 minute walk thru super safe area to Las Ramblas. Metro travel is very easy - great to getting down to the Gothic Quarter and the Harbor. Very helpful, friendly staff as well. Clean room.
",4,2006,05,22
59,No Complaints!,"Although the room was small, it was extremely clean and well maintained, which suited our needs perfectly. The hotel was situated in a quiet, somewhat residential area, though close to early morning and late evening cafes for a snack at whatever time you fancied. (Try the patata bravas at Cafe de Paris - the best we had!) Though the staff spoke some English, they were not all that helpful or friendly, but nothing particularly unpleasant either.  The location was slightly north of where the 'action' on La Rambla is, but I personally prefer that as it is less touristy and quieter. However, the hotel is still only a 5 minute walk to the metro or a 15 minute walk to La Rambla.  The sex shop is nothing to worry about as it looked closed most times we passed by and it's hardly even noticeable.  The area was completely safe and wonderfully maintained.

I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Barcelona - and more importantly, I would highly recommend Barcelona to anyone looking for a city in Spain to visit!

59,will go back to the astoria!,"Just came back last night from first trip to Barcelona and we loved the  Astoria.  Located in L'Eixample, a bit out of the touristy area, in a lovely residential neighborhood, but only a few blocks from the metro and 2 stops down to Placa de Catalunya and the top of the Ramblas.  Nice walk over to Metro,  close to Gaudi buildings on Passig de Gracia, just off Diagonal, great shopping, plus restuarants and cafes nearby- we ended up loving the location.

Place is spotless, staff very helpful, spoke English, breakfast buffet was included in our rate and was very good.  Beds comfortable, GREAT shower and towels...

Would definitely stay there again!

And Barcelona was super - even in November, cannot wait to come back in warmer weather.  Perfect location of mountains and beach, with elegant city, great art and architecture, great food, loved the chocolate shops, friendly people-

59,Great value,"We stayed at this hotel a year ago and had one of the double rooms with no view (overlooking lift shaft).  After reading reviews on this site, this time I asked for a double room overlooking the street and got one on the top (9th) floor which had brilliant views from the front and also the side windows.

The hotel now boasts a small swimming pool, and a roof-rop terrace with sunbeds and tables and parasols though we rarely saw anyone out there - but great views!!

Staff very friendly, rooms spotlessly clean, comfortable beds and a great location.  Ten minutes walk to Passeig de Gracia and the Gaudi Buildings.  Several little cafes nearby where you can have breakfast - we used the Jockey Club for breakfast and Bar Paris for our late-night coffees and brandies!!

Don't be put off by the sex shop 2 doors away - never saw any dodgy looking characters hanging around in the vicinity - think it is just like a Spanish Anne Summers!!

59,We'll be back,"Very pleasant stay - and all thanks to this community. We narrowed down to 2 hotels that seemed very similar, that is until we read the reviews on Tripadvisor. One was praised, one was slagged off - off to the Astoria we went.
Its a little way out in the Eixample district, about 20 min walk to the centre of the Ramblas, which can be good or bad depending on what you need. It suited us perfectly as we prefer to stay in a more quiet classy area and go into the more hectic areas when we want.Clean,nice classic decor and nice fluffy towels, good neighbourhood. Friendly, helpful reception staff.The pool is a glorified footbath but thats ok.Unless your rate includes breakfast, take a walk. Try El Trobador(turn left out of the hotel 50metres), or my favourite,Farga.(Walk up Enric Granados past El Trobador and turn right onto avenue Diagonal  - 200metres, number391.Excellent selection of all sorts of pastries for a 'pick your own' breakfast. Plenty of nice eateries around the area.Shop around for rates and check out directly with the hotel itself for special deals.Leave your car behind - those crazy buslanes- those crazy drivers, bumper car parking is a good spectator activity. Use public transport which is fine.Fell for Barcelona big time - what a lovely city. We'll be back, and we'll stay at the Astoria.

59,Great Value for Money Says This Finicky Traveler,"I stayed at the Astoria for 9 nights on a combined business/pleasure trip.  It was elegant and had numerous, helpful, and discrete staff.  While the first night I was given a noisy room where the elevator was on the other side of my headboard, I requested and received (the next day) another, much quieter room, for the rest of my stay and from then on, it was an ideal hotel experience.   

The room was modestly elegant and modern with fine air-conditioning, thick towels, and comfortable bed.  I was surprised and pleased at the value for money.

As for the location, I appreciated the quiet elegance of the Diagonal.  The Rambla got wearying and touristy after a while.  The Astoria is far from the sea, so if you're looking to beach it often, I wouldn't recommend this hotel.  

For everything else, however, I find the Astoria was perfect.  The breakfast had serano ham, other meats and cheeses, and a myriad of other early-morning foods.  The coffee was strong and smooth.  Since breakfast lasts until 11am, it can be a brunch-y experience, helpful to tide one over in late-lunching Spain.

Speaking of lunch, try the cod specialties and the crema Catalana at the Troubador, a fine restaurant just around the corner.  It is one of several Troubador locations.  This one is on a quiet pedestrian street with plenty of outdoor tables that pick up the delightful breezes.  The food is fresh and well prepared.

I am a rather finicky traveler and found the Astoria to be a terrific find.  As long as you avoid rooms near the elevator, you'll have a terrific stay.

59,very nice place to stay,"Barcelona- Hotel Astoria 

The Astoria Hotel (a *** Derby Hotel ) is located off avenue Diagonal in the Eixample district. Located in an ideal part of Barcelona and accessible to all the stores, transportation, restaurant and sightseeing, the interior of the hotel is decorated in the Art-deco mode with sculptures and furniture representative of that era. Our room was nicely decorated with black and white floor tile and included a nice sized bathroom. The buffet breakfast at 12€ is over-priced and you’d be better off seeking out the small cafés around the area. We used Bar Paris Cafeteria down the street, which was very popular with the locals. Note that parking is very expensive and since we didn’t need the car for our three day stay opting instead to use public transportation or walk, we parked at a garage recommended by the hotel (located very near by) and left it there at a cost of 20€ plus 7% tax/per day.
",4,2005,07,18
59,Excellent value for money,"Stayed for three nights.  The rooms and bathroom were very clean.  We did request a room that looked onto the street (to avoid lift shaft).  There was a free safe deposit box in the room and a mini bar.  The location of the hotel would not put us off staying there again.  We did get the occasional taxi as site seeing can be tiring but there is a bus stop directly outside the hotel and a taxi rank too.  The bars and restaurants close by are excellent and the area very safe.  We would definately recommend the hotel to anyone as it was extremely good value for money.
",4,2005,06,25
59,The Astoria - Well worth a visit!,"We stayed at the Astoria for a three night break in May.  The hotel was elegant and comfortable and we found the staff very helpful with any requests that we had.  We were pleased to have read earlier reviews that mentioned inside rooms that looked out onto a ventilation shaft, and made a point of asking for an outside room when we checked in.  This looked out onto the street but was quiet enough, apart from the night when Barcelona won the Spanish Championship!

The hotel is situated just inside the Diagonal and we found that La Sagrada Familia and La Rambla were within comfortable walking distance.  The red and blue route tourist buses also stop at Francesc Macia-Diagonal, which is little more than five minutes away.

Breakfasts are OK - cereals, cooked meats, fresh fruits and bread etc - no full English, but you don't really come to Barcelona for that, do you? - but avoid the scrambled egg!  We did not use the restaurant as there are plenty of eating places within easy reach.

Overall - well worth a visit.
",5,2005,06,04
59,Hotel fine but too far out,"Just left Barcelona after a week in the Astoria. The hotels fine but in reality its too far away from the hub of the city.

My advice to anyone thinking of going is to try to get a hotel around the Barri Gotic area or the Place de Catyluna - there you will be within walking distance to most things and wont have to walk best part of a mile every night from the nightlife.

Having said that, it is about 2 streets away from the diagonal which is a terrific place to shop.

Thanks to previous reviewers for giving us an insight into hotel

59,Lovely classic hotel,"We were with twelve people in this lovely old and small hotel near the town centre of Barcelona (12 november till 14 november 2004). What can I say about this 3 star hotel? The atmosphere and decorations are much and much better than the average 3 star hotel. The staff is very friendly and the breakfast is nice. Although I normally only visit 4 or 5 star hotels, I really really enjoyed this hotel. The hotel is situated in a pretty quiet street near the towncentre. It is very good located for all your trips in Barcelona. Don't mind that sex shop a few doors next to the hotel, you will hear or see nothing (untill you go inside of course!). If you want a late night drink just go to the corner of the street and there is a nice pub called ""Paris"". The price for the room and breakfast was very good en worth every euro! If I ever go back to Barcelona I will go back to this hotel for sure!!!!
",5,2005,02,01
59,Great choice,"We stayed here in September and it was great! The location is perfect for walking in a safe area. We were near the Gaudi homes and other sites. The service was very nice, the rooms were lovely, and I felt like the hotel was a bargain. Very classsy.
",5,2004,11,29
59,Very Nice Hotel,"We had to spend one night in Barcelons in July 2004 and as usual checked Trip Advisor for info.
This hotel has had mostly good reviews and they were right.
It is a very nice hotel in a very good location. One night is perhaps not long enough to give a proper review but in the time we were there the hotel certainly was well worth the 3 star status it has.
We booked online directly with the hotel and got a very good price (94 euros) and a very clean room with a nice clean bathroom.
The breakfast is an extra 11 euros and,while it is pretty good,you may find better value and choice in one of the many cafes etc. in the area.

We would certainly have no hesitation in choosing this hotel for future trips to what is a fantastic city.
",4,2004,07,25
59,Great place to stay,"Great place to stay in Barcelona.  Very friendly staff.  Rooms are clean, and the housekeepers do a nice job.  Nice location.  Make sure that you ask for a room with a window (not the airshaft).  Can be a bit noisy from streetnoise (as in just about anywhere in Barcelona), but if you are a light sleeper earplugs will do the trick.  I would definately stay here again.
",4,2004,06,01
59,Very nice,"The hotel exceeded my expectations of a 3-star hotel. It's location is close to Gaudi's Casa Mila and about 20 min walk from Placa Catalunya. 
It's very clean, well equipped and the service is good. Highly recommended",5,2004,04,20
59,Loved the location!,"Stayed here for 3 nights in January. Excellent location. Within walking distance of Las Ramblas - or there's a bus stop right outside the hotel!!! We were lucky, having read other reviews we requested one of the few double rooms which had a great view. Lots of beautiful authentic restaurants near and if you like designer shopping, you couldn't pick a better location.",5,2004,02,18

59,Hotel Astoria was Excellent.,"Stayed at the Hotel Astoria. The hotel was very nice and all the people very friendly and very accommodating. The only slightly negative item would be that our room was right next door to the cleaning closet and it got a little loud when they started cleaning in the morning. But, everything was very clean and the rooms were great. Barcelona was AWESOME, including the Costa Brava and the nearby mountains. I highly recommend all of it!",4,2003,08,12
59,"Very Mixed (and yes, Bizarre)","We were not very pleased with this hotel. We were given a relatively very expensive room (150 euro/night) that was small, cramped, and had no external window. Instead, the window opened onto a creepy airshaft with very little light or air. We were disappointed, to say the least, and asked to change rooms. The hotel staff were not gracious in handling our request, and it was only when we packed our bags and prepared to stay elsewhere that the staff promised us a room with an outside window the following night. (after refusing to refund our reservation deposit of one night's stay if we did leave). Admittedly, the room we had on the second night was bright and had a view, and the bathrooms were quite nice, although not worth the price charged. We were informed by the hotel staff that there are only 7 double rooms with outside windows in the entire hotel. The rest of the rooms face on the gloomy airshaft. Another disappointment with the Astoria is how difficult it was to get around Barcelona from the location. It took us quite a long time to reach downtown, and we wasted much of our day travelling to and from the hotel and nearby attractions. Overall, not worth it. One of the places down closer to the Cathedral would be a much better bet, and much less of a crunch on the pocket book.",2,2003,06,17
59,"Great location, peculiar service","Yes, this is a great location. Yes, the refurbished rooms have a stylish sense of wit. 
Service is bizarre.  We were travelling with children and discovered a startled bellboy lurking outside our kids' room at 2 a.m. When we enquired about his business there, he ran away! The car park is a garage in the next block, which is sometimes locked up at, say, 9 in the morning; one must go back to the hotel and wait for a bellboy to find a key in order to retrieve one's car or to park it. Our room was facing the street, but was quiet. Our kids room had a window onto a creepy airshaft. But if you are interested in the modernista Barcelona, the location is unbeatable. If you are driving, it is located just off the Diagonal, and so if convenient for making trips to nearby.

59,Surprising hotel. Because it should have 4*,"I usually go to Barcelona often, so there are already many hotels I have been to. My company took me to this hotel because the ones I usually go to were full or had very high rates. At first I thought that a 3* would be little, but then I saw some reviews and my perspective changed a little. When I arrived in Barcelona and the taxi dropped me off at the hotel, I liked it and was very surprised by the entrance. At the reception, the receptionist was very friendly, even seeing that I had a single room, he gave me a superior one so that I would be more comfortable given that they had availability.
Well, I would like to point out that I have been more comfortable in this hotel than in other 4-star hotels in Barcelona. I don't understand why it doesn't have a 4* to be honest.
The room is very spacious, views of the main street, king size bed. It is appreciated that there is a hall when you enter and you have another door to enter the room. What this achieves is that you do not hear the people in the hallway when they arrive or leave.
The bathroom is comfortable, the shower is good because it also produces a lot of water and a good shower is appreciated after a hard day of work.
The bed... what I liked the most. Wide and very soft. With 7 cushions so you can accommodate yourself to your liking. But the best....the texture. The softness and freshness of the bedding. The pillowcases are super super soft. Something that I love and that I have been very comfortable with.

So the summary is that it was very good and that next time I will ask to be booked again.",5,2024,05,16

59,A great weekend.,"Last weekend I had the opportunity to go to the Astoria Hotel in Barcelona, I went with my daughter to spend the weekend.

I am posting this review because my daughter says that our opinion is important and other families may take it into account.

The Astoria hotel is very well located, we were relatively close to everything.

You can go as a family, there is a piano in the reception that you can play, that made us feel at ease and very comfortable.

At Reception, everything was very good, on Saturday we arrived at dawn, after a concert and the staff was very willing and surprisingly friendly.

As for the room, sober, clean and the bathroom clean.

The next day, we got up late and decided to eat at the hotel bar, because we were surprised because the food was delicious!!! It seemed like we were in a restaurant specializing in haute cuisine, I think they were products of the day, variety and quality in one place, it is worth eating at the hotel. The bar staff, also very friendly and close.

In summary:
It is an elegant hotel, old like everything in Barcelona, but modern and updated with new times.

Great staff, close and respectful.

The rooms are large and spacious, with no surprises in the bed or bathroom.

The food, surprisingly good.

The services, very good.

We will return to Barcelona and this will be our reference hotel!!!!

Un hotel reformado, con unas habitaciones muy bonitas y una cáma muy cómoda. La ventana de nuestra habitación tenía persiana, algo que me hizo muy feliz ya que siempre suelo madrugar en los hoteles a causa de la luz que entra desde muy temprano. La ubicación estupenda también. Tiene una azotea con piscina y unas vistas a la ciudad maravillosa!",5,2023,01,30

59,UN HOTEL QUE SE PREOCUPA POR EL ARTE,"La limpieza, los servicios, la ubicación... todo perfecto. Pero que además un hotel se preocupe de tener una exposición con originales de un artista (en este caso de Opisso) hace que pensemos en volver.",5,2022,12,19
59,"Nuestra casa en Barcelona cada año, el hotel Astoria","Un hotel elegante, acogedor y, sobre todo, con un excelente personal, atento y profesional. Buen desayuno. Buena ubicación, en una zona tranquila, con restaurantes y tiendas. Muy cómodo para viajes de trabajo o de vacaciones.

Gracias por todo J&S ",5,2022,11,29
59,Muy buena estancia,"Hotel bien ubicado en el Eixample, cerca de Diagonal (metro y Avenida) no muy lejos de Paseo de Gracia y del centro.
De entrada, destaca por su elegante recepción y que contiene una exposición de Opisso.

El personal de recepción fue amable y resolvieron posibles dudas, además, esta cadena de hoteles te ofrece gratis el Museo Egipcio (museo que ya tuve la ocasión de visitar y que volví a visitar).

Respecto las habitaciones, son amplias, la cama era grande, comfortable; habia TV, muebles, un sofá, armario y mini bar. Además, habían folletos, papeles para tomar notas y como cortesia, una botella de agua de cristal.

Lo que viene siendo la cama, fue bastante comfortable y ancha y no noté ninguna incomodidad.
El baño, lo vi funcional y bien equipado, donde destaco la ducha, jabones y las toallas.

En general me gustó el hotel y para ser un 3***, perfectamente podría ser un 4****.

Cosas que mejorararía: 
-La ubicación de la TV no era la idonea para verla desde la cama ni desde el sofá.
-Algunos muebles estaban ""cascados""
-Si bien no es una calle muy ruidosa, no estaría de más que las ventanas aislasen mejor del ruido exterior.

En cualquier caso, recomiendo este hotel por su comodidad, ubicación y elegancia.",4,2022,11,27
59,Decepcionante,"El hotel está cerca del paseo de Gracia. Pero sinceramente si quieres hacer turismo no es la mejor opción ya que no queda cerca ni de las Ramblas, Sagrada familia, etc.

Las habitaciones pequeñas y con muchos ruidos a lo largo de la noche. La calefacción NO FUNCIONABA. Las camas  incómodas y las almohadas nada del otro mundo. 

Lo peor la gestión del paquete Gaudí. Este incluía entradas a la Pedrera. En la recepción nos indicaron que con nuestra entrada era visitable desde las 9:00 hasta las 22:00. ESTO ES MENTIRA. Y nos costó poder visitarla según lo previsto. 32 euros costaron las entradas.

Especial mención a la cutrez del desayuno. Pan mohino y reblandecido, embutido ultraprocesado de la peor calidad, fruta de aspecto oxidado... todo fatal.

Sin duda ni volveremos ni lo recomendaremos.",1,2022,11,27
59,EXCELENTE HOTEL,"Hotel muy bien situado con amplias habitaciones. A destacar la limpieza general y en especial en las habitaciones, la comodidad de la cama y la buena insonorización y la atención y amabilidad del personal. ",5,2022,11,20
59,Genial experiencia!,"todo genial, hay una extensa exposición de 300 obras del dibujante catalán Opisso con influencia del dibujante francés Toulouse lautrec.Es una exposición permanente en el hall del hotel Astoria, restaurante muy bonito y de buen gusto.

Muchas gracias!",5,2022,11,17
59,Estupenda experiencia,Es un hotel con 3 estrellas pero merecedor de 4. Cogimos una habitación familiar y nos tocó con terraza.

La magnífica acogida, por parte de su director, Sr. Camps y la oferta gastronómica que ofrecía me hizo reservar una mesa para compartir con amigas y disfrutar de una genial estancia en un ambiente envolvente, cálido, culto y relajante en el centro de Barcelona. 
Gran hallazgo! Sin duda, volveré!",5,2022,11,10
59,"Sehr zu empfehlen, ein ausgezeichnetes Hotel in bester Lage","Wir waren mit unserem 6-jährigen Sohn für 7 Übernachtungen im Hotel Astoria Barcelona. Aufmerksam sind wir durch die positiven Bewertungen im Internet geworden, die wir nur bestätigen können. Die Kunstausstellung im Hotel und der Pool auf der Dachterrasse sind wirkliche Highlights. Die Zimmer sind sehr sauber und auf den guten Betten konnten wir sehr gut schlafen. Was aber das Hotel besonders auszeichnet, ist das gesamte sehr zuvorkommende und freundliche Personal auf dem Niveau eines First-Class-Hotels, was für die ausgezeichnete Führung des Hoteldirektors Herr Camps spricht. Es wurde sich um alle unsere Anliegen und Wünsche umgehend gekümmert. Auch ist die Lage des Hotels perfekt zum Ausgehen. Wir werden das Hotel auf jeden Fall wieder besuchen.",5,2022,11,06

El hotel nos ha gustado mucho en todos los sentidos y hemos estado como en casa. La ubicación perfecta.
Gracias por todo y esperamos volver pronto.
No he valorado el desayuno ni rte porque no hemos hecho uso de el, pero estoy segura que es de 10.
No parece un hotel de 3*...yo le daría 4*  en todos los sentidos. 
Gracias de nuevo y hasta la próxima.",5,2022,08,20
59,No cumple con las expectativas,"De la entrada lujosa te esperas una calidad que luego no se refleja en la habitación y en los comforts que vas a tener.
Nada más entrar nos fijamos en una señora que tenía su perro encima del sofá, cosa que no debería estar permitida. El hecho de que nadie del personal le dijo nada no nos gustó, nos pareció de poco respecto hacía los demás huéspedes, por no decir poco higiénico.
La habitación pequeña, con ventana al patio interior que daba a la pared de enfrente, sin luz natural, y el baño ciego, nos pareció un poco claustrofóbica. Además se escuchan todos los ruidos del pasillo y las habitaciones cercanas desde la cama, falta insonorización. La terraza con pequeña piscina inutilizable ya que estaba siempre petada de gente. De las fotos parece más grande de lo que es. 
No nos encontramos cómodos y no merece lo que pagamos.",3,2022,08,14

59,Reunión profesional en un entorno único,"Tuve que organizar una reunión rápida de negocios y en la cafetería me cedieron una de las salitas en la parte de la colección de Opisso.

59,Excelente hotel,"No se porque este hotel figura como de 3 estrellas cuando parece de 4 estrellas en todo. Hasta piscina tiene. La atención es excelente, la habitación está bien, el colchon es muy bueno, etc. Y la ubicación también es buena.
Por poner alguna pega, pongo 2:
- Nos tocos una habitación justo al lado del cuarto de la limpieza, con lo cual por la mañana se escuchaban más ruidos de lo habitual.
- El precio.. aunque no se si todos los hoteles de Barcelona están así de caros, o era por el Primavera Sound que subieron tanto los precios...",5,2022,06,06

59,Peccato per le camere,Hotel molto bello per struttura complessiva e per la posizione dalla quale si raggiunge a piedi il centro della città in maniera molto veloce. Deludente la camera con un letto talmente piccolo che in coppia abbiamo faticato non poco a riposare. Nessuna possibilità di aprire le valige. Ovviamente bagni piccoli e lavandino e bidet intasati. Un vero peccato,3,2019,06,16

Camera confortevole e molto pulita. Purtroppo la nostra finestra si affacciava su un muro ma d'altra parte non dovevamo passare la giornata in camera.

Decoración, ambiente, bienestar, buena cocina, servicio esmerado, un magnífico Té –escanciado de manera extraordinaria, y que hay que ver para creer-.

El hotel tiene la magia de lo tradicional con sus colecciones de fotografía y porcelanas ubicadas en el lobby y áreas comunes, así como el modernismo y la sencillez adoptados en sus habitaciones que están dotadas con camas confortables, baños impecables y un mobiliario adecuado. El restaurante también ofrece un excelente desayuno buffet y una variada carta de comida internacional y catalana para comida y cena.

El Astoria es de los pocos hotels en ésta área que cuenta con piscina, la cual esta ubicada en la última planta  y ofrece una visual hermosa de la ciudad y a la vez la posibilidad de disfrutar de un servicio de bar con cócteles de la casa.

Como huésped usted puede esperar una cálida bienvenida por parte del staff del front desk y en su habitación una botella de vino y un boleto gratis al Museo Egipcio, que vale la pena resaltar que lo visite para que pueda disfrutar de la importante colección de piezas únicas que son un orgullo adicional para Barcelona, el cual queda a solo 15 minutos caminando desde el hotel.

El Astoria está situado en una zona muy linda de la ciudad, en donde encontrará pequeños cafés y tiendas exclusivas, a pocos pasos del metro y estaciones de bus. Definitivamente, este hotel lo tiene todo y es una verdadera joya en Barcelona.

¡Gracias Pepe Camps y a todo su equipo de trabajo por la pasión y continuos detalles que hacen para sus huéspedes, una experiencia de viaje tan inolvidable!

Hasta muy pronto.",5,2018,09,13
59,ottimo hotel che meriterebbe 5 stelle,"Hotel curatissimo, pulito. Bellissimo il museo permanente del fumettista Opisso.
Prime colazioni ricchissime e freschissime. Ristorante impeccabile.
Ottima pulizia degli ambienti. Personale gentilissimo, in particolare quello della ristorazione.
Sicuramente sarà il nostro riferimento nei prossimi viaggi.",5,2018,09,11
59,Siamo stati bene,"Posizione molto buona: a piedi si raggiungono con una piacevole passeggiata molti siti interessanti della città. La hall dell'hotel ha un sapore affascinante con il suo stile liberty.
Stanza piccola ma molto pulita, che affacciava in pozzo d'aria interno ma in compenso silenziosa come noi avevamo richiesto.
Non ho usufruito della colazione che abbiamo consumato presso ""Farga"", un'ottima pasticceria nelle vicinanze",4,2018,09,11
59,Ubicación perfecta,"Muy recomendable, cerca del metro para poder moverte por Barcelona. El personal estupendo. Ha sido una estancia muy agradable. La piscina genial después de 12 horas de patear Barcelona. Mi única pega son los colchones, muy blandos.",4,2018,08,22
59,"Ottima la posizione, la pulizia, la cortesia e l'ambiente","L'hotel Astoria si trova in una posizione comoda per visitare tutta Barcellona. Praticamente, ogni attrazione si trova a 20-30 minuti (coi mezzi) dall'hotel. La zona è letteralmente disseminata da fermate del bus e della metro. Inoltre si trova nel nuovo quartiere di Eixample, pieno di ristoranti, bei negozi e in generale tranquillo. 
Le stanze sono pulitissime e profumate, luminose e larghe quanto basta. Climatizzatore, frigobar e cassaforte perfettamente funzionanti. Il personale è gentilissimo ed estremamente disponibile. Parlano bene molte lingue, quindi farvi capire non sarà affatto un problema. La piscina sul tetto è piccolina ma comoda e fa il suo dovere, specialmente se si ha bisogno di una bella rinfrescata dopo una lunga giornata a scarpinare per Barcellona. Si può inoltre usufruire degli asciugamani che l'hotel mette a disposizione direttamente in piscina.
Se proprio devo fare un piccolo appunto, che spero venga preso più che altro come suggerimento, ci vorrebbe un rinnovo dei bagni tale da sostituire la vasca con una bella doccia e, almeno per i clienti italiani, aggiungere gli asciugamani da bidet al già vasto kit di cortesia fornito XD 
In conclusione, consiglio caldamente questo hotel, perchè, a conti fatti, il rapporto qualità-prezzo è Eccellente!",4,2018,08,21
59,posizione strategica,"situato vicino alla diagonal, comodo per passeggiate fino alle ramblas. confortevole, con hall corredata di galleria fotografica da museo. colazione varia e di buon livello, non così la cena. personale cortese e disponibile.",4,2018,08,15
59,Recomendable,"Recomendable para visitar cómodamente al ciudad! El servicio de recepción estupendo aunque tuvimos un problema con la cisterna q finalmente no se solucionó antes de irnos, se quedaba la cisterna haciendo ruido y soltando agua y era molesto por la noche, optamos por cerrar la llave para los dos dias q nos quedaban. Cuando lo comentábamos en recepción nos decían q lo miraban pero luego al volver después de todo el día seguía igual, aún así son cosas solucionarles, lo recomendaria",5,2018,08,10
59,"Nostalgisch, stilvoll, und sehr sehr freundlich","Für einen Kurztrip (oder mehr) in Barcelona perfekt!

Der Pool auf dem Dach ist natürlich ein Highlight, aber besonders hervorzuheben ist neben der wirklich außergewöhnlichen Freundlichkeit der Hotelangestellten auch die sehr geschmackvolle Einrichtung des Hotels, vom Dachgarten über die Zimmer bis zum Frühstücksraum - man merkt, dass hier Kunstliebhaber am Werk sind!

Über das Angebot an frischen Früchten und Salaten, Säften, Sojamilch und verschiedenen Müslis haben wir uns sehr gefreut - das ist längst nicht überall so toll!

Einziges Manko war, dass das Zimmer auch für ein Standardzimmer ziemlich klein war - aber für eine Reise nach Barcelona im Hochsommer macht das wirklich nichts. Dafür war es herrlich ruhig.

Absolut zu empfehlen!",4,2018,08,09
59,Städtetrip,"Das Hotel befindet sich nicht weit einer U-Bahn Station. Wer gut zu Fuß ist, kann vieles von dort aus erreichen. Das Personal war sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. Die Zimmer sauber und dem gegebenen Standard entsprechend. Für den Preis und die Lage kann man hier wirklich nicht meckern!",4,2018,07,22
59,Muy recomendable para reserva en grupo,"Buscamos un lugar donde poder comer para culminar una salida cultural por la zona, un grupo de 30 personas y residente en Barcelona. Hice una reserva de grupo en el restaurante del hotel Astoria y todo salió de forma impecable. La atención del departamento de reservas de eventos del hotel fué muy buena y resolutiva, el personal de sala amable y profesional, la comida excelente y el precio muy razonable. El restautrante tranquilo y buena temperatura,destaco una decoración exquisita con la colección de ilustraciones del dibujante Opiso y otros carteles de la época modernista catalana. Muy recomendable para reserva en grupo dado el espacio (recogido y tranquilo), la comida, el precio y el equipo humano.",5,2018,07,11
59,Hotel correcto. Cama incomoda,Hotel muy bien situado en l’Eixample de Barcelona. Ideal para salir por la no he ya que no hay que coger el coche. Atencion correcta. La piscina del ático es muy pequeña. Las camas son muy incomodas y las almohadas demasiado altas.,3,2018,07,09
59,Habitación bien pero mucho ruido.,"Estuvimos alojados 2 noches solo para ver la ciudad. La habitación bien, muy equipada. El personal muy bien, es un hotel de “los antiguos” con respecto al trato, muy pendientes . Lo malo sin duda los ruidos, se oye cada vez que tiran de la cisterna y los ruidos del pasillo como si estuvieran en la habitación.Tiene una mini piscina en la azotea.",3,2018,07,03
59,Excelente Opción!!! RECOMENDABLE!!!,"La ubicación es muy buena porque estas a unas cuadras del Diagonal, la Rambla de Catalunya y el Paseo de Gracia. De Plaza Catalunya estarás a unas 10 cuadras ( que podrás hacer a pie en pocos minutos). 
Alrededor del hotel existen muy lindos lugares para almorzar o cenar o tomarte un rico café como para hacer compras ya que tienes todos los locales de las mejores marcas y popularidad cerca. 
El hotel tiene instalaciones cómodas, limpias y para descansar es maravilloso. Parece un hotel antiguo cuyo mantenimiento es impecable. 
Fui a estudiar una semana a Barcelona y la verdad el personal del hotel es atento, amable, servicial y procuran atender cada consulta e inquietud que se pueda presentar con una sonrisa. 
El desayuno muy rico y todos los productos super fresco. 
La piscina de la terraza es pequeña pero para los días de calor es espectacular. 
Es un hotel que recomiendo 100%!!!",5,2018,06,29

Una vez mas tengo que agradecer a su director las multiples atenciones que ha tenido con nosotros. También , por supuesto, a todo el personal por la amabilidad que hemos recibido por su parte.
Nos han preparado un menu especial el cual ha sido del agrado de todos los comensales y tambien agradecer el buen trato de las personas que nos atendieron durante la comida.
Me gustaria decir que la situacion es excelente, uno de los motivos por el cual escojo este hotel es para facilitar el desplazamiento de las personas que asisten a dicha reunion.

Bar abierto las 24 hs y el desayuno excelente !!!. ",5,2018,05,22
59,no se a que se refiere con titulo?,"Hotel emblemático con tradición y solera  que podría ser tipo el Hotel Majestic en pequeño y que sin grandes cambios, ya que la arquitectura es de corte clásico e imponente, podría ser convertido en un magnifico Hotel.
Como interiorista y acostumbrada al Majestic les digo que el Hotel es mucho mejor que estos de diseño barato, pero que tiene una necesidad de cambio de interiorismo tremendo.",3,2018,05,21
59,Il classico non tradisce,"Non c è che dire il nome non sempre è una garanzia ma in certi casi, come il mio che sto godendo del mio soggiorno qui all’astoria, lo è! Personale impeccabile, ad ogni ora; stile e classe; vecchia scuola, il che a noi amanti del vintage non spiace! Che dire, lascio parlare la foto del cioccolatino che ogni giorno ti fanno trovare sul cuscino!",5,2018,05,19
59,UN HOTEL DE PRIMERA,"Para empezar desde que llegamos fuimos muy bien recibidos por el personal de recepción, al llegar a la habitación se respiraba frescura, una limpieza impecable, la cama muy confortable perfecta para el buen descanso, el desayuno tipo buffet era muy atractivo a la vista, variado, y cabe destacar una vez mas la atención del personal que siempre estuvo atento a nuestros requerimientos. Lo recomendare siempre que pueda.",4,2018,05,16
59,Normalito,"Hotel bastante normal, lo mejor es la ubicación. Las habitaciones son correctas, limpias y confortables, pero el precio en general es alto. Buena elección para querer  moverte por la cuidad en transporte público, pero se aparca muy mal en la zona",3,2018,05,12
59,Soggiorno confortevole,"Siamo appena ritornati da Barcellona con una buon ricordo . La  posizione  dell'albergo  è comoda per gli spostamenti sia a piedi che con i mezzi pubblici e non . Intorno c'è di tutto .La location ha un fascino antico  , è accogliente e pulita . Personale gentilissimo , disponibile e pronto ad aiutarti anche se parli solo italiano . Colazione buona e varia , con la possibilità  di ordinare caffè e/ o cappuccino all'italiana . La camera ""datata"" è confortevole e tranquilla ma poco insonorizzata . Per  fortuna non abbiamo avuto necessità del condizionatore perché l'aria è orientata direttamente sul letto . Purtroppo dobbiamo dire che ,per due volte ,il personale è entrato in camera senza bussare anche se si è prontamente scusato .Ci sentiamo di consigliarlo .",4,2018,05,03
59,Buena relación precio calidad,"Muy buen hotel en una ubicación estratégica. Los empleados siempre con buena onda, sobre todo la señora de la barra, que siempre fue muy amable. La habitación cómoda. El hotel tiene un pequeño museo de arte. Lugar interesante.",4,2018,04,28

59,Sólo tres estrellas?,"Hotel bien situado muy cerca de la Diagonal, Rambla de Catalunya y Passeig de Gracia con un nivel de servicios de primera línea y que nada tiene que envidiar a otros de cuatro o cinco estrellas. Habitaciones suficientemente amplías, bien insonorizadas y muy cómodas. Lobby con decoración a base de caricaturas del gran Opisso. Piscina exterior en el ático de buenas dimensiones, ideal para refrescarse los días de verano. Sin duda repetiremos.",5,2018,04,05
59,Ottimo soggiorno a Barcellona  ,"Hotel accogliente, pulitissimo e dotato di ogni comfort.
Personale gentile e professionale.
Consigliato sia a chi viaggia per lavoro e a chi viaggia per diletto.

Tornerò sicuramente. ",4,2018,03,31
59,Piacevole soggiorno! ,"Ho avuto il piacere di soggiornare in questo hotel, molto bello e soprattutto pulito. Personale cortese anche se nessuno faceva un minimo sforzo per parlare in italiano, anzi rispondevano pure velocemente così che ovviamente non capissi nulla, però ... Hotel antico però bello e curato nei minimi dettagli. CONSIGLIATO! ",4,2018,03,25
59,Increible relación calidad-precio,"Se trata de un excelente hotel, situado en una de las mejores zonas de Barcelona. Ideal para visitas a la ciudad, incluso sin problemas para entrar y salir de la misma.
La atención en recepción resulta excelente, disponen de servicio de aparcamiento (de pago) lo cual en el centro de Barcelona resulta necesario.
Las instalaciones así como la decoración en general tienen buen aspecto. Su precio es inmejorable para el servicio y ubicación que ofrecen.
Y, solo como crítica constructiva, sugerir que sustituyan las bañeras por duchas, ya que las actuales resultan peligrosas para entrar y salir en personas con ligeros problemas de movilidad.
De cualquier manera, hotel altamente recomendable.",4,2018,03,22
59,Tranquilo y acogedor,"Excelente hotel clásico, acogedor y tranquilo. Muy buen servicio y limpieza. En el centro de Barcelona. El personal es muy atento y el desayuno tipo buffet o a la carta muy bueno.

PARA VOLVER!",5,2018,03,18
59,"Zona céntrica, bonita y bien comunicada en hotel elegante y actualizado","Tiene la elegancia de los 60 con las comodidades de finales del siglo XX. Personal muy amable. Habitación amplia con sofá. Camas comodísimas con varias almohadas. Persiana en las ventanas. A destacar el hall y la sala con caricaturas.
El desayuno es caro y sin opción a algo más económico. No hay problema porque la zona está llena de cafeterias que abren bien temprano.",5,2018,03,15
59,AlbertoE.,"Voy prácticamente todas las semanas, aún cuándo está muy bien ubicado y su personal es infinitamente muy amable y profesional, especialmente la chica de cocina a quién querría felicitar por su trabajo, tiene algunos inconvenientes:

1. Una de las veces que me hospedé no había agua caliente y no he recibido ninguna compensación a cambio.
2. La grifería es a veces muy ruidosa en otras habitaciones, especialmente las de las esquinas y no permiten descansar correctamente.

Existen mejores hoteles en la zona con precios similares, yo los utilizaría si mi empresa tuviera convenio con ellos.",3,2018,03,13
59,Ist OK!! Aber nie wieder...,"War für 3 Nächte im Hotel.

Das Standard Zimmer ist sehr klein man kann sich kaum bewegen...das Zimmer war sehr staubig und das Bad sehr veraltet.
Man hat kein Ausblick auf die Stadt sondern sonder auf eine Mauer wir haben keine frische Luft bekommen wenn man das Fenster öffnet.

Das Personal war nett und das Frühstück war auch ok (15€ pro Person, bekommt man in der Stadt besseres Frühstück).

Also wer nur ein Bett zum schlafen braucht ist das Hotel ok aber mehr nicht...

",2,2018,03,03
59,Hotel Clásico con la belleza de las grandes casas de Barcelona,"Una situación inmejorable en el eixample pegado a la calle más de moda en cuanto a restauración (Enrique granados ) y el shopping de rambla cataluña y paseo de gracia . La atención fue exquisita por parte de tanto la gerencia como del front desk . Tienen descuento en un parking justo en frente del hotel que el conserje te lo acerca. El desayuno muy correcto y las habitaciones espaciosas comparado con otros hoteles de más estrellas. Toallas en los baños gordas y agradables , limpieza un 10 y calidad precio inmejorable .",5,2018,02,21
59,"Acogida y servicio cordial, comodidad y precio muy razonable","Este hotel de estilo modernista y con una larga historia, está magníficamente situado y su personal es ejemplo de amabilidad con el cliente.
Las habitaciones son relativamente pequeñas pero muy cuidadas, Nosotros tuvimos una estupenda habitación superior.
El desayuno buffet responde a la cuidada calidad de servicio del hotel.
Destaca también el muy razonable equilibrio calidad /precio del hotel.
Muy recomendable",5,2018,02,16
59,Muy aconsejable en Barcelona ,"Inmejorable situación. Conserva el encanto de aquellos hoteles con glamour. Un vintage en las zonas comunes con obras de cartelería de época parisina y catalana pero con habitaciones modernas. Conodísimas camas con ropa de calidad total. Baños que dan gusto por el rizo impecable de sus toallas o la comodidad y facilidad de grifos que no pasa en todos los hoteles.
El desayuno con pan de verdad, el pan cristal catalán con tomate es un escándalo del bueno.
El jamón ibérico espectacular que es de agradecer. 
Muy bien atendidos tanto recepción como en comedor. 
Desde luego calidad precio es y será mi elección siempre que pueda.
Felicidades!",5,2018,02,15
59,Schönes Hotel in guter Lage,"Die Lage des Hotels ist für einen Städtetrip wirklich gut. Nette Bars und Restaurants in der Nähe, kurze Distanz zu öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln. 
Sehr freundliche Mitarbeiter. Wir waren um 9:30 vor Ort und konnten sofort unser Zimmer beziehen und frühstücken. Das Frühstück war sehr gut, warme Speisen konnten separat bestellt werden. 
Das Zimmer war klein aber komfortabel und sauber. 
Ich würde das Hotel weiterempfehlen. ",5,2018,02,14

59,"Albergo centrale, molto pulito e che ci consente un tuffo a capofitto nell'arte dei primi del '900","Localizzato in centro, contornato da palazzi liberty. L'atmosfera del periodo si vive anche dentro l'albergo dato che il proprietario è stato amico di Picasso e che ha avuto il gusto di riempire tutto il piano terra di opere dell'inizio del secolo scorso. Affiches, disegni di Toulouse Lautrec, statue da tavolo rendono interessantissimo il soggiorno.
Le camere non sono spaziose ma ben tenute",5,2018,02,07
59,MUY RECOMENDABLE,"Esta todo muy renovado y confortable, las habitaciones perfectas no son muy grandes pero lo justo para una pareja con un  niño pequeño como es nuestro caso, el servicio super atento disponen de parking, y el desayuno perfecto todo esquisto. muy recomendable.",5,2018,02,03

59,Un tres estrellas con calidad de cinco,"Impresionante de inicio al fin: una bienvenida cálida de Juan y Valeria en recepción (quien llamó minutos después para cerciorarse de que todo estaba perfecto), la ayuda de Germán para ubicarme en la ciudad, la amabilidad de las camareras de piso (las cuales dejaban la habitación totalmente impoluta). El diseño de la habitación, urbano y chic, la atención y calidad del desayuno... todos me asistieron con interés sincero. Acostumbrado a la calidad esta cadena, pero ha excedido las expectativas.
Gracias de nuevo a todo el equipo, estoy deseando volver.",5,2018,01,26
59,Excelente hotel,"Le estancia en el hotel Astoria ha sido excelente. El trato del personal es exuisito, haciéndote sentir como en tu casa. La limpieza perfecta. Tenían una exposición en su hall y nos invitaron también al museo Egipcio. Preciosas escaleras de caracol!",5,2018,01,22

59,Buena atención - Buen desayuno ,"Muy cómodas las habitaciones de dimensiones normales pero muy lindas para un hotel de 3 estrellas. El servicio de cuarto muy atento y respetuoso.

Recomendable. Por la época no pude disfrutar de la pileta.",5,2017,11,19
59,Un lujo,"Reservé este hotel para mi último día en Europa, fue una decisión correcta.
La atención es excelente, muy buena predisposición de los recepcionistas, gente cálida. La ubicación es inmejorable, en el eixample, una zona muy segura, iluminada, concurrida, con todos los medios de transporte al alcance. Recuerdo irme a caminar por el barrio a altas horas de la madrugada, sin ningún temor a que algo ocurra.
Hay opciones gastronómicas por todas partes, kioskos y almacenes.
Las instalaciones del hotel son una maravilla, la habitación amplia, la cama muy comoda, el sistema de aire acondicionado, la tele, todo moderno y en buen estado.
Sin dudas volvería a hospedarme aquí, lo recomiendo totalmente.",5,2017,11,17
59,me encanto,pasamos 3 noches alli . Excelente todo !! Atencion muy buena. Ubicacion muy comoda. Lo uniico no incluia desayuno y tomarlo alli salia 10 € mientrss que en barcitos de la cuadra salia 3 o 4 €. Asi que tomabamos en otro lado . especialmente en el bar Paris muy lindo !!,4,2017,11,06
59,"Sauber, Freundlich, zentral gelegen ",Wir durften drei Nächte in diesem Hotel verbringen und waren sehr zufrieden... nettes und freundliches Personal... saubere Zimmer die jeden Tag gereinigt wurden.. benutzte Handtücher wurden täglich gewechselt.. leider nur 2 deutsche Fernsehsender ( aber wer braucht schon Fernsehen bei einer Städtetour).. sehr leckeres und ausreichendes Frühstück.. bei schönem Wetter kann man auch den Pool auf der Dachterrasse benutzen die auch mit ausreichenden Liegen bestückt ist.. auch die Betten waren sehr bequem und sauber das einzige Manko war dass sie getrennt gestellt waren,4,2017,11,04

59,Un hotel con personalidad,"Voy a Barcelona a menudo y siempre me quedo por la zona del Eixample. Esta vez mi hotel habitual se había subido a la parra y decidí buscar otro. El hotel está en la calle París entre Enric Granados y Aribau, muy cerca del paseo de Gracia y rodeado de multitud de restaurantes de todo tipo.. El lobby es ya distinto a cualquier otro de su categoría, una decoración deco, una exposición permanente de dibujos de Ricard Opisso y un personal amabilisimo. Las habitaciones son bastante amplias con un buen cuarto de baño y un armario bien distribuido lo cual es raro de ver. La unica sugerencia sería una silla para poder trabajar, ya que el sofa es un poco incomodo para esto. El hotel cuenta con una piscina en el atico pequeña pero muy agradable y con buenas vistas y un escaso gimnasio que si hace sol se convierte en un pequeño horno. En resumen un hotel distinto, en precio, muy bien situado, con algunas carencias para mi de poca importancia e insisto con un personal fuera de lo normal de amable.",4,2017,09,15
59,HOTEL MUSEO OPISSO,"Hotel en un barrio muy tranquilo, muy cerca del centro, y muy bien comunicado. Posee una terraza magnifica con agradable vista hasta el mar. A 200 metros de las calles comerciales y edificios modernistas.",5,2017,09,13
59,Hotel céntrico,"Me alojé por motivos laborales y pasé exclusivamente una noche, así que mi experiencia no es muy completa. El hotel es elegante, está bien cuidado, tiene muchos detalles decorativos curiosos y buen aspecto general. Las habitaciones estaban limpias, aunque sin demasiado esmero (la mía olía a polvo y de encerrado). El aire acondicionado (mal común en la mayoría de los hoteles) hace mucho ruido y es imposible controlar la temperatura, así que mueres de frío o de calor (en pleno mes de julio).
El desayuno se me antojó escaso, pero quizá porque el espacio del comedor es más bien pequeño.
Las habitaciones están bien insonorizadas, así que la calidad del sueño es elevada.
La gente de recepción es atenta y preocupada. Vale la pena alojarse en el Astoria si tienes negocios que hacer.",3,2017,09,04
59,"Tolles Hotel, super Service!","Das Hotel liegt zwar nicht direkt im Zentrum, dafür kann ein eigenes Fahrzeug sicher untergebracht werden und alle Sehenswürdigkeiten sind zu Fuß sehr gut zu erreichen.

59,Estadía hotel Astoria,"Muy lindo hotel, habitación muy cómoda y buenas instalaciones, los empleados muy atentos. Super recomendable, si vuelvo a Barcelona vuelvo a hotel Astoria. Cerca del hotel hay bares y restaurantes para cenar.                                                  ",5,2017,08,05
59,Un hotel de 10. Magnífica experiencia.,"El hotel Astoria tiene todo el ambiente de la Barcelona clásica. Es elegante y señorial en sus zonas comunes. Moderno, limpísimo y perfectamente equipado en sus habitaciones. El trato de su personal hizo que nos sintiéramos como en casa. Ya no contemplo más hoteles para mis visitas a Barcelona. El Astoria es un precioso hotel de 10.",5,2017,07,31
59,Recomendable,"El hotel en conjunto bien, servicio, recepción,habitación(una superior en esta valoración) el desayuno para mi gusto más que suficiente y en las mesas avía unos papeles que decian huevos,salchichas, chistorras no se sabe si es que podias pedirlos porque de información no ponía nada , la colección de dibujos muy interesante.El precio supongo por haver mucha demanda en la capital este fin de semana y tratandose de un tres estrellas un poco alto 207 € la noche.",4,2017,07,31
59,Por encimas de las expectativas y muy buena calidad para ser un tres estrellas,"Normalmente solemos usar hoteles de cuatro o cinco estrellas y en este caso, por tema de ubicación, decidimos usar este hotel. Quedamos gratamente sorprendidos ya que el trato fue excelente y las habitaciones eran nuevas y muy cómodas. La única pega (por poner alguna) es que no pudimos disponer de una habitación para cuatro (dos adultos más dos niños). Por el resto es un hotel altamente recomendable ",5,2017,07,30
59,Sehr zentral gelegenes Hotel in Barcelona mit super Service und leckerem Frühstück!,"Super!
Saubere Zimmer und sehr netter Service. 
Das Frühstück war genau richtig, von allem etwas und warme Speisen konnten direkt beim Kellner bestellt werden. Viele Highlights in der Nähe, ob zu Fuss oder mit der Bahn. 
Sehr empfehlenswert für einen Kurztrip nach Barcelona!",5,2017,07,27
59,Ottimo hotel,"Camera di adeguate dimensioni, veramenre pulita. Staff molto gentile, soprattutto il ragazzo di Cuba che si occupa del bar sul terrazzo con piscina. Posizionato vicino a bar,  ristoranti e mezzi pubblici.  Unico neo è il rumore proveniente dalla strada.",5,2017,07,26
59,Hotel con un personal excepcional,"Había leído sobre la amabilidad del personal de este hotel y su director, pero han superado mis expectativas, tuve la mala suerte de ponerme enferma durante la estancia en su hotel hace unos días y el trato ha sido, además de su educación, tan amable, cercano, atento, generoso, y no es una pose de cara al cliente, realmente se ve que son gente excepcional y buena. Muchas gracias de corazón.",5,2017,07,24
59,"Excelente hotel, ubicación perfecta, atención especial, sin dudas lo recomiendo","Estancia perfecta en el hotel, habitaciones amplias, excelente limpieza, atención permanente para tratar de solucionar inconvenientes que pudieran surgir , la ubicación inmejorable, sin dudas los,recomiendo. ",5,2017,07,15
59,No me gustó,"La ubicación es muy buena, mi experiencia en éste hotel no fué buena, cuando llegué habia pagado por una habitación Superior de 27mts, según decía la página  y me dieron una que no llegaba a la mitad,Fuí a la conserjería y trataron de convencerme no de buena manera  que estaba bien, luego me ofrecieron el desayuno, lo cual no acepté, al otro día nos cambiaron a la habitación contratada. La limpieza es deficiente, el baño tenía cabellos en el piso desde que la entergaron hasta que me fuí.Una estadía no muy agradble. La piscina es una broma, con 6 personas se llena.No volvería.",3,2017,07,11
59,Mala atencion al cliente,"El hotel es elegante, con un bonito bar en la planta baja y un cómodo espacio con sillones, la habitación es cómoda y tiene una pequeña piscina en la terraza.El inconveniente en este hotel es la atención al cliente en particular en la recepción, si tienen un inconveniente ( como yo lo tuve) no solo no les solucionaran nada sino que además se encargaran de hacerle sentir que es una molestia.",3,2017,07,11
59,Barcellona senza automobile,"La posizione dell'hotel consente di visitare la città senza bisogno di noleggiare un'automobile e di raggiungere l'aeroporto senza taxi. E' confortevole, pulito, il servizio accurato. Colazione strepitosa! Consigliato!",4,2017,07,09
59,Fantástica estada! Precioso Hotel!,"Fuimos muy bien atendidos por cordialidad  y el trato del personal muy amable y eficiente! Recepción estuvo muy atento en cada momento por nuestro bienestar.

59,Vacanza bellissima!!,"Sono stata a Barcellona insieme alle mie amiche e son rimasta entusiasta sia della città sia dell'albergo. Ottimo il servizio (mai trovato in disordine nelle stanze e gli inservienti erano sempre disponibili e gentili) e la cucina (soprattutto per è un amante del pesce). Anche la posizione è comoda (abbastanza vicino alla Ramblas, vicino a fermate autobus e taxi).
Consiglio vivamente di andarci a chi vuole fare una bella vacanza senza spendere troppo.",5,2017,07,04
59,Cena pessima,"Ho pernottato in questo hotel con mio marito durante un viaggio organizzato dalla Boscolo. Convinti, erroneamente, che la qualità della struttura fosse soddisfacente sotto tutti i punti di vista, ci siamo dovuti ricredere al momento della cena!
infatti, avendo pagato per la mezza pensione (notte+colazione+cena), i miei compagni di viaggio (tour organizzato pacchetto Boscolo) e noi ci rendiamo conto di quanto fosse scadente la qualità dei pasti proposti (o, meglio, imposti, non essendoci alternative) e di quanto la preparazione/cottura sia incommentabile: primo piatto di salmone affumicato contornato di lattuga e secondo piatto di pesce di origine indefinita (forse merluzzo) contornato di patate e carote, il tutto non adeguatamente cotto e di sapore sgradevole. 
Non avrei lasciato commenti così negativi  su tale struttura se non fosse che ancora ora (a distanza di 2 giorni dall'ultimo pasto mangiato nel hotel) sto subendo le conseguenze negative per forti mal di pancia (e non mi dilungo per decenza).
La colazione, invece, è stata abbondante e varia e qualitativamente buona!
Le stanze, dalle foto risultanti discretamente ampie, sono in realtà risultate piccole e con affacciata non areggiata poichè circondata da mura (nonostante la mia stanza fosse situata in un piano alto; non oso immaginare chi alloggiasse in un piano inferiore...).
Per questi motivi (primo tra tutti i pasti!) non tornerei in questo hotel, purtroppo.",2,2017,06,27
59,Un dia maravilloso ,"Celebramos junto a unos amigos nuestra fiesta de 60 años.

59,hotel funcional de 3 estrellas muy aceptable,"Muy céntrico, bien comunicado, con todo tipo de servicios alrededor. Personal muy amable. Habitación standard correcta. Cama comodísima y de agradecer las 2 almohadas más un cuadrante aunque podía ser de 1.50 en vez de 1.35. Muy limpio y funcional. Con aire acondicionado. Ventana con cortinas, visillo y persiana que dan intimidad y oscuridad a la habitación, pero dando a un patio enano. Por un lado estupendo ya que no había un ruido. Se agradece el aire acondicionado.
Muy caro el desayuno.
Preciosa la exposición de pintura en la planta baja.",3,2017,05,29
59,Relax,Ci hanno riservato la camera al piano alto come richiesto ed anche se  non  c' era panorama perché dava su una corte interna la tranquillità era garantita. Ed era quello che cercavamo. Notevole la piscina sul tetto ,4,2017,05,22
59,Buon hotel centrale,"Hotel classico ed elegante, in zona molto centrale e comoda, ma allo stesso tempo tranquilla, con tanti ristoranti e bar nei paraggi.
La camera non era molto grande, ma con tutto lo spazio necessario; nuova, pulita, con il parquet (niente moquette), armadio grande e scrivania, letto e cuscini comodi, minibar e tv a schermo piatto.
Il bagno era piccolo, con la vasca (scomodo fare la doccia), ma anchd con il bidet. Buoni i prodotti da bagno.
Purtroppo l'isolamento acustico della stanza non era dei migliori: si sentono i rumori in corridoio e l'acqua che scorre nei tubi.
La colazione era buona, con vasto assortimento di dolce e salato ed anche piatti caldi su ordinazione (uova, omelette...).
Il ristorante interno è aperto anche a pranzo, ma non a cena.
Wifi gratuito abbastanza veloce.
Personale gentile e disponibile.
In generale è stata un'esperienza positiva, ma con qualche punto da migliorare.",3,2017,05,18
59,Gracias Astoria,"Volvería sin duda porque fue el lugar donde me sentí muy cómoda con todo y todos
El personal es muy atento y servicial siempre dispuesto a resolver todos los problemas o dudas que se presenten
Lo recomendaría porque fue el mejor hotel superando a Málaga y Madrid",5,2017,05,17
59,Valoracion Restauracion,"No voy a valorar el hotel. Si no su restaurante donde el servicio profesional es excelente y la cocinera magnifica, donde invito a cualquiera a que acuda a comer un dia para terminar con la sensacion de haber comido en un restaurante propio de categoria estrella michelin. Relacion precio-calidad excelente. Si no le pongo 5* es pq solo puedo valorar su restaurante y desconozco como son sus habitaciones. Pero al visitar la octava planta y encontre esa pequeña pero agradable piscina, me entusiasmo la idea de algun dia quedarme como huesped en dicho hotel. El unico fallo es que los baños del hall estaban estropeados y como solo hay uno pues debes subir al octavo piso si quieres ir al servicio. Pero como sera algo puntual debo decir que no os arrepentireis de por lo menos comer el menu del dia en dicho hotel.",4,2017,05,17
59,Algo que otros hoteles no tienen.,"En el lobby se puede ver la mejor colección de dibujos y pinturas de Opisso. Una delicia tomarse un vino y contemplarlos.
Personal muy amable. Comedor, bar y salas muy tranquilos.
Ubicación muy céntrica en la izquierda del Ensanche barcelonés, junto a la deliciosa calle Enrique Granados y su zona peatonal cabe la Diagonal.",4,2017,05,09
59,Recomendado,"El hotel está muy bien. Bien situado, apenas 1 min de la diagonal, el paseo de gracia desde el hotel en la misma calle en 5 min andando despacio. Lo mejor es la ubicación que sin ser en una calle principal que suele ser horriblemente caro lo tienes todo cerca.
Limpio. 
La atención del personal muy buena y bien. 
Merece la pena desde luego.

59,Un buon albergo,"Ho soggiornato con la mia fidanzata nei giorni a cavallo del primo Maggio. La posizione dell'albergo è molto buona: centrale ma sufficientemente defilato dalle vie più rumorose. All'arrivo abbiamo ricevuto un'ottima accoglienza anche in lingua italiana e abbiamo dovuto immediatamente pagare tutto il soggiorno. La cosa non è stata un problema ma ci ha dato l'impressione di una sfiducia a priori. Siamo poi stati accompagnati alla nostra stanza e ci sono state spiegate le varie possibilità che avevamo, tra le quali una piscina riscaldata posta all'ultimo piano che non abbiamo potuto sfruttare per mancanza di tempo.
La stanza era piccola ma molto confortevole. Due particolari, però, non sono stati all'altezza del livello complessivamente buono della struttura: il rumore dello scorrimento dell'acqua nelle tubature interne ai muri che, specie di notte, si sentiva parecchio, e il personale addetto alle pulizie che iniziava rumorosamente il riordino delle stanze dalle 7.30 del mattino (!) arrivando a bussare alle 8 alla nostra stanza per sistemarla. Ovviamente stavamo ancora riposando e la cosa è stata poco piacevole. L'abbiamo segnalata alla reception perché vi ponesse rimedio.
Abbiamo comunque ricevuto delle piccole attenzioni, nei giorni di permanenza, come dei cioccolatini e dell'acqua fresca che abbiamo apprezzato come dei gesti per prendersi cura di noi.
Il giorno della partenza, poi, ci è stata fatta la gentilezza di tenere in custodia le nostre valigie fino al pomeriggio, quando siamo ripartiti.
Una buona permanenza che speriamo di ripetere in futuro.",5,2017,05,02
59,Un hotel muy acogedor,"El edificio es bonito y el personal muy amable. Todo está muy limpio. El desayuno es muy bueno. La ubicación ideal, muy cerca del paseo de Gracia. La calle es muy tranquila tanto de día como de noche.",4,2017,05,02
59,Buona base per visite della città,"Albergo di media categoria, pulitissimo, camere più che dignitose. Decentrato rispetto alle principali zone di interesse turistico , ma abbastanza vicino alla metropolitana. Ottima colazione e personale gentile.",3,2017,05,02
59,LO ACCESIBLE Y CENTRICO QUE ESTA. Lo sencillo y  elegante a la vez.,"Tuve que estar mucho tiempo en el hotel por razones de trabajo y personales, necesitaba un lugar fresco pero acogedor y mi carácter no me permite lo grosero o no elegante, aunque sea sencillo; además era irrescindible que tuviera una comida sana y rica, y que estuviera céntrico y se pudiera pasear con comodidad por sus alrededores. Lo voy a recomendar a mis suegros y mi familia  que vienen mucho a BCN porque la relación servicios, calidad y precio esta superequilibrada.",4,2017,04,27
59,Hotel für Städtetrip,"Das Hotel ist sauber und das Personal ist nett.
Wir haben einen Barcelona Trip gemacht und dafür ist das Hotel ideal. Wir hatten ein Zimmer nach hinten, da hat man einen ""Lichtschacht"" aus dem Fenster. Nicht schön anzusehen aber dafür sehr ruhig und das ist die Hauptsache, denn nach vorne ist ja eine viel befahrene Straße. Und wir sind ja nicht in Barcelona um aus dem Fenster zu schauen. Frühstück ist völlig ausreichend und wenn man das Personal fragt bekommt man frische Rühreier und Bacon also perfekt! Wir würden wieder kommen!",4,2017,04,27
59,Consigliato,"Ottimo hotel con ottima posizione, vicinissimo a Casa Batlló è La Pedrera, ma in una zona molto tranquillo. Molto pulito e il personale è molto cortese. Se mi capiterà di tornare a Barcellona, tornerò sicuramente.",5,2017,04,15
59,Posizione strategica,"Buon albergo in posizione strategica: lontano ma non troppo dal centro, ben servito dalle fermate 'Provenca' e 'Diagonal' della metro, e molto vicino a una delle grandi direttrici del traffico barcellonese, Avinguda Diagonal.
L'albergo è grande, pulito, le camere sono abbastanza spaziose, il personale è gentile e il capo ricevimento parla italiano.
Problemi con l'impianto idraulico! Fa un chiasso infernale, che penso venga dal quinto piano, e mi ha svegliato più volte di notte.",4,2017,04,02
59,Muy amables pero la habitacion sin mas,"El hotel es precioso y los trabajadores son super simpáticos, el problema es la calidad. La habitación tenía buena pinta pero la cama no era especialmente cómoda, la televisión no se podía ver porque no debía de estar bien sintonizada o yo que sé, y la ducha es pequeña. El desayuno buffet también dejaba bastante que desear, el café malo, el zumo normalito y lo único que se salva eran las mini magdalenas",3,2017,03,26
59,Trato del personal estupendo,"El personal del hotel fue muy amable, me encantó el trato. El hotel esta en una zona muy bien comunicada con los FGC y líneas de metro muy cerca. La zona en si es estupenda. M encantaron los pósters y grabados que decoraban el hotel y el ambiente es retro y muy acogedor.",5,2017,03,23
59,Consigliato,"Come sempre le 5 stelle sono calcolate basandomi sulla cifra pagata. Prenotato 3 mesi primi ho speso il giusto e sono stato benissimo. Abbiamo sempre e solo dormito in qs. Hotel senza mai consumare pasti. Camere pulite, personale gentile e disponibile, posizione buona. Consigliato.",5,2017,03,21
59,"posizione centrale, servita dai mezzi, ma fuori da caos del centro storico","Ottima esperienza in questo hotel 3 stelle. Personale gentile, sia in reception, sia al bar.
Buona la pulizia e il comfort della camera. Pecca un po' nella insonorizzazione, più che altro le tubazioni dell'acqua, la notte diventava parecchio fastidioso.
Nel complesso consiglierei senza dubbio questo hotel, situato nel quartiere eixample, molto elegante, tranquillo e lontano quanto basta dal delirio del centro storico. La fermata più vicina è Diagonal (metro L3 e L5), a pochi minuti di distanza. Consiglio una volta usciti dalla metro di entrare al punto di informazioni che si trova proprio all'uscita e fare incetta di cartine e chiedere l'elenco dei punti di interesse, con orari, costi e indirizzi di tutte le principali attrazioni.
Zona pieni di locali in cui mangiare bene, ma se siete amanti dello junk food c'è anche uno starbucks e un mcdonald's a pochi metri.
Ottimo servizio e ottima esperienza. Complimenti!",5,2017,03,17
59,Excelente ubicación y gran confort,"La ubicación es excelente para el que quiera recorrer Barcelona, a pasos de la Avigunda Diagonal, Passeig de Gracia y Rambla de Catalunia.

59,Casi todo bien,"La ubicación es muy buena, el personal es muy accesible aunque a veces entraban a hacer la limpieza sin cerciorarse de que no hubiese nadie. La amabilidad de los mismos es estupenda. sin embargo las camas son muy incómodas, al ser de resorte el sueño fue difícil. ",3,2017,03,12

59,Hotel Astoria Barcellona,"Una hotel ottimo, vicinissimo alla Diagonal e al Passeig de Gracia.
Oltretutto, un luogo storico perché è il museo di Ricard Opisso; il pittore che ha contribuito a formare il gruppo pittorico dei ""Els Quatre Gats"" con Pablo Picasso.

Da visitare assolutamente.",5,2017,02,26

Hotel da consigliare per una breve e intensa vacanza a Barcellona.",4,2017,02,11
59,Para repetir y tripitir,"Es la tercera vez que lo visitamos y sí, aunque no es de los hoteles más minimalistas en cuanto a decoración se refiere, la limpieza, las instalaciones, la ubicación y el trato del personal es excelente.

Volveremos de nuevo. Sin duda. ",5,2017,02,08

59,Nostalgie trifft Moderne,"Die Gegend ist nicht die schönste von Barcelona und wenn man vor der Tür des Hotels steht, merkt man, dass es schon einige Jahre auf dem Buckel hat. Doch innen ist es toll. Vieles ist alt, aber prima in Schuss gehalten während das Zimmer modern und freundlich gestaltet. Alles top sauber. Das Personal in allen Bereichen sehr freundlich. Das Frühstücksbuffet war sehr gut. ein kleinen Wehrmutstropfen gibt es dann noch, der Kaffee war nicht so toll, aber das ist unterm Strich dann doch ein Haar in der Suppe.",5,2017,01,17
59,BUONA SCELTA,"Abbiamo trovato questo hotel in un pacchetto di Expedia. 
Il personale è sempre stato gentilissimo e pronto ad esaudire le nostre richieste, la camera era molto carina, e ben arredata, il bagno grande, col bidet e con la finestra. 
Posizione ottima a circa 10 minuti dalla metro Diagonal, in un quartiere ricco di bar ristoranti, e negozi, anche un paio di supermercati.

59,A COLPO SICURO,"Esperienza molto positiva. Camere doppia ben arredate, complete di tutto e sufficientemente ampie. Stesso dicasi per il bagno, sebbene un piatto doccia sarebbe stato ancora più comodo della vasca munita di antine laterali. Buona l'offerta della prima colazione. La posizione è tutto sommato apprezzabile: passeig de gracia è a 15 minuti a piedi, Plaza Catalunya (e quindi le ramblas) a 25, ma a cinque/sette minuti dall'albergo vi sono cmq le prime fermate di treno (Provenca) e metro (Diagonal) e proprio di fronte la reception una di autobus di linea. Ho trovato il rapporto qualità/prezzo davvero conveniente! Sicuramente da suggerire! ",4,2017,01,07

La nostra camera affacciava sulla strada principale, avevamo la colazione inclusa ed ogni mattina il buffet era ricco ed il personale provvedeva ad ogni nostra richiesta soprattutto per i bambini. Accanto alla hall ci sono vari disegni di Opisso davvero interessanti. Personale molto cortese e  disponibile, pulizia della camera molto precisa, prezzo medio alto.

59,"Excelente atencion, habitacion anticuada","Estuve solo una noche en el hotel y lo mejor la atención de los recepcionistas (todos muy serviciales y majos). La ubicación ideal, con muchos restaurantes en los alrededores. La habitación es mejorable: muy anticuada, la tele muy pequeña y se veía regular. Lamentablemente me tocó una habitación interior y la vista era bastante fea. Pero en resumen pude descansar bien y me quedo con la buena atención. ",3,2016,10,27
59,Teures aber sehr gut gelegenes Hotel mit Mängel,"Hallo,

wir waren in dieser Woche für 4 Tage in Barcelona um unsere Miniflitterwochen dort zu verbringen. Anhand der sehr sehr guten Bewertungen und auch der zentralen Lage habe ich das 3 Sterne Hotel Astoria im Stadtteil Eixample gewählt. Warum dieses Hotel so viele gute und vor allem herausragende Bewertungen hat, verstehe ich überhaupt nicht. Meine Vor - und Nachteile in zwei Listen:

Vorteil:

- zentrale Lage, die nächste Metro Station (Diagonal) ist fussläufig in wenigen Minuten zu erreichen
- sehr nette Rezeption, die gerne mit Insider Wissen aufwartet
- es sieht edel aus 
- Pool auf dem Dach (könnte aber knapp werden, wenn das Hotel voll belegt ist).
- Sport - / Kraftraum

Nachteil:

- teuer, allen voran das extra buchbare Frühstück für 15 € pro Kopf
- lächerlich geringe Auswahl beim Frühstück, keine Wurst, 2 verschiedene Käsesorten, mieser Kaffee -> definitiv keine 15 € wert, Abzocke
- (unser) Zimmer roch muffig und wäre es wohl nicht frisch renoviert gewesen, hätten wir sicherlich Schimmel an den Wänden. Nachfrage bei Rezeption und Haushaltsdame brachten keinen Erfolg, es wurde kein anderes Zimmer angeboten.
- Blick in einen viereckigen Schacht, keinerlei Luftzufuhr bei komplett offenem Fenster
- nur 3 deutsche Fernsehprogramme (ZDF, RTL und Eurosport), was aber verschmerzbar ist.
- mangelhafte Installationen (Steckdose fällt aus der Wand, beim Duschen läuft, trotz Glastür und - wand, das Bad voll).
- Zimmer sind sehr mickrig, bei nächsten Mal wäre wohl ein Hostel die bessere Alternative gewesen.
- Was aber gar nicht geht, ist der Geräuschpegel. Obwohl keine Arbeiten mehr in dem Hotel zu machen sind, ist es ab 6.00 Uhr morgens richtig laut, so dass man wirklich nicht mehr schlafen kann, absolute Katastrophe!!
- Wände sehr dünn, man hört jedes Spülen oder Duschen als würde man direkt in dem jeweiligen Raum sitzen.
- Reinigungsfrauen kommen, trotz ""Bitte nicht stören"" Schild, einfach in die Zimmer. Auch klingelte mitten in der Nacht einmal unser Telefon.
- Safe im Zimmer vorhanden, aber defekt.

Alles in allem kann ich von dem Hotel nur abraten und bin auch immer noch enttäuscht, dass mich hier die vielen guten Bewertungen getäuscht haben. Wer weiß, was dafür bezahlt worden ist, echt Erfahrungen können das nicht sein.",2,2016,10,21
59,Hotel encantador!,"Muy buena relacion calidad precio... Habitaciones muy bien equipadas y confortables...El desayuno excelente, completo y muy bien presentado, lo mismo que el restaurant... Realmente un placer... si vuelvo a ir a Barcelona, con gusto me volveré a alojar alli..",5,2016,10,19
59,Consigliato ,"Hotel in posizione ottima, ben collegato dai trasporti pubblici. Le camere sono accoglienti e pulite. Il personale è molto disponibile (grazie a loro ho potuto acquistare due biglietti per 'El Clàssic' nello stesso giorno dell'evento). Ho soggiornato nel mese di ottobre del 2012. Ci tornerei sicuramente. ",5,2016,10,19
59,Viaggio sorpresa,"Personale gentile e attento ci hanno consegnato la camera diverse ore prima del ceck-in, alla partenza hanno tenuto le valige sino alla sera,assolutamente consigliato. Letti comodi, mini bar ben fornito, esperienza positiva. l'hotel è in una posizione comoda per gli spostamenti per visitare la città, a 5 min c'è la fermata della metro sulla Diagonal.
Volendo si possono sfruttare la piscina piccola ma carina all'ultimo piano,la mini palestra e la sauna, e una bella vista sulla città. All'interno c'è una scala a chiocciola molto suggestiva.",4,2016,10,16
59,No me ha gustado la zona,"El hotel no esta mal, pero no está céntrico, para todo teníamos que movernos en taxi.
El desayuno es pasable y las habitaciones no son demasiado grandes. 

El personal del hotel es agradable. La proxima vez buscaré uno más céntrico",3,2016,10,13
59,Ottima Esperienza,"Sono appena rientrato da un we trascorso a Barcellona. Avevo visto diversi hotel sui siti specializzati ma alla fine avevo scelto questo hotel per il buon rapporto stelle/prezzo e non ne sono rimasto affatto deluso. 
L'albergo si trova in una zona tranquilla e ben frequentata con numerosi negozi bar e ristoranti nei pressi, molto ben collegato al centro e non solo. 
Il personale si è mostrato gentile e professionale e la camera sempre pulita ed ordinata (la nostra si affacciava sulla strada ed era luminosa).
Non ho mai fatto colazione e quindi non posso giudicarla, in definitiva sono rimasto molto contento del soggiorno e ci ritornerei",5,2016,10,10
59,Posizione ottima,"Ho soggiornato presso l'hotel Astoria 3 notti x viaggio di lavoro, la struttura è curata ma attenzione alle camere *20 e *23 (cioè 123,223 etc.. perchè hanno la finestra che si affaccia su un cavedio molto stretto quindi quelle ai piani inferiori sono molto buie e non passa l'aria.
Le camere sono piccole ma confortevoli e rinnovate da poco cosi come i bagni, unico difetto difficoltà di entrare nella vasca/doccia per chi ha qualche problema di movimento.
Il personale è gentile ed efficiente, la reception e il bar dove servono le colazioni sono molto curati con una mostra di disegni di Opisso.
La colazione è abbondante e varia sia nel dolce che nel salato.
posizione ottima a 5 min a piedi dalla fermata della Metro Diagonal, a piedi si raggiunge Paseo de Gracias con La Pedrera e Casa Battlo.",3,2016,10,07
59,Me encantó,"Hotel ubicado cerca de varias estaciones de metro, al lado de la calle Diagonal, puedes ir caminando perfectamente hasta la rambla. Cerca de la calle de gracia.

59,Magnifica colección de Opisso,"Encantador hotel que contiene una sorpresa en sus salas una magnífica colección de cuadros de Opisso.
Se puede desayunar, comer o cenar rodeado de sus magníficas y variadas obras. Además los miercoles puedes participar en la amena visita guiada que el director del hotel propone.",5,2016,09,21
59,Gute Wahl.,"Unser Zimmer war sehr geräumig und hatte einen sehr großen Kleiderschrank .Badezimmer sehr groß und jeden Tag sauber geputzt. Klimaanlage und Wlan sehr gut. Pool auf dem Dach für Abkühlung i.O. Leider sehr wenig Sitz- oder Liegemöglichkeiten.
Metrostation ""Diagonal"" L3 oder L5 ca. 10 min zu Fuss. Auch Sagrada Familia (25 min), Casa Mila und Casa Battlo (ca. 15 min.)
Im Hotel konnten die Tickets für den Hop-on-hop-off-Bus gekauft werden. Ansonsten sehr nettes Personal - von der Rezeption bis zu den Zimmerdamen.",4,2016,09,15
59,Amabilidad exquisita.,"Además de ser un hotel con un emplazamiento genial, las instalaciones están limpias y cuidadas con pulcritud.

El equipo humano tuvo un trato exquisito, facilitando en todo momento, que nuestra estancia fuera lo más agradable posible.

Gracias por hacernos sentir tan bien, espero volver en breve.",5,2016,09,12
59,Ottimo hotel ,"Ottimo hotel per la posizione centrale, in una bella zona, piena di ristoranti e locali. Il personale è molto attento al cliente, disponibile e cortese. La stanza è grande e lo stesso vale per il bagno. Ottima la pulizia. Ci tornerei senza dubbio!!! ",4,2016,09,06
59,NO!,"Hotel molto ben collegato, metro, taxi, autobus. Personale educato e gentile a parte casi isolati che, in questo caso, abbiamo incontrato non appena arrivati. Con circa mezz'ora di ritardo dall'arrivo previsto, avevano cancellato la nostra prenotazione, rifilandoci (forse approfittando della nostra inesperienza ed età) con scortesia una camera 100 euro più costosa e 100 volte peggiore di quella precedente: una finestra minuscola, una doccia scivolosa che, quando usata, allagava perennemente tutto il bagno, un condizionatore vecchio che al massimo della sua potenza non avrebbe raffreddato neanche uno sgabuzzino. Camera pulita sì  ma le cameriere che entrano nonostante il ""non disturbare"" alla porta sono inconcepibili. Inoltre, tutto ciò può essere anche sopportabile quando stai in giro tutto il giorno e torni lì solo per dormire o lavarti ma per una come me che ha avuto la sfortuna di ammalarsi (scoprendo anche che l'hotel era privo di un termometro) è davvero troppo. Quindi, sconsigliato.",2,2016,09,04
59,Hotel acogedor y bien ubicado,"Buen hotel, calido y confortable.
Habitaciones amplias y baños impecables. Muy buen desayuno y menu de medio dia estupendo. 
Muy buen trato del personal.

59,Breve vacanza,"Ci siamo fermati in questo hotel solo 2 notti. Siamo rimasti soddisfatti di questo soggiorno. L'hotel è bello, la camera era pulita e confortevole, anche se la nostra si affacciava su un cavedio interno. Molto apprezzata la piccola piscina dell'hotel all'ultimo piano, ideale per chi vuole rilassarsi un attimo prima di ripartire a visitare questa bella città. La zona è bella, signorile e ben frequentata, vicini alla metro, vicinissimo ad alcune delle principali opere di gaudi. Per la sera non ci sono tantissimi locali e ristorantini in zona ma ci si sposta senza nessuna difficoltà anche con la metro.",4,2016,08,24
59,Hospedaje,"El hotel es exquisito. Con líneas edilicias modernas. El lobbie y espacios de descanso ofrecen obras en exhibición de Ricard Opisso. Los pasillos de circulación son amplios y las habitaciones muy cómodas. Hay un piano de cola que invita a ser tocado, solo por especialistas. El hall de acceso a las habitaciones es amplio. Las escaleras de circulación también son amplias. El personal tiene muy buena predisposición y atienden con una sonrisa, desde el momento en que llegas, te hacen sentir como en casa. Detalles como encontrar al regreso de un dia agitado, un chocolate en la almohada, te hacen sentir especial. El frigobar ofrece una gran variedad de bebidas y golosinas y los precios no son desmedidos. El hotel está ubicado en una zona bellísima tanto de día como de noche. En la esquina hay un bar donde podes iniciar tu recorrido de ""tapas"".",5,2016,08,18
59,Super Hotel!,"Super Hotel! Sehr gut gelegen im Zentrum, Personal sehr freundlich! Zimmer sind zwar recht einfach aber schön eingerichtet! Bad vor allem ist sehr schön. Sehr sehr sauber!

59,Vacaciones,"Me he sentido como en casa gracias a la amabilidad que tiene todo el personal del hotel empezando desde el Sr Director, las habitaciones están muy bien puestas en orden  y limpieza, respetando también el descanso de los huéspedes, nos ha gustado mucho la colección de los cuadros de Opiso y pudimos apreciar la visita guiada q hace el Director para los clientes explicando sobre la colección, el desayuno y restaurante todo muy bueno diría yo excelente, solo toca agradecer a todo el personal  y estamos pensando repetir en un futuro",5,2016,07,31
59,Indecente,"Hotel non malissimo ma frequentato molto male confusione la notte, muri di cartapesta gente che urla ecc

59,Muy buen hotel... ,"La habitación del hotel es buena, lo que marca la diferencia es la atención de todo el personal. Con muy buen desayuno y bien ubicado. Vaya tranquilo.

59,En línea con la zona ,"Tras un estudio de los diferentes hoteles para poder pasar unos días de turismo en esta maravillosa ciudad, decidimos tener nuestro campo base en este establecimiento, el cual está cerca de todo lo más emblemático que poder visitar en una semana pateando (o no) Barcelona. 
Instalaciones bien cuidadas, personal increíble, limpieza impecable y atención sin nada que objetar. 
En cuestión calidad/oferta/precio muy recomendable, sabiendo que esta atrayente ciudad barata no es el mejor adjetivo para definirla. 
Lo suscribe un sevillano embelesado de Barcelona.  ",4,2016,07,17
59,Consigliato.,L'hotel si trova in un punto strategico della Città dove ti puoi muovere a piedi per visitare le principali meraviglie di Barcellona. Il ristorante offre un menù fisso o a scelta piuttosto buono. In alternativa nella zona ci sono buoni ristoranti e a 100 metri il ristorante la Tagliatella con cucina Italiana ottima.,4,2016,07,15
59,Muy buen hotel,"Es un hotel antiguo restaurado ,Muy bien ubicado cerca de la pedrera y la casa Baslo, es 3 estrellas ,pero la habitación es muy cómoda con una muy buena cama,buen colchón y unas almohadas increíbles Sri en total muy cómodas de plumas.el hotel cuenta con una pileta chica en la azotea ,un mini Gim y sauna no los utilice.el desayuno bien completo y la atención muy buena",4,2016,07,10

59,Buena ubicación y cosas a mejorar,"La ubicación es perfecta y en sí las instalaciones están bien. Deberían mejorar en cuanto a la TV en las habitaciones (demasiado pequeña), la conexión wifi y la ropa que cubre la cama. Sinceramente, tenía más expectativas del hotel.",3,2016,07,04
59,"Buon hotel, anche per la posizione","Siamo stati a Barcellona per un week end lungo. L'hotel è situato in una zona tranquilla, ma a due passi da alcune delle attrazioni più famose di Barcellona, per cui si riusciva spesso a girare a piedi. La camera è abbastanza funzionale, e silenziosa. Il menù serale (avevamo la mezza pensione) discreto (senza eccellere), a pranzo abbiamo anche approfittato del bar interno con discreta soddisfazione.",4,2016,06,28
59,Urlaub,"Zusammengefasst war es ein schöner Aufenthalt im Astoria Hotel .

Kritikpunkte :
- fehlende Toilettenbürste
- hellhörige Zimmer 
- Fenster zum "" Lüftungsschacht"" , kein Tageslicht 
- Bildqualität des Fernsehers verbesserungsbedürftig 
- Preise der Minibar nicht akzeptabel ( 0,25 l stilles Wasser kosten € 7,50 !!!) 
- Dachterrasse nur bis 20 Uhr offen 

Positiv:
- Frühstück immer frisch
- Auswahl Frühstück gut, auch wenn mit Schoko Creme / Frischkäse ergänzt werden könnte 
- zentrale Lage  
- freundliches Personal 
- saubere Zimmer 
",3,2016,06,23
59,In giro per ..... dormire,"Considerato che siamo a Barcellona dove gli hotel sono cari , questo mi sembra essere un buon compromesso. Quattro notti senza colazione , ""che non conviene fare a meno che non vi sia offerta nel prezzo del pernotto "" per 439 euro. Posizione centralissima , marmi , e parquet caratterizzano questa struttura in una posizione centralissima. Jacuzzi sul tetto con prendisole allietano il pernotto. Pulito. Consigliato.",3,2016,06,17

59,Es war gut!,"Im großen und Ganzen war es gut in diesem Hotel . Auf dem Dach befand sich der Pool . Dort waren einige Gehplatten locker und von dort konnte  man das fittendttufio erreichen was aber keins war . Msn hat dort nur einen Stepper und ein Rad gefunden . Das Frühstück war super . Zwar keine riesige Auswahl , aber dennoch frisch und lecker . Das Zimmer war klein aber fein .es fehlte an nichts .

Im großen und Ganzen war es dort sehr schön und das Personal war auch sehr hilfsbereit und nett .",3,2016,05,23
59,Buen hotel,"Estuve solo por una noche. El barrio es muy lindo, el hotel es un clásico, bien mantenido. La cama y habitacion es son comodas. Baño completo y amplio
Tienen muy buenos amenities de un hotel de 5 estrellas
Las habitaciones estándar no tienen el desayuno incluido, sale 12 euros y no es gran cosa, no recomiendo pagar por ello",4,2016,05,17
59,Un buen hotel para recomendar.,"Emplazado en la zona de L`Eixample, en un lugar un tanto apartado del ""ruido turístico"", pero bien conectado, ya que está a menos de 100 m de la avenida Diagonal y a unos 400 del Metro (estación Diagonal) y la emblemática Paseo De Gracia. La oferta gastronómica de los alrededores es muy variada y de diversas calidades. El edificio no es moderno, pero gracias a su estado de conservación y mantenimiento se pueden apreciar detalles constructivos y decorativos de gran valor. La habitación es cómoda y suficientemente espaciosa como para pasar una buena estancia, al igual que el modernizado cuarto de baño. El servicio de limpieza muy satisfactorio y la atención en recepción sumamente atenta y diligente. Para objetar quizás el costo de la habitación para un 3 estrellas,y el precio del desayuno (16,50 euros x persona), del que desistimos por supuesto, ya que a unos pasos del hotel en Garnier por 3 euros disfrutamos de una bollería genial. A pesar de esto último lo recomendaría y volvería.",4,2016,05,16

Il centro non e' vicinissimo ma si raggiunge a piedi con una passeggiata di circa 20 min oppure in metropolitana che e'vicino all hotel
L' hotel ha una splendida hall trattandosi di un edificio storico in stile liberty e la sala colazione e' altrettanto bella 
La colazione in se era buona con ricco.buffet ed inclusa nel prezzo
Camera un po piccola ma con tutti i confort, letti comodi e pavimento in parquet cosa che io gradisco piu della antiigienica moquette, silenziosa e wfi gratis e ben funzionante",4,2016,05,01

Ottima posizione, facilmente raggiungibile. È abbastanza vicino a Placa Catalunya (15 minuti a piedi al massimo) ed a pochi minuti dalla fermata della metropolitana. Ci sono diverse pasticcerie, un supermercato, una farmacia e qualche locale abbastanza frequentato nei dintorni. Prezzi adeguati. L'unica cosa su cui ho da ridire è il costo della prima colazione, a mio parere un po' eccessivo (se non sbaglio, 15€ a testa, al giorno). Ve lo consiglio! ",4,2016,04,27

No tienen restaurante para cenar y del desayuno no puedo comentar nada porque cuesta 15€ persona y día y la zona está llena de muy buenos sitios para desayunar bien y mucho más económico.

Camera sufficientemente spaziosa e pulitissima e letto comodo.Noi eravamo al settimo piano ed era silenzioso.

59,Estupendo,"Pasamos dos noches en este hotel de L'Eixample y quedamos encantados. Es uno de los mejores 3 estrellas en los que estuve nunca, por no decir el mejor. La habitación era pequeña y daba a un patio interior, pero para dos noches me daba igual. Mobiliario y decoración cuidados, limpieza impecable, cama cómoda... no tengo ni media queja. La piscina de arriba es un puntazo, pequeña pero lo justo para refrescarse, una pena que no todos los clientes respeten las normas, estando allí llegó una pareja con un niño y se pusieron a jugar con hinchables y pelotas y a romper todo el ambiente chill out del lugar, pero bueno, eso no es culpa del hotel. 
La decoración de las zonas comunes es vintage auténtica, súper agradable, con una exposición permanente en una de las salas de abajo. 
No tomamos allí el desayuno así que no puedo valorarlo.

La habitación, por lo menos en la que nosotros estuvimos, una doble matrimonial, era más bien pequeña, pero para el uso que le dimos, que era descansar y poco más era suficiente. Sin embargo, la habitación tiene cosas mejorables, en la nuestra tanto el lavabo, como la bañera no tragaban bien, y el agua quedaba estancada un buen rato hasta que se iba, la puerta del cuarto de baño estaba comida por abajo, dando una sensación bastante mala, no hay ningún espejo en la habitación aparte de el del cuarto de baño, aspectos que sin ser determinantes, nos parecieron destacables y que se pueden mejorar fácilmente.

59,"Excelente situacion, gente muy agradable.","Nos encontrábamos por la zona, y era la hora de comer, nos aconsejaron el hotel astoria. llegamos a la puerta y al entrar en el hall, entendimos el por que nos habían recomendado este restaurante. Nos encanto la arquitectura del hotel, muy elegante y acogedor. Desde el hall a los distintos salones en los que puedes admirar las distintas ilustraciones de Opisso, pasando por la majestuosa escalera que llama la atención ya desde la calle. La verdad que nos cautivo la gran colección de arte del pintor Ricardo Opisso que tienen expuesta permanentemente, de la cual pudimos disfrutar mientras comíamos en el restaurante. Te sientes como en casa y eso es de agradecer. Sin descuidar la inmejorable situación, justo al lado de la conocida diagonal y muy cerca también de la famosa rambla de catalunya. 
Sin duda recomendable 100 %.",5,2014,11,28
59,Excelente,"He realizado varias reuniones de trabajo y presentaciones en sus instalaciones. El ambiente, entorno y su ubicación son inmejorables. Su relación calidad precio lo hacen muy interesante y tanto el trato del personal como la comida son excelentes.
Repetiré seguro.",5,2014,11,28
59,Repetiremos,"Un hotel que nos sorprendio, por su clase y elegancia. Un servicio immejorable. La situacion es perfecta para visitar la ciudad. Nos encanto tambien una coleccion de arte de un gran pintor. El comedor tiene una arquitectura preciosa pero sobre todo una cocina muy exquisita. 
Lo recomiendo.",5,2014,11,27

Imperdibile la collezione di affiches e riproduzioni del pittore Opisso, che rendono estremamente piacevole attendere nella hall.
      
      ",4,2014,11,10
59,Ben posizionato...,"La posizione di quest'albergo è molto comoda perché molto vicino a Passeig de Gracia e alla parte sommitale della Rambla. In 10 minuti a piedi si raggiunge plaça de Catalunya. La zona è molto tranquilla e nelle immediate vicinanze ci sono diversi ristoranti, alcuni forni dove poter fare colazione e un supermercato aperto 24h. Le stanze non sono grandissime ma non sono nemmeno dei loculi, molto pulite e con un bagno comodo. L'unica avvertenza che posso dare in tal senso è di richiedere, se possibile, delle camere con vista sulla strada perché la finestra interna da su un pozzo di luce (per non dire di buio) che non vi aiuterà a capire se fuori piove o c'è il sole. La connessione wifi è gratuita e il personale molto cortese. Lo consiglio.
p.s. Cercate bene prima di prenotare perché spesso qui su tripadvisor si trova la camera in promozione con la prima colazione mentre in hotel mi hanno detto che i prezzi più bassi si trovano sul sito personale dell'albergo (cosa che però non ho verificato).",4,2014,11,06
59,Decepcionada,"Nos dimos una escapada en pareja y contratamos la HABITACIÓN SUPERIOR  por casi 170 euros la noche,  esperábamos tener el minibar  gratuito, vistas a la calle o por lo menos una cama de matrimonio, en la publicidad ofrecían incluso una terraza, y vistas a la calle,  pues nada más lejos de la realidad, nos metieron en una habitación de camas separadas, OSCURA, SIN SOFÁ, CON VISTAS A LA PARED DE UN EDIFICIO, cuando reclamamos nos metieron en otra más oscura aún pero que tenía sofá y cama de matrimonio, las vistas daban al muro de la parte baja de de edificio de enfrente y encima cuando abrías la ventana te encontrabas con la maquina de el aire acondicionado, nunca había visto peores vistas, casi me corté la pierna al entrar a la bañera con el mármol que estaba roto sólo lo habían colocado se soltó y casi me caigo,  durante la noche mi marido tubo que levantarse 4 veces a conectar  la luz en el cuadro eléctrico por que nos quedábamos sin luz ni aire, el minibar por supuesto no era gratuito. Elegimos este hotel por cercanía al centro, por que esperábamos algo mejor por el precio que se pagó,  pero desde luego no volveremos por que  nos arrepentimos de haberlo elegido.",1,2014,10,25
59,Entorno agradable y comida excelente.,"Estuve esta semana, como en otras ocasiones, en el restaurante del Hotel Astoria, y como siempre encontré la comida con gran variedad de platos, todos ellos muy bien presentados y cocinados con excelentes productos, servidos por un personal agradable y con trato muy cordial, siempre en el acogedor entorno del hotel.",5,2014,10,23

Non è centralissimo, però con la metro che è a pochi passi si possono raggiungere tutti i monumenti, musei e attrazioni varie. La colazione non l'ho presa perché è carissima € 15. Piscina pessima, sembra una vasca da bagno.",3,2014,10,21
59,Acorde a Hotel 3 estrellas,"Por motivos laborales me alojé con mi padre durante pocos días. El desayuno era buffet y tenía una gran variedad de cosas para elegir. La habitación era suficiente para nosotros, que sólo íbamos al hotel a dormir por la noche y pasábamos todo el día fuera. Las camas eran cómodas y el espacio bastante bueno. El baño era lindo y cómodo, pero por algún motivo algo en el material de su techo hacía que se hiciera mucho ruido al cerrar la puerta, lo cual era un pequeño problema si alguno de los dos íbamos al baño por la noche. La pileta es pequeña pero me pareció muy buena, al menos para darse un pequeño chapuzón después de pasar una larga jornada con mucho calor. El personal del desayuno era excelente, siempre atentos, incluso cargaban mi termo de agua caliente de forma gratuita y desinteresada. Mi primera impresión del personal de la recepción fue mala: mi padre hizo el check in primero y cuando entré yo nadie me preguntó jamás mis datos, lo cual me pareció muy extraño. Sin embargo, fueron muy cordiales a la hora de permitirnos dejar nuestras valijas cuando hicimos el check out (ya que nuestro avión partía por la noche). La ubicación me pareció muy buena, lo suficientemente cómoda para los lugares que yo necesitaba ir. Está a menos de 10 cuadras de donde sale el AeroBus para ir al aeropuerto. En resumen, la pasé muy bien, el resto fueron sólo detalles que no arruinaron para nada mi estadía en Barcelona.",3,2014,10,13

Definitivamente, volveremos",5,2014,10,11
59,Ottimo rapporto qualità/prezzo,"Per una vacanza di tre giorni con le amiche l'agenzia ci ha consigliato questo hotel. Non distante dal Passeig de Gracia e dalle case di Gaudì, si trova in una zona tranquilla e decorosa. Le stanze sono comode e pulite, fornite di televisione, climatizzazione, frigobar e set da bagno. Il personale è molto gentile e parla italiano. Buona anche la colazione, molto varia e servita in una deliziosa saletta al piano terra. Gli arredi e l'atmosfera sono molto gradevoli. Lo consiglio.",4,2014,10,02

59,Molto carino,"Ho soggiornato in questo hotel scegliendolo nonostante fosse un po' distante dal centro. Siamo stati molto bene, l'hotel è pulito, carino, non è nuovissimo ma è molto ben tenuto. Il personale è sempre stato cortese, parlano italiano e ci hanno fatto fare il check-in prima di quanto potessimo. (È alle 14, ma se hanno camere libere anche in mattinata ti permettono di farlo). C'è una terrazza con una piccola piscina che permette di passare un bel pre serata o anche di farsi un bagnetto dopo l'afa della città. In più se si prenota dal sito tramite tripadvisor è possibile usufruire della colazione compresa nel prezzo. Devi dire che questa cosa ha fatto la differenza nella scelta, ed è stata una buona scelta. Nè lontano nè vicino dalla metro, saranno 5 minuti a piedi dalla fermata più vicina e 10 dalla fermata Diagnal.",4,2014,09,05
59,Tranquilo y bien ubicado,"Estuve hace unos días en el hotel, la habitación tranquila y cómoda. La ubicación del hotel es buena, cerca a un metro, con restaurantes cerca, y a pocas cuadras de Paseo de Gracia. Además, el personal muy amable. Volvería a este hotel.",5,2014,08,31
59,Ottimo e molto pulito,"Soggiorno di coppia di una settimana, l'albergo e' molto bello e curato nell'architettura e nell'arredamento. La camera era molto ampia e luminosa il bagno funzionale e sempre pulito. Il personale alla reception e' davvero molto disponibile e conosce bene la città tanto che uno di loro (che prepara ottime sangríe al banco del bar per 3,50€) ci ha consigliato anche degli ottimi ristoranti per carne, pesce e paella! L'albergo e' a due isolati dal viale pieno di negozi che in 15 minuti a piedi porta a Plaza de Catalunya; in alternativa la piazza dVanti all'hotel e' ben servita dai taxi e si arriva facilmente ovunque.

59,Tranquilidad y bienestar,"Estuve con mi pareja el verano pasado y la estancia fue de lo más agradable. La habitación era bastante amplia y al ser interior era también de lo más tranquila. Lo que más me gustó fue que nos sorprendió no encontrarnos las defectillos que según algunos comentarios parecía tendría: había quien decía que no renovaban los amenities y lo hacían cada día, que habían sido objetos de mal trato por parte de los recepcionistas y el que tuvieron con nosotros fue inmejorable, que no limpiaban la habitación y lo hacían por la mañana y por la tarde...
La ubicación es muy buena, a unas pocas cuadrículas de Plaza de Cataluña y bien conectado con todo por bus y metro. Si volvemos a Barcelona no buscaremos otro hotel.",5,2014,08,21
59,Hotel muy correcto y bien ubicado,"Estuve en el hotel durante 4 noches y he de decir que no hemos tenido ningún problema en la estancia en el mismo y si alguna vez vuelvo a Barcelona no dudaría en repetir.
El hotel está ubicado cerca de la diagonal y cerca del famoso paseo de gracia barcelonés, a pocos minutos de la estación de metro de Diagonal por la que pasan un par de lineas que te dejan en el centro. El barrio es tranquilo y hay varios sitios en los que poder comer/cenar y además tiene a la vuelta de la esquina un supermercado y bastante cerca hay varios establecimientos que están abiertos 24 horas. 
La habitación es tranquila y cuenta con todas las comodidades que un hotel de esta categoría requiere, es decir la cama estaba bastante bien y cuentan con caja de seguridad y minibar. Un armario y cuentan con tv por satélite con varios canales de otros países. 
Lo que quizá si que creo que tendrían que mejorar es el baño ya que son un poco antiguos. 
El hotel cuenta con un personal muy amable que en todo momento nos ayudó en todo aquello que necesitamos. La única pega que pondría al hotel es que en nuestra reserva solicitamos que nos dieran una habitación con vistas a la calle y nos asignaron una con vista a un patio interior. El wifi va bastante lento y sólo permite conectar tres dispositivos.
El hotel cuenta con una piscina en la azotea que es más que suficiente para darse un chapuzón y refrescarse. El desayuno no lo puedo valorar ya que no lo teníamos incluido en el precio, y aunque podríamos contratarlo en la reserva al llegar al hotel nos lo ofrecieron al 50€",4,2014,08,10
59,Ottimo hotel,"Posizionato a 10 minuti dalla fermata metropolitana Diagonal, vicino alla fermata dei taxi hotel pulito , personale cordiale, qualita' prezzo imbattibile piscina all'aperto  con una bella vista dal terrazzo della città.

Repetiría sin duda y lo recomiendo a cualquiera que quiera disfrutar de una bonita terraza, en una de las calles céntricas más bonitas de la ciudad y cerca del centro comercial y turístico (paseo de gracia), una buena cena y un un perfecto y atento servicio. Sobretodo destacar que éramos un grupo muy grande y aún así el servicio y la comida fueron perfectos.

Pulito, elegante, con uno stile leggermente vintage!
Posizione centrale, rapporto prezzo/qualità ottimo, l'hotel vale più di tre stelle.
In zona c'è tutto e ci si possono godere sia le tante attrazioni della città sia la vita notturna di Barcellona facendo pochi passi.
Città da girare tranquillamente a piedi e scoprirne così ogni angolo, anche quelli più nascosti.",4,2014,07,06
59,Hotel consigliato,"Situato vicino ad Avenida Diagonal e a 5 minuti da Rambla de Catalunya, è comodo per raggiungere il centro città a piedi e durante il cammino ammirare le bellezze architettoniche che si incontrano sul percorso, fermarsi a visitare i molti negozi per lo shopping oppure per gustarsi tapas o altre specialità negli innumerevoli bar/ristoranti. Ho pernottato con mia moglie per tre notti dal 20/06 al 22/06 e ci siamo trovati molto bene. Camera pulita, bel bagno, cambio biancheria giornaliero, buon servizio. Personale gentile, cordiale, disponibile e qualcuno parlava anche un poco in italiano. Colazione dolce e salata a buffet non esagerata ma più che buona. Sicuramente lo consiglio a tutti coloro che cercano qualità/prezzo e confort.",4,2014,06,27

Recomiendo el hotel además x su cocina que es fabulosa, la ubicación del hotel es propicia para visitar muchos lugares hermosos turísticos diferentes a los que siempre recomiendan los guias lejos del conglomerado habitual de personas.
Definitivamente me volvería a repetir ya q cumple todas mis expectativas en comodidad, precio, atencion, y mas.

59,Buona struttura.,"Abbiamo pernottato all'Astoria per tre notti dal primo al quattro maggio. Le camere sono pulite ma un pò anguste, la nostra non aveva piatto doccia bensì una vasca da bagno alla quale bisognava accedere con un pò di fatica e con il rischio di scivolare ( mi chiedo come abbiano potuto fare delle persone anziane che facevano parte del nostro gruppo). Comunque, la struttura è vicina al Passeig de Gracia, alla stazione della metropolitana e, con una bella passeggiata ""una tantum"", a Piazza di Catalogna. Discreta la colazione; senza particolare ""menzione"" le uniche due cene che abbiamo consumato in ""loco"".",3,2014,05,12

Buen servicio, menu especial excelente ,muy bien atendidos y precio muy razonable.",5,2014,04,11
59,Todo correcto,"Un pelin alejado del centro, habitaciones muy bien, tranquilo. No me gustó que por las noches hay que llamar a un timbre como si fuera un hostal. Cumple su cometido. Se nota que es un hotel antiguo pero no está mal

59,Excelente en todos los aspectos!!!,"Estuve hospedada junto a mi esposo en el mes de septiembre, el hotel cubrió mis expectativas y más, el personal fue muy cordial, la habitación cómoda, limpia y ordenada, la comida fue de lo mejor, definitivamente me volvería a hospedar ahí en mi próxima visita, lo recomiendo plenamente!!!",5,2014,02,01
59,centrale,"L'hotel è un po datato ma pulito ed elegante. Il personale dell'albergo è gentile e qualcuno parla anche italiano. Le camere un po piccole c'è l'essenziale, purtroppo però ci sono capitate quelle sulla strada dove ci sono un paio di locali molto rumorosi.
 il bagno pulito, manca lo scopino che puo' sembrare stupido, ma non lo è. La colazione è abbondate e varia, si forse un po' cara ma pensare di fare colazione per strada per risparmiare pochi euro non vale la pena. la fermata della metro è la Diagonal  e la fermata dell'autobus è proprio di fronte all'hotel. Che dire tutto bene se non ci avessero rubato il portafoglio, Nel mc Donalds, non in albergo, anzi il personale ha cercato di aiutarci. Attenzione ai borseggiatori che a Barcellona sono abilissimi e ad ogni angolo.",4,2013,12,26

59,Ideal!,"Estuve a principio de mes en el hotel y la verdad es que quedé encantada! La ubicación me gustó mucho porque es una zona donde encontrás tranquilidad, y a la vez tenés todos los medios de transporte cerca para desplazarte hacia otras. 
A solo pocas cuadras de La Pedrera, Paseo de Gracia y La Rambla Catalunia! 
La atención es inmejorable, y el desayuno riquísimo! 
Muy recomendable para ir con amigos, solos o familia!",5,2013,12,13
59,UN RINCÓN PARA ESCAPAR DE LA GRAN CIUDAD,"A veces, los hoteles se contagian del barullo y la prisa de las grandes ciudades. Y buscas alguno que sea como un oasis donde refugiarte. Este establecimiento resulta muy recomendable. Elegante y algo anticuado en el buen sentido de la palabra. Sus salones de la planta baja están adornados con una buenísima colección de dibujos y pinturas de Utrillo. Siempre tranquilos, son un perfecto lugar de encuentro.
Los precios, sobre todo en las ofertas de baja temporada, son proporcionados. El servicio es atento y efectivo. Las habitaciones son cómodas, agradables y confortables. Recomiendo, eso sí, pedir las que dan a un patio interior. Se ahorra uno el ruido de la calle París, aunque sea a costa de un poco de luz. 
El precio no incluye el desayuno, que no es recomendable porque sale demasiado caro. Al lado mismo tenemos el tradicional bar París con todo tipo de bocadillos y pastas.
Siempre que he estado aquí me he sentido como en casa. Sin la frialdad de los grandes hoteles, ni el alboroto de los hoteles turísticos.",4,2013,12,09
59,Magnífico trato e inmejorable ubicación,"Es la segunda vez que voy en menos de 2 meses y seguro que repito. La ubicación es inmejorable y hay una amplia oferta de tiendas, ocio y restaurantes en pocas manzanas. Linea directa de metro hasta la estacion de Sants.",5,2013,11,25
59,Tranquilo y bien situado,"Elegí este hotel por su precio, categoría y situación en la ciudad cerca de los medios de transporte que me interesaban: FGC - metro (estación Provenza) y autobuses urbanos (Diagonal, Balmes…). La habitación, de uso individual, me resultó muy acogedora por sus pequeñas dimensiones, la decoración, el mobiliario, la buena cama. Al no estar en el hotel más que para dormir, no fue problema el que la ventana diera a un estrecho patio de luces, imagino que menos agradable aún para las habitaciones de los pisos inferiores. El buffet del desayuno me pareció un tanto básico. El personal, agradable. La ambientación de las zonas comunes, interesante y artística. En los alrededores del hotel hay gran variedad de bares y restaurantes.",4,2013,11,13
59,Recomendable!,"Nos alojamos en Agosto del 2013 en el Astoria de Barcelona. Un Hotel confortable donde el personal fue siempre muy cordial .

Aspectos Positivos: 

- Personal muy cordial.
-Tiene caja de seguridad
-Wifi Gratis
-Habitación Limpia 
-Bien ubicado. 
-Ascensor
-Aire acondicionado
-Zona tranquila para descansar 
-Lugares cercanos para comer, principalmente el bar París en la calle paris 187. Donde Era un bar de barrio pero bien atendido y cenábamos bien dos personas por : 15 o 20 euros.

Aspectos Negativos:

-La señal de wifi era débil en las habitaciones y para hablar por skype teníamos que ir al lobby.
-Esta a 10 o 12 cuadras de plaza Cataluña o de la Av. Passeig de gracia . La avenida nombrada anteriormente es una de las mas importantes en Barcelona donde hay muchas tiendas de las principales marcas de ropa y es muy pintoresca. Pero si bien el hotel se encuentra a 12 cuadras aprox de esta avenida. A solo 3 cuadras del Hotel puedes tomar un metro o subte para cualquier punto de Barcelona inclusive Passeig de Gracia.

En resumen:

Es Hotel cálido y cómodo y al no estar en pleno centro es posible lograr un muy buen descanso. Y a solo 3 cuadras del mismo esta la estación del metro donde se puede ir a cualquier punto de Barcelona .",4,2013,08,25
59,uno más!,"Destaco primero la excelente atención de Luis en particular, tambien buena atencion la de Mariela y Fernando.
Cuando ingresamos al hotel, lamentablemente, las personas mencionadas no fueron las que nos atendieron.
Aclaro, que el hotel estaba reservado y pagado por lo menos 3 meses antes. Y, cuando ingreso, una persona joven , y gordito, lo primero que hace es pedirme mi tarjeta de crédito. A lo que yo respondo , si no era suficiente con la constancia de pago.Vuelvo a aclarar, que ni siquiera dijo buen día, Lo primero fue , pedir la tarjeta. Entonces, le respondo que si le dejo mi tarjeta, el me debe dar un recibo, y que es la primera vez que me requieren la misma.
Entonces, aparece otra persona, para calmar las cosas, y dice , que esta mal expresado, que solo quiere mi numero de tarjeta, por si rompo algo.
Mi reserva era por 2 noches. 
Al segundo día, en el baño, no me cambian laS TOALLAS, NI TAMPOCO ME DEJAN LOS ""AMENITIS""
Hago el reclamo correspondiente, y me dicen que el hotel deja los amenitis el primer día.Por lo tanto, yo me quejo y digo que pagué por 2 días, no por uno. Y, a mi me corresponden los amenitis todos los días que yo pago, pues estan dentro del mismo importe. y, tambien me dan toallas nuevas.
Y, gracias a la intervencion de Luis, se solucionaron las cosas.
Pero, sostengo, que  no me tienen que hacer cuestiones en un viaje pago y de placer!
Nunca en un hotel , ni de Francia, España, Italia y Argentina , me ocurrió tal situación.",4,2013,08,07
59,Precio de 4 estrellas servicio y calidad de 2,"Me gustaría manifestar mi disgusto con mi estancia en el hotel. Más aún, después de una excelente reciente estancia el Hotel Gran Derby, lo que me había animado a escoger otro hotel de la cadena Derby Collection.
La atención a la llegada fue fría, distante y muy poco cordial, a diferencia de la recibida en el Gran Derby.
La habitación era minúscula. No creo que mida los 24 m que se publicita en la página web. Al ser un piso bajo (segundo) y dar a un patio interior la sensación de claustrofobia era tremenda Además daba a un patio y un piso muy bajo, lo que daba sensación de auténtica claustrofobia. 
La bañera era muy antigüa, con ducha tipo alcachofa que dificulta la limpieza si eres alto. La pila del lavabo estaba rota. 
Las zona de la piscina era correcta dado el poco espacio, aunque faltaba un servicio de toallas. !se había de utilizar la de la habitación !!
Como bueno es la ubicación, el bonito hall de entrada y el moniliario del dormitorio 
En definitiva, precio de 4 estrellas, servicio del personal y habitación de hotel 2 estrellas.
Lástima porque mi opinión de la cadena Derby se ha diluido después de la excelente impresión inicial",2,2013,07,28
59,Muy bueno,"El Hotel tiene una céntrica y estratégica ubicación, respecto de la cual tienes acceso en 10 minutos a pie a la Plaza de Catalunya, Las Ramblas, etc. Los precios del hotel son competitivos, dada su ubicación.
Aparte tiene alrededor, muchos restaurantes y tiendas, para aprovisionarte y completar el día. 
Se encuentra a pocas cuadras del paradero del bus turístico, lo cual permite hacer los tres recorridos y al final quedas cerca a tu hotel.

Muy bueno se los recomiendo!!!!",5,2013,07,05
59,Ottima scelta.,"Ho soggiornato in questo hotel dal 1 giugno al 3 giugno 2013.L'hotel si trova in una zona molto tranquilla,piena di bellissimi palazzi.Non è molto vicina al centro (placa Catalunya dista 30 minuti a piedi),e la metropolitana non è vicina,quindi abbiamo speso molto prendendo spesso i taxi.Però l'hotel è veramente bello:La camera molto moderna,bagno nuovissimo e pulito.All'ultimo piano c'è pure la piscina,anche se non ne abbiamo potuto usufruire causa mancanza di tempo.Non abbiamo usufruito della colazione perchè troppo cara,ma nelle vicinanze ci sono molti bar dove si può fare colazione a prezzi bassi.Nel complesso lo consiglierei.",5,2013,07,03
59,Tranquillo,"Molto ben locato in un quartiere vivace pieno di bei palazzi modernisti, vicino alla metropolitana e a vari ristoranti e bar. Bello anche l'edificio dell'hotel. Un po' cara la colazione a buffet ma molto buona.",4,2013,06,10
59,Ma.....,"Buona la colazione e le zone comuni carine . Camere nella media e tutto sommato sufficiente.
Scomodo il quartiere troppo lontano dal centro a piedi.
Consiglio sotto la diagonal principale x potersi muovere comodamente a piedi e x essere nella morbida di Barcellona con ristoranti aperti e ampia scelta",3,2013,05,30
59,Fascino austero.,"L'hotel è elegante e pulito. Ha un suo fascino austero. Molto bella la Hall arredata con delle bellissime stampe. 
La scelta per la colazione non è molto ampia ma c'è da mangiare a sufficienza. Nel complesso un buon posto dove alloggiare (anche se all'arrivo accertatevi che la colazione sia inclusa, altrimenti dovete pagare 12€ e non ne vale la pena. Dietro l'angolo ci sono diversi bar e pasticcerie).",3,2013,05,29
59,non male ......,"Visto le sue 3 stelle, la posizione e il prezzo possiamo dire che è un buona struttura di riferimento. Situato in una zona adiacente alla diagonal, nn lontano dal centro. I taxi sono a 20 metri dall'Hotel, mentre per la metro ( stazione Diagonal) dista circa 400 metri. La hall è un pò vecchiotta come gli spazi comuni ma le camere sono ben arredate, sobrie e discretamente spaziose, inoltre sono pulite e danno all'interno ma sono luminose, il bagno ha il bidet non ha finestre ...... attenzione alla scivolosità della vasca quando fate la doccia !!!! L'isolamento acustico tra le camere potrebbe essere migliorabile. Non abbiamo provato la colazione in quanto in zona ci sono delle ottime pasticcerie. Personale gentile. A pochi metri ci sono dei locali notturni tra cui 1 discoteca adiacente alla stuttura e dei night club ........ basta attraversare la strada. Non male il rapporto qualità prezzo. Non abbiamo usufruito della piscina.",4,2013,05,13
59,Ottimo come punto d'appoggio,"Il punto forte è l'ubicazione, si trova all'inizio della Rambla in alto poco prima dell'arteria Avenida Diagonal; quindi con pochi passi si discende la Rambla, agevolmente a piedi si raggiunge anche Casa Pedrera. Confermo tutto quanto descritto dalle precedenti recensioni, ovvero che le stanze danno sul cortile interno senza vista esterna (ma francamente la città l'ho voluta vedere girandola non dalla finestra dell'hotel), ed anche il costo eccessivo delle colazioni, 14€, a noi hanno offerto le colazioni a 8€, si tratta di colazioni internazionali con buffet niente male; chi invece non può rinunciare alla colazione italica può recarsi nei bar della zona che offrono cornetto ed espresso a 2€. Aggiungo come nota positiva la gentilezza e disponibilità del personale e che nella hall a qualunque ora ci presentassimo, parlavano tutti italiano.",3,2013,05,12
59,"Posizione, colazione e rapporto qualità/prezzo","Ottimo tre stelle in ottima posizione per visitare Barcellona. A 2 passi dalla via Diagonal, dal metro e col taxi (ottimo servizio ed economico a Barcellona) di fronte all'Hotel.Fa' della colazione il suo punto forte, paragonabile ad un 4 stelle. Internet free nella hall.Piccola spa all'attico.Le camere sono pulite e ben arredate con mobilio elegante, un pò rumorose quelle su via Paris.Ottimo il rapporto qualità/prezzo, facendo gli opportuni paragoni.Unico neo trovato (almeno per la camera 625), la pericolosità, per la scivolosità, della doccia inserita nella vasca.Il voto di eccellenza é per il mix delle cose positive che ho indicato (posizione, servizi, colazione,prezzo). CONSIGLIABILISSIMO.",5,2013,05,10
59,Pretenden ser mas de lo que dan. No lo recomiendo,"Hotel bien ubicado. En un lindo barrio. Cerca de la rambla. Linda la planta baja.
La habitación demasiado pequeña, un pañuelo. Totalmente interna. Imposible ver un cm de cielo.
Te sentias totalmente encerrado y alejado del mundo. Entre la calefacción asfixiante y la ventana por la que era imposible ver el cielo, no sabias como vestirte. Tenias que bajar hasta la calle para enterarte si hacia frio, calor, llovia o nevaba.
Respecto del wifi, nos dijeron que incluía solo una clave de wifi por habitación. Yo me pregunto, la habitación es doble, pago por 2 personas, me cobraron 2 tasas de alojamiento, porque me entregan una sola clave wifi?? no se supone que 2 personas van a tener 2 dispositivos.
En la terraza tienen un sauna que parece ""el sauna del terror"", da miedo entrar ahi.
En fin, detalles de quienes quieren parecer un gran hotel pero no lo son.
A favor, ubicación, limpieza y el lobby. 
Por lo demás no lo recomiendo.",3,2013,04,11
59,Una base sicura e confortevole.,"E' un albergo di ottimo livello ad un prezzo assolutamente concorrenziale. Le stanze sono ben arredate con mobilio sobrio ma elegante, La posizione è buona, a poca distanza dalle stazioni metro Diagonal e Provenca. Le stanze interne danno su un pozzo luce e quindi niente visuale, ma in compenso sono silenziose. Unica nota stonata, la rumorosità del personale di servizio già dalla mattina presto e un fastidioso odore proveniente dal pozzetto del bagno che si è manifestato a vacanza quasi conclusa e quindi abbiamo soprasseduto. Internet a disposizione nella reception. 
Bel terrazzo con piscina, sicuramente da frequentare..peccato la stagione non lo permettesse.",4,2013,02,28
59,exquisito,"Un hotel en pleno centro de Barcelona, tranquilo y para estar en una calle tan céntrica no hay ningún ruido , el ambiente es muy relajado. 

El personal muy atento y amable. Lo que mas me ha impresionado es poder disfrutar de una colección excepcional de Opiso.

Lo recomiendo a todo el mundo incluso a los barceloneses , ya que si viviera en Barcelona ,seguro que sería un lugar en el que reunirme con mis amigos ,",5,2013,02,27
59,Hotel Astoria - gut!,"Das Hotel liegt relativ zentral im Stadtteil Eixample. Ca. 400 m entfernt liegt die Metrostation Diagonal. Das Hotel ist insgesamt in einem guten Zustand. Die Zimmer sind zweckmäßig eingerichtet und sauber, allerdings war unser Zimmer ziemlich klein. Das Frühstücksbuffet war gut uns ausreichend. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Kein WLAN. Der Ausblick von der Dachterrasse mit kleinem Pool mit Blick auf die Stadt Barcelona ist toll, allerdings nicht rund um die Uhr zugänglich.",4,2012,12,27
59,Consigliatissimo,"L'albergo ci ha accolto alle 2,00 di notte, dopo un problema con un B&B li vicino, sono stati gentilissimi e ci hanno fatto pagare anche un bel po' di meno rispetto il prezzo di listino!!
Sarò sempre grata al portiere notturno perchè ci ha salvato la vacanza!! 
La posizione è buonissima, pulitissimo, potrebbe essere tranquillamente un 4 stelle!!",5,2012,12,16
59,Scelta ottimale per visita alla città,"Molto buono per posizione e struttura, personale gentile, prezzo adeguato. Unica nota negativa, la camera singola da me occupata con finestra con vista su.... un muro in cemento armato a tre metri. Per tutto il resto, consigliabile senza riserve.",4,2012,11,10
59,"OTTIMO HOTEL, BUONA POSIZIONE, OTTIMO RAPPORTO QUALITA'/PREZZO!","Ottimo hotel, ubicato in una zona tranquilla e ricca di bei negozi, bar e numerosi ristoranti. La metro di Diagonal è la più vicina e dista circa 300/400 m.
Il personale è efficiente e sempre disponibile ma non molto loquace (visto anche l'alto numero di ospiti), la pulizia ottima e l'ambiente quasi elegante.
La nostra camera con finestra interna (cieca) era molto ampia e ben arredata, il bagno grande e dotato di vasca/doccia ed anche bidet (!), tutto sempre in ordine e pulito (abbiamo visto che i pavimenti vengono disinfettanti con varechina), sono presenti tutte le dotazioni come phon, frigobar, tv con rai1, aria condizionata, manca solo una cassaforte in camera (anche se è disponibile in reception).
La colazione (compresa nella tariffa della camera) abbastanza varia e di buona qualità, forse ci sarebbe solo bisogno di aumentare il numero dei tavoli disponibili....

Insomma tutto OK e hotel da consigliare, gli unici lati negativi (se così li vogliamo definire) possono essere la scarsa insonorizzazione delle camere, in particolare quando i tuoi vicini di stanza hanno l'abitudine di fare la doccia alle 6 del mattino; la mancanza di una finestra che dia sull'esterno; e la connessione WiFi in stanza che è gratuita solo per 90 minuti consecutivi al giorno.

Spero di esserVi stato utile, CIAO!",5,2012,11,03
59,Comodo ed  elegante,"La posizione centrale dell' Hotel Astoria facilita gli spostamenti dentro e fuori la città sia che visitite  la città con  o senza auto.

59,para volver!,"Encontre este hotel gracias a esta pagina y he de decir que ha sido una estancia absolutamente maravillosa. El personal del hotel atento y encantador en todo momento; la habitación era interior y nada ruidosa. La única pega que pondría es que la alcachofa de la ducha no se podía mover y según la altura que tengas se queda un poco baja.
El desayuno también perfecto, además nos hicieron una oferta muy buena.
Ha sido uno de los mejores hoteles en los que he estado.",5,2012,10,16
59,hotel consigliatissimo,"ottima la posizione di questo hotel, il quartiere è molto signorile, vicino a Passeig de Gracia dove ci sono i più bei negozi di Barcellona e le famose case di Gaudì. Vicino alla fermata di metro Diagonal. Personale molto gentile, camera pulita, bagno con vasca, letto comodo. L'unica pecca è stato avere la camera vista muro ma abbiamo riposato stupendamente! non abbiamo provato la colazione perchè avevamo solo il pernottamento e ci siamo deliziati delle prelibatezze di un forno con bar poco più sotto.",4,2012,10,07

Dista a due fermate della metro da Plaza Catalunya, centro nevralgico da cui spostarsi per ogni dove o per una passeggiata sulla Rambla. Il personale dell'hotel è stato molto disponibile e cordiale. Il bagno non è il massimo in quanto non ha un buon riciclo d'aria. Purtroppo il prezzo pagato ad Agosto non corrispondete ad un tre stelle.",3,2012,08,31

59,Magnífica ubicación y agradable estancia,"Nos decidimos por este hotel por su magnífica ubicación--céntrico y a la vez tranquilo, a tres calles del Paseo de Gracia y Diagonal, y a un paso de bares, restaurantes y pequeño comercio de calidad.  Además, el metro está a cuatro calles y se llega bastante rápido a Sants.  La relación precio-calidad en el paquete que conseguimos estuvo muy bien--109 euros la noche por una habitación doble, con desayuno incluido.  Nuestra habitación era muy espaciosa, con muebles sobrios y bien mantenidos, con un cuarto de baño de amplio, y una limpieza inmejorable.  Al tratarse de una habitación interior, era bastante oscura, pero no nos molestó ya que pasamos los días fuera.  El buffet de desayuno estuvo bastante correcto, con una buena selección de frutas, cereales, embutidos, panecillos.  El hotel cuenta, en el octavo piso, con tres bicicletas estáticas en una habitación acristalada, y una pequeña piscina.  Las vistas son muy bonitas. Hay una zona de wifi en el lobby y un ordenador disponible para los huéspedes.  El personal del hotel es muy amable.  Un hotel muy recomendable. SIn duda repetiremos.",4,2012,07,10
59,IDEALE PER UN FINE SETTIMANA A BARCELLONA,"Ci sono stata circa tre anni fa, e devo dire che l'ho consigliato ad altri amici, che dopo qualche tempo hanno scelto l'hotel per il loro primo viaggio a Barcellona. Troverete comodità e  centralità dell'hotel, pulizia, e stanze moderne e molto carine e ancora, estrema gentilezza del personale. Quando ho soggiornato io, la colazione non era inclusa, ma sulla strada dell'hotel ci sono numerosi posti dove fare colazione, e dove la sera, se siete stanchi, potete decidere di mangiare. Inoltre, l'hotel si trova in una stradina tranquilla, praticamente a due passi da diagonal, dove ci sono tantissimi negozi e ristoranti e da lì, con circa 10-15  minuti di cammino a piedi si arriva in centro. Inoltre il posto è strategico, perchè ben collegato con metro (diagonal) ed autobus. Inoltre, se avete il volo la sera, vi tengono gratuitamente in deposito le valigie. Ah, tre anni fa la stazione taxi era proprio fuori l'hotel... Ricordo che quando ho soggiornato (marzo), l'hotel era pieno di uomini di affari (americani, russi, spagnoli), che probabilmente stavano lì per lavoro..",5,2012,07,04
59,nella media,"Non abbiamo scelto noi l'albergo ma era inserito in un pacchetto della Boscolo.Hotel molto bello nella hall in cui ci sono dipinti e stampe incredibili.

59,Insomma...,"La posizione dell'hotel è abbastanza buona, zona tranquilla, anche la sera, la nostra stanza era  piccola, con una finestra inutilizzabile che dava su un buco che sarà stato 2metri X 2.
sul sito dell'hotel c'è la possibilità di acquistare la colazione, che non abbiamo preso, quando siamo arrivati ci hanno chiesto se eravamo interessati, e dopo che abbiamo rifiutato ce l'hanno offerta in promozione a metà prezzo. Noi abbiamo rifiutato anche questa, ma il comportamento non è molto professionale. Subito fuori dall'albergo c'è un forno con delle colazioni buonissime.",3,2012,05,23
59,Signor tre stelle,"Ho soggiornato in questo albergo con la mia famiglia (2 bimbi 5 e 7 anni) durante il periodo di Pasqua e devo dire che é filato tutto liscio. 
Colazione abbondante, bagno grande con finestra (una rarità), suggestiva vista di Barcellona dall'alto (eravamo all'8^ piano). Persino il letto non era male (in genere sono molto critica su questo punto).
Zona tranquilla, residenziale ma centrale, con molti ristoranti e negozi nelle vicinanze e a 5 minuti a piedi dalla fermata di metro Diagonal.
Ottimo rapporto prezzo / qualità.",4,2012,04,17

Camere spaziose, silenziose, bagno più che grande e comodo, letti comodi, TV con canali di tutti i paesi europei, frigo bar pieno di ogni cosa. Postazione internet nella hall.
La nostra stanza al settimo piano disponeva anche di un ottima visione esterna.
Personale cortesissimo, parla anche italiano, colazione piena di ogni cosa (dolce, salato).

2. Das freundliche und teilnahmsvolle Personal im Hotel. Haben alle unsere Wünsche bei der Panzerung berücksichtigt.
3. Die leckeren und vielfältigen Frühstücke.

59,Un buon hotel 3* in un elegante quartiere di Barcellona,"Posizione
L’hotel si trova all’Eixample, un bel quartiere residenziale, a distanza percorribile a piedi dalla Pedrera di Gaudì. La Metrò Diagonal dista circa 400mt. Il parcheggio dei taxi è sotto l’hotel.

Struttura Hotel
L’hotel è un edificio storico di inizio ‘900, un classico liberty molto bello. La hall è abbastanza imponente, con porte a vetri in legno all’ingresso, lampadari e specchi antichi e una bellissima scala a chiocciola che consente di salire ai piani in alternativa all’ascensore. All’interno c’è anche una mostra permanente di Ricard Opisso, artista e illustratore bohemien, niente male.
L’hotel dispone inoltre di un terrazzo all’ultimo piano, dove trova spazio una piscina veramente piccola, alcune sdraio e tavolini sotto gli ombrelloni. Nel complesso un piacevole luogo per un breve relax serale.

Camere
Premetto che io avevo prenotato, con 3 mesi d’anticipo, una camera quadrupla e all’arrivo mi sono trovata una normale tripla. Però il personale dell’hotel è stato gentile e abbastanza veloce nel risolvere il disguido. Ci è stata data un’altra stanza, che non era una quadrupla, ma una tripla con un’anticamera abbastanza grande da poterci alloggiare un letto singolo.
La camera è risultata pulita, l’arredamento un po’ vecchiotto, in legno scuro; il letto matrimoniale comodo, i letti singoli dei bambini un po’ meno. Il bagno grande, però con vasca da bagno e tenda da tirare per fare la doccia. 
L’unica nota veramente negativa è che l’hotel è mal insonorizzato, per cui trovandosi su una strada a scorrimento veloce il rumore era abbastanza fastidioso e continuo per quasi tutta la notte, anche se eravamo al 6° piano.

Colazione
Non abbiamo usufruito del ristorante, in quanto la colazione veniva proposta a buffet a 14€ a testa. Proprio fuori dall’hotel, oltre a bar per tutti i gusti, c’è anche un forno con annessa caffetteria, dove si possono gustare deliziosi croissant, seduti all’aperto in un piacevole angolo semi-pedonale.

In conclusione
Un valido hotel 3 stelle, con un buon rapporto qualità-prezzo! Nel complesso niente male.",3,2011,04,13
59,posizione ottima e hotel confortevole,"Ho soggiornato in questo hotel per 3 notti insieme al mio compagno e ad una coppia di amici. 
Tanti gli aspetti positivi: 
La posizione è davvero strategica, la strada è parallela alla diagonal e a 5 minuti appena dalla fermata della metro. Si raggiunge la Sagrada Familia con 2 fermate di metro e per raggiungere la Placa de Catalunya si può optare sempre per la metro (2 fermate) oppure per una bella passeggiata a piedi (saranno 20minuti o qualcosa in più  ma ne vale la pena, si percorre Passeig de Gracia dove si trovano la Pedrera, Casa Battlò e tanti tanti negozi!!!!).
L'albergo è stata una piacevole sorpresa! all'inizio eravamo scettici tante recensioni buone e tante meno buone che lo descrivevano come un posto piccolo, non pulito e buio e per questo motivo al momento della prenotazione abbiamo specificato di volere la camera matrimoniale come quella rappresentata nelle foto dell'hotel; COSì E' STATO.... camera e bagno non molto grandi ma moderni e puliti; ogni giorno ci davano nuovi bagnoschiuma, shampoo, saponetta e crema corpo e sul cuscino anche un piccolo cioccolatino. 
( non abbiamo fatto colazione in albergo quindi non posso dire nulla sul cibo)
Il personale è stato molto cortese dandoci informazioni su come raggiungere i vari posti di interesse e su eventuali richieste. 
Siamo rimasti davvero soddisfatti!

ps. per la cena raccomando il Marisco (il pesce è davvero buono) e la Flauta (per quanto riguarda tapas e dolci!).",4,2011,04,11
59,ABBASTANZA INSODDISFATTA!,"Buona la posizione perché si raggiunge il centro molto facilmente e a piedi. L’aspetto esterno dell’elbergo è discreto e gli spazi comuni (il salotto all’entrata e la sala colazione) sono dignitosi. Non altrettanto posso dire della mia stanza: piccola, buia, con arredo molto vecchio e poco funzionale. Inoltre la finestra dava su un cortile interno (di fronte al quale c’era un’altra costruzione) quindi l’aria non correva proprio. La stanza da bagno(senza finestre!) era un po’ maleodorante. Assolutamente non all’altezza di un quattro stelle! Le foto del sito inoltre sono più belle della realtà!!! Positiva è stata la disponibilità del personale della reception.",2,2011,03,19
59,ne si ne no,"L'hotel è situato in una bellissima zona di Barcelona. Avevo acquistato la camera già da tempo e a un prezzo scontato. La camera non era delle migliori come vista, anzi veramente scadente, primo piano che davano nel cortile interno verso un ripostiglio o non so' cosa, ma in compenso era molto silenziosa. 
La pulizia a un primo impatto sembrava buona, ma il bagno puzzava di muffa e sorpresa delle sorprese, nella tazza del water c'era uno scarafaggio morto di 3/4 cm che galleggiava nell'acqua. Insomma non molto piacevole.",2,2011,03,16
59,Un clásico modernizado,"Al entrar en el hotel te recibe un amplio hall con cierto toque modernista, como corresponde al barrio, rodeado de varios salones decoradores con interesantes dibujos y pinturas. Al fondo, los ascensores y una preciosa escalera de caracol que sube a los dormitorios.
Nuestra habitación fue la 715. Dos camas, dos mesillas, mueble con la TV, un escritorio, un amplio armario... Nos pareció fantastico la cantidad de espacio para guardar la ropa y cualquier cosa que lleves, todos son puertas y cajones. También muy buena idea la puerta corredera que cierra la habitación y la separa de la entrada y el baño, lo que aisla de los sonidos. Las camas muy cómodas, y la iluminación muy buena. Las vistas no tanto, daban a una zona interior muy amplia, pero sin nada que ver.
El baño también amplio, con buena encimera de marmol. Lo único malo que olía bastante a tuberías.
No hay que perderse el ático, con tumbonas, sombrillas, mesas y un piscina ideal para refrescarse un día de calor.
Está cerca del metro de Diagonal, y hay bastantes bares y cafeterías alrededor. Recomendable el Bar París y su pan con tomate....",3,2011,03,15
59,Mala insonorización de la ventana,"Estuve en el hotel TripAdvisor el pasado 5 de marzo, en concreto en la habitación 326, que da hacia la calle París. Es curioso este dato, ya que había pedido en la reserva una habitación que diese hacia el interior, pero bueno. El caso es que el hotel es el típico edificio que se nota que ha sido señorial (con escalera de mármol en forma de caracol, pasillos amplios, suelo de la habitación de buena calidad), pero cuyo mantenimiento se ha abandonado bastante en los últimos años. Es decir, que fue, pero ya no es.

En concreto, en la habitación, cuya publicidad pone que está insonorizada, se oía cada coche que pasaba por la calle, ya que la ventana (de doble cristal) cerraba mal, la caja de la persiona tenía grietas, etc. El teléfono no funcionaba (el de la habitación) y cuando preguntamos qué pasaba dijeron que eran cosas del mantenimiento. La caja fuerte de la habitación estaba suelta (podías meterla en la maleta y llevártela contigo) y, para más colmo, cuando preguntamos en recepción por la llave de la misma (era de llave) dijeron que la habían perdido, que dicha caja fuerte no se podía usar, pero que el hotel era razonablemente seguro y que no había habido robos desde que recuerdan.

Como dato positivo comentar que el colchón era bueno y la cama cómoda, la habitación amplia, y tenía doble puerta (la de la entrada y otra más interior) que aislaba del ruido del pasilo, lo malo es que el ruido inmenso de la calle París no había forma de aislarlo. Tocó dormir dos días con tapones en los oídos.",2,2011,03,09
59,"Nella media, con qualche disservizio","Hotel con posizione strategica, a pochi passi dal Paseig de Gratia. La hall si presenta molto bene, ma le camere sono piccole, anche se ben arredate. La pulizia lascia a desiderare, come anche l'isolamento acustico delle camere. Diciamo che non consiglierei questo albergo a chi ha il sonno leggero! Internet disponibile, ma gratuitamente solo nella hall, nella camere è a pagamento, tranne la prima ora che viene gentilmente offerta dall'albergo. E per finire, per avere il foglio di check-out, ho dovuto spiegare cosa fosse.",3,2011,02,26
59,decepcionante,"Escribimos esta crítica para recomendaros que jamás entréis en este hotel si vais con alguna oferta de internet, el resultado será el que tuvimos nosotros: una habitación de cinco metros cuadrados (no exagero), bastante sucia y con vistas a un patio interior de unos tres metros cuadrados (y tampoco exagero). NO hay wifi excepto en el hall del hotel pero ¿es eso normal en un hotel de 4 estrellas? El personal dista mucho de ser amable y cercano, más bien es distante y altivo. Jamás volveremos a este hotel aunque suponemos que si vas sin oferta te darán un trato y una habitación mejor. No obstante, no es nuestro problema que pongan ofertas en internet ¿por qué después te tratan mal si las aceptas? Trato vergonzo, no lo recomendamos. El Astoria es un hotel de tres estrellas con pretensiones de cuatro.",2,2011,02,04
59,nella media,"dalle foto del sito mi aspettavo di meglio: la mia stanza era un buco e la finestra dava sull'interno di una tromba e nemmeno vedevo il cielo fuori! il bagno era senza finestra e i sanitari poco curati: tutto sommato ci si può stare, ma è troppo costoso rispetto a quello che offre.",3,2011,01,14
59,"Tranquillo, comodo ....","Tranquillo, comodo, estrema disponibilità e gentilezza del personale. Abbastanza centrale (circa 5/10 min con i mezzi), pulito, rapporto qualità / prezzo buono.",4,2011,01,04
59,"gute Lage, Sauberkeit mangelhaft, nur knapp zu empfehlen","Zu erst wurde mir ein Zimmer in schlechtem Zustand zugewiesen (alt, Schimmel im Bad..) AM nächsten Tag konnte ich wechseln. Ich hatte die Wahl zwischen einem Zimmer zum Innenhof, neuer renoviert, aber klein und wenig Licht und einem Zimmer zur Strasse (älter, dafür grösser und sonnig) Ich entschied mich für letzteres. Aber trotzdem: Schimmel in den Badezimmerfugen, Sauberkeit im Zimmer nur oberflächlich: Die Minibar traf ich stark verschmutzt an  (siehe Bilder) und sie wurde in meinem Aufenthalt von 10 (!) Nächten nie gerinigt. Steckdosen mit gelb-braunem Belag... Es hat ein ""Fitnessraum"" Mit 2 Hometrainern und einem Stepper in fraglichem Zustand. Gefallen hat mir die Lage, das Personal war freundlich (auch als ich mich wegen dem Zimmer beschwerte) gratis Wifi (aber laaangsame Verbindung)",3,2010,11,30
59,Un hotel en consonancia con la bella ciudad,"Todo fue excelente, desde la llegada, pues la amabilidad del personal da gusto. Muy bien decorado y acogedor. Y superlimpio. La habitación no tenía vistas, pero nos ahorramos así el posible ruido que pudiera llegar desde la calle. Era muy bonita, elegante y espaciosa, con una cama inmensa y cómoda. La única pega es que la foto de la piscina de la azotea nos engaña, parece enorme, y realmente es una bañera grande. Si la convirtieran en jacuzzi sería muy buena idea.",4,2010,11,16
59,Excelente,"Me  encanto, buena  atención  muy   buena  ubicación  lo recomiendo 100%",5,2010,10,22
59,TRATO FAMILIAR Y UBICACION PERFECTA EN LA CIUDAD,"-Visita de turismo, aunque ya conocía Barcelona, el hotel esta muy bien situado, en zona céntrica comercial, fuera del bullicio típico del casco antiguo (ramblas, plza. Cataluña, etc). trato muy amable por parte de recepción y buenas recomendaciones para visitar la ciudad. la entrada del hotel y la exposición de Opisso dan un aire de hoteles de mayor categoría. ¡¡ por cierto la piscina es genial para refrescarse y mi hijo disfruto muchísimo !!! próximas vacaciones casi seguro que si encuentro alguna oferta repetiremos en el mismo hotel.",4,2010,09,26
59,"Buon albergo, ma non vi aspettate troppo.","Piccolo ma discreto albergo vicino al cenro di Barcelona, metro' a 5 minuti, plaza Catalunya a 10 min in autobus o 5 metro' +5 autobus. Ottima posizione lontano dal traffico.
Colazione molto buona. Struttura rimodernizata recentemente. Stile: antico. Prezzi: abbastanza buoni. Assistenza clienti: molto buona. Camere pulite. Piscina: lasciate perdere e' un buco di 3x3 mt, per le papere sarebbe ottima...Altri servizi: WIFI gratuito (ma difficile connetersi gia' al secondo piano, solo al primo piano e alla hall funzionava bene) e 2 PC al primo piano con internet con accesso gratuito. Attrazioni x bambini: NIENTE. Hall piccolissima senza TV, 2 sofa' in mezzo alla hall, con 1 tavolino ma senza nulla a fianco. (E che ci fa uno? Ci schiaccia un pisolino sopra dopo la colazione???)
In generale: Albergo molto semplice ma pulito e personale cordiale.
Attenzione ai consigli di un assistente alla reception (non mi ricordo il nome) per dove mangiare: Ci ha spediti in un ristorante vicino ultra caro e con cibo scadente, vedete mia review: petit paris barcelona. E il bello e' che appena 1 minuto prima ci eravamo lamentati che a Barcellona era difficile trovare buoni ristoranti a buon prezzo...
Attenzione al conto finale: mi erano stati addebitati 6 euro extra per un qualcosa mai ricevuto. Cifra sottratta con tante scuse.",3,2010,08,21
59,Muy recomendable: ¡Excelente hotel!,"Viajamos a Barcelona en pleno agosto de 2010 y conseguimos este magnífico hotel por 90€ noche (doble alojamiento y desayuno). Las instalaciones son magníficas, mejor que muchos 4 estrellas a pesar de tener oficialmente 3, cómodas, nuevas, elegantes... El personal de trato amble y muy correcto. El desayuno excelente en calidad...
 En fin una opción magnífica por relac ión calidad-precio a lo que hay que sumar su tranquila a la vez que céntrica ubicación, junto a la Diagonal y cercana a Rambla Cataluña y Paseo de Gracio.",4,2010,08,16
59,HOTEL MARAVILLOSO,"Durante mi estancia en el Hotel Astoria todo fue perfecto.
La limpieza de la habitación era perfecta, Los empleados eran todos muy amables y seviciales se nota que son profesionales cualificados y con experiencia .
La ubicación es perfecta para placer y negocios esta ubicado en una barrio céntrico y comercial pero a un paso del centro histórico.
La relación calidad precio inmejorable
Me quede impresionado al descubrir que este hotel dispone de un sala  museo con pinturas de Opisso.",5,2010,06,16
59,Me encantó. Perfecto,"Fui en abril con mi marido y la niña a un médico. Estuve un par de días. La habitación me costó 70 € por noche y la verdad que me sorprendió enormemente cuando llegué al hotel. Es un típico edificio de la zona, precioso por fuera y también por dentro.
No os dejéis asustar por las críticas negativas. Los baños eran correctos y las habitaciones estaban bien de tamaño. La mía daba a la calle principal y dormí estupendamente, nada de ruidos de coches ni nada, estupendo.
El personal, como dicen en otras críticas, hiper amable, desde el recepcionista, limpiadoras, mayordoma, camareros, maitre, botones, una pasada. Te ayudan en todo lo que pueden. La verdad que con un bebé estas cosas se agradecen un montón.
Está al lado del Paseo de Gracia y hay un autobús justo en frente que lleva a Plaza Cataluña, con lo que desde ahí te puedes mover donde quieras de Barcelona.
Espero que la opinión os ayude, yo desde luego encantada del hotel. Por cierto, no dejéis de subir al ático si hace buen tiempo, tienen una terraza con piscina donde puedes tomar algo con toda la tranquilidad del mundo, es super agradable.",5,2010,05,13
59,"Nettes Hotel, empfehlenswert!","Es ist ein nettes Hotel mit gemütlicher Atmosphäre und freundlichem Personal. Die Zimmer waren stets sauber. Das Frühstücksangebot war relativ gross und abwchslungsreich. Leider hatten wir keine Aussicht aus dem Fenster, der Blick ging auf einen Lichtschacht, was aber OK war, wir waren den ganzen Tag in der Stadt unterwegs und sind erst abends zum Schlafen ins Hotel zurückgekommen. Die Größe des Zimmer war für 2 Personen OK. Alles in allem waren wir zufrieden und würden jederzeit wieder in dieses Hotel gehen!!! Wer keinen allzu großen Luxus möchte, wird sich in diesem 3- Sterne Hotel wohlfühlen!! Für Städtereisen optimal, da gut gelegen aber dennoch ruhig und kein Autolärm!!",5,2010,03,27
59,buon hotel ben posizionato,"Buon hotel con camera pulita bel bagno con marmi e soprattutto bidet! disponibilit' del personale, posizione ottima vicino alla metro, in zona tranquilla e vicino a casa battlo. Buon rapporto qualita' prezzo, stanza leggermente piccola ma curata. Spazi comuni ben tenuti e belli adatta a coppie, famiglie anche per lunghe vacanze ( noi 8 notti). Da consigliare!",4,2010,01,08
59,Pessimo,"Il soggiorno all'Hotel Astoria è stata proprio una spiacevole sorpresa!
La camera è minuscola, arredamento vecchio e mal tenuto, bagno pessimo!
L'albergo non è comodo alla metro e non proprio in centro.",1,2009,07,03
59,"Muy céntrico, práctico y funcional","El hotel está muy bien situado, muy cerca de los principales sitios turísticos. El servicio fue extremadamente amable y aunque pasamos sólo una noche, creo que es un hotel con muy buena relación calidad-precio. Desde luego, si vuelvo a Barcelona, seguramente vaya a este hotel.",4,2009,03,25
59,veramente una brutta e sgradevole sorpresa!,"saro' stato particolarmente sfortunato, anche perche' avevo ricevuto buoni commenti qualita'/prezzo, ma mi sono fermato 1 sola notte e sono stato troppo fiducioso... risultato: il personale efficiente, disponibile e collaborativo, ma la camera, servizi e relative  installazioni un vero incubo. Sicuramente non corrispondevano in nulla a quanto visto e pubblicizzato su depliants e websites! Arredamento datato, cadente e rovinato, riscaldamento ( a novembre!) acceso solo al mio arrivo la sera, una finestra non chiudeva (con relativo spiffero gelido tutta la notte), cuscini vere pietre e materassi tanto infossati da parere amache,un rumore infernale (dalla strada) tutta la notte. Scopro che il ristorante funziona solo a pranzo ( non specificato in nessun sito) e la sera e' chiuso. Ultima goccia: lavabo e bidet intasati, e dal bidet usciva solo acqua rigorosamente bollente, senza alcuna possibilita' di miscelare....
Sicuramente non ci tornero' mai piu' e mi guardero' bene dal consigliarlo a chicchessia. Un ostello sarebbe stato meglio, almeno si sa cosa aspettarsi. E non trovo affatto corretto ne' buona politica offrire scarti alla clientela solo perche' il soggiorno e' limitato ad 1 notte. Non mi sembra  un delitto.",1,2008,11,27
59,Cooles Hotel gut für Partygäste!!,"Das Hotel war genial von der Lage her. Wir mussten ca 7 minuten bis zu den Partys gehen. Die City war auch direkt..nur wenige schritte. Es war schon cool das Hotel. Jetzt kann ich nur sagen lang lebe Barcelona. Es waren zwar nur 3 Sterne aber dafür gute :)
",3,2008,09,24
59,buon rapporto qualità prezzo,"un buon albergo vicino alla metropolitana  avevamo due stanze al primo piano e una aveva il bagno leggermente maleodorante che abbiamo risolto  subito chiudendo la finaestra che dava su di un cortile interno .
la piscina è piccola ( forse è più una grande vasca da bagno) ma comunque il contesto è carino 
non prenotate la colazione vi fanno lo sconto sul posto del 50% ma comunque ci sono tanti bar vicini più a buon mercato",4,2008,09,14
59,"Comodo, lussuoso ma un po' caro","L'hotel è in una zona abbastanza centrale, a cinque minuti a piedi dalla metropolitana e non tanto distante dal bellissimo quartiere di Gracia. Le stanze sono molto pulite e confortevoli, dispone di piscina e palestra sul terrazzo. Il servizio alla reception è eccellente, e parlano correntemente italiano. Unico neo il prezzo un po' alto, ma ho soggiornato in agosto e si tratta di un tre stelle di categoria superiore.",4,2007,11,26
59,Bellissimo tre stelle,"Nel quartiere dell'Example bellissimo tre stelle. La mia stanza era a due piani con salotto e anticamera e un enorme finestrone dava sul solarium e sulla piscina. La piscina è piccola, ma è sufficiente per prendere il sole e riposarsi durante la siesta. Molto quotato il ristorante sulla terrazza, dove a volte venivano a mangiare anche per colazioni di lavoro.
Personale molto gentile, super comfort.

59,buon hotel,"Abbiamo soggiornato all' hotel Astoria nell'agosto 2004 e devo dire che è stata una piacevole sorpresa quando il nostro taxi ci ha lasciato di fronte al suo bellissimo ingresso..la zona è molto tranquilla,ci sono bar,supermarket,farmacie e persino un sex shop...!L'unica pecca  è la distanza dalla metro(Diagonal),in compenso di fronte all' albergo passa un bus che in circa 5-10 minuti ti porta in piazza Catalunia.Per quanto riguadra la camera era soddisfacente,il letto grande,il bagno spazioso e gli asciugamani morbidissimi,purtroppo la vista non era un granchè perchè dava su un muro!La colazione l'avevamo presa in offerta (paghi 1 prendi 2..) con 11€,era abbbondante  e varia,sia dolce che salata.Un ottimo hotel che sicuramente consiglierei anche per il rapporto qualità/prezzo.
",4,2007,06,28
59,ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo,"Abbiamo alloggiato conla mia famiglia, composta da 4 persone fra cui 2 bambine, in questo albergo durante le vacanze di Pasqua.
La ricerca dell'albergo è stata oltremodo complicata per la difficoltà di trovare a prezzi non proibitivi una soluzione per noi quattro. Dopo aver scartato molti altri alberghi, che nella scala delle preferenze espresse lo precedevano, ho riscontrato una grande professionalità, sia nei primi approcci per e-mail, sia una volta giunti sul posto.
La nostra stanza si affacciava sulla via principale molto tranquilla, al contrario degli alloggi presso la ramblas, e  pur essendo sostanzialmente una tripla adattata a quadrupla era assolutamente soddisfacente per il costo: 155 euro escluso la colazione, il cui costo era di 12 euro.
Da italiana non bado molto alle colazione, ma devo dire che era molto ben fornita : macedonia con frutta fresca, una buona scelta sia di salato che di dolce. Mia figlia amante delle colazioni scozzesi l'ha trovata di suo assoluto gradimentoe non è una tipina facile.
",4,2007,05,25
59,Experiencia nefasta,"Por cuestiones de trabajo tenía que pasar una semana en Barcelona, y reservé este hotel en una agencia de viajes de Valladolid. Pensé que la calidad sería la de un 3 estrellas y que se parecería en algo a las fotos del folleto, pero, no acerté con ninguna de las dos cosas.
Nos asignaron una habitación que se encontraba justo al lado de un cuarto donde guardan los productos de limpieza. Estaba en el primer piso y daba a un patio interior oscuro y lleno de piedras y mangueras de agua.
El moviliario de mala calidad y cutre. Al lado de la cama que pegaba a la ventana, se encontraba el radiador y el aire acopndicionado, d emodo que el radiador quedaba justo en la cabeza y el aire acondicionado en los pies. El baño tan cutre como el resto. El lavabo estaba roto y había moho y humedad en la ducha. 
La television estaba sopbre una mesa que ni siquiera miraba hacia la cama, d emodo que para poder verla habría que sentarse en un sofá horrible e incomodoq ue estaba justo en frente de la tele.
En fin, no tengo palabras para describir lo engañada que me sentí, porque había pagado 150 euros por noche en un hotel no centrico y que para nada era un 3 estrellas. 
Ni que decir que me largué de allí inmediatamente y no pasé ni la primera noche, eso si, me la cobraron aunque no estuve ni una hora en ella.
