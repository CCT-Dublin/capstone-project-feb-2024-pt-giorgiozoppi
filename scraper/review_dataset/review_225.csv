225,Perfect stay,Beautiful room in the centre of Temple bar. The decor of our room was tastefully decorated me with lovely added features like complimentary water and coffee. Staff were very helpful and I can not praise them enough. Discounted parking was a great added benefit. Highly recommend,5,2024,10,17
225,Very disappointed ,Lovely room and bathroom but we were awake very early because of the light coming in the deluxe windows!! This is totally unacceptable seeing as the room cost 240euros for one night! What was even worse was that there were blinds on the windows but the windows could not be reached to pull them down. It really ruined our stay and we wouldn't recommend this place,3,2024,10,06
225,Avoid this place,"Horrible, horrible service.  Booked a room, received two confirmation emails, and then when we arrived we discovered-through the help of the business next door-that people haven‚Äôt been getting an email for payment two weeks in advance.  No communication from whoever the con artist is that owns this place.  No email for payment, no communication that our room was given to someone else.  Avoid this place.",1,2024,09,01
225,Give it a very wide berth.,"I booked a room at this hotel, two weeks in advance of my trip. They debited my credit card for the full amount and then,two days before my checkin date, cancelled my reservation, telling me they had overbooked. This caused huge issues for me, given a close friend had separately booked a room  in the Merchant House. I was forced, on two days notice, to find another hotel.

I would avoid this place, they clearly have no respect for customers, particularly those who pay in advance for services they subsequently decide, on two days notice, not to provide , disgraceful.",1,2024,01,31
225,Terrible service,"Myself and my Wife were scheduled to stay at the merchant house on Saturday the 27th of January. 

Payment was taken on the 9th of January for ‚Ç¨200 (the deal through booking. Com was for ‚Ç¨185)(no mention of a reimbursement in any of the messages from booking.com)

My booking was cancelled less than 24 hours prior to my stay. 

I was sent on codes for entry etc and 6 hours later told to ignore these emails and that my booking was cancelled. 

Very disappointed that a phone call wasn't made and email sent to explain the situation (booking.com notifed me). Definitely not a 5 star hotel. I called three times and no answer. 

Fair play lads your in the service industry but offer awful service (happy in your work?)",1,2024,01,26
225,Unhelpful,"Due to the riots in Dublin we did not want to travel to Dublin tomorrow .  I totally understand that we could not get a refund but would have thought they would have been willing to give us another date due to the situation.   I was advised by booking.com to email them to request a change of date - they did not respond to my emails.  Poor, unhelpful customer service  - did not answer telephone -   only contacted me through WhatsApp once I had left a message their response  'situation out of our control'.",1,2023,11,24
225,Outstanding ,"Great location, clean, beautiful and spacious rooms. Walking distance to everything. If I come back, definitely staying here again. Only thing missing is a/c in the rooms so we could keep the windows closed during the night.",5,2023,09,12
225,Great location and very quiet,"My husband and I recently stayed at the Merchant House.  Our room (the W.B. Yeats room) was spacious and clean.  The location in the Temple Bar area was central to everything, yet the room was super quiet.  We were able to leave our luggage in the building entryway until check-in on the day we arrived which was very convenient.  Overall, it was a great place to stay!
",5,2023,07,16
225,Perfect hotel in Belfast!,"The hotel was beautiful and the location was great. We walked to all the sights we wanted to visit. Plenty of restaurants out the door! The staff went above and beyond. Ryan, the assistant manager went above and beyond at the last minute. We were leaving for the airport and our rental car had a flat :-( 
He hired us a taxi and made sure the tire got fixed and delivered the car to the airport for us. We had a flight to catch so we had to leave. Thank you Ryan! 
Request an Art Deco room to be sure you are in the quiet section. 
The only thing I would like to see changed is the hotel to  change foreign currency for the tourists.",5,2023,07,02
225,Stay at The Merchant House,"The Merchant House was a fascinating find in Dublin!¬† The location cannot be beaten in terms of proximity to the Temple Bar area and other¬†attractions.¬† The street is VERY quirky but we never felt unsafe and the neighbors and neighborhood were colorful!¬† We were not met by a member of the staff but were provided instructions for access.¬† Please note that the initial lock into the front door is a bit temperamental¬†but we eventually got the hang of it.¬† If you are short, it can be a bit hard to reach.¬† We had no problems with noise at night as long as we shut the windows as instructed - it was very quiet.¬† The first night we left the windows open and learned our lesson!¬† They provided a tower fan, which was very nice to keep the air moving.¬† The pillows are very hard, but helpfully there was a drawer marked ""softer pillow"" and we did supplement with that one.¬† We were in the James Joyce suite, and the size was very nice with plenty of seating provided with a chair and small loveseat.¬† We particularly appreciated the bench at the foot of the bed which was helpful for putting on shoes, etc.¬† In our room, the hair dryer was in the vestibule and was attached to the wall (our friends were in another room and their hair dryer was movable), but there were mirrors in the door of the cabinet next to the hair dryer so you could see what you were doing.¬† They do not serve breakfast and used to have an agreement with a nearby restaurant Panem but that apparently has lapsed.¬† We did eat at Panem twice (it is quite close) and the breakfasts were delicious.¬† There is no lobby in this guest house and you will need to navigate the stairs with your luggage.",4,2023,06,24
225,Quirky & Fabulous Gem of a place! ,"If you like quirky, don‚Äôt mind being between a sex shop & Thai massage place then this is the place for you! Fabulous location to explore Dublin, a bit noisy at night when the Temple Bar lights up but great sound proofing at the windows if required. The decor, the ‚Äòloft‚Äô feel and comfort are fab - comfy bed, great living space & lovely bathroom.  Mini bar at reasonable cost, complimentary tea & coffee, toiletries, iron, trouser press, Wi-Fi & immaculately clean the Oscar Wilde Suite is worth the 4 flights of stairs! (They are manageable even after a few pints but if you have mobility problems there is no lift) - Airy, bright space, safe and secure entrance & charming manager ‚ÄòFrank‚Äô makes this place a gem of a find.  The sex shop & massage place are no bother at all, discreet and we didn‚Äôt have any issues. Frank works next door in the shop if you need him & it‚Äôs an eyes on saucers experience walking in there ‚Ä¶. but he os polite & very helpful if there is a problem.  The breakfast is epic! A short walk over a bridge at end of street to the wonderful Panem Cafe for a fabulous 3 course breakfast.  All in all the Merchants House is a perfect place to make your base when exploring Dublin. ",5,2023,05,12
225,Lovely quirky accommodation with some downsides,"Lovely accommodation, we stayed in the James Joyce suite which was beautifully furnished, very clean. Had everything you needed hair dryer , ironing board , coffee/tea , mini bar etc. The member of staff who met us was really nice and professional, the door system is very secure and easy to use . 
Downside is despite very good triple glazing it‚Äôs just very very noisy because of its location whatever was happening next door didn‚Äôt end until half 4 which was such a shame it‚Äôs a trade off really it was a great location and a quirky accommodation. Only thing for those travelling who might be a bit shy the bathroom door and shower tiles are glass üò≥",3,2023,03,25
225,DO NOT STAY HERE,"I have been working in hotel industry for 20 years and have never experienced anything so bad. 
They advertise as a Five Star hotel and suites, here is our experience:
Day of arrival, we get a phone call telling us that we cannot do check in when we want, that we should have left Cork earlier. 
We arrived to do check in at 6pm 

The rooms are full with clutter and plastic flowers, there is no space to put any of your belongings.

They give you two old rotten towels, one of them so bad that the edge is totally in pieces, and we asked for extra towels, we are told that ‚Äúonly one towel per guest is authorized‚Äù

Next: 
TV does not work in one of the rooms 
If you want a hot shower be ready for a trip to 1950 they have this old devise that either scorches you or freezes you.

You have to wait 20 minutes between showers because the water won‚Äôt flush and it‚Äôs disgusting 

The cherry on top of the cake:
We had 3 rooms two of them had an early flight, so they left at 9am, our flight is later so we stayed in the room until 12 (This is the check out time they have written in their book at the room) 
At 12:01 an old gentleman storms into our room without knocking and I cuote literally‚Äù Get out!! You need to be out of the room, I have other guests, Get out!! This happens yelling 
I grabbed the book and showed him the check out time is at 12 an he replies yelling 12:02 is past noon 
Grab your sh*&8 and get out, he grabed the keys of the room and stormed out as he continued yelling going downstairs.

We are appalled at this point, we were ready to leave anyways, but I have never ever ever been in a place like this in my life. 

Save your money, enjoy a nice stay a the Temple Bar Hotel or any other, BUT DO NOT STAY HERE

THIS IS NOT A FIVE STAR HOTEL

It is a 3 star or lower Airbnb",1,2022,09,14
225,"Beautiful, boutique suites!","We had a lovely 3 night stay in the James Joyce Suite. Very spacious suite with great facilities, huge bathroom and windows. Even though you're in the heart of vibrant Temple Bar area of Dublin, there's minimal noise disturbance due to the extra internal glazing. The suite felt very private, secure and peaceful.
Room was spotlessly clean and serviced daily. Attention to detail was evident throughout the apartment. Loved the little extras such as the coffee machine, DVD player and earplugs for light sleepers (these were not required but a nice touch!) Shower was amazing even though it states the water pressure is low in this area.
You're greeted by one of the team on arrival and everything is explained in detail. Can't remember the name of our host now, but he was fantastic and told us not to hesitate to call if we needed anything further.
We would definitely recommend these Suites if you're looking to be in a central location of Dublin City.
Overall, had a brilliant stay here and will be back soon!

Bev & Doug",5,2022,08,19
225,"Great Rooms, Very Clean","Very nicely appointed rooms, super clean, and upgraded bathrooms.  This small boutique hotel is in an older/historical building that only adds to its charm. Be aware there are no lifts. We booked three rooms on three floors and they were all very nice.  Parking, as in pretty much any part of Dublin, is not easy and there is literally no place to pull over to drop off luggage without threat of the dreaded tire boot!  Also be aware that this is a very busy, noisy, traffic-laden part of the City.  If its peace and quite you are looking for, this isn't your kinda place but if you want to be in the thick of the Temple Bar area, its a good choice.",4,2022,06,30
225,Good location,Host Frank was very friendly and explained all details to us. Room was a good size and so clean.  It's an excellent location to stay.  At the bottom of Eustace Street is Temple Bar's busy area and at the top of the Street is Dame Street.  There is a Spar shop at the top of Eustace Street that prepares fresh sandwiches.  We got the express bus from the airport which was three stops.  Be prepared one side of the Merchant House is a Thai Massage shop and the other side is a shop that sells sex toys but we didn't see anyone visiting these places and we felt very safe day/evening.,5,2022,06,23
225,"Charming and unique, but a little off","The building is 300 years old so it has ""charm"" that we enjoyed. However, the main reason I booked it was for the king sized bed. It might have been a queen sized bed or a full. NOT king. The street below is noisy- as is to be expected for the fun neighborhood it is located in. The doubled windows worked fine for keeping out the noise, however when it is warm you may want to keep the windows open since there is no a/c. (There is an underwhelming fan.) One other strange quirk was the glass walled bathroom. Yep, you can see through from the bedroom. For privacy we coordinated our positioning in the room at key time.",3,2022,05,24
225,"Gorgeous suites, unfriendly staff.","Booked 3 rooms for myself and friends for our wedding. I required an unusual check in where I needed the other guests room keys to be left in my own suite, in order to help the running of the days events. This was outside of their policy which I totally understand and am very grateful it was accomodated. However it was not easily achieved. I was firmly assured how they were going out of their way for my special check-in and how this was a 5 star facility, so maybe treat your guests as if it is 5 star?

I needed to explain the plan/situation countless times prior our check in date which I may as well not have because we ended up needing to explain everything again on check-in. Very strict on check-in time, ringing to confirm once again while I was on route- no need. Communication was over the top for me prior my stay. Example, received an email one day saying ""telephone me I left a voice mail an hour ago"". Kinda in work, cant pick up at your demand my apologies.

And then for check in itself, well that was an experience. Greeted, or not greeted, by the most inhospitable person I have ever come across in the hospitality sector. The whole check in process was extremely lengthy and unnecessary, and we were spoken to as if we were children and that we needed to ""pay attention"". Personally, I don't feel the need to be shown every little corner of the room or being explained to what ear plugs are for. (By the way, advertised as soundproofed, but provide ear plugs.) Anyway, we just wanted to check in and chill, keep to the important stuff like fire escapes maybe. But now thinking about it, I dont think that was even covered! Took a good 35 mins of rude, abrubt chatter before check finally ended. I thoroughly enjoyed the room itself, beautifully decorated and maintained, perfect location. Its an amazing building. Just a pity the staff aren't very pleasant, it was our very first impression and unfortunately a lasting one. 

Would have been a nice place to go back to for anniversaries but after that experience I can't say I'd go back. Unless the staff obtain hospitality training, manners or just some simple kind social skills.",3,2022,03,23
225,Mr and mrs,We were  so looking forward to our night away in a beautiful looking hotel. However having been charged 50 euros to move booking from Dec 2020 to Dec 2021 they now want to charge another 50 euros as we are unable to travel again due to covid. Asked for a voucher for next year as advertised on the website but that too is 50 euros.,1,2021,11,12
225,"Great room , great location","This charming hotel is situated in the middle of the town centre and walking distance from lovely restaurants pubs and shopping.
The rooms are charming and spacious, for breakfast you walk to a nearby coffee shop and that was delicious",4,2021,09,21
225,Very Charming,"We very much enjoyed our stay here.  It is one of the more unique B & B's I have stayed at.

It is right in Temple bar which makes it nice to be able to Pub Hop and go back to your room, plus it is close to many attractions.

We stayed in The Oscar Wilde Suite, top floor, it is not handicap accessible so if stairs are an issue unfortunately this is not the place for you.   Room comes with a mini bar and some wine options.  We did not opt for the breakfast so I can not tell you about that.  Shower was a bit small so the only thing that would have made the room perfect is a spot for a soaker tub.

We were very happy with our stay here.",4,2021,08,31
225,Super accommodation,"If you are happy left on your own, this is fantastic. Well met on arrival, thorough tour of room and amenities. Large suites, well designed. Great location if you want to be central, all your epicurean desires are within easy walking distance.",4,2020,08,13
225,Terrible Customer Service,"I can't actually review the location or accommodation as sadly out of our control my 40th Birthday Surprise holiday was cancelled due to COVID.  My husband contacted all 5 hotels he had booked us into (mini tour planned) and every hotel understood it was not our choice to cancel and offered either a full or partial refund with SMALL fee. 

Having already paid nearly ¬£200 for one night at the Merchant House he contacted Merchant House who then sent a e-mail saying we could change dates for a FURTHER 50 euros or have a voucher to re-book if we didn't know the date yet for a FURTHER 52 euros and said they were being generous ! 

My husband e-mailed several times asking them to surely reconsider in light of the current Pandemic only to be sent the same e-mail time and time again saying no, basically take it or leave it. 

If we do take the voucher (solely to avoid losing everything) I will attend the holiday (when we are allowed) knowing they made a bad situation so much worse and will never recommend them. Funny enough my friend is planning her 40th and wanted our feedback as she was going to book a week there ...... She won't be now !",1,2020,07,30
225,Pleasant Stay,"We stayed on The Oscar Wilde Suite on the top floor and we loved it! The spacious room, very comfortable and beautifully decorated. 
Located right in the heart of Dublin, close to everything. Despite it's  located at the Temple Bar district but it's quite in the room. Such a great stay. ",4,2020,04,30
225,Excellent stay again!,"This was our 3rd stay at Merchant House and the excellent service continues! We stayed in the W B Yeats Suite and did not have any problem negotiating the doors or the stairs. We were greeted very warmly and we were set for the stay.
The shower is very typical of an Irish accommodation and had the added luxury of heated floors. The room was bright and comfortable and we enjoyed the stay!",5,2020,03,12
225,Lovely place - brekky was offsite though. ,"Superb accommodation. Room is a wonderful and 
spacious Art Deco delight. 

Main room in the suite dominated by 2 striking Art Deco paintings which are great. Photos don‚Äôt do this place justice - lovely artistic and fresh touches in every place you look. 

We found the pillows a little high (but to be fair then in the morning we realised there were spare (smaller - ie normal) pillows in the closet). Shower was a little weak, which was out of kilter with the nicely appointed room, and the very-high ceilings - although lovely - meant it was a little cold in the shower when the shower was otherwise hot. 

Room is effectively a suite of lobby, bathroom and lounge/bedroom. Place was meticulously and spotlessly clean with nice touches everywhere and really nice linen and furniture. Everything looks new and fresh. Owner had clearly put a lot of thought in. I‚Äôd give the place and location even more than 5 stars if possible - but dropped a star over breakfast. 

Breakfast was a disappointment because it was not on site - it‚Äôs not far though, in a cafe just across the Liffey river. Annoying when the breakfast is ‚Ç¨16 each, but the breakfast you get is ‚Ç¨9.50 at that same cafe... I‚Äôd always rather have breakfast on site - but searching for a location offsite is awful. 

Location is bang in the middle of Temple Bar, and a plus point is the owner has nicely soundproofed the place - was lovely and calm inside despite the noise outside. One downside is that these suites are located with a Thai Massage parkour on one side, and a sex shop on the other side, so you feel a little seedy fumbling for your keys outside!

On the whole a good place, and recommended. We stayed in the James Joyce suite - very nice. I‚Äôve attached photos of 2 breathtaking paintings in the main room. Really stunning. Thanks!",4,2020,02,16
225,Most unprofessional hoteliers we have ever dealt with,We have travelled to over 65 countries and 100s of hotels. This hotel was informed that an error was made on a booking within 5 hours of booking. The hotel sent us one of the most hateful messages I have ever received from a hotel. I have a disability and informed them of this. Instead of understanding and accommodating they charged my card 1000 dollars sent us more rude messages and forced me to cancel my card. I told them this was horrible business and to avoid this and they did it anyways. Dishonest. Unprofessional avoid. Don't buy their self serving response. It will be a lie.,1,2019,12,11
225,3 days in Dublin,"Rented the oscar wilder suite for my partner and me, and the bram stoker for my adult son.  The wilder suite was large but on top floor, having to climb 4 double flights of stairs.  View of the street below.  The stoker room Was small, dark no view.  A mistake I'm sorry to say.  Breakfast while included meant taking your voucher and walking a half mile to a cafe.  Very low water pressure in The showers.  Not what would i call 5 star at all.  Be aware",2,2019,12,06
225,"Great location, but...","Overall, I don't disagree with those that state; ""water pressure"" issues to some degree...and great ""location"". I just would NOT rate this anywhere near ""5-stars"". It's a solid 3. WHY? Incredibly steep staircases. ALL rooms will require a steep and somewhat awkward climb with luggage. 3 interior doors for ingress/egress, including an equally awkward to lock, outside security door. None of these features are mentioned. If you have ANY type of mobility issues, do not choose this property. In my view, it's pricey for what you get, but being in ""Temple"" area is a great feature, and what you're mostly paying for. ",3,2019,12,06
225,Location Location Location!,"Great spot right in the heart of Temple Bar. The room was spectacular! The service was excellent, we couldnt have had a better experience. The next time we plan a trip for Dublin, this we definitely be top of the list to stay! Strongly suggest!",5,2019,11,07
225,Awesome Stay,Location is perfect! Easy to get around and there is so much within a stones throw to do! The staff (Denise) greeted us at the door and explained how everything works before handing the keys off and bidding good day. The suite was tastefully decorated to then period of the room. The bathrooms were extremely large and even though some complained about the water pressure in the showers I thought it was perfectly acceptable. The best part was the bed. I believe it was a feather mattress and was one of the most comfortable bed I‚Äôve ever slept in. Would definitely stay again and highly recommend to anyone looking for a great stay in Dublin. Thanks to everyone at the Merchant House (ie Denise)!!!,5,2019,09,27
225,FANTASTIC LOCATION,"We stayed there for 4 nights actually in Sept 2018.  Great location near the Temple Bar and the river.  The only minor issue I had is that getting a comfortable water temperature in the shower required an MIT Doctorate degree in Engineering.  Otherwise, the room was fantastic...well appointed, comfortable and clean.  We would certainly stay there again.",5,2019,09,12
225,A beautiful room in Temple Bar,"We stayed in the Oscar Wilde suite and were very pleased with the room. It had the unique charm that we were hoping for. It was walking distance from everywhere we wanted to visit. The breakfast vouchers we received were for a place called Panem, just across the river. The breakfasts were tasty.

Two things to be aware of. Our suite was the top-most, being 5 flights up without an elevator. The staff were very helpful with our bags, but you need to be able to walk stairs just to get to the room. (Other suites aren‚Äôt as high up, so check when choosing.)

The other is that Merchant House is in a very active
neighborhood. Even with the soundproofing, if you want to open the windows for fresh air, there‚Äôs significant street noise. It didn‚Äôt bother us, but if you need complete quiet, it might.

In general, our stay here was a wonderful part of our visit to Dublin. ",5,2019,08,31
225,Lovely hotel but the stairs are ridiculous,"A charming hotel right in the middle of Temple Bar, large comfortable rooms etc. But there's no lift so the stairs are tiny and many, so be warned before you book in. We stayed in the Oscar Wilde room which is at the very top, so about 8 flights of stairs, which is not great on two middle aged people with knee issues! Suggest you only stay there if you can get the Bram Stoker room, which is the lowest one!",3,2019,07,02
225,Beautiful and unique suites in a busy nightlife part of town,"Generous size rooms with quirky but tasteful decor.  

Very comfortable bed.

Triple glazing means you don't hear any noise from the nearby bars and clubs

Premises not normally manned - a housekeeper meets you at the door

Located in the Temple Bar area of Dublin - wall to wall bars, restaurants and adult shops.  Housekeeper emerged from the fetish shop next to the door to the suites !! 
Door security intense - sliding steel mesh door, then solid front door, then pass code on inner door.",5,2019,06,24
225,A visit to Dublin,"We visited Dublin in early June and stayed at the Merchant House.  The accommodations of the house are without a doubt 5 star.  The house is in a very busy section of Dublin, the Temple Bar area.  It can get noisy into the early hours of the morning but the owner has sound proofed the windows and even provided ear plugs near your bed.  The house is a self contained building which means there is no reception on duty other than the housekeeper who is there from 9AM to about 6PM.  I was able to email the merchant house after hours and they were very responsive.  The faucet in the bathroom was broken and hanging on by a thread and they fixed it the very next day.  Very responsive.  ",3,2019,06,07
225,Beautiful suites BUT..,"The suites were spacious and beautifully decorated.  Didn't realize there was not a manager on site, so have to make apt. to gain access to room.  Denise was there and waiting for us as planned, very friendly and helped with bringing up the luggage to the 2nd & 4th floor- no elevators!  The Temple Bar area is hard to drivie in had to park a few blocks away in parking garage.   Also, this is the only place we stayed that would not allow for timely cancellation (something we missed when we booked- they charged our card immediately after booking ) and were pretty expensive compared to our other places.",3,2019,06,03
225,Birthday treat,Loved the place from the start. Two lovely ladies met us and showed us to our room (Bram Stoker). They were so pleasant and friendly. The room was perfect and had everything we needed and more. Shower was fine despite the note saying about low water pressure in the area. Comfortable and beautiful. Thanks so much... we will definitely be back xx,5,2019,04,13
225,Great room in middle of temple bar area!,"Great room, wasn't expecting something like this hidden gem in temple bar. It wasn't noisy at all as they fit a 2nd window inside of the original windows. I think the bathroom floor actually had underfloor heating as well! The bathroom was really nice, very clean and had a big walk in shower big enough for 2 people. The bed is very big and the room is very spacious. Lots of cool items in the room and plenty of character with 2 fireplaces. Overall very happy with the ‚Ç¨140 we paid for it.",5,2019,03,31
225,"It's OK, but.....","The rooms were clean and eclectically decorated.  The location is a big plus.  The lady who let us into our rooms was very nice and accommodating.  We stayed in the Oscar Wilde suite which is on the fifth floor with no lift, so if you forget your cell phone or something you have to hoof it up some serious stairs.  The bar across the street is VERY loud until VERY late.  They do provide ear plugs.  I would probably look for a more traditional hotel in retrospect",3,2019,03,22
225,Amazing!,"We‚Äôre just back from a night I‚Äôm the Oscar Wilde Suite, this is an absolutely amazing hotel! The only thing is it‚Äôs all stairs so if you‚Äôve a problem with stairs, steer clear and Temple Bar is a low water pressure area so the shower wasn‚Äôt great but we didn‚Äôt mind! We loved it here! I was so sad leaving! The housekeeper that let us in was unbelievable! I can‚Äôt speak highly enough of her and I‚Äôm so disappointed I didn‚Äôt get her name, she couldn‚Äôt do enough for us and it‚Äôs litedally in the middle of Temple Bar with a Costa Coffee a couple of doors down! I‚Äôll definitely stay again, i‚Äôd love to see what the other rooms are like but I really loved the Oscar Wilde suite!",5,2019,03,21
225,"the ""don""t do that"" Dublin house","so this it not a hotel (but a vey old house...) and it is very much repeated to you (that it is not a hotel and a very old house). 
Reservation made through Booking website without any possibility of reimbursment (quite restrictive !)
, and don't expect much of conversations when you write emails; you are always sent back to the website or the schedules automatic mails. So try not to have more questions, they will not be answered.

INDEED the check in is welcoming (2 young ladies attending the house), BUT Access for check-in is by appointment only and the house (or blockhouse) with its 3 doors and codes is not the most welcoming , especially when you're on time, tired of having traveled long and forced to wait under the rain that someone finally opens
INDEED, it is ideally situated in the pub center of Dublin , BUT beware of the noisy surroundings at nights if you're looking 
INDEED it has been decorated with some style (though much of the furniture is from IKEA) , BUT the entrance/ Hall of the room is made of industrial plastic floor
INDEED a well equipped bathroom is present, BUT don't expect any hydrotherapy or massage shower, worst shower i have experienced in a so called 5 star place : warmth is just a pain in the @%% to fix, and no power at all (the old building excuse)
INDEED it has some mini bars , and a fridge for your convenience , BUT our room fridge had not been emptied from previous guests (YUK)
INDEED it is accessible by car (and you can park some minutes to unload your luggage, BUT know that the parking lot , though a walking distance , requires a 3 km detour to be acessed from the hotel (unless you challenge the Irish road rules). 
INDEED it looks like a very romantic and peaceful place , BUT don't expect some rest, it is an old house which is very noisy and crackling , and you are reminded every stairs to keep quiet and as low as possible.. we have enjoyed our neighbours ups and downs the stairs and in their room all night long (and I suppose they have had the same from us)

finally :
* don't come with oversized or heavy luggages, they will not fit the stairs and they are no elevators (remember, it's an old house)
* don't expect any commercial behavior, it was for instance my birthday the day of my stay , and i was ""kindly"" brought back to the expensive ""supplements"" sold on the website

for all this defaults, it is really not worth its price (240 ‚Ç¨ bkft included, off season)",3,2019,03,14
225,Fab cocktails!,What a beautiful building in such a brilliant city! Highly recommend going to experience the splendour of the bar/lounge at the Merchant House...stunning. Staff & service second to none too. Will definitely returning on our next trip!,5,2019,02,27
225,Comfortable and Welcoming Stay in the heart of Temple Bar,"You ready many reviews about the Merchant House with some negatives about the noise, so we went prepared for that.  We were welcomed warmly and shown to our room, a great room with a host of amenities and a really comfortable bed.  Yes, there is a bar opposite and we suffered some noise to the early morning on one night, but you can't really expect to stay in the heart of Temple Bar and not expect it.  Ear plugs are available for those that don't tolerate noise levels well.  Our stay was comfortable, welcoming and the location is so central.",4,2019,02,04
225,Stayed for concert ,"We had a lovely stay at the Merchant suites  we stayed up for a concert in the O3. It was so central right in the heart of Temple bar . 

The key exchange was easy and our rep was a lovely guy 

The room was fab the interior was beautiful and everything that you need is provided 

We got a lovely thank you message after we checked out . 

We will stay again  ",5,2018,12,02
225,Excellent,"We stayed here last night and it is in the heart of the temple bar area. The location is fantastic. But it is also so private and quiet and safe. It's a period property that has been renovated to a really high standard. It's clean, cosy and comfy and they have thought of every possible amenity. We were going to see a comedy show and everything was in walking distance. When going to bed at 1am it was still really busy in temple bar area but we couldn't really hear anything once we were in the room. Would definitely recommend it. And the house keeper was really nice. We came down from the north in the car and there is a car park right beside it (3min walk). For the one night and afternoon it cost us about 17 euro for the parking. Which I think it fantastic. If you show your invoice you get discount. All really handy.",5,2018,11,11
225,Good Guest House in the Heart of Dublin,"The Merchant House provided a good location to explore the city center of Dublin on foot.  Located right in the heart of Temple Bar it is close to the river walk, HaPenney Bridge and a half hour or so walk to St. Patrick's and Guinness. Parking was provided at a discount at a ramp about 5 - 10 minute walk away. The room was very nice, definitely an eclectic decor, but the bed was comfy, bathroom was nice, and very quite given the liveliness of the bar/music scene in Temple Bar.",4,2018,09,23
225,Quirky but overpriced and definitely not a luxury suite,"Spent 4 nights in the James Joyce suite in September. Check-in was simple and it was helpful to be be able to leave our bags prior to check in. The guesthouse itself is located in the heart of the vibrant night time economy that is Temple Bar in between a sex shop and a masseuse. The accommodation comprised three rooms, a bathroom, bedroom and hallway/storage room. The door opens into a room housing a large, man's wardrode (no hanging space for a dress), a table with the coffee machine and kettle, a handy fridge where you can store your own milk etc and a mini bar, and doors leading left to the bathroom and right into the bedroom. The shower was adequate although it cycled slowly between tepid and scalding, there are signs everywhere informing visitors that the age of the properly means that water pressure is low which probably explains that. The towels were an odd assortment of small, brown bath towels. Toiletries were the standard sort you'd find in Premier Inn or similar, I'd advise taking your own. The bedroom faced the street and we found the sound proofing adequate although if you are in any way a light sleeper do not book to stay here. it is certainly the only place I have ever booked where ear plugs are supplied as standard! The bedroom was certainly quirky, every available space was filled with dark pictures of townscapes or trains, ornaments including a vase of pot pouri the broken edge of which was rendered 'safe' by having been covered with cellotape! statues of cherubs, dogs, boots, rabbits and the like, and an assortment of fake flowers in dusty vases. The furniture was dark brown and the stained, brown carpet lent an air of faded grandeur but overall, although the room was spacious it had an air of dark and gloomy shabbiness. The complimentary snacks consisted of a plastic bottle of still water and small bag of peanuts which were not replaced once consumed. Coffee, milk and sugar were also not always replaced without it being requested. There were other snacks available at a cost but these were not only very expensive but the food items were out of date. There is a Spar and Tescos minutes away so would recommend you buy what you need from there. There was a room safe which was useful and easy to use. Extra blankets and pillows were also available which was good as the pillows on the bed were memory foam which I dislike, so to have alternatives was good. Lots of signs warning guests about the financial penalties they would incur for various infractions. This was booked as a special trip which is why we'd booked somewhere so expensive but I think it was very overpriced for what it was, it wouldn't be my recommendation I'm afraid and definitely not my idea of luxury.",3,2018,09,22
225,So....loud....my....ears....are.... still... ringing!,"The room was satisfactory, and the check-in was not that complicated although the managers require a ""check-in"" appointment.... In setting this up, the manager was courteous and responsive.  The problem was with the extremely loud nightclub just downstairs, and the streams of youthful partiers flowing, clunking, yelling and fighting all night long, literally a stone's throw from our window.   We had traveled from the US for a quick overnight in Dublin before taking the train to Killarney the following day.  This choice was a mistake, principally on my part, because I pre-paid the booking before reading all of the reviews. When I read a little further ""down the line"" I saw the comments regarding noise, the neighborhood and the rock and roll bar.  Oops! We decided to keep the reservation, and not lose the money, but I would not stay there again. ",1,2018,09,18
225,Terrible - Extremely dishonest and shady owner,"I cannot emphasize enough how terrible our experience with this place was.

My pregnant wife, 15 month old son and I traveled to the Merchant House, Dublin from the US after making a booking online (2 adults + 1 infant).

We arrived in the morning, the housekeeper greeted us, took our luggage and baby crib to our room to hold. We waited until check-in at 2pm.

Then at 2pm, the very same housekeeper refused us entry - he said, ""I'm sorry - I forgot we can't allow babies."" They flatly refused a refund. The owner was incredibly rude about it and unapologetic.

Turns out - this business is owned and operated together with a disgusting, perverted fetish shop (see image). It's basically like something out of a Red Light district.

We're currently pursuing legal action over the refund and discrimination we experienced but just wanted to make sure people are aware of this. It's NOT a ""luxury"" hotel as its advertised and the owner will never issue refunds even when he's at fault (other reviewers on other sites have also had trouble with him).",1,2018,08,11
225,Honeymoon completed ,"We spent the last 2 nights of our honeymoon here at the Merchant House. At first glance after driving from Belfast we were a bit leery. It‚Äôs a tiny one way cobblestone street with tons of people and lots of bars. We knew it was the place to be for nightlife and we decided that‚Äôs how we wanted to spend our last nights. We met the guy who let us in an gave us a tour. He was an extremely nice guy he waited for us to park the car at the car park near by. We walked inside and were amazed what a nice place. They have done a very good job with the furnishings and decor. We were shown all around our room and shown how to block out noise with the extra panes of glass. There was a lot of info to take in and it‚Äôs also nice they have labels and info all over room to help us out. The bed was very comfortable, there was a fridge to use, and the place was big but felt very cozy We went out to wander and didn‚Äôt use  the car for the duration because it is so close to everything. When we got back after dinner and a show we shut the windows and then the second noise barrier panes and to our delight it blocked out 90% of the noise. We used the fan that was provided  and we had an extremely peaceful night. We slept like babies it was one of the best nights sleep during our 3 weeks in Ireland. This is a wonderful place to stay and it‚Äôs so close to everything we are recommending it to anyone we know visiting Dublin. We would definitely stay here again. Thanks for the wonderful place to end our trip. ",5,2018,07,27
225,Stunning ,"I booked the James Joyce Suite for 1 night as we were in Dublin for a trip to the Theatre, I have to say this little place is a hidden gem, from the friendly staff to the attention to detail, including well stocked mini bar, my daughter and I had a lovely stay. Perhaps if we get a chance we will return again . Highly recommend ",5,2018,07,19
225,Charming!,"When we first approached the Merchant House, I was wondering what I had signed us up for. This boutique hotel has a very unassuming facade. Ringing the bell, Diego led us up to the extremely charming Oscar Wilde suite and took time to explain the accommodations and to provide some restaurant recommendations. During our stay, we found Temple Bar to be an excellent location with easy access to Dublin‚Äôs major sites to many eating spots. Highly recommend. ",5,2018,07,05
225,Worst ever,"I planned a stay at The Murchant House in March of 2018 but my whole trip was canceled on me do to a major snowstorm called ""The Beast from the East"". When I contacted The Murchant House, they told me that they couldn't refund my money but would allow me to stay at another time. I am now planning my redo trip and The Murchant House has informed me that I misunderstood. All they can do is offer me a free breakfast if I wish to pay for another stay. They are theirs through and through.",1,2018,06,25
225,Wonderful small luxury suites hotel temple bar district Dublin,We spent a night in this boutique luxury suites. Natalie the housekeeper was very helpful and pleasant. We arrived early. There is no lift and it is five floors up for this for suite hotel. The rooms were very modern and renovated. I would recommend this to any traveler who enjoys the small boutique hotel experience. I would not recommend it for anyone with mobility issues as the stairs are steep,5,2018,05,29
225,"Chic comfort, every detail thoughtfully curated, calm oasis in the middle of everything","We booked two rooms at The Merchant House, with little preconception of the guest house idea. We loved it. The spacious and unique rooms are like staying in an elegant and extremely clean home, every detail is interesting, great amenities, exceptional and rapid service from the concierge and housekeeper- did not really miss the fact that there is no front desk as the service provided generally exceeded front desk service. Temple Bar is a fun and quite noisy central location but we could not hear the noise in either room and one was right on the street side where bars continue until the early hours. There is always the possibility that someone forgets to lock the front door at night or stumbles up the internal stairs after a late night and there is not 24/7 security so that could be a consideration for some, but for us i would immediately try to stay there on my next trip to Dublin.   ",5,2018,04,15
225,Bewildered,"Our experience at Merchant House was extremely mixed. I couldn‚Äôt agree more that our room was beautiful, the attention to detail was was remarkable and artistic. The bathroom was luxurious. The bed was the most comfortable I slept in during my two weeks in Ireland. With all of that said, our interaction with the management at Merchant House was the most unwelcoming I‚Äôve experienced anywhere (on vacation or business travel . . . Anywhere). It seems that check in is by appointment only. We didn‚Äôt know that and I still don‚Äôt see where it says that on the website. When we didn‚Äôt arrive at the time Merchant House was expecting us (I don‚Äôt even remember listing an expected time of arrival) we got a phone call; the hotel manager was both sarcastic and abrasive. It was a bit of a shock after meeting so very many warm and welcoming people in our trip through Ireland . It‚Äôs not that we weren‚Äôt willing to communicate our arrival time (or changes to our schedule) it‚Äôs that we didn‚Äôt know we were supposed to. When we arrived Natalie was there to meet us; I stayed In the car while my traveling companion got the run down. Later, after Natalie left we realized we couldn‚Äôt find sheets for the pullout. So we did what Natalie said to do, we called her. She said we were supposed to tell her that we wanted to use the pullout while she was there, but now it was too late . . . Nothing could be done. The thing is there is no hotel employee on site. If something comes up you call someone and in our case, we were told nothing could be done. So my friend slept without sheets in this ‚Äú5 star suite‚Äù. Without these two incidents I would unhesitatingly give this place 5 stars. The human interaction was lacking though. They simply weren‚Äôt friendly or welcoming.",3,2018,04,12
225,"Beautiful large, spotlessly clean room.","We stayed in the James Joyce Suite for 4 nights, and it was absolutely lovely.  The location was very convenient to many historical sites and wonderful restaurants.  Although the nightlife outside on the street and in the two nightclubs on the other side of the road can get a bit loud, the double windows really help to soften the sound, and ear plugs are provided which block out the noise completely.  The beds and pillows are extremely comfortable, and the housekeeper, Natalie, made our rooms spotless each day.  I highly recommend The Merchant House for anyone looking to stay in the Temple Bar area of Dublin.",5,2018,04,10
225,Won‚Äôt be back,Stayed here in November for my birthday. Totally disappointed by being woken up in the middle of the night by what I thought was someone trying to break in. We called staff and to be fair they came. This happened around 2am and I got no sleep after this. It turns out it was a guest that didn‚Äôt have a key but at 2am I wasn‚Äôt checking. Breakfast was excellent the next morning but the trip was wrecked with little or no sleep. One of the only hotels I have stayed in that supply ear plugs!!,2,2018,04,02
225,Excellent,Stayed here for st patricks day celebrations. Could not of asked for a better location. Parade passed the top of the street and temple bar pubs at the bottom. We had the oscar wilde suite that is at the very top of the building with quite a few narrow stairs to climb but well worth it. Spacious well equipped suite. Lovely comfy bed.    Very good security to the property. Nearest car park only five minutes walk away but expect to pay usual inner city rates. We paid ¬£53 from 2pm on a friday till 8am sunday. Anyone that wants a great location and is able to climb stairs this is the place for you. We were at the top so had to climb the most stairs but there are suites on lower floors so please dont be put off.,5,2018,03,21
225,Awesome venue ,"This is the second time I have stayed here and it is awesome. 
The bar area is so authentic and has a great atmosphere. 
They do great meals and at a reasonable price. 
Staff is more than willing to help and very friendly. 
Highly recommend. ",5,2018,03,15
225,Great pub ,"Great pub, good food and fresh pints. Live music everyday of the week in the evening and on our few trips it Dublin it‚Äôs never too crowded but even if it is don‚Äôt let the first floor fool you there is more seating upstairs! ",5,2018,03,14
225,Luxury ,"On arrival, greeted by Natalie, who was very welcoming. The room we got was very nice and very spacious, the room faced a busy street, however u could bearly hear anything from the room, the bed was lovely and comfortable, had different options for pillows for hardness, which was good. Had a pleasant stay, and I highly recommend this place. ",5,2018,02,25
225,Great Location,"The hotel is in a great location.  We were able to check in early and had all four rooms in the hotel.  We did not experience the same noise as others but I think that was due to the fact that it was right after NYE.

The rooms are a little bit dated (needs new carpet!) and although they say King Sized beds, they are queen.  They are a very generous size.  The shower was hot/cold in all rooms (low pressure but that did not bother anyone).

The woman who manages the building is very sweet and was available for a good portion of the day if we needed anything.

There is no elevator and the stairs are fairly small.  We put my parents in the Bram Stoker Suite, which is only up one flight of stairs.  The rest of the suites are one per floor so it was a bit of a hike to the top.",4,2018,01,06
225,Temple Bar Delight,"My wife had been looking forward trip to Dublin for quite some time, so when the chance came i booked 2 nights for her 50th birthday at the Merchant House. The Merchant house is situated perfectly in Temple Bar, close to nightlife and all the sightseeing attractions.
On arrival we were very warmly welcomed our housekeeper. our  room ( James Joyce Suite ) she showed us was stunning - wife was absolutely delighted.
As you enter there is two fireplaces and a huge room very well appointed with flat-screen TV and DVD player with a selection of movies to choose from as well beautiful decor.
The housekeeper explained everything to us in a very friendly manor,
very rare in the busy days.
The beds are amazing soft cushions and very relaxing mattresses,
there was so much attention to detail.
Breakfast is off site in a small cafe around the corner called the backstage, and the food & welcome were delightful
We stayed 2 nights in the merchant House and would fully recommend to anybody who likes a bit of luxury. Have read other reviews about the noise outside, the windows are secondary glazed and after retiring to bed we did not wake up once, (may have been the Guinness) but your on Holiday enjoy it.
If there is something to improve it would be the heating, was a bit chilly in the morning, but only a small criticism.
Last my thanks are going to the whole staff who were so friendly.
The Merchant House worth a visit and well worth the price.

Thank you so much",5,2017,11,27
225,Confused rating - 5 Star for accommodation but 1 Star for lack of sleep!,"I looked at the all of the low ratings on this site and have to disagree with them, the room and staff were impeccable - wonderful; and yet, I cannot give the highest rating due to the neighbouring night-club. Its a real shame as this property is excellent in so many ways.
You must book your arrival time to be let into your room and be given keys etc - they were very good at pushing me on this (I was guilty) and they were there at the agreed minute. I was welcomed by a very smiley and welcoming lady (Natalie?) who explained everything very precisely and also offered other info. A very professional and friendly welcome.
The property was very easy to get to - I walked for 5 minutes from the Aircoach stop from the airport.
My room was the WB Yates suite - it was impeccably designed and decorated and had a wonderful homely feel to it with all mod cons. Espresso maker, iron, DVD player, statues, ornaments, books etc - all very homely and relaxing. If I ever had an apartment in Dublin, it would hopefully look similar. Also very spacious for a couple - lots of seating.
The bed was one of the most comfortable that I've ever slept in - perfect for me and I love firm pillows because of my bad neck and shoulders (softer pillows were in the wardrobe if needed). I couldn't really fault the room and loved the little ornamental touches.
If I had to be picky, I'd say that I would prefer a bath to a shower, and also the shower didn't have much power - but this is due to water pressure within Temple Bar.
OK, and now we come to my difficult decision of giving a lower mark. The property is located across the road from a very busy and loud night-club - yes, earplugs are provided, but they did not fix everything and the triple glazing can only stop so much noise. On Friday night, I used the ear-plugs ( I can't sleep well with plugs), but the base could still be heard and also shouting, chanting etc - it didn't really matter as the noise stopped at 04:30 and I didn't need to get up until 10:00, so I still had some sleep. On the Saturday night however, I had to get up at 04:20 to get my coach/flight - I couldn't risk using ear-plugs and not hearing my alarm; I lay there desperately trying to sleep while music/bass pumped out, people shouted, argued, chanted, sung etc on the street. One guest was locked out and banged on the door for 30 mins at 02:00 while others went to their rooms very loudly at 03:00. By the time the night-club closed at 04:30, I was leaving the Merchant House having had not one minute of sleep - I had to push my way through a dozen or so drunk youths who were on the pavement immediately outside of the property (explains some of the shouting and arguing).
My predicament, is can I give a 5 star rating for an excellent property/staff, if I had no sleep and suffered because of it? Room only - 5 star. Lack of sleep and proximity to night-club 1 star. I would say that if you want a 5 star experience, then take the WB Yates from Monday-Thursday, but at the weekend, if you are older/tourist/romantic couple who haven't come to Temple Bar for a late night, then be prepared for the loud music. It may have been quieter in the rooms away from the street. Shame - mixed experience.",3,2017,11,13
225,Lovely (&a quiet!) in the heart of Temple Bar!,"We booked this for our last night in Dublin. Unlike some of the reviews on this site, we DID read the emails from the hotel and knew to call ahead to advise of our arrival so Natalie was expecting us. Our room wasn't quite ready so she brought our bags upstairs for us while we went to grab a coffee down the road. Room was all ready when we came back 15min later.
Perfect location, beautiful room (we had the Yeats Suite). Double pane glass windows kept the noise out and though the shower doesnt have super-crazy high pressure, it's a completely lovely shower (made a point of putting that in here as someone else complained it had low water pressure)
The room is beautiful, quirky in its decor and the bed is beyond comfortable. 
Would highly recommend staying here. My one complaint is the front gate door....took us a bit of time to get it locked each time but appreciated the security measure.",5,2017,10,12
225,Luxury Hotel,"We stayed in the Oscar Wilde Suite for 1 night. There are 56 stairs to climb to get to this suite but we felt it was well worth it, others might disagree.  The room was large with plenty of room to spread out, bathroom again was more than adequate with complimentary shower gel etc. The housekeeper was friendly and offer help if we needed it.  Ideally placed for Temple Bar. We had no noise issues at night although we did stay on a Tuesday night. Would definitely stay here again. Thanks to all concerned.",5,2017,09,21
225,"""James Joyce Room ""   Best room in Temple Bar","The Merchant House is right smack in the middle of Temple Bar area. These are big studio rooms with dual pane glass windows so you will not be bothered with all the noise coming from the pubs in the area. The room comes with free chocolates, Tea, and espresso coffee. If you're looking to stay in the Temple Bar area this is the place Pay the extra few dollars for the dual pane windows so you can actually get some sleep because this is a very noisy area till 5 am. I'm reading some of the other reviews and it seems if people would have just taken the time to read the Hotels rules ( no cancellation policy) and the instructions on calling in advance to let the hotel know when you would be arriving then they will make sure someone is on site to let you in. So don't give the hotel a bad review because of your own stupidity and laziness.",5,2017,09,17
225,Sold by Ratings - Fooled by Amenities,"Let‚Äôs straighten up few facts. The Merchant House is NOT a Hotel. It‚Äôs a bed only property. Once you take that into account, everything will fall in place. I wish I had that picture clear before booking, and I would have avoided all the heartburn.

And now the review

Property ‚Äì It‚Äôs a 5 suite standalone building, with no lift, very narrow stairs, no reception, no concierge, no common area, no, lobby etc in the prime touristy Temple Bar Area. That‚Äôs makes it a well located Guest House, nothing more & nothing less.

Check In ‚Äì We landed in Dublin and shooted out to the hotel to drop our bags (we were informed that baggage can be dropped post 9:00 AM). Upon arrival at 9:30, we were greeted with a locked door. Knocked it, rang it, called the number given on the mail, even did ‚ÄúAbra ‚Äìka-Dabra‚Äù but the door didn‚Äôt budge. Helplessly we packed our bag in our car and headed out to Wicklow mountains. We got a call at 5:00 PM, while we were on our way back, asking us whether we‚Äôre going to check in today or not coz, check is allowed only till 5:30, after which the housekeeper leaves for the day. Luckily we made in just in Time.

Room ‚Äì Spacious, dated upholstery, carpets, sofas and towels. Few Quirky Knick knacks for decoration. Okayish bathroom, with minimal shower power.

Food ‚Äì No in-house restaurant. Remember, it‚Äôs a guest house!!!!!

Check out ‚Äì Smooth. Drop your keys in the drop box shooo away.",2,2017,09,13
225,Not acceptable!,"The Merchant House wants to benefit by getting bookings through Booking.com, but doesn‚Äôt want to abide by Booking.com‚Äôs clearly stated 24-hour grace period cancellation policy ‚Äì Not acceptable!

We booked a room through Booking.com, but soon realized from reading Tripadvisor reviews that the difficulties leaving luggage in the morning would not suit our early arrival from the US to Dublin. So we cancelled well within the 24-hour cancellation period that was explicitly stated. Well, the hotel would have none of that, and informed us that ‚Äúunfortunately‚Äù they had already charged our credit card! And so I had to spend many hours dealing with this annoying problem. Booking.com was supportive, but it still took a number of phone calls, emails etc. to get our money back, which we ultimately got from Booking.com, not the hotel. Getting it back from this obnoxious hotel is now Booking.com‚Äôs problem.

Just judging from the brief correspondence we had with The Merchant House staff ‚Äì in stark contrast to the consistently lovely hotel staffs we dealt with absolutely everywhere else in Ireland ‚Äì I would warn anyone against going near this place. 

",1,2017,09,11
225,Bram Stoker,"Stayed here early last summer, it was a strange check in procedure. We were left waiting outside with another couple for about 20 minutes before someone came to let us in. Very cramped welcome space but the room we got was lovely and spacious with excellent amenities. The only downfall was the sky light in the ceiling with no cover.  As it was during the summer it was very bright from quite early on and that did wake us up. The hotel is very charming and excellent location. Very good soundproofing too. ",3,2017,09,11
225,No issues with Temple Bar,"Spent 3 nights at this centrally located accommodation 
Did not experience any issues with the surrounding pubs and in fact this location made it easy to access all areas of Dublin by foot
We walked to the Jameson distillery,
Both of the pedestrian shopping streets along with a number of good restaurants and pubs to choose from. Did not have 1 negative opinion of the room or the location ",5,2017,08,19
225,Nice stay in a great location!,"The Merchant House has an amazing location, situated right in the middle of Temple Bar. The location, however, is not near the noisier pubs and nightlife of Temple Bar which makes it even more attractive. 

Be forewarned, however, that there is no on-site management or a ""front desk."" You need to set up an appointment prior to arriving and someone meets you on the street in front of the Merchant House. All worked out well for us, but is a tad unnerving when you arrive in a strange city and see the front door to the hotel locked up! Regardless, a man met us on the street and let us store our luggage inside until our rooms were ready. 

It should also be noted that there is no air conditioning. Although a fan is provided, it did little to help out with warmth that seemed to gather in the upper floor rooms. 

But, small complaints aside, we really did enjoy the location and the room at the Merchant House! The room had charm and we felt that the noise was minimal compared to other locations in Temple Bar.",4,2017,07,19
225,"Nice room with a few quirks, limited service.","Stayed one night in the W.B. Yeats Suite. The room was spacious for 2 and well-equipped except for one peculiar thing: no bath soap. We were told that the management considers it wasteful. There are stairs, but we knew that ahead of time. With the double windows, we were not bothered by street noise on a Wednesday. Anyone arriving on an early morning flight should be aware that the staff will not accept luggage before 9:30 AM, no exceptions. If you want an early start on your arrival day, pick another hotel. The hotel is convenient to airport and tourist buses and within walking distance to many attractions.",4,2017,07,15
225,Very Disappointing ,"Chose hotel for King size bed..they actually gave measurements..and position in Dublin Temple Bar. Bed is a basic double. Pillows need replacing. 
The actual rooms are quite cut but busy. You need to know all rooms up narrow stairway. The day minder will help with luggage. 
Position is perfect. Sleeping..nit so great. Nosy at night. They supply earplugs.
We stayed twice. Each for 2 nights. .first time black out and noone did anything for over 4 hours ..even though I rang the provided number..was told not on duty that day. So we left with no coffee. Disappointing! 
Next 2 nights.  I had asked for the single bed to be made up for the return stay. Not done. Had to ask again. It is exceptionally uncomfortable.  Again pillows provided just awful.
On return from day trip on our last night we returned to a room that hadn't been serviced. So wet towels unmade beds and again no coffee for the morning. 
We had to leave by 5 am for flight to Europe.  Again they disappointed. I rang the manager and was told too late..nothing could be done. 
I would suggest for the price there are other places in the same are you could stay. 
Ireland and Dublin are wonderful. Pity the accommodation wasn't  as stated on booking.com",2,2017,06,18
225,Luxury?,"This accommodation has great location for Temple Bar party. This was one of the main reasons for booking. It is a special accommodation for sure, but not luxury as they advertise. We booked Oscar Wilde suite for one night to celebrate our wedding anniversary in Dublin. Comminication with The Merchant House was fine. We got confirmation fast as well as few other emails from them. There was friendly and helpful young gentleman waiting for us when we arrived. Our room was upstairs. There is quite a climb upstairs with luggage, you need some physical strenght for doing it. Especially when temperature is hot. Room is nice and quite large. Decoration is nice if you like old  things as we do. Bathroom is far away from luxury. It is quite small and toilet is in a same space. All sounds from there can be well heard everywhere in a room. Luckily window in a bathroom can be opened.
Breafast cafe round the corner was fine and worth paying. 
We were happy about everything, but if you lok for luxury you will have to book something else.",3,2017,06,04
225,Tranquility in Temple Bar Area,"Stayed in the beautiful Oscar Wilde Suite at the top of the building. It was immaculate, with everything you could wish for. Charming Christian warmly greeted us & explained everything professionally & helpfully, as well as waved us goodbye at end of our long weekend stay. Our friends stayed in the romantic Bram Soker room on the 1st level & they were as equally delighted with their room as we were. It is a little luxurious gem and oasis of calm in the middle of fun & wild Temple Bar district & gives easy access to the riverside & the many attractions on offer. We had a freedom of Dublin 3 day pass, which we picked up easily from the airport & that gave us the Airlink Express to the city, the hop on/off tourist bus and public buses all over Dublin. Great value. We've had a blast & will return to this accommodation without hesitation. Highly recommend.",5,2017,05,29
225,Terrific central location very safe,James Joyce room faced the street and was lovely BUT not for light sleepers on a noisy weekend.  We enjoyed the very nice coffee machine : Keurig style. The bed and linens were very comfortable.  We were very near major attractions.,4,2017,05,24
225,Best location in Temple Bar,"We really enjoyed our two nights staying in the Bram Stoker room at the Merchant House.  This room is only up one flight of stairs and has less exposure to the street, so it was pretty quiet. We used a white noise app on our I-pad and slept very well, no ear plugs necessary.  Even on Saturday night, sleeping was not an issue at all.  The room is large and very well equipped.  It was very clean and the bed and pillows were extremely comfortable.  The bathroom was large and immaculately clean. Communication with the staff was easy via email and check-in and out were a breeze.  You honestly can't find a better place to stay in Temple Bar.  Just minutes walk to everything.  We took a taxi right to the front door to and from the airport for about 25 euro each way.",5,2017,05,15
225,Dissapointed,"I have written many reviews about hotels and restaurants and never gave 1 star.  Sadly I had to do it with The Merchant House.  My husband and I planned our 30 year wedding anniversary trip to Ireland and were to stay at The Merchant House for our first night in Dublin.  My husband was injured and needs surgery so we had to cancel the entire trip.  All of the hotels and airlines worked with us and gave us back our money 100%, even if they were Non refundable.  We have a note from the Doctor stating he cannot travel.  The Merchant House did not refund the money and want to charge us $199.  Very sad and disappointing with this customer service.  We will visit Ireland next year, however The Merchant House will not be in our plans.  They said they would give us a discount on next booking, however I would rather not  stay at this place.",1,2017,05,07
225,Oscar Wild Room,"Firstly let me say that the standard of this room was excellent, very clean and the staff we're on their game the whole four days we occupied it and even kept our cases safe in the hallway due to our evening return flight. This particular room is at the top of a flight of stairs from memory it's about 6/7 flights and with a large case it's a very tight towards the top what I'm trying say is if you struggle with stairs I recommend stopping in a lower room. The bathroom although amazing isn't very private with a see through frosted glass facade. The room does have double glazed windows but unfortunately the right hand side one was missing with a note on it from management say we're sorry for the double glazed window missing on this window it's currently under repair but wasn't that bothered because the room was very warm and felt it was a minor issue untill it came to night time and did we find out why there where ear plugs conveniently placed at the side of the bed. Opposite our room on the other side of the street which if you leaned out of the widow you could of probably touched with a cloths line prop, is a night club that's open till 6am and its rammed all over the weekend so much so it spills out onto the street and can be heard even with the ear plugs in but I suggest you have one more Guinness to help you sleep through it. The breakfast we booked with the room was at a restaurant at the bottom of the street called Als Stage Door and its worth it just for the advise and recommendations from Alan his breakfast is legendary. Cheers mateüëç",3,2017,04,19
225,Ear plugs provided!!,"The Merchant House apartments are located between a sex shop and Thai message parlour in the centre of Temple Bar. For those who don't know Temple Bar Dublin, it is ideally located for the river, castle and shops. It is also surrounded by hundreds of bars and restaurants who all play live music from early to very late! Hence my review title!
The rooms in the Merchant House fortunately have very good double glassing and the facilities are excellent. They also have an arrangement with The Stage Door Cafe for excellent Irish breakfasts. The owner Eric is worth a visit just for his blarney!",4,2017,04,09
225,Would happily visit again,"What an excellent town house and what excellent, considerate service.

I ended up travelling alone and was on a flight delayed late into the evening.  I knew that there was no reception at the Merchant House.  As a women travelling alone, this bothered me but Christian stayed until I arrived and made sure I was safe and settled.

I stayed in the Bram Stoker room; a comfortable and well decorated room with a lovely bed.

I was aware of some music and some early morning cleaning outside on the street but it didn't disturb me.

The Merchant House is a beautiful gem in the middle of Temple Bar.  So convenient and so nice to return to.

I will come back again so I can show it off to my husband.",5,2017,04,03
225,Great 3 night stay .,"We booked the Bram Stoker room for 3 nights as part of a football match visit to Dublin and we were not disappointed . We arrived about 4.30pm on Thursday night and were met and shown up to the room and everything was explained on arrival .

Room has all you could ask for including a very comfortable bed and the Merchant House is ideally located in the heart of Dublin's famous Temple Bar area , good soundproofing but we were woken early on the Sunday morning from the outside noise of Eustace Street being cleaned .

We took up the breakfast option which was served just around the corner in a little caf√© called The Stage Door which is very traditional , serves great food and the staff are all very friendly .

The only slight complaint we had from our 3 night stay was that somehow we were charged for 2 x deposits but only the 1 was actually taken into consideration when the final payment was deducted . This was quickly resolved over 1 phone call and didn't in anyway spoil our enjoyment and a great visit .

I would definitely recommend the Merchant House and next time we visit Dublin will not hesitate in trying to book there 1st . Da Iawn from Wales .",4,2017,03,28
225,St. Patrick's Festival Home Base,"Location, location, location!  We were guests at The Merchant House for 6 nights during the St. Patrick's Day Festival last week.  

Central to everything and in the heart of the city.  A few minutes walk to the historical landmarks, great restaurants, lively pubs, and public transportation.  We were half a block from the parade and it doesn't get any better than that.

If the perfect location isn't enough, just wait until you experience the warm welcome from the staff and the charming decor of the suites.  

The Merchant House is 200+ years old and has tons of character. While there is no reception on site, you want for nothing. The  friendly staff are only steps away and can be reached via the intercom. While there is no lift in a building this age, we were
met upon arrival by Kristian who gladly carried our luggage up the stairs to our well-appointed suites. He gives detailed instruction on how everything works.  
 
I stayed in the James Joyce Suite on the first level above the street. The party was in full swing outside in the street and the bar across from us as one might expect during the festival.  I had anticipated sleepless nights in the heart of the Temple Bar area but that wasn't the case at all.  With the double windows, shades and drapes, the noise didn't bother me in the least.

The complimentary wifi was fast and I was able to easily connect to my job in Texas and work when necessary.  The Nespresso coffee maker, hot pot and complimentary coffee and tea were an appreciated bonus.  There was no need to take photos of the suite as it was exactly as depicted on the website.  Beautifully decorated with a warm, welcoming feel of arriving home at the end of the day. The bed was so comfortable that I regretted getting up most mornings.  

My daughter and friend stayed in the Oscar Wilde Suite that was five flights of stairs up and they were equally as pleased.  I will leave that review to them.

We enjoyed our stay so much that we forfeited pre-paid rooms at another hotel to spend another night at The Merchant House. That alone should be an indicator of how impressed we were with The Merchant House.  This isn't the typical hotel experience and I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else if I am blessed enough to return to Dublin.",5,2017,03,25
225,Great Stay,"Very nice, very clean & home-like rooms. Lovely bathrooms. The first night we had some trouble with a window that wouldn't close but the staff were lovely and solved the problem as fast as they possibly could by taking us to another room for the night which was also very nice! ",5,2017,03,21
225,Stunning,Beautiful place in heart of Temple Barrett.  The attention to detail in suites was stunning. I booked 2 rooms for myself and 3 daughters and was overwhelmed by how fantastic the rooms were. We had the WB Yeats and Oscar Wilden suites. Owners very friendly and rooms spotless. They will even look after your bags for you the day you arrive and the day you are leaving. Couldn't ask for more. Breakfast at the Stage Door eatery which is prearranged is fantastic with excellent hosts. Will definitely be back üçÄüçÄüçÄ,5,2017,03,15
225,"Great place, almost perfect !","Amazing location, in the heart of the ""action"". Very clean, outstanding warm design. 
To improve; 
1. Breakfast was served in a nearby restaurant, very stylish but extremely limited menu. If you stay for more than three days, food would be boring ;(
2. Underfloor heating in the shower area didn't work around the clock. 

Otherwise- a perfect place !",4,2017,03,09
225,"I will arise and go now, straight back here!","Stayed in the W.B Yeats suite for two nights off peak in January.  Large room with walk in shower, street facing with double glazing but light sleepers may need to avail of the complimentary ear plugs, noise didn't bother me personally.  Steep stairs, not for crutch users or those with bad knees/hips.  Lovely for a romantic stay in beautiful Dublin.  True irish feel, W.B Yeats literature in the room and everything!  Highly recommend for a lovers retreat!  ",5,2017,01,23
225,Perfect little hideaway,"Excellent location, right in the middle of Temple Bar and yet so quiet. Good security, excellent manager in Chris who went above and beyond to accommodate any request. 
Room was stunning down to every little last detail, beautifully decorated, comfortable bed and great sized bathroom. 
Would stay here again and highly recommend.
",5,2017,01,22
225,No refund,"I have stayed here on many occasions - I booked at 11 this morning only to have to cancel at 1pm due to a family emergency & be told they would not refund me my ‚Ç¨160, a ‚Ç¨160 that has already been taken from my card although it said on e-mail that it was payable at hotel. I cannot believe the inhuman way this has been handled. I will never stay here again & wont recommend it to anybody. I'm furious that in a 2 hour spell they cannot take a cancellation in goodwill & return me my money that in fact they shouldn't have even received yet. Poor poor business decision.",1,2016,12,31
225,"Lots of plusses, however some improvements possible ","We really liked the location a lot. Right in the heard of temple bar area. The room was extremely quiet. No noise at all from outside! Clean and well designed Stoker room. Takes 35 minutes with an air coach or air link for 10-12 euro per return ticket. Walk from busstop is max 10minutes. Improvements: the matras was not really flat anymore. The shower temperature is not very stable (has to do with low pressure). Temperature in room is a bit low. They provide an extra Dyson heater but perhaps they can prolong the heating settings. Lastly the advice about transport from airport to the city was taking a taxi instead of the air coach bus due to road works. This was no problem at all. So we were surprised about this. Wrong advice. 
But all in all for 165 per night we would still go there again. The check in is based on appointment. This worked well. We landed on 12:35 and arrived at the hotel at 14:00. Just email or call them with a changed schedule. See pictures for impressions on good state of room. They arranged tickets for the hop on hop off bus.   ",4,2016,12,29
225,spacious comfort in the thick of the action in dublin city centre,"this is a quiet, comfortable historic town house in Dublin's Temple Bar. You are a few minutes from dublin castle, Trinity College and Christchurch Cathedral so very central. It is not a serviced hotel but it has spent a bit of time thinking through everything you might need to ensure a comfortable stay. my room, W.B. Yeats room was very comfortable. I could hear people arrive late up above me but it didn't last long. It is not a power shower for good reason but otherwise it had a nice mini bar and a great reading and desk space - if you had to do a bit of work in the room it is perfectly set up for it and I think most people would be happy to spend a few hours here.",5,2016,12,08
225,Pleasant experience,"Arrived at the Merchant House, and to say it was unexpected was an understatement, as I suppose I was expecting the more traditional type service, but can say it was a nice room and served us well, nice and roomy and good blackout blinds, it was quite loud but with a few drinks its not that noticeable, bed was super comfy also..",5,2016,12,04
225,Excellent Room in Excellent Location,"In heart of Temple Bar area.  We had the James Joyce suite.  Windows were excellent for keeping out sound.  Comfy bed, good shower, very clean.  Checkin is at 2 pm - no earlier - we arrived around 1:00pm, but our luggage was kept until we returned.  Did not have the breakfast package.  Would recommend.",5,2016,10,12
225,Quiet place to stay in Temple Bar,"Well-appointed rooms in a super central location, friendly and helpful staff. Low water pressure, no kitchenette (does have a minibar&coffee/tea maker) but for the rest very comfortable and quiet in the middle of Temple Bar. ",4,2016,10,01
225,I have the simplest tastes. I am always satisfied with the best.,"What a find! Firstly, don't be concerned about Temple Bar noise as this charming guest house is fully double-glazed.
We arrived early but it was not an issue as the gentleman who met us, took our bags & when we returned at the specified time, we were taken up to the Oscar Wilde suite (top floor).

Exceptionally clean with plenty of space, a seating area with TV & DVD player (a number of DVD's to boot too), comfortable bed and ample bathroom space behind a frosted glass door.

The only minor negatives - no Bath, but then the area does suffer with low water pressure and so you can understand why and my wife suggested some moisturiser with the toiletries would be nice...clearly a girl thing.

The breakfast we had as part of a deal down the road was very tasty too and so if you're looking for a special place to stay in the heart of Dublin, seriously consider the Merchant House...we will once more next time we're visiting. ",5,2016,09,27
225,Luxury in the heart of Temple Bar,"Excellent little B&B with gracious hosts - the Bram Stoker room was the perfect size and the location couldn't have been any better.  Within walking distance of a huge amount of things to see, shopping, the ubiquitous pubs, or just plain people watching.   Highly recommend this B&B for couples.  Access might be a little tight for families but still doable.   ",5,2016,09,13
225,Beautiful Introduction to Dublin,"We arrived weary on a late Wednesday night, after more than 26 hours in transit and 22 hours flying direct from Australia, and it was an absolute pleasure to arrive at such delightful accommodation and to have such a warm welcome by the housekeeper and effortless check in process. It was like arriving home! We stayed in the James Joyce Suite, and the first thing that impressed upon us was the charm and size of the room - beautifully appointed, with finishing touches that demonstrated a real consideration for the comfort of guests. The big beautiful windows are double glazed, and we experienced no discomfort with noise being in the heart of the Temple Bar, and this is coming from an incredibly light sleeper! The young gentleman that greeted us, was more than accommodating in ensuring all our questions were answered and directions provided for our following day of sightseeing Dublin. We utilised the discount voucher provided to us for dining at the La Caverna restaurant, which was exquisite Italian food, as was the breakfast recommendation a short stroll away in the morning. A wonderful central location for exploring Dublin on foot, and for enjoying beautiful homely accommodation. Would definitely recommend this place to family and friends, and would stay again if returning in the future.",5,2016,09,04
225,The best stay of our entire trip,"We stayed here for two nights during our 22-day vacation, and it was not only the nicest place we stayed during our journey but also the nicest place I think we've ever stayed! We loved how it's been updated and modernized while maintaining much of the original architecture, like the brick fireplaces. We arrived late because we'd popped over to see family in England and our Ryanair flight didn't allow us to get there until about 7 p.m. A young lady had waited for us to get us settled in and didn't make us feel as if we'd put her out at all. She also took time to show us all around our suite and show us how everything worked, rather than rushing through it because of the time. The W.B. Yeats suite was massive. We were located in the heart of the Temple Bar district, but the double glazed windows allowed us a sound sleep. However it was also great fun to open the windows and watch all the action from above for a while. Since we were staying two nights, I got to unpack and settle in. There were plenty of drawers and a wardrobe. There was a hairdryer and iron/ironing board. There is a bottle of wine and plenty of snacks in the room, but you'll be charged for them so be aware. The Nespresso machine, however, is no extra cost and they provided pods of several varieties for us to enjoy, which we did each morning and afternoon. There's a TV with several channels, and they provide a wide variety of DVD movies you can watch if you want to miss out on the fun of Dublin. The bathroom is divided from the rest of the suite by an etched glass door, so you may feel a little exposed; however the suite is big enough that we could give each other privacy. A huge shower that meant I could finally shave my legs without being a contortionist. There was also a shelf in the shower, which is normal here in the US but we hardly ever found any as we traveled all over Ireland. The towels were thick and soft, and they provided washcloths which was also a luxury in Ireland. The bed was super comfortable, with lovely bedding. My only problem the whole time was finding a place to put on my makeup that allowed me to get close to the mirror and have enough lighting. I figured it out by putting the makeup mirror they'd provided onto a side table that I placed next to the window so I could use the natural light, and I just sat on the floor. Viola! And while the noise from outside is well muffled, the people who were staying in the room above ours were related to elephants so the first morning we were woken rather early by them. The young man who cleaned up our room each day was from Croatia and incredibly friendly and accommodating. He insisted on carrying our bags down the stairs for us, and he was happy to hang onto them after we checked out so we could continue to explore Dublin some more. I could easily see not only a return visit to The Merchant House, but actually staying a whole week and using it as command central for our next vacation to Ireland. A luxurious stay that makes you feel like royalty, in a place that's very centrally located to anywhere you'd want to go, and while it may be a bit more than some hotels, it's not exorbitant.",5,2016,08,31
225,Wonderful stay,"We spent one night in the Oscar Wilde Suite and it was all we were looking for and more. The suite is big, cosy, luxurious and extremely quiet. The hotel is located within the Temple district which can get very busy at night, but we did not hear one single noise and slept like babies, I highly recommend this room for light sleepers, as it lies on the highest floor (4th). However, as the building is a historical one, an elevator cannot be fit in so you should be aware of this in case you decide to book it, older people might have a hard time walking up and down the stairs. The hotel is just a short walk away from Dublin's main tourist attractions so it was perfect for us as we just had one day to spend there. We were warmly welcomed and shown around the building by Malcolm and his trainee. Definitely one of the best accomodations in  Dublin! Well done to the entire staff!",5,2016,08,10
225,Ideal location and accommodation,"We stayed here for one night and cannot complain about one aspect of our stay, the housekeepers were very welcoming nothing was too much trouble.  Spotlessly clean.  The breakfast was served at a restaurant at the end of the street and was faultless again staff very welcoming.  We would stay here again and would recommend to family and friends",5,2016,07,20
225,Lovely stay,"We stayed in the Oscar Wilde Suite; beautiful furnishings & in close proximity to all the bars, restaurants, & points of interest in the area (Trinity College). Staff was very accommodating with holding our luggage until check-in time. Would recommend staying here.",4,2016,07,15
225,"Beautiful, Spacious & Stylish","Like others have mentioned, this is right in the Temple Bar area.  Parking is a few blocks away.  It's loud deep into the night, but only if you have the windows open.  It's plenty quiet with them closed.  

Our room looked even better than its online pictures.  It was large and had a new modern bath with lots of stone and glass.  The bed was great, they have plenty of reasonable snacks and good coffee.  It was more like a stylish apartment in the city (minus a kitchen).  We stayed for a weekend, but would be comfortable staying much longer and would book there again.  

The young woman who met us and let us in was very helpful and friendly. She made sure that we had everything we needed before leaving (there is no front desk).  This place is perfect if you prefer to stay in places that are more like large private apartments rather than a hotel which may include amenities (parking, restaurant, fitness center, concierge), but smaller rooms.

This place is very unique.  If a private space in a bustling area is what you're looking for, this is it.  No complaints here, we loved it.",5,2016,07,13
225,A great stay! ,"We stayed in June at the Merchant House and had a fantastic weekend. Our suite was called the James Joyce Suite and overlooked Eustace Street. There was plenty of amenities supplied in the room (free tea, coffee, bottled water) which was great. Granted, there was some noise during the night from outside but not enough to put us off staying again. The breakfast the next morning was lovely and only a short stroll from The Merchant House. We can't wait to return! ",5,2016,07,06
225,"Great location, luxurious room","The Merchant House is a great place to stay for touristing in Dublin.  It's a short walk from the airport bus (very convenient), walking distance to many of the key sites and right in the heart of Temple Bar.  The room was very comfortable -- well appointed with a great bed (we were in the Yeats room).",5,2016,06,23
225,Hidden Gem ,"Fantastic little place to stay. Right in the heart of temple bar  so everything right at your fingertips.  Lovely warm welcome  really clean and inviting room( brahm stoker) nice breakfast in little cafe down road all included. Could not fault our stay. Will defiantly return soon 
Thank you so much ",5,2016,06,01
225,Stunning room with nice little extras,"I booked the James Joyce Suite as an anniversary present for my husband and I couldn't have booked a better place to stay.

We were greeted by a lovely host that showed us around our suite. The suite was large, with three rooms - the bedroom, a dressing area, and the bathroom. The rooms were well equipped with a comfy bed, lots of storage space, a great hair dryer, a large desk area and a Nespresso machine. There were also a few extra touches that made it stand out from the rest, such as an umbrella. The Wifi worked perfectly throughout our stay.

A perfect location for sightseeing. It's a busy area, but we had no problems with external noise.",5,2016,06,01
225,Best city centre accommodation.,"I stayed here with my husband three nights earlier this month. The accommodation was beautiful. The housekeeping staff were very friendly and helpful. Temple Bar can be very noisy and busy at night and we had a night club just over the ally but the double glazing worked a treat and we heard no noise. We were at the top of the building in the Oscar Wilde suite. If you have a problem with lots of stairs this may not be the one for you. The Bram Stoker and James Joyce suites are on a lower level and all four suites in the building are beautiful. If you would like a breakfast the Merchant House have an arrangement with a restaurant only 1 min walk from them. The breakfast's were good as was the choice.
We loved Dublin even though it is very touristy lots of tat in the gift shops! Can recommend a trip to the Guinness Brewery and Trinity College to see
 the Library and the book of Kells. If you like steak FX Buckley on Crow Street is the place to go, Buckley's is a butcher with there own restaurant you will need to book we were lucky we arrived at the same time as a booking of 10 who were down to 8.
A very memorable visit for all the right reasons ended by a concert at the Arena to see the Dixie Chicks!",5,2016,05,22
225,Brilliant,"A fabulous venue for music. We went three times and each time there was a different act performing. The food was good, service was excellent and the beer was the best served in Dublin. Fantastic selection.",5,2016,05,17
225,Really Nice ,"Great spot in the the heart of the city if you are looking for good quality rooms at the right price this is the place for you decor really good comfortable bed high level of cleanliness every thing you need is thought of 
Welcoming Staff very friendly and informative cleaning Staff excellent and very helpful 
We will be back thanks ",5,2016,04,26
225,Everything they promise is true ,"It's located just perfect, after I've booked it some people said that oh my god, Temple Bar, u can never sleep there. That is not true, we had Oscar Wilde Suite and there was absolutely no noise what so ever. It's really cool that u have ur own keys and total privacy to come and go as u please. Bed is great, it's really clean and looks exactly like on the photos. Everything is close by, bars, restaurants, shops, theatre and so on. I cannot imagine better place to stay. Only thing I would say, since its     an old building and the water pressure is low in the area, shower is a little weak but it's so small thing compared to all the good. 
Loved the notebook, thank you very much :)",5,2016,04,23
225,Customer service,"I am never one to make a complaint but the way I was spoke to by one of the staff members in this hotel made me compelled to make my complaint heard, I was due to stay in this hotel on the 8th of April and was very much looking forward to it as it was for a 1st year anniversary with my girlfriend. A couple of days before arrival I was made aware that my card had declined payment (I thought it was pay on arrival) so I phoned to get the issue resolved. I was met by a man on the other end of the phone shouting and arguing with me and telling me how I should have responded to his email (I was in work and didn't see it) when I asked couldn't I sort it out now over the phone he actually told me he didn't want my business and to reply quicker to him and then he hung up. I have never met such bad manners for customer service in all my life and it defiantly has put me off ever looking at this place to stay in again.",1,2016,04,05
225,Amazing Suite - Brilliant Stay,"We stayed in Dublin for St Patrick's day, and we chose the Merchant House based on its ideal location in the heart of Temple Bar, and it's excellent feedback from previous guests.

We stayed in the Oscar Wilde suite on the top floor, which was absolutely beautiful - wonderfully decorated, and a great open airy space - comfortable and spotless.

Despite the St Patrick's day party going on late into the night - you really couldn't hear much at all through the secondary glazed windows - and we both slept perfectly.

The suites themselves are superb - we will definitely stay again - and encourage anyone looking for a nice place to stay in Dublin to give the Merchant House a go!

",5,2016,03,18
225,Wow!,"What a great little find. Husband booked this for a weekend break in Dublin but we could only get it for one night. It's a hidden gem (sandwiched between a Thai massage parlour and a fetish shop) but don't let that put you off! Just off Temple Bar it's noisy outside but the additional glazing overcame that issue inside and there was no noise to disturb our sleep. The suites are something else, quirky, imaginative with the space and well stocked with little extras such as walnut whips (to purchase but where else would you find these in a hotel room?).  Bed lovely and comfortable. The Housekeeper was lovely, keeping our bags for us, selling us bus tour tickets and even retrieving our passports and car keys we'd left in the safe!  Really didn't want to review this place as I'd like to keep it our little secret!",4,2016,03,06
225,Top class hotel,Stayed here for 1 night. Top class hotel. Definitely a hotel to mark an occassion. Stayed in the James Joyce suite room was excellent. Right in the heart of Temple bar. Public car parking a stones throw away from hotel. Would highly recommend this hotel & would return here again.,5,2016,03,05
225,Good location & lovely room,"Visited in February for three nights. This hotel is literally a stones throw away from the Temple Bar pubs and night life but you cannot hear a peep once you are inside your room. Stayed in the Bram Stoker Room - lovely d√©cor, incredibly comfortable bed. One minor niggle is the shower pressure but this is explained that hotels in Temple Bar area are not allowed to be power showers so is at absolutely no fault of the hotel.

Both members of staff we encountered were very pleasant and very helpful. Room cleaned daily. No breakfast available but you are given the opportunity to use a restaurant just around the corner (and if this doesn't take your fancy there is Costa a couple of doors down).

Highly recommend!",4,2016,02,23
225,A jewel in the emerald isle,"A late review but still well deserved. We visited at Halloween weekend 2015. Checked into the Bran Stoker Suite and were so impressed with the attention to detail. after being met on arrival, we were briefed on how everything works and codes etc. This guesthouse does not have a manager on site 24/7. You come and go as you please although they can be contacted if required. The rooms have everything from snacks, mini bar, umbrella to borrow, a selection of DVDS etc. Comfy and totally sound proofed room (which is handy as this is bang in the middle of Temple Bar and the streets are LOUD and lively). Location wise, perfect! They don't serve breakfast in the guest house,  you visit a little Italian restaurant a minutes walk away. Their Irish breakfast is gorgeous! I cannot fault this place and would definitely return. 

For authentic Guinness and super friendly hospitality visit The Dame Tavern. Pat the landlord is the friendliest man on the planet. He will tell you all the places to go.  Fire restaurant is lovely for a special meal out on an evening.

Love Dublin!! Enjoy :-)",5,2016,02,17
225,OMG what a room !,"Lovely quirky, comfortable room, not much of a view but who cares ? Great location, right in the middle of Temple Bar which is great for pubs, clubs & restaurants. We were in the Oscar Wilde Suite which was on the top floor (57 steps) but definitely worth the effort. Breakfast (2 min. walk) was very nice. You must check out the shop downstairs ;-) ",5,2016,02,15
225,"Great room, in a great location, with great staff. Have I missed anything!?","My girlfriend treated me to a weekend in Dublin, seeing the sights, enjoying the nightlife, and visiting her relations. We had an absolutely epic time, and much of it was the suite we had and the location. 

The room: we stayed in the Oscar Wilde suite on the top floor. Absolute luxury feel to it, with beautiful decor and furnishings. Being on the top floor the noise from Temple Bar wasn't too bad, with the window open and at the height of the revelry. With the double-glazed windows firmly shut you'll hardly hear a peep. The bed was huge and very comfortable. The room was also very big, with plenty of seating for guests. It's the sort of suite you'll want to entertain in - on both our evenings we invited family back. This is something you wouldn't normally do in a typical hotel room. 

The location: one word - central. Right among the action in Temple Bar. If you're looking for great, and I mean great pubs, then you probably won't need to venture more than a few hundred metres! It's pretty close to everything we wanted to see for example, it was walking distance to the Guinness Factory, The City Hall, Christchurch Cathedral, the Huegenot 17th century cemetery, the main (and very impressive) shopping area, The Brazen Head (oldest pub in Ireland), The Shelbourne (hotel), Dublin Castle, and numerous places linked to The 1916 Easter Rising. 

As you can see, my girlfriend and I had a great time in Dublin and loved the hotel. We'll certainly be returning next time we're in Dublin. Finding this gem might be a problem the first time you visit. It has a very discreet gated doorway sandwiched between a Thai Massage parlour and a fetish sex shop. Absolutely true! BUT please don't be put off by this, you hardly notice unless you make a point of looking! We and our guests thought it was funny, and it made a good reference point when trying to locate the doorway each time we returned to our room! 

A mention about the staff member / cleaner Juliana. Absolute gem! Very polite and very helpful. Despite being a coffee addict I had trouble using the coffee machine, and Juliana instinctively picked up on this when tidying our room on our first day. In the evening we found a note from her giving clear instructions on how to use the machine. Now that's service. For us, Juliana tipped this hotel to a SIX star, however, that's impossible so we'll settle for awarding this woundeful hotel just the FIVE stars.",5,2016,02,01
225,Cosy rooms in a central location ,"I recently stayed at the merchant house for 2 nights with 3 other friends celebrating a friends 40th birthday . We had the James Joyce and WB yeates suites . We loved the location of being in the centre of temple bar , the river and nearby trinity college and grafton street college . We arrived in Dublin at 10am but the house keeper took our luggage and arranged to meet us later that day to check us in . Juliane was lovely and very friendly , she had taken our bags to our rooms and gave us a thorough tour of the rooms and all the facilities . The rooms are lovely , cosy and very comfortable . The beds are amazing and the rooms are immaculate . The rooms have everything might need , even down to an umbrella and clothes brush . We were not at all disturbed by noise despite being opposite a nightclub so don't let the location put you off if you want a quiet break . There is secondary glazing and earplugs if needed - we didn't need them at all . However if you want to party the best pubs are right on your door stop . The check out time of 12pm was very welcome after a late night and the housekeeper working that day helped with our bags and kept them for us until we needed to leave for the airport . We loved it here and will definitely return and recommend to friends . P.s the bathrooms are beautiful but not very private so make sure you are with someone you know well !! ",5,2016,01,26
225,Good location in temple bar!,"The hotel is very well located to visit the temple bar area! Very easy to connect to the airport too! You can visit everything by walking. The room are really spacious and very well decorated. The down point is that it's located in a very busy street just in front of a concert place. There is a very good isolation, but it can be noisy anyway. The hotel provides ear plugs if needed :)",4,2016,01,07
225,Great Room but big billing incident and obnoxious communication,"The room was great, the housekeeper very sweet, but after check out the manager tried to charge my credit card with 2 breakfasts we had at a nearby caf√© working with the hotel... Only problem is, we paid for those 2 breakfasts cash directly at the caf√©. Now the hotel's manager still states that we didn't pay for those. Obviously poor communication between the hotel and the caf√© and between the manager and the clients, implying we were dishonest people without even listening to our arguments. ",1,2015,12,31
225,Perfect,"Right in the middle of Temple Bar, within easy walking of main shopping centre, its the perfect location.
We were in the Oscar Wilde suite on the third floor and it was beautiful, gorgeous fireplaces, comfortable bed and great facilities.
The staff were very helpful and absolutely lovely, nothing was too much trouble, we will definitely be staying again on our next visit",5,2015,12,11
225,"Great location, Great stay!!!","Absolutely loved our 2 night stay here. This was our second trip to Dublin and last time we stayed a little further out so found the location this year fantastic. The suite (James Joyce) was beautifully decorated and furnished, loved how spacious the room and bathroom was. Very private and quiet, great staff who were so friendly and accommodating. Due to the location there is a lot of bars opposite, we got back at 1am and 2am and never heard a peep!!! If your looking for a lovely relaxing weekend and like to chill out between sites and bards this would be a lovely place to relax! Will definitely be coming back here for sure!",4,2015,12,04
225,Very comfortable in the heart of Temple Bar,"Very hospitable staff and great location for those who prefer to walk the city of dublin. One warning is parking is several blocks away, so be prepared if you drove to pay extra and walk a few extra blocks.

Otherwise, one of the nicest places we stayed while in Ireland. Despite how noisy Temple Bar can be, they have doublepaned windows, which kept the noice to a minimum. 

Extremely close to the nightlife and a short walk to Trinity College and other nearby sites.",4,2015,12,02
225,Quick but enjoyable stay.,"Stayed at the Merchant House for the final night of our Ireland Trip.  Flight was out early the next morning and, in lieu of turning in the rental car and staying near the airport, which would require cab/bus to and from downtown Dublin, we decided to stay in Temple Bar and take the cab early in the AM (proved to be no trouble due to the ""link"" app on the iPhone).
Hotel room was beautiful, very homey, and also fashionable (chic?).  Heated tile floors in the bathroom and a big soft bed (we only slept a few hours, though!).  A nice desk beside the bed and a Nespresso maker were definite plusses for me!
The rate is a bit high....around 150 euro for our night...so I would hesitate to book the hotel room again, especially for an extended stay.  However, that's mostly budge based, so if you have the money and want to be in Temple Bar, the Merchant House is where you want to be.   You walk out of the hotel/apartment and are right in the thick of things.",4,2015,11,18
225,Spacious and comfortable suite,Stayed three nights in this luxury suite in the heart of temple bar. Lots of room and very well appointed. We were greeted by the very helpful housekeeper who helped us with cases up the stairs. Extra glazing to keep out noise of vibrant area outside was effective.,5,2015,11,12
225,Artist's garret,"We had a lovely night in the Oscar Wilde room, an artist's garret in the attic of the house. A wonderfully decorated room, with quotes from the man himself all around. The room had a shower room and toilet (lower the blind so the neighbours can't see in), mini bar and tea and coffee facilities. Chocolates, drinks and snacks were available at reasonable prices. A fantastic location from which to explore Temple Bar, and a fine room. ",5,2015,11,10
225,Just perfect James Joyce,"Stayed in the James Joyce suite for my birthday/engagement weekend as wanted somewhere special. We weren't disappointed! Were greeted by a lovely friendly housekeeper and shown to our suite, and given our keys, breakfast and dinner vouchers, also a little James Joyce keepsake diary which was really sweet! The suite was beautifully laid out, super high ceilings, tasteful art on the walls and extremely comfortable king size bed.  Modern bathroom with spacious shower off the little entrance hall and Nespresso machine and very reasonable mini bar provided also. There's nothing wr could fault really, we were very warm and comfortable during our time there and the extra glazing certainly worked! You have the option of a 20% discount for dinner at a great Italian restaurant two blocks away. I would highly recommend this offer! The restaurant, La Caverna, is authentic in every way: the food delicious and well presented, reasonable and respectable wine list and efficient, friendly staff.  Breakfast is available just down the street, in Eliza Lodge. Juice, cereal, toast and a very tasty cooked breakfast with several options, including pancakes! Will definitely be back again and we'll done Merchant House üòä",5,2015,10,26
225,Spacious and comfortable,"We stayed one night in the Yeats suite and it was okay. The location is great (pretty much in Temple Bar) and I liked that they had double-paned windows - we didn't hear any noise from the street. However, the people staying in the suite above us came in really late and left really early, and we could hear everything - they were loud, clomping around (at least it sounded like it) and the floor/ceiling creaked with every movement. I don't know if it's like that in other suites, but that's an issue with the Yeats suite for sure. Also, if you're with a couple or solo, it's fine, but the bathroom door is partially frosted glass, so if you're with a friend or colleague (or even a new relationship), it may be a bit awkward. It was good value for money (we got a good rate on Booking.com) but I'm not sure if I'd stay there again. Maybe?",3,2015,10,18
225,Quiet gem in Temple Bar,"Stayed in the Bram Stoker suite which was clean, beautifully laid out with a modern bathroom and the only noise on the busy weekend we stayed there was from the clock ..which was eventually muffled by a couple of towels. Breakfast at cafe close by was also excellent. Before I checked out I had a quick peek at other suites which were bigger than the Bram Stoker with a little sitting room included at not much more in price...so will be booking one of those for next trip. Reception person was very welcoming and happy to answer any questions re restaurants, transport, weather etc. will be back.",5,2015,10,05
225,One night stay in the Oscar Wilde Suite,"When looking initially I was looking for a nice place to stay for my wife and I and overall we were not disappointed. There were a few minor things we thought would improve the room, there is a small mark in the shower tray, and it needs re caulking. Staying in High end rooms is all about perception, there is a nice bottle of red wine in the room in a high heel shoe make it complimentary along with a nice box of chocolates that would have been a nice touch, if you felt this would affect your margins too much then review your prices add the price of the items to the cost of the room no one would know.
One further observation take the breakfast option it's in the Italian corner restaurant approx. 100mtrs from the Merchant House, it was a fantastic breakfast fresh orange juice, cereal, followed by a lovely fried breakfast with toast and jams. Someone on here suggested eating at the stage door caf√© which we did the first morning we arrived it was the worst breakfast we have ever had and I have eaten at truck stops before, just saying.",4,2015,09,28
225,"Things to know: loud, busy guest house","First, it's a guest house, not a hotel. So it's basically a converted apartment building with a street side doorway (a cage door, then a giant door, then an airlock that smells like urine before a glass door with a code lock) into narrow halls, stairways, and no lift. With our 4 bags of luggage it was a bit daunting. There are no on-site services available though the attendant is very friendly and helpful. The rooms are indeed quite nice but this proved worthless to us for the following reason...

It's in the loudest, busiest part of Dublin, Temple Bar. There is a sex shop downstairs and a very loud and popular club across the street. The street (a narrow cobblestone alleyway) is surprisingly busy. The touted double windows did nothing to keep out the noise at night and even earplugs weren't enough.

Wife and I stayed in the James Joyce Suite on the first floor above ground facing the alley. It was a Saturday night in late September and the riotous din went All. Night. Long. Constant hooting and hollering with occasional yelling and foot ball chants, against various thudding sound systems. I thought it would quiet down by 2am, no big deal. Or maybe 3am. 4am?? By 5am the clubs had closed and the alleyway drum circles broke out.
Not a wink of sleep for either of us. It was so challenging after weeks of travel that we moved to the Westin without any hope of getting a refund for the two additional prepaid nights at Merchant House.

Maybe it's better during the week but I would only recommend this to people looking to party in the heart of party town. Giving three stars for nice rooms, good service, and the admission that it's not my scene but could be great for others",3,2015,09,28
225,In the center of things,"This is a beautiful guest house with only 4 rooms, and since there were 6 of us we had almost the whole place to ourselves. Each room is a period piece, very nicely decorated with every comfort you'll need - the beds are very comfortable and the bathroom floor is heated (which is incredible, i miss it at home), the staff, while not on-site, was very helpful and attentive to our needs. The only downside, and its what keeps me from giving this place an excellent rating, is the noise. The bad side of being in the center of things is that its loud, they have double windows and provide earplugs for sleeping, but the partying outside is impossible to block out and goes on well into the night. Temple Bar is an area known for its nightlife, so if you stay here, prepare to take the bad with the good.",4,2015,09,24
225,"Fantastic location, huge rooms",My husband and I stayed here for just one night as we only had limited time in Dublin.  Jorge met us and kindly took our bags up the stairs.  Our Oscar Wilde suite was huge with a very comfy bed and relaxed atmosphere.  Considering the central location in Temple Bar it the hotel was not noisy at all.  The closeness to great pubs and restaurants was a real winner for us and we would stay again.  Thanks Jorge!!,4,2015,09,22
225,Special treat for our anniversay,"I was a little worried since the Hotel doesn't have an elevator, but Jorge, met us at the door and helped us get all our luggage up to the top floor. What a magnificent room it was, with 2 fireplaces, a comfy sitting area and a huge modern bathroom. There was plenty of room to spread out our three suitcases, out of the walkways and still had space to relax on the sofa. They provided DVDs many of which were classic Irish films. In addition to coffee maker, there was an espresso machine. The second set of windows at each window opening completely eliminated any sound from the very noisy Temple Bar action below on the street. there was a fan in the room, which we used one night when it got a little warm with the windows closed. The hotel is on a side street in Temple Bar so it was very convenient to go out in the evening. I would definitely recommend it and hope to be able to return myself.",5,2015,08,31
225,Great location,"Great spot in city center.  Just one block from main bus routes.  Great service.  Offered to hold bags and then got room ready early for quick check in.  Good sq, but storage is not as much as it looks at first.  No separate room spacing to allow for movement without waking someone else.  Don't know if this exists in Europe.  Still, the lighting and carpeting help a lot in this regard and were able to have one get up early without waking the other. Bed was good.  If you were dead silent in room at night you could only faintly here some chatter on street.  This is a big win and any fan or music app easily covered the sounds.  Great value.  Bram stoker room. ",5,2015,08,29
225,A Weekend in Dublin,"The Merchant House is outstanding.  We were met by Jorge and dropped off our bags as we were a bit early.  We then explored Dublin and checked back in at 2pm.  The James Joyce suite is stunning and massive perfect size for a couple getting away and exploring Dublin.  You are in the centre of Temple Bar.

If you are visiting Dublin for a weekend and can get a room trust me you will not be disappointed.

Outstanding and thank you for a great stay.",5,2015,08,14
225,Fantastic accommodation in Dublin's temple bar ,"Very large fantastic suites. Rooms were so large they provided a homely feel. Large bathroom. Very well appointed. In the heart of temple bar so there is a little noise from the street, but I found this very minor and it didn't affect my stay at all. Being in the centre provides many dining and pub options right on the doorstep. Easy to walk to anything. Some noise from the suite above walking around, however this didn't distract from the quality of the suite and fantastic location. I would recommend. ",5,2015,08,13
225,Fantastic!,"I visited Dublin for my 21st birthday and wanted somewhere nice to stay and came across here on booking.com and was not disappointed! It exceeding expectations. We were met at the arranged time by A very helpful member of staff who then showed us to our room where we were pleasantly surprised. We love it! The had everything we could have wanted for the purpose of our trip. From underfloor heating, to a nice selection of drinks in the fridge to a very comfortable bed. It is very safe and secure and right in the middle of where the fun happens, however it is still quiet enough to get a good rest ready for the next day of adventures. My experience was made extra special by this hotel and when I return to Dublin again this WILL be where I'll be staying.",5,2015,07,31
225,Fur coat and no knickers,located above a fetish shop should have been a clue. In the party area we expected the are to be lively but night one was like having a brass band playing in your bedroom such was the lack of effectiveness of the secondary glazing. we were awake for four hours until the party ended. Night two was a Sunday but tonight we could not get to sleep simply because we were on a busy street - the noise of people moving around outside under the influence. The sleep was then awoken with the couple above us spending hours having noisy sex so illustrating that there is no sound filter between floors. Night four was a combination of upstairs orgasms and external noise. The intent to defraud - advising us that they had installed secondary glazing to ensure our stay was interrupted - was complete when we uncovered packets of ear plugs. Hardly what you expect for the money. The apartment is beautiful but when you have experienced sleep deprivation it clearly becomes more difficult to be balanced and embrace the environment. Plenty of Thai massage parlours ironically nestled near a church completed the strange set of experiences on offer. I suspect I would have slept more had I been with the homeless on the streets surrounding the property.,3,2015,07,23
225,Best place to stay in Dublin,"Having arrived after 30 hours of travel from Australia the Merchant House and our welcome by Julijana was wonderful. Easy to find after using the bus from the airport, we waisted no time to find a pub (of which there are many), and had some very nice ales (for medicinal purposes).
In the heart of Temple Bar was the best place to base ourselves for three days of exploring. 
Great location to sample the best of Dublin.
Thank you for the little gift too.",5,2015,07,21
225,A touch of class in the heart of the action,"I'd booked this as a surprise for my partner on the occasion of his birthday, which coincided with the last night of our mini tour of Ireland, and I was truly delighted with my find.

The location above a sex shop, the absence of a formal reception area, the lack of a bar or restaurant...none of these matters. It's impeccably decorated and furnished, really comfortable, has an affordable and really well thought out minibar as well as a guest fridge, and its location in the heart of Temple Bar would be hard to beat.

Having been met on arrival by George, we found him to be highly informative and really helpful. I'd prearranged 'bubbles' in our room and pre purchased tour bus tickets courtesy of Merchant House's advance communication and was delighted to find the tour bus stop no more than 150 yards from the front door. 

The triple glazed windows ensure minimal disruption from the lively activity going on all around and I would not hesitate to recommend this establishment to anybody looking for a touch of class in the heart of the action.",5,2015,07,18
225,"Good Stay, Some Minor Glitches","Stayed here midweek for 2 nights with my wife.
The room itself is a decent size, as is the bathroom. One minor gripe is that it is slightly overstating itself when it is advertised as a 'suite'. It is more a larger hotel room (although a good one at that - we stayed in the Bram Stoker room).
Everything that came with the room was to a very good standard and the underfloor heating in the bathroom was a nice bonus. On the other hand, no air con in the room was pretty uncomfortable and a sleep was not the easiest because of the heat.
Jorge (sp?) was very very good on arrival and check out. Very informative and helpful.
The area is perfect for Temple Bar although there are a few unsavouries hanging about that area who look like addicts, however, we didn't get any problems.
If I came back to Dublin, I would definitely consider the room again.",4,2015,07,05
225,Best Hotel in Dublin,I know so cliche but this was just beautiful. My wife and I wanted to move from our country to hotel to one in the Temple Bar area and we loved this hotel. We were worried the noise level would be high but we couldn't hear a peep from the outside. The wifi is okay but the charm in the Oscar Wilde room just cannot be matched. This is a must have (even for a day) if you love a great hotel.,5,2015,07,01
225,What a find!,"Stayed here for two nights in late June.  Absolutely loved it.  Easy to find an on arrival we were met by Jorge who showed us to our room, The Oscar Wild Suite on the top floor.  56 stair but totally worth it, the suite was fantastic.  Jorge kindly showed us around and let us know how things worked, before he left he gave us a small gift to remember our stay - a lovely touch.  The suite was huge, homely, relaxing and clean.   The bathroom was perfect with good toiletries and a nice big shower. The suite is very well soundproofed - we slept very well on both nights.  We didn't take breakfast as there are lots of restaurants and cafes nearby - the location is brilliant.  If we return to Dublin we will definitely be staying here again.  Thank you Merchant House (especially Jorge!). ",5,2015,06,29
225,Dublin Retirement Bash,"This complex is privately owned and is absolutely fantastic.  The trip was with family + best friend to celebrate my recent retirement.  Jorge (I think that was his name) was waiting for us to show us the 3 rooms that we had booked (2 per room).  The rooms were very spacious, exceptionally clean and stocked with both soft and alcoholic beverages which were reasonably priced. The bathroom was area was quite large with a good sized shower.  Next time I go I will take my wife with me as this is an ideal location to take advantage of both the night life and shopping. The Liffy is just 10 minutes away for a romantic stroll.  10-15 minute stroll also takes you to St. Stephen's park.",5,2015,06,26
225,Bram Stoker room perfect for a couple,"We stayed at the Merchant House a couple of weeks ago and had a brilliant time. There are some reviews on here which say the Bram Stoker room is too small, but we found it much bigger (and more homely) than most hotel rooms. Last year we stayed in a similar district of Paris and got a lot less room for a lot more money! 

Bearing in mind the central location of the Merchant House, we found the price very reasonable. As it is a guest house, it is more like staying in an apartment than a hotel or B&B - but we found this a refreshing and more genuine experience as out got us out and about in the city more. 

The room was really quiet considering we were in the middle of Temple Bar and I loved the remote controlled sky lights.

We would definitely stay here again!",5,2015,06,21
225,First class accomadation,"Just back from spending the weekend in the merchant house and it was the best guest house i have ever stayed in.

We were met by Jorge who was waiting at main entrance to greet us, Jorge was such a lovely person, he showed us to our room (carried by case up to top floor) and gave us a little gift after showing us around which was lovely.
Our room was the oscar wilde suite and it was simply the best. We were so happy with everything, whoever designed this layout was spot on with their layout and with everything else in this room.

If you like upmarket accomadation, then this is the guest house for you. You get what you pay for.

It was down an alley way but you were soon stuck for words when you arrived indoors.

Don't worry about the sex shop remarks, i was a bit worried about this but it's more like an Anne summers shop, so nothing to worry about.

Entrance was well secured.
There was no reception in building but this wasn't a problem, there was an intercom system to contact someone if needed.
There were refreshments to purchase at low prices in room.
There were lovely toiletries in bathroom which was fab.
Free water left everyday.
Breakfast, you need to walk to end of street, about 1 minute away, which was lovely.
We took the voucher to local italian were you get 20% off your bill which was lovely.

Maid visited on saturday and she put in 100% with cleaning her work was to a very high standard which was excellent, she was so polite and such a lovely person.

We will be visiting merchant house again soon, i don't think we would ever get anything better than the merchant house.

Bed was so so comfy
Triple glazing was a bonus
No noise heard at all

Thanks for a lovely weekend to all at the merchant house.",5,2015,06,14
225,Birthday Treat To Dublin,"Wow! Stayed at The Merchant House in Dublin for a Birthday treat for my husband's 50th. We arrived on Saturday 23rd - 27th May didn't know about the referendum for same sex marriages was taking place that day so explains why Temple Bar was mental. All good though.
Had emailed The Merchant House during week stating estimated time of arrival as these are Luxury Suites and therefore has no reception or bar/restaurant they send a member of staff to greet you.
Julianne met us and showed us to our suite - W B Yeats Suite on the 2nd floor. Well one word describes this suite WOW! It's stunning with extremely high quality furniture and gorgeous attention to detail with flower arrangements, mirrors,pictures and ornaments.
Julianna explained all to us and was so helpful with things to do over our few days so Thank You Julianna you were a great help.
The suite houses a luxurious bathroom and lovely hot shower,although this isn't a power shower it was still great pressure and wonderfully hot. The suite has a well stocked mini bar all reasonably priced and also a seperate guest fridge should you wish to use it. There are complementary tea and coffee facilities including a Nespresso Coffee machine again Julianna gave a master class of how to use this! Complimentary water and all the above were replaced daily and if you required your room serviced you simply left your prompt  hanging on the door. Nothing could be more simple.
The suite has two fireplaces which sit against a lovely brick wall, again mirrors above these were beautiful. There are plenty of lamps and light this pleased us as we like subtle lighting rather than huge bright lights. As I said the furniture was of high quality with all drawers and wardrobes having soft close doors and drawers.The Guest book gave you information if you needed to contact any member of staff out of hours or during the day. You are given your own set of keys and security codes to gain entry and lock up after herself. We also met Jorge he introduced himself and asked if everything was to our liking again very helpful and polite.
I paid for the breakfast option and as the suites don't have a restaurant you are given vouchers which you simply hand in each morning. The breakfast takes place about a minutes walk away from The Merchant House at the bottom of the road in Eliza Lodge. The staff were lovely and the Irish breakfast along with lots of toast and tea,coffee were a great start to a fun packed day. The breakfast restaurant is also an Italian and we ate a lovely meal there one evening so Thank You to all at Eliza Lodge.
Really didn't want to leave Dublin we met some lovely people enjoyed some great food and obviously enjoyed the odd pint of Guinness - what could be better! Thanks again to all.",5,2015,05,29
225,"Super location, Super Hotel, Super service!","We stayed at The Merchant House from Tue 28.05.15 for two nights and everything about the hotel was excellent. 

From meeting Jorge at check-in we knew the stay was going to be easy and hassle free as he was very accommodating with holding our luggage until we arranged a check-in time with him and he even had our room ready earlier than anticipated at 12noon.

We stayed in the top floor Oscar Wilde Suite and the room is huge with every appliance and amenity you would need for a pleasant stay. Some people have moaned on TripAdvisor about the 4 flights of stairs up to this particular room but it really isn't far or steep at all. 

The room is double sealed with two sets of windows to block out noise from the outside and it works. 

Location ... Couldn't be better. 
1min from Spar shop
1min from airport bus stop
1min from city sightseeing bus stop
0min from temple bar restaurants and bars
3min walk to river

Would highly recommend this particular suite and The Merchant House. 

Thanks to Jorge for excellent service and attention to detail with the room touches.",5,2015,05,28
225,Romantic Weekend in Dublin,"We stayed at the Oscar Wilde Suite. Great for a couple spending a few days in Dublin. Its located in the heart of the Temple Bar area. The room has double glazing etc.. so you can sleep even when folks are partying outside. Large comfortable room and lavish decor in a unique style. Well appointed with walk in shower, nespresso machine, mini bar. Breakfast was very tasty and served at a nearby restaurant.Staff very friendly as well. 

Do note however that this is not a hotel and staff are not permanently at a reception.(You can call them by an intercom for any issues) Also there is no lift and some of the Suites are 4 or 5 floors up so travelers with any walking issues should consider this as well.",4,2015,05,26
225,Heart of Tempe Bar,"On arrival we were greeted by a nice gentleman He showed us to our room on the top floor and carried my not so light suitcase up 4 flights of stairs. We stayed in the Oscar Wilde Suite. It was gorgeous. After a quick review on where everything he located, I was presented with a little small journal. Very nice unexpected welcome gift.  
The room had all the necessities we needed. It was clean and comfortable. This hotel didn't have breakfast onsite, but we didn't mind, we were in the center of Tempe bar distract and plenty of places to choose from. My husband and I were skeptical after reading the reviews regarding the Sex Shop next door.  But after much consideration we still decided to stay here. We were GLAD we did. Perfect spot to walk around Dublin. We didn't feel unsafe, as a matter a fact, having the two security doors made us feel safer.  The housekeeper was a very nice female that greeted us every morning as we left for the day.  As for the sex shop, there was nothing offensive on display. It resembled a lingerie shop. I never saw any sketchy characters hanging around in the 3 days we were here. Our stay was great and will recommend to all our family and friends.  Thank you Merchant House.",4,2015,04,30
225,BEWARE,"I reserved 2 suites for our group of 4 adults via Booking.com (we are in our 50's and 60's) hoping to enjoy a night in Dublin where we could have a nice dinner with friends. No mention of a party/ gathering or a reunion in my booking just that we were coming with our Australian friends, it was a birthday and we didn't need extra beds in the rooms. 

I cancelled directly after receiving 3 emails from the Manager, Mike Ryan. His confirmation ""welcome"" email consisted of such a lengthy rude and arrogant directive advising me and my friends that we should take our ""party"" to a local establishment (bar?) which would be more suitable for us. We were reminded not to smoke or break any rules or we would be heavily fined. We were also told in the emails that they had to ""deal"" with UK groups coming over for Hen and Stag nights hence his need to clarify his regulations. 
(I do not understand why he felt the need to communicate his bigoted stereotypical views about Britons to potential hotel guests) 
I immediately knew this was not the guest house for me and certainly would not wish to expose my Australian friends to such a rude management. 

I asked to cancel my reservation immediately and received yet another dismissive, rude and arrogant email where I was told I was over reacting and annoyed over nothing. He did agree to cancel the reservation via booking .com though and I received a confirmation email soon after. 

Having then read more reviews on Trip Advisor I thanked my lucky stars that I did not have to endure one night in that establishment even if it would be for free. Without ever having stepped foot inside I had an abysmal customer service experience. 
This manager only sees guests as a revenue source, an annoyance and has assumptions of bad behaviour from people he has never met. He does not see them as paying customers who expect to receive a polite welcome and a service oriented experience from the manager. 

The only recommendation I can give about this guest house is to approach with extreme caution.",1,2015,04,30
225,"Great Location, Beautiful room.","I am a literary fan and so this hotel was right up my street. We stayed in the W.B. Yates room and we loved it, the staff are very friendly and explained everything to us and showed us all the great places to go on the map as soon as we got there. They looked after our bags before and after our stay while we made the most of our time in Dublin. The hotel is in a great location right in the centre of Temple bar it was only a 1 min walk to get back after a night out, however once in the room it was completely sound proofed. The breakfast was delicious and it was quite nice to wander to the restaurant down the street for a full Irish! (the staff there are lovely too) We would recommend this hotel to anyone planning a trip to Dublin and won't stay anywhere else when we plan a trip back.",5,2015,04,29
225,Temple Bar in style,"No need to wax lyrical about the Merchant House.
Yes there is a sex shop below and no there is no restaurant. Well so what ?
The room was clean, clean and spacious, the bathroom spotless. 
You're in Temple Bar, step in off the street and you're back to sanity and lovely clean war me room.
Me and the missus were quite content in the Bram Stoker Room, no complaints from us whatsoever.. I'd return",4,2015,04,27
225,This one is a strange place to review!,"Now, you may think that by me only giving this 3 stars, I didn't really like it. Far from it!

Lets start with the positives. We arrived and were promptly met at the entrance by 2 young guys who seemed to be running the place. Both very friendly and helpful. They checked us in, showed us to our room and gave us a run through of everything in the room.

The room itself was stunning! The Oscar Wilde suite, right at the top of the building. I would recommend this to anyone staying here.

Location wise, it was bang in the centre of the main bar area called Temple Bar. We had a night out one evening and we were never more than 5 minutes walk from our hotel. And it was also very quiet in the room, no outside noise at all.

However, staying on the location topic, the hotel was next to a sex shop! Now, I have absolutely no issues with this at all and to be fair, as a 28 year old man, I'm more open to this kind of thing than probably 99% of the population anyway but I can imagine an older or more easily offended person / couple might not like this as much.

There is also no restaurant. Breakfast is served at a bar about 200 yards from the actual hotel which is a tiny bit frustrating. Although the breakfast at the bar, is unbelievably nice!!

And finally, it's not a hotel, it's a guesthouse. It felt like we were staying in someone's spare room if I'm being totally honest. I did really, really like it but at the same time I probably wouldn't be in a hurry to stay here again. I think that the price of the room per night is a little high considering the strange location (to some people), the lack of a restaurant and although the room was great, it just doesn't feel like a 5 star place which it sells itself as.

I just can't decide!!",3,2015,04,26
225,"Beautiful and very large room, great location","Nicely nested in the heart of Temple bar area, this guesthouse has been a wonderful experience. Jorge will welcome you and explain in details all what your room offers as well as all information you need to know about Dublin. We were in the Oscar Wilde room, on the top floor, and this room is very nice. It is very spacey, very comfortable and nicely equipped with coffee machine (Nespresso), nice amenities and all what you need to have a great stay. Bathroom quite modern.Very nice touch as well from the owner giving a small gift related to the theme of Irish authors at the check-in. Discount is offer for the parking of the car at the nearby fleetstreet parking. Only remark would be the noise from the busy street at night even if all rooms are equipped with double-glass windows. We stayed on a Monday and it was ok. All in all, very nice stay and we would definitely stay there again for our next visit.",4,2015,04,17
225,Great location!,"To explore almost all of the Dublin sights but of course you are staying in Temple bar!

I confess I didn't do my homework properly and thought the room was in a small boutique hotel and at first I was a bit miffed there wasn't a bar or a lounge, but of course you're never from from either, so no problems there.

We stayed for 3 nights in the Bram Stoker and it was all very good, with the possible exception of a weedy shower. (Local water pressure issues that can't be controlled by the owners.)

It was great to be able to step outside right into the middle of temple bar, but it's only 10 minutes to walk to either o'connell street or to Grafton street as well.

Great place to stay, and they do a good breakfast deal 40 yards away too.

",4,2015,04,12
225,Would definitely recommend,We stayed in the W B Yeats room and it was lovely.  The bed is super comfy with high quality bedding.  The room is spacious with lovely touches and spotlessly clean.  The ear plugs which were thoughtfully provided were most welcome - the location is the middle of Temple Bar area so it is no surprise that there is some noise - but this is minimised by the secondary glazing.  Not only is there a Nespresso machine for a lovely coffee but also a most welcome fridge to store some milk for the coffee (or tea which is also available)  Jorge who looked after us  was most helpful and I would definitely recommend this for a very comfortable stay and would definitely return again.,4,2015,04,08
225,"Beautiful room, lovely little touches but a little noisy","The room is stunning, and spacious with comfortable beds and chairs and everything you could need. The hotel has lots of nice little extra bits like spare pillows, a proper nespresso coffee machine, reasonably priced mini bar and dvds that made it a really lovely stay. The housekeeper was also friendly and welcoming which made us feel safe. Thr hotel is very centrally located too. Only downfall was that we could hear people walking around on the floor above until the early hours so it was quite noisy despite double glazing blocking out the noise from outdoors. ",4,2015,04,06
225,Long Weekend,"We've just returned from our annual 6 Nations weekend in Dublin.  We went for a long weekend this time so I looked for somewhere a little cheaper to stay.  Merchant House did not disappoint. Last year we paid almost twice as much per night and our room at MH (Bram Stoker) was much bigger and included even more amenities.  

Location is excellent.  A little noisy on the Saturday night from the night club opposite but other nights were complete silence.

We didn't ask for anything but I got the impression they would have been happy to help if we had!

I'd return!",5,2015,03,05
225,Hidden Gem,"Had a 2 night stay in the James Joyce Suite. This is a small property with 4 or 5 suites, so there are no hotel facilities or reception area. Breakfast, if you choose to take it, is at a restaurant at the end of the street, right by the river.

The building is very secure, despite being in such a central area. I was very surprised at how quiet it was with the windows closed. We felt very comfortable here and would definitely recommend it. We would stay here again.

Our suite was lovely, very impressive. Clean, spacious, luxurious, we loved it. Jorge, the housekeeper, was pleasant, friendly and helpful. He advised us on transport, restaurants, weather - you name it! He is an asset. Jorge gave us a 20% discount voucher for a nearby Italian restaurant, La Caverna, which was excellent.

The suite has an entrance hall/room with wardrobe, safe, mini-bar plus small fridge for your own drinks, kettle, coffee machine (nice touch) and a fireplace. There is plenty of complimentary tea/coffee, etc and also a couple of small bottles of mineral water. Anything you use from the mini-bar is chargeable but the prices are very good for the area.

The main bedroom has a big comfortable bed, tv, dvd, sofa, chairs, table, etc. Another fireplace, big mirrors and pictures on the walls. D√©cor is nice and gives a luxury feel to the place.

The bathroom has underfloor heating and a big shower (no bath, but we only like a shower anyway). There are toiletries, shampoo, shower gel and handwash. Take a bar of soap with you if you prefer to use soap. 

Our deal included breakfast, which we were pleased to find was up to 11.30am. We took our time in the mornings, had a walk and went for breakfast about 11am, which suited us. There was a good choice, order whatever you like from the breakfast menu. We had full Irish breakfast, tea/coffee, fruit juice and toast. We were offered top ups and extra toast etc, and the quality was good, so having the breakfast was a good deal for us. We could have also had fruit, yogurt, cereal, pancakes, etc, if we wanted them. We didn't want to eat again until the evening.

I can only think of one negative and that isn't really a fault with The Merchant House. One night, other guests were quite noisy returning in the early hours. They were shouting to each other down the stairs from different floors. There are signs asking guests to be quiet at night, but sadly some people are still inconsiderate. 

The Merchant House wasn't cheap, but I would say it was well worth the price. We were happy and comfortable staying in the James Joyce Suite and would definitely stay there again.",5,2015,03,01
225,A real sense of living in dublin,"I picked this hotel for its location and it was ideal , no taxis , walked to theatre and restaurants but apart from that our room was lovely . It is a different experience to the usual hotel. 4 suites in an old building and yes there was a bit of noise from the street but no more than someone walking past your door in an hotel . What was perfect was the peace in the morning , no traffic sounds or noise enabling us to have an unusually long sleep in . We stayed in the James Joyce suite and were as comfortable as could be . The underfloor heating in the bathroom was lovely as were all the extra little touches . Really appreciated the mini bar and not being ripped off .i cannot imagine staying anywhere else in Dublin now that I have found here .",5,2015,02,19
225,Our visit to Dublin,"Better than a B&B, very tidy and clean, room cleaned everyday with fresh towels but a bit on the pricey side but very enjoyable, great location for Temple Bar area plenty of pubs, bars and restaurants and a stone throw from the river Liffey plenty to see and do in temple bar area.",4,2015,02,15
225,Excellent! ,"Received our two night stay in the Oscar Wilde Suite as a Christmas present and thought it was fantastic! We were welcomed by Jorge who was extremely helpful, carried my suitcase up the many flights of stairs, showed us where things were located and gave us recommendations for restaurants and bars.

The suite itself was beautiful, the bed was comfortable and the soundproof windows were a must! Thought it was a lovely touch that bits and pieces were provided in the bathroom (cotton pads, ear buds, shampoos etc) as well as a nepresso coffee machine with coffee pods - fantastic! Great selection of snacks, soft/alcoholic drinks in the mini bar as well - and all reasonably priced. 

Thank you so much for making our trip to Dublin so enjoyable!",5,2015,02,08
225,Perfect Weekend away," I spent two nights in the oscar Wilde suite with my boyfriend and was extremely happy with our stay. The room was absolutely beautiful and had everything that we could have wished for. The staff couldn't do enough and were ever so friendly. Told us where to go and what we needed to know. Brilliant location and wonderful breakfast! ",5,2015,01,20
225,Outstanding Rental,"We just loved staying here in Dublin. Very safe and secured building in the heart of the Temple Bar area. The service was outstanding!! Nice big room, though lots of stairs, but well worth it. The sound proofed rooms are a must in this town. We stayed 4 nights in the Oscar Wilde suite.  Would definitely return!!  Thanks, Cathy and Tony

PS Sorry for the late response!!!",5,2015,01,08
225,Great place to stay in Dublin,"The Merchant House is much more than a B&B and much more cozy than a hotel.  The bathroom in the Bram Stoker room was large, with heated floors and lots of nice towels. The bed was comfortable, and the remote controlled skylight was a really neat feature, allowing us to listen to the Temple Bar area festivities in the evenings while we were getting ready, but once closed, we didn't have to listen to the noise the rest of the time...  Very good soundproofing in the room.  Minibar, fridge, snacks, etc. are great, and the location could not have been any better.  Mere steps to everything, including bus stops.  Very safe building despite not having 24-hour staff.  Highly recommend staying here.",5,2015,01,04
225,Comfortable accommodation in the heart of Dublin,"Attractive, comfortable accommodation in the heart of Temple Bar.  Plenty going on, but still possible to enjoy peace and quiet here.  Friendly welcome on early arrival and no problem leaving luggage secure.",4,2014,12,28
225,Luxury in a great location,"We stayed 4 nights in the Oscar Wilde suite which is on the top floor and quite a climb up the narrow staircase, but it's certainly worth the effort when you get there. The suite is very spacious with a high ceiling and is well furnished with lots of top quality art work and ornate features. The large double bed was extremely comfortable. Without doubt the location is first class, right in the middle of Temple Bar with all it's lively night life, restaurants, caf√©s and some of the best pubs in Dublin, all with live music 7 nights a week, easy walking distance to most of Dublin's best shopping areas 
The house keeper was extremely helpful, providing excellent advice and information on all the top Dublin attractions, transport and places to eat.
One slight downside for us was the internet was a little hit and miss, sometimes disconnecting and a little slow at times, however it didn't change our view that this is top class accommodation in a fantastic location.",5,2014,12,12
225,Perfect and charming!,"We stayed in the WB Yeats Suite and it was a wonderful experience. Luxurious. The location is excellent, the decor is pretty, there is sound proofing (very much needed since this is in the heart of Temple Bar), and heated floors. However, skip the breakfast and go to any of the myriad pubs nearby instead.",5,2014,12,11
225,Well Placed Accommodation,"Recently attending The Gaiety Theatre, we stayed at The Merchant House, and really enjoyed our stay. A house divided into 4 large suites in the heart of Temple Bar - an area of Dublin noted for entertainment and socialising in  an old cobbled city setting. The area may be over-rated, but the accommodation is well placed for the city, and very secure. Suite well laid out - large entry room, with well appointed bedroom/sitting room to one side, and fine bathroom to the other. High ceilings , good insulation, comfortable furnishing, tv, wifi, and adequate heating, give the place a fresh feel.
One of the few places I have been, where the mini-bar is more reasonable than the local hostelries!! One slight drawback - the stairs are a little steep, and narrow.
Definite premises to consider for your Dublin stay.",5,2014,12,04
225,Luxury accommodation in the centre of Dublin,"The Merchant House consists of four luxury rooms in Temple Bar. We stayed in the W. B. Yeats suite on the second floor. The room is beautifully decorated with lots of little touches. Although the room is opposite a club, the double glazing is good enough to stop you being bothered by noise outside. There are lots of stairs which was no problem for us but may be a consideration. We loved it and would stay again.",5,2014,12,03
225,Excellent in so many ways,"By husband and I stayed in the James Joyce room for two nights and have to say, that from start to finish, it was superb. Jorge's met us and was very welcoming.  The room was spotless and decor well thought out.  The room itself is really spacious and is comprised of an entrance hallway, with fireplace, tea/coffee (Nespresso!) amenties and wardrobe.  The bathroom is to the left and bedroom to the right.  The underfloor heating in the bathroom is a treat and the bathroom itself is light and spacious. We are probably average sleepers in terms of noise sensitivity, and were not affected by the vibrant Temple Bar district virtually on your doorstep.  The only slight drawback is the size of the bed as we are used to a kingsize.  We are frequent visitors to Dublin and would definitely return to The Merchant House.",5,2014,11,24
225,Downtown Dublin Delight,"For a long weekend in Dublin we stayed in this house right in the middle of Temple Bar area.  We were in the James Joyce room.  The room was very spacious, with comfortable furniture and a lovely bathroom with heated floors.  This room is in the front of the house which might be a problem if you are a very light sleeper but wasn't an issue for us (they have triple pane windows and heavy curtains to help block the street noise).  The staff were excellent, very attentive and even held our bags on our last day.

Helpful hints:
- if checking in late, make sure you call to arrange for the night housekeeper to meet you
- grocery store nearby plus a multitude of restaurant
- taxi stand is just around the corner
- very close walk to Trinity College and Brazen Head is ~15mins",5,2014,11,16
225,"Unique guest house, great location","We arrived in Dublin on October 9, 2014 and stayed for three nights in the middle of the busy Temple Bar area. We were in the Bram Stoker room, one flight up. The room was spacious, the bathroom was well equipped, including a heated floor and very quiet in what could have been a noisy environment given we were in Temple Bar. Serge (?) our greeter was a great help in orienting us to the area as well as making suggestions about the area in general and dining. Despite the fact that there was no 24-hour staff, we did not feel insecure in that it took two keys and a code to get into the building. We would not hesitate to recommend this guest house and we would stay here again. Breakfast was a five minute walk away with a welcoming staff and a varied menu. We did not expect this as given in that was a guest house.",4,2014,11,13
225,Superb Accomodation,"Have just returned from a mid week stay at the Merchant House in Temple Bar Dublin.
The place was just what we wanted;  well situated, spacious, spotlessly clean, comfortable and well appointed. The House Manager looked after us well and they have taken care to look after the details which make all the difference. Breakfast was served at a restaurant a few yards from The Merchant House - there was a good choice and it too was well presented ( and tasty ! )
We stayed in the Yeats suite.
I wouldnt hesitate to recommend The Merchant  House",5,2014,09,26
225,Excellent weekend stay,"We stayed in the Bram Stoker room for a long weekend in August. The room was very good and attention to every detail was given. The rooms were spacious and nicely decorated The staff very helpful and attentive. It is located very close to temple bar, in the center of Dublin, however it was fairly quite. I will definitely  stay there again if i visit Dublin",5,2014,09,10
225,Luxury Stay,"Stayed here for a romantic night away after Christmas. Rooms are beautiful and it was such a treat and such luxury. We had the Oscar Wilde suite- and it is exactly as is in pictures! Stunning fireplace, luxury bed linen, and brilliant power shower in the modern bathroom! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who doesn't want the hustle and bustle of a noisy hotel! It's like its own little world! While there we did the Guinness Storehouse. A bus tour around Dublin and ate and drank in Temple bar! All within walking distance! Totally worth it!",5,2014,09,02
225,Beautiful apartment in the Temple Bar Area,We booked four nights in the Oscar Wilde suite and it was fantastic! Beautifully decorated and very spacious with a comfortable bed. The staff was very helpful and greeted us at the door and provided us with maps and lots of recommendations of what to do in the area. We loved the breakfast at the Stage Door Cafe where the owner was very friendly and the food was delicious! I would recommend when booking to make sure you eat here for breakfast. We will definitely recommend this hotel to all of our family and friends. Thank you for making our stay so amazing!,5,2014,09,01
225,Unique and Convenient,"We pampered ourselves with two nights in the luxurious James Joyce suite, and couldn't have been more pleased.  The room was spacious, immaculate and beautifully decorated.  It is a one of a kind.  We were warmly greeted by Jorge, the housekeeper, who provided a lot of help with planning our outings in the area.  The location could not be more convenient.  The combination of luxury and location make this a highly recommended place to stay in Dublin.",5,2014,08,24
225,A haven of peace in the middle of Temple Bar,No problem with security.......Staff very helpful and attentive. The suite was very comfortable  and close to all Dublins attractions. We slept very well and enjoyed our breakfast at The Italian Corner....dont know why some reviewers complained about it......yes we will stay again!,5,2014,08,15
225,Spacious room in Temple Bar area,"We stayed in the James Joyce room. It was very spacious and well appointed. The manager was very helpful. Located in the centre of the Temple Bar area which is very close to pubs, shops and attractions. The room was quiet even though it was in a busy part of town.
Heather & Graham July 2014",4,2014,08,03
225,Fantastic place in the middle of everything!,"Fantastic apartment, that gave a  feeling of staying at a modern, but homy place. It has everything you can wish for and a little more as well. Wish we had more nights to stay here, because it was truly excellent. Staff was really friendly and helpful. I will book this place again next time i go to Dublin!",5,2014,07,16
225,Wish we'd stayed longer!,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for 1 night as a birthday surprise to Dublin and like another review stated the first impression is a little off putting, surrounded by bars and an adult shop! HOWEVER, as soon as you step indoors the doubts disappear. We stayed in the James Joyce Suite, WOW, from the comfiest of beds, to the gorgeous decor and space, I began to wish is was for more than the one night that I had booked. Sound proof windows worked a treat, there is a bar directly opposite open until 2am, we didn‚Äôt here a thing and it was a busy Saturday night. 

The house keeper was super friendly, offering guidance about where to eat, drink and sight see.
Location wise, it‚Äôs as good as you can get if you want to be in the thick of it all. You can easily walk to anything within the city centre, even the Guinness storehouse.

The only constructive feedback I can offer is that it would have been nice to have received a reminder email of booking closer to the visit as I booked a few months in advance and was unsure of the ‚Äòdrop off bags‚Äô arrangement. I did email a few days prior and received a reply straight away confirming the times, however I felt it was a little abrupt and didn‚Äôt really set the scene of what was to be a fantastic stay with a welcoming and friendly housekeeper. 

I would definitely return to Dublin and would most definitely return to The Merchant House. 

Travel from airport - Don't waste money on transfers of taxis, for 10 Euro return is was a bargain to get the bus which stops right next to the hotel.",5,2014,07,14
225,"Great place, shame about the breakfast","The Merchant House is extremely well situated in the heart of the Temple bar, close to all the theatres, transport links and restaurants. The Oscar Wilde suite was spacious, clean and had the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. As we stayed on Tuesday night, there was hardly any noise coming from the downstairs bar. There was no trouble with the adult shop next door either. Staff was friendly.

So why only 3 stars? We booked the room with the breakfast option (+‚Ç¨20) and expected to be directed to the Al's Stage Door Cafe, which we visited independently, and have fallen in love with the place and the ambience. Unfortunately, we received a voucher to Eliza Lodge restaurant. Dirty chairs, terrible coffee and 1 dry old looking sausage and 1 overcooked piece of bacon with poached eggs (egg white still raw in 1 egg) in Irish Breakfast option. If I had a camera with me, I would have taken a photo. It's indescribable.

I would suggest the owners to only use the Stage Door cafe for the breakfast service and refund the breakfast cost to all the unfortunate guests who were forced to eat at Eliza's.",3,2014,07,02
225,fantastic,"We stayed here for 2 nights, and initially when we first arrived, we were a bit put off by the surrounding bars etc. We needn't have worried, as the hotel suites have sound proof windows and staying here was a complete delight. There are 4 suites to choose from and we stayed in The James Joyce Suite and it was stunning. The staff that we met were both  very friendly and knowledgeable in the surrounding attractions, and explained the high level of  hotel security  very well .If you do decide to stay here, we would recommend eating at La Caverna Italian restaurant, with guests receiving up to 20% discount of their bill.",5,2014,06,12
225,Exactly what we wanted,"We stayed in the Oscar Wilde suite which was on the top floor of the old Georgian house. It's was all we could hope for with lovely wooden beams in the ceiling, fantastic decor and a big comfy bed. We stayed on a Saturday and Sunday night and could hardly hear any noise from the bars outside. The merchant house is situated right in the heart of Temple Bar which is perfect. Overall we had a lovely weekend away. Would definitely recommend.",5,2014,05,17
225,Good place if you feel being treated like a cash machine,"The place is clean and well situated, a good start.
But, we were charged for a 3rd person without any warning and even though the room indicates 3 beds. We were greated by the housekeeper and have never seen the manager.
Breakfast is not served on the premises but in a Cafe nearby (Poor quality) against a voucher.
The overall impression is that you are just a mean of revenue for the owner. Not what we expected.",2,2014,05,12
225,Fabulous!,"A group of six of us have just returned having had 3 nights at the merchant house. This really is superb accomodation, great big comfy beds and immaculately clean. Please ignore the bad review on this website as the owners and staff really don't deserve it. 

Yes, it is noisy outside and no there is no 24 hour reception but why would you expect anything different when staying in a boutique guest house in the heart of Temple Bar? 

The staff couldn't do enough for us and breakfast down the road at the stage door cafe was simply superb. We had a great weekend and thoroughly recommend staying here.",5,2014,05,05
225,"Great place, Great location","Fabulous accommodation right in the heart off the city. v generous sized rooms. Nice touches include spare fridge for your purchases, earplugs, and DVD loan. The nearby provided breakfast was from a great little cafe overlooking the Liffey and was very good.
Just one irksome thing to watch out for is the La Caverna offer of a discount when booked and the hotel is mentioned. I notice that they have changed the offer now (probably as a result of our complaint), but we did this and opted for the Early Bird to be given 10% instead of 20% as promised at the time. What irritated us was that the manager knew full well of the premise we had booked the table, and didn't say anything until the end; it wasn't like we were scrimping either as well over half the bill was overpriced wine (the food was also mediocre).",5,2014,03,31
225,Insecure inside,"We were staying for 6 nights and we paid for them many months in advanced.There is no staff in the building after 4pm. On the first night a couple had a terrible argument in and outside their room. We could not sleep afterwards. It was scary. On the fourth night another couple absolutely drunk not only had a terrible quarrell in their room (we could hear to all their shouting) but also the man came to our room and tried to enter and fight with us. There is no telephone machine in the rooms. We dial 911 from our mobile phone. The police arrived quickly, talked to the drunk couple and accompanied us to leave the hotel and looked for another one at 2 am.(We have the police report) It was not secure to stay in the building with these violent guests and nobody to defend us from them.
 We had our complete stay already paid. The owner did not return any of the money for the three nights we did not stay (not even the one night he said he would return).  Due to our comments in Trip Advisor they are not giving any of our money back. In Tourist Information Center in Dublin they told us this Guest House is not registered. They did not know about it. Although we booked it through Booking.com they were of no help to solve this.",1,2014,03,03
225,"Great location, lush guest house ","Just got back from staying at the merchant house, me and my boyfriend both in our early 30's stayed in the W.B Yeates suit 
The room was exactly like you see in the photos, lovely and spacious, bang in the middle of temple bar, the bed was really comfortable, the shower room was great and spacious, sound proof windows so u hardly hear any noise, in some reviews it's says about the sex shop and massage shop either side of the guest house, you don't even know their there, julieana our house keeper was absolutely amazing and so helpful, would deffo stay here again  ",5,2014,02,23
225,Nice Getaway,"We had to travel to Dublin last minute to get a travel Visa, we saw this place and liked the look of it, it was last minute and out of season so we got a seemingly good rate. Guests get a discounted parking rate at the nearby car park at ‚Ç¨20 which is not too bad given the location. It is right in the middle of Temple Bar so if your looking for a quite haven this may not be quite right, but the windows doubled and we noticed little noise. Their was no bath and a glass door on the bathroom. Lots of mini bar types stuff for sale in the room. Overall it was good with great finish to the room, with some random ornaments but it seems to work, We did ask for a late check our be that was not an option, guess they were fully booked.

225,Luxury at a very keen price........,"We visited Dublin and the Theatre recently and eventually booked The Merchant House in Temple Bar. Tried booking it on three other occasions and they were always full. We were not disappointed at all. Luxurious & comfortable , lovely decor and very polite / friendly staff. The Suite was spacious and the bed king size was so comfortable. No noise from the busy Temple Bar outside. Our breakfast was served until noon and was very pleasant. It is not served on the premises but literally one minutes walk away. We had some stairs to climb but that was expected as the building is a Georgian townhouse. Overall a lovely experience and we would certainly stay there again.",5,2013,12,27
225,"Not for the budged traveller, but good quality","Stayed for 3 nights in May. The room was very beautiful. Lovely bathroom with nice shower.
Good service. We had some problem with our flight and had to cancel for one night just few days before. The hotel manager took care of the rearrangement for us. Also they answered emails quickly. 
Excellent location in the middle of Temple Bar. There was little noise coming from the street, but not too bad. If you are very light sleeper, find hotel outside Temple Bar.
Bit pricey, but overall worth it.",5,2013,10,26
225,Excellent Location,"The hotel is in a fabulous location - literally 1 minute walk to the famous Temple Bar.  The windows have double glazing so the room was well sound-proofed from the alleyway below which was very busy and noisy at night. There is no airconditioning (but there is a fan) and the windows had to be kept closed for this reason which was unfortunate. The WB Yeats Suite was lovely, very spacious with lots of little extra touches. Good shower and bathroom. Breakfast was in a restaurant down the road but was really good. The downside is that it is very inconvenient having to plan specific times to arrive at the hotel to drop off bags prior to arrival or collect bags as there is no reception. Contact with the hotel via email prior to arrival to try to arrange check-in times, etc. was met with quite curt replies and absolutely no flexibility for an early check-in. It was a little concerning when coming back to the hotel at night with the unsavoury drunken characters in the alleyway (there is a sex shop right next door). I filled in the Comments form on departure and obviously the hotel does not like to receive any negative feedback at all. The bed was not a King Size as advertised.",4,2013,10,19
225,Perfect Location for Exploring Dublin,"The room I stayed in was the WB Yeats Suite. It is exactly like shown in the picture with not a thing out of place. Upon a arrival, we were helped with our bags and the room was readied for us early so we could get in before 2pm which is their checkout time. The facilities were very clean and well maintained.There is no AC but it is not needed because its usually so cold. The windows are sound proof so you don't hear the busy city nightlife when you are going to bed. They also provided ear plugs if you needed them, but they shouldn't be necessary. The staff was very helpful always and they called a cab for us to be there on our last day and they helped with our bags again.They have a huge fan in there that cools off the room so well i had to turn it off sometime because it got too cold.It is within literally 30 second walk from the Temple Bar which is probably the most famous bar in Ireland. 30 second walk from the river Lifey. 5 minute walk from all the one day tour departures on Suffolk street. Really close to trinity college and the old stone church. I can't say enough about the area. It's in a great location. Be aware that there is a sex shop right next door. This doesn't bother me but some people may be traveling with you g children and may be bothered by it. I personally don't think it would be a problem. It's a great place to stay, but be sure to book ahead because they fill up months in advance.",5,2013,09,28
225,Would definitely stay there again!,We stayed in the James Joyce suite and it was great!  The room was spacious and had all the amenities.  The bathroom as a good size with heated floors.  We were concerned at first that it would be loud at night as it was in the middle of the Temple Bar area but we were amazed at how quiet it was due to the double windows. Definitely very luxurious. We were very happy.  The only way it could have been better was if it had a lift...it is a walk up.,5,2013,09,14
225,Quiet in the din of Temple Bar,"We stayed in the Bram Stoker room, while it didn't have any windows to the streets, it did have two motorized sky lite windows w/shades and two windows that looked to the interior of the building, it looked directly onto a roof with another story above on all four sides, sort of like an arboretum without any trees, just a roof and windows of the other apartments and rooms. The windows were frosted and I had to open up the window to really see what was out there. There was plenty of daylight coming in for a nice gentile wake-up n the morning. 
The one thing I can say about the room is that is was just about pin-drop quiet for being right in Temple Bar! When we opened the sky-lite windows at night, the noise was very loud from all the revelers still out at 2:30- 3:00 in the morning. Amazing how quiet it got when the windows shut!!

Arrived Saturday morning and had made prior arraignments to drop off our bags, checked in later at the specified time with our bags delivered to the room. Security for the room is high as we had to unlock a gate, then a door, then punch in the security code for a glass door inside before using yet another key to access our room. The room was wonderfully appointed, the bed was super comfy. (we had just spent a week in Oughterard in a ""cottage"" with very thin, hard, single mattresses.) A soft bed for the last three nights in Ireland was just super! Although we did not take advantage of the extras the Merchant House offered, there were several romantic offerings for an extra fee. Champagne and chocolates, and limo rides to and from the Dublin airport to name a couple.
Getting there from the air port was very easy, we had dropped off our rental there and took the 747 bus to the stop just around the corner from Trinity College, it was less than a 5 min walk to the room from there and the hop on hop off bus stops were in the same place. (the bus ride that included 72 hours of hop on hop off and a return trip to the airport was $28 Euro at the bus stop at the airport. Buses ran every 15 min.)
Eustace street goes from Dame Street to the River Liffey, (#8 is closer to the Dame street end) and will put you right on the Millennium Bridge to cross over the river. The Ha'Penny bridge is the next one down and it's kinda of neat to see all of the locks that lovers have put all over the iron works.
One recommendation would be to take a tour of the 1916 Rebellion, we did this our last day and wished we had done it our first. Lorcan the guide was a blast to listen to. It starts at the International Bar(pub?) at 11:30, cost was 12 Euro pp. Well worth it!
In short, this was my first visit to Ireland, and I would not hesitate to stay there again.",5,2013,09,03
225,very nice rooms in the heart of Temple Bar.,"We were warmly welcomed at 10am after a long trip from Chicago.  The James Joyce room was great.  It's on the second floor and it over looks a pub located across the street. Seeing this, we were prepared for a bad night for sleep, BUT, we ended up with a wonderful uninterrupted rest. The owners installed triple pane windows to keep the room temps comfortable - but also a great sound proofing solution.  The bath is modern and very large.  Towels could be little softer guys :)
I didn't know the hotel neighborhood b4 booking so took a chance here.  Really glad we did.  Very comfortable, safe neighborhood, close to all Temple Bar attractions, shops and restaurants all around.  I'd recommend to a good friend.",5,2013,08,28
225,Excellent!,"My husband and I stayed here in July 2013 for a quick anniversary getaway.  The Oscar Wilde suite was on the top floor (no lift) and was luxurious, overlooking the street below.  Like others have said, it was absolutely soundproof with the windows closed (they do provide additional earplugs if you are a light sleeper which we did not need).   The room was immaculate, beautifully decorated, the bed was comfortable, the location was excellent- in the heart of Temple Bar and the staff was extremely pleasant and helpful.  I would not hesitate to stay here again.  My only suggestion is that the room could use a fan because it was a bit warm in July with the windows closed at night.",5,2013,07,27
225,Luvury Suite in heart of Temple Bar,"We stayed in the James Joyce suite at the start of our tri[p and at the end.  The large windows, overlooking Eustace Street, could be opened.  If you chose to close all the windows the suite was absolutely soundproof.  The suite was very large with a king size bed.  There is a large separate bathroom with heated floors and a nice electric hot water shower.  There is an ante room with a mini-fridge and kettle for tea and coffee.  Juliana and John were our Housekeepers and provided very good service and information.  If you are there on a Friday night, the Temple Bar Food Market(www.templebar.ie/Market/Food_Market) happens every Saturday Morning. The square, where the market is located, is adjacent to the building the hotel is in. It is a great place to eat lunch or purchase food for a picnic.",5,2013,07,24
225,"fab, fab, place to stay in the heart of dublin","stayed here in nov 2012 for my 40th birthday what a magnificant place to stay, i could not complement it enough, private, spacious, luxurious, great set up with all day breakfast available around the corner, wonderful location. there is no down side to this venue",5,2013,07,15
225,What you should know about The Merchant House.,"As the many reviews all say, Merchant House provides absolutely first class accomodations.  The suites are top notch.  What you need to know is that it is situated in the center of Dublin's pub scene and sits between a massage parlor and at sex-toy fetish shop.  The neighborhood can be a bit off putting if you think this will be like staying at the Raddison.  This is a LIVELY neighborhood and somewhat in contrast to the splendid retreat Merchant House offers.  Again, this property is top notch and centrally located.  I would stay here with my wife again at the drop if a hat, but I found the surroundings fun. Not everyone would. ",5,2013,05,01
225,Paddy's Day stay in the Oscar Wilde Suite,"Well....We were greeted by appointment by the most lovely Irish welcome. Our flight was early arriving Saturday before "" The Gathering "" on Sunday. Our bags were stored safely before checking in at 14:00. We then embarked on what can only be described as MAD ! Temple Bar Dublin the day before St Pat's is really a sight for sore eyes. We watched the England v Wales rugby in the Temple Bar pub, befriended by the official OstWestFalia drinking team from Hamburg. But this review is about the Oscar Wilde Suite. Located up a few flights of very well decorated stairways to our suite to find what can only be described as "" Overwhelming "" The quality and detail of the fabric and furnishings are a credit to the owners. The staff who serviced our suite know what is required to make their guests welcome.

The location....slap bang in the middle of where it's at !! Eustace St, can be very noisy but hey this is Temple Bar during Paddy's weekend, and in truth once in our suite the sound proofed windows did the job, slept very well with no disturbance. The buzz around the locality is so infectious and cultured, with so many Nationalities enjoying the celebrations.

Our breakfast at the Stage Door Cafe was a delight on both mornings, enjoying a menu for such a small place starting with what me and my wife can agree on....THE best Irish Coffee known to man, superb ! Wonderful Irish Breakfast and great hosts. We will eat again at the Stage Door without doubt.

The Merchant House is unique in what's on offer. No reception, no bar, no dining room...Fantastic ! We enjoyed the feeling of being part of Temple Bar, with your own exclusive access to your suite, and completely secure.

To quote the man himself.. "" We are all in the Gutter, but some of us are looking at the Stars "" Oscar Wilde. 

Our next visit is already planned. And as for our generation....we are in our mid 50's...Enjoy.",5,2013,03,28
225,Oasis,Excellent high end accomodation with all the touches of a boutique hotel only set in a larger space (we stayed in the Oscar Wilde suite) and with far more privacy. There were stairs (3 flights if I recall) leading to the suite but its a 19th Century building so came as no real surprise and this should not put you off . Location is good and whilst in central Temple Bar no noise discernable from Eustace Street below. Arranging the booking and arrangements for picking up keys etc couldn't have been easier to follow and the staff we met were v helpful.,5,2013,02,22
225,Nice romantic place to stay a night,"Wouldn't plan my whole vacation here, but a great place to stay a night or two with your special someone. Nice staff for the most part, clean, cozy (but not tiny), quiet (even though it's in Temple Bar) and comfortable overall. Know that if you stay in the Oscar Wilde suite you have a few floors of very steep stairs to/from your room.",4,2013,02,19
225,Excellent Stay!,"Stayed during start of February, Excellent service once checked in, staff couldn't have been more helpful. The services provided by the hotel are next to none, had no issues. Breakfast was lovely during the morning, would recommend to everyone alike, won't disappoint compared to some places I've been before I must say. First class!",5,2013,02,10
225,nice location but awful service,"I was welcomed by the personnel in a fetish/adult shop which may be a plus if you are not a business/family traveler. They have no facilities so when I needed to use a restroom after a 8+ hrs flight was forced to rent a room at the hotel on the opposite side of the street. They did not accomodate my needs in terms of timing and eventually did not show up for check in at agreed time in the evening.
I spent an hour in the rain on the phone with for booking.com support trying to reach them. They were not answering my calls nor emails while I was in the rain but they answered to booking maybe worried that they would exclude them from the website. The worst thing is that after my feedback given to booking.com they keep bothering me on my professional email address saying that I was childish and keep using very unprofessional language. A customer feedback is supposed to be anonymous and you should expect no retaliation for that so I have just informed booking.com about this. They should have apologized for the failure but apparently this is not the Manager's style. Apart from that suite was nice and cosy and location is excellent.",1,2012,12,17
225,Magnificent Merchant House.,"Like the previous reviewer we stayed in the Oscar Wilde suite and it was amazing. 
Every little detail is thought of to make it a comfortable and luxury stay for you. 
Lovely hot warm shower, fresh towels, tea & coffee facilities, hair dryer etc. 
mini bar available if you want it. 
We did stay mid-week but temple bar was still busy, but we did not hear any noise after we returned from evening out. 
Although there is not a reception us such I think they did more for us than a 24 hour manned reception ! 
They stored our bags as we arrived before 2 and recommended a lovely cafe for a bite to eat. Midday checkout was handy and again stored our bags. 
The breakfast included is provided by a place called the stage door and again was amazing. 
Wouldn't hesitate in recommending.",5,2012,12,06
225,What an amazing suite!,"We stayed at The Merchant House, Temple Bar Dublin for a few days recently and were truly impressed by this accomodation! There are 4 suites, all named after famous writers, we stayed in the Oscar Wilde suite and as soon as we were let in we were gobsmacked. This is truly 5 star with every little detail thought about, from underfloor heating in the bathroom to sound proof glazing on the windows (you are in a very busy part of Dublin)! Our welcome was very frinedly and informative, breakfast was at the Stage Door just around the corner and is a must to set you up for the day! The suites are on Temple Bar doorstep, perfect on cold nights when you don't want to walk too far.
Overall, perfect accomodation for a great time in Dublin!",5,2012,11,05
225,OK serviced Apartment,"I think its important to emphasise the fact that this is a serviced apartment without cooking or washing facilities. So if you want a serviced apartment look elsewhere and if you want a hotel with facilities (including reception) you also better look again. The room/ apartment was nice and spacious however its important to emphasise a couple of things that some potential guests may see as a deal breaker. The shower pressure is rubbish. Its more of a trickle than anything else so if you like your showers and intend on washing your hair stay out of Temple Bar. Being in Temple Bar it will be incredibly loud until around 3am or so. If you like sleeping at night then please stay out of Temple Bar. The Merchant House has installed double glazing and even provide you with a pair of ear plugs but this simply reduces the noise to sound like a marching band rather than a U2 concert. If you dont like climbing stairs then stay away! There were 58 steps to the top, which doesnt sound like much but try that with two suitcases or after an exhusting day out. All in all the ""luxury suites"" as they are refered to are clean and comfy but just too noisy for me to give it anything more than 4 out of 5.",4,2012,10,31
225,Excellent location beautiful room,We stayed in James Joyce suite beautifully decorated room location brilliant every area of central Dublin close by. We had no problems with noise our stay was on mon/tues   We didn't feel as relaxed as we would have in a hotel there was a list of do' and don'ts which I can perfectly understand as they have lavished money and care into the renovation  no bath which we knew before we went was a downside and electric shower ran hot and cold could have done with more towels and shampoo and shower gel barely enough to cover our stay  but that aside a beautiful place and would recommend ,5,2012,10,10
225,In the centre of Temple Bar,"We've stayed at the Merchant House before (in the WB Yeats suite) but this time we had booked the Bram Stoker room as it was on the first floor and at the back (avoiding the street noise but typical there was a three day concert behind the building whilst we were there but we suspect everyone else in the building were subject to the same torture of Ireland's ""finest"" bands). 

First thing is the location - the Merchant House is truly in the centre of Temple Bar. It's noisy and smelly at times but the people are great. Easily accessible by the superb bus service - no wonder taxis tout for business all the time. We were greeted by a lovely lady and shown the room. The Stoker room is smaller but we felt we didn't need a larger room. The windows in the roof are magic - opened by remote control. The bed is supremely comfortable with tea making facilities but the kettle has seen better days - replace it with a new one! There is plenty of storage space so we could store our clothes. The mini fridge was useful for storing milk and other items that required chilling. 

The bathroom is lovely although I'm sure a bath could be installed. The toiletries and towels were replaced on a daily basis. The shower doors didn't close properly meaning that water leaked onto the glorious heated floor (shame that this couldn't be set for longer periods as it was a touch nippy).

We loved the Stage Door Cafe - vouchers are valid from 8am to 8pm for any meal so you can have an evening meal there instead of breakfast. The food and service is excellent. They even pulled out the stops in preparing sandwiches for us on our return journey home as we couldn't use the voucher for the weekend.

All in all, we loved the Merchant House. Make a note - new kettle, fix the shower doors and possibly stick a bath in as well and it would be perfect.",5,2012,10,07
225,Lovely James Joyce Suite...but noisy very noisy!,"First, the good points...
The James Joyce Suite is really spacious, clean and has quality furnishings etc.
The Housekeeper John appeared like Mr Benn from the next door Sex Shop (!) and gave us a lovely welcome. He really was very pleasant and helpful.
It's bang in the middle of the action; Temple Bar central! Just around the corner from the fantastic Saturday gourmet food Market and all the lively bars. We LOVED Dublin!
The Stage Door Cafe was great; nice and quirky, friendly, two minutes walk and a good fry up every morning at the time which suited us.
And then....
It's not cheap, 145e a night and I'd rather they just call it bed and breakfast; what's free about the breakfast?
The shower room was disappointing. It was a weak electric shower and the underfloor heating was ineffective. The towels were a bit past their best and the toiletries seemed a bit on the mean side.
I would have liked net curtains or some kind of privacy since when you opened the curtains everyone in the Riverhouse Hotel and artist studios could see right in.
But...the main thing is THE NOISE! It wasn't so bad on the Wednesday and Thursday nights, although you do get a lot of street NOISE at kicking out time and I could hear the guests upstairs moving about, running up the stairs etc. But FRIDAY! IT WAS MAD! LOUD MAD NOISE! REALLY NICE CHATTY PEOPLE and MUSIC and glass bottles SMASHING and people SHOUTING! MAD! I was tempted to take the duvet into the shower room and sleep there at the back. The windows do have sound proofing but still it was LOUD! The Mezz Bar/Club is right opposite and although the atmosphere was in no way intimidating or violent it was just not what you want at 4am. Check out google streetview and make your own decision!
I would go back if I got a room at the back and it was a bit cheaper and I was deaf. Shame, since like I say, it really was a very very nice suite and we did have a brilliant time and Leonard Cohen was great!",4,2012,09,17
225,Good B&B if you dont mind late night noise,"Spent one night at this B&B. Expensive at 145euro. Lovely comfortable bed, room quite small the Bran suite but had everything needed, safe, hairdryer etc. Met on arrival by a lovely gentleman who showed us to our room.  Excellent breakfast in cafe round the conrer, great coffee.But the noise couldnt be ignored.  At 1 am we could'nt hear the T.V. in the bedroom. with the music outside. We know it would be noisy in Temple Bar but didnt know it would be this loud. Avoid unless your a total party animal.",3,2012,09,16
225,"Perfect, wish we could have stayed for longer !!","Just back from a 2 night stay in the merchant house , we stayed in the Oscar Wilde suite in the top floor. The suite was huge and had everything we needed plus more, exceptionally clean and extremely comfortable . Location was perfect for us right in the middle of temple bar so although very lively at night we had no problems with noise at all. Breakfast is served in a cafe round the corner and again have no complaints , was a great start to the day. We plan on making another trip to Dublin soon and wouldn't want to stay anywhere else!! ",5,2012,08,30
225,Nice but noisy and a little scary,This is a nice large guest house in the heart of the Temple Bar area but would recommend only for those who are looking to seriously party as otherwise it can get really noisy at night because of the pub next door. Jokes aside the house was really spooky and one of my friends felt really uneasy sleeping on the top floor. Would recommend only for large groups looking for a lie in after a night of debauchery!!!,3,2012,08,28
225,Central and Clean,"My husband and I spent 3 days in Dublin and found this an excellent location for walking the city as it is so central.  Breakfast was provided by way of a voucher at a nearby cafe which was efficient and the food was excellent.  We were met on arrival but after that did not see or talk to anyone else, and this was a little strange and cold. However our rooms were cleaned thoroughly every day and were very comfortable with some nice little touches added like chocolates and biscuits renewed each day.",4,2012,08,09
225,absolutely perfect!,"Me and friend just got back yesterday from staying here in the James Joyce suite and it was perfect, no faults at all. Location great too! We almost didn't go out the first night as didn't want to leave the room! I almost don't want to rate it to high as want it to be our little secret! when staying in Dublin i don't think i'll ever look elsewhere to stay, if rooms not available for dates i want...i'd change dates haha!",5,2012,07,30
225,Hidden treasure!,"Stayed in the Bram Stoker room and whilst there may be no views, more importantly it is very quiet (not an easy feat in Temple Bar) so had a great night sleep. The room itself was beautiful, good size, very clean and plenty of light from the remote controlled sky light. Breakfast was included at a charming little cafe around the corner. 

All in all, Merchant house is a little treasure in a very popular location ‚Äì good for nightlife in the temple bar, attending the Olympia Theatre or shopping in Grafton St. I would definitely go back.",5,2012,07,23
225,New love for Yeats,"We had a wonderful stay in the Yeats suite! It was spacious, super-clean and very comfortable.  The bathroom was huge and very modern - and also very, very clean! (I like clean!) The sound-proof windows really were sound-proof!  We didn't hear a thing.  It was a fabulous location - close to many attractions.  The breakfast was really a surprise ~ coupons for a wonderful little bistro just around the corner.  Mike and John and the housekeeping staff were very friendly and attentive.  I would definitely recommend The Merchant House.",5,2012,07,19
225,Attention to Detail-Superb!,"We stayed in the Oscar Wilde Suite which is the top floor (several flights of stairs).  It looks exactly like the photos.  Everything is exceptional quality and the attention to detail is unparalleled!  Everything you could want is there and labeled.  We only stayed 2 nights, but I wished we could have stayed longer.  Temple Bar is extremely loud--louder then anywhere I have ever stayed (louder then NY).  I like to sleep with the windows open, but I couldn't for the noise, but what amazed me was how quite it was when I closed the windows.  The breakfast restaurant was really surprisingly excellent as well.  The staff was very friendly, they even carried our luggage up all the flights of stairs.  The only thing that was strange is the bathroom door is glass, with only part of it frosted.  I'm not sure about the other suites.  I would highly recommend the Merchant House.",5,2012,07,04
225,The beautiful Oscar Wilde suite,"We stayed in the Oscar Wilde suite at the very top of the Merchant House in Temple Bar on Friday 22nd June.
If you can't make the four flights of stairs (no lifts - so difficult with luggage) then there are other suites on lower floors. 
If you can, then you are in for a treat - its a tastefully decorated/furnished apartment and well worth paying that little bit extra for - I believe it was the largest of the 3 or 4 suites available.

There was no noise at all from the bars/pubs around and it was well situated for the nightlife.
It was  really like having the key to a lavish apartment right in the heart of Dublin but be aware - there are no cooking facilites/kitchen, just tea/coffee making and a small fridge for the cold stuff.
Wife and I loved it and would definitely stay again - especially for that special occasion.

225,Sanctuary in Temple Bar,"What an elegant and beautifully appointed guesthouse in the middle of the rowdy and noisy Temple Bar.  It was a great location, and no amenity was spared!  We loved the sound proof windows.  Both the Oscar Wilde and James Joyce suites were lovely.  We stayed here on our last night in Ireland, and this hotel provided the perfect end to an incredible trip!",5,2012,07,01
225,Best start to our honeymoon,"We stayed here for the 1st night of our honeymoon.  We arrived early in the morning and were allowed to leave our luggage and walk around Dublin for a few hours until our room was ready.  We stayed in the Oscar Wilde Suite on the top floor, it was the best room they have.  The room was very spacious and beautifully decorated.  We loved the location, right in the middle of Temple Bar!  The B&B offers several al a carte items, wifi, dvd's, and privacy/security.  The breakfast was around the corner and the Irish breakfast was great.  We stayed 2 nights and had different breakfast selections each day.  The gentlemen that work there were great, they really took care of us.  

The only slight negative for us was the low water pressure, which seems to be a European thing.  

We would definately stay again and suggest you stay here.",5,2012,06,24
225,Charming elegant property in Temple Bar,"The suites are lovely and well furnished. Sound insulating windows curb noise effectively, so you can stay in the middle of Party Central (Temple Bar) and sleep peacefully. Location is terrific. You can't beat it for a stay in Dublin.",5,2012,06,18
225,Excellent,"Stayed 2 nights on business
Perfect location
Very quiet
Excellent facilities
V good breakfast
Will return",5,2012,06,08
225,"Great hotel, lovely room, would return!","We stayed at the merchant house for 2 nights at the end of April.

We stayed in the Bram Stoker suite and I was happy surprised at the size of the room, I don't think any pictures really show quite the size of it. I thought we would barely have room to walk either side of the bed but we did. 

We were met by a very nice young lady who showed us to our room, on the first floor but set back from the main staircase. With 3 little steps leading up to it. We barely ever heard anyone walking up the main stairs. And we never heard anything from inside the room at all and for this reason - we would DEFINITELY stay here again! 

It was fully equipped with everything you would expect - umbrella, hairdryer, soap, shower gel, shampoo, safe, and hangers. The bed and pillows were comfy too. Modern and clean. The only thing which was a little meh was the shower pressure but hey, it's not a problem. The minibar is well equipped but prices are as you would expect to pay in Dublin.

It was right in the heart of Temple bar which was brill, and the breakfast served 2 mins around the corner was also very very good! and a great way to start the day. We had to wait a little while for a seat on the Saturday morning as it's quite small but it's very quaint. 

They are up on the security and so you have to go through 3 doors to get in, a few keys to 
carry but I'd rather that than worry. 

We would definitely return in the future, why go someone else when this is everything you need and more. I was pleasantly surprised. Not because I expected it to be bad but because it was better than I thought it could ever be. 

Go and have fun!",5,2012,06,02
225,Very good...,"I really enjoyed my stay at The Merchant House, even though we arrived ahead                            of schedule the staff were helpful and stored our bags for us and when we returned to ""check in"" our bags had already been taken up to our room...
The rooms themselves are beautifully decorated and are extremely comfortable, wifi connection was excellent and there was even a universal adaptor in the room, which was a nice touch... 
There was some noise from the club across the road but as we were staying in the heart of Temple Bar to enjoy the bars and live music scene this was to be expected and it never interfered with our enjoyment of the room...
Breakfast at the cafe provided was excellent with a good range of options and a decent coffee, while not in the actual abode itself it was so close it usually takes me longer to get from the room to the resteraunt in more traditional hotels so I didn't see this a major drama and actually liked the fact that breakfast was served in a cafe that locals frequented...
The only improvement I could offer would be to move the wardrobe and fridge from the entry room into the main bedroom and add soem seating into this room....
If your looking for Holiday Inn style hotel accommodation then stay in one, however if you are looking for a comfortable bed and quirky place to relax and unwind in the heart of Temple Bar then I don't see how you can go far wrong here,,,",4,2012,05,08
225,Nice refuge,"We enjoyed our stay at The Merchant House.  We were traveling with our 16 y.o. son and stayed in the WB Yeats suite in April.  Someone met us when we arrived around 10:45am but we were not able to get into out room yet.  Since there is no lobby or public bathroom (really just a short narrow hallway right off the street), it was a bit awkward getting things from our bags so that we would be comfortable sight seeing for the afternoon.  We also had to specify a time that we would be returning so that someone could show us up to our room after it was ready.  We were going on a walking tour and gave a 30 minute window when we would be back but still ended up hurrying because we were going to be late.
The room was lovely, very spacious and nicely decorated.  The large bed was very comfortable with nice linens, and my son said that the pull out was ""OK"".  Some people have complained about the noise but we didn't have any problem.  Granted, we were there mid week.  There is a  floor fan in the room that helps with noise and also an ipod dock so you can play your own ""sleep music"".  The bathroom door really needs to be replaced.  It looks great but that isn't the purpose of a bathroom door.  Most people want a bit more privacy than these doors allow.  We took an extra blanket and draped it over the door, which worked fairly well.  Otherwise the bathroom was pretty nice.  No outlet so you have to dry your hair in the other room which is a bit awkward, but frankly, not unlike other place we stayed in Ireland.  The electric kettle is nice for tea and coffee.  The coffee is instant but is exactly the same that we had every other place we stayed.  There is also a little fridge that is stocked, but you can squeeze a few personal things in.
There is no telephone in the room so if you need to reach the management for anything (and you don't have a cell phone), then you have to go down to the entry door and push an intercom button for help.  We had to request help in this way because the in room wifi wasn't really working for us.  We were going to have to schedule yet another time to meet someone the next day who was going to work on it for us but after I asked for an adjustment in my room rate because one of my criteria in choosing a place to stay is free in room wifi, someone was actually able to fix the problem that evening by rebooting the router.
We had to leave our son in the room one day because he wasn't feeling well and the housekeeping staff was very accommodating.  They didn't try to clean the room, and she gave me plenty of things to restock the room myself: coffee, complimentary bottled water, towels.
The breakfast at The Stage Door was pretty good, although, I think they have only white bread for the toast.  You can ask for salad instead of the toast, though.  They serve breakfast all day so you don't have to hurry in the morning.  You could actually come back and have your breakfast for lunch.  They will also make a really good breakfast sandwich (grilled egg, ham, and cheese) to take with you if you don't have time to sit down and eat.
Overall, we very much enjoyed our stay at the Merchant House. It was in a great location in Temple Bar and close to other major attractions or on a bus route.  It felt like a nice refuge from the hustle and bustle of Dublin.  We would stay there again and we would recommend it to friends.",4,2012,05,06
225,A mistake,We stayed in the Bram Stoker suite. No view as no windows  only roof windows which we had to keep shut because of the thumping from nearby night clubs.    Noise stopped about 3am and we opened skylights but the seagulls had arrived by then.     Did not like the rules and regulations. E.g. If we soiled bed or floor ‚Ç¨100 fine.    Escort guests of premises etc.     No reception. This was not an hotel.  Although we had booked and paid for two nights we left after one. One of the worst experiences i have had.  Breakfast in the cafe was good.,1,2012,05,05
225,Disappointed.,"I was very disappointed in the merchant house. I had booked it online and it was in the hotels section, listed as a boutique hotel. This is very misleading as it is a guesthouse. You are essentially renting a room in a house. There is no reception and no facilities. 
The location is in the heart of temple bar. It was very noisy at night and difficult to sleep. 
Our breakfast was in a cafe down the road, the stage door, but they did not understand the terms gluten free or coeliac so I didn't have anything to eat.
 
There were long black hairs on the lockers which put me off and the carpet is that hard wearing stuff they put in schools, really rough on your feet.

Somebody has gone mad with a label maker and labelled literally everything in the room!
 
Overall I felt it had been miss sold and didn't live up to my expectations. ",3,2012,04,24
225,One Night in Dublin,"We had just gotten married, and were staying in Dublin for one night before we flew out of the country.  We decided to treat ourselves with a boutique hotel in the heart of everything, and this hotel met all expectations. 

We were staying in the Oscar Wilde Suite.  If you're in there, be ready to walk up 4 flights of stairs. This is truly an old 18th century Irish house, which means there are no lifts/elevators to help you out with your luggage.  

The Suite was beautiful and very intimate. So intimate that the door to the bathroom was a partially sand blasted glass, which means you can see your roomie (in this case my new husband) at his most intimate.  I figured I'm living the rest of my life with this man, so might as well get used to these things, but if I was travelling with someone else, it would've been a different story.  

The location is great.  You can walk to tons of bars and restaurants, and their sound proof windows held up so slept through the night.",4,2012,04,24
225,Quiet and elegant in Temple Bar,"We were extremely happy with The Merchant House. We stayed in the Bram Stoker room which is in the back. Consequently, though there are no views, there is no noise either. Yet when you walk out the door you find yourself in the heart of theTemple Bar area. The Castle is just up the hill, Christchurch Cathedral is a 5 minute walk, the Quay is just down the hill, Trinity College and the Book of Kells were maybe a 10 minute walk. This property is located on a side street off Temple Bar, still in the ""zone"", on cobblestones, but without the ruckus.

The room itself  was elegant. It had two skylights and two frosted windows onto an inner rooftop, so it had plenty of light though no view. This turned out to be a great thing as it was super quiet, I don't know how you could find a quieter room in the Temple Bar area.

The bed was Queen sized and very comfortable, as were the comforter and pillows.

We were a little taken aback at first as we had planned to crash for a bit in the lobby after our overnight flight but there was no lobby. However they did store our bags and have our room ready when promised so in retrospect, given that they are a B&B/Inn and not a hotel this is something to plan for but not hold against them.

Everything was meticulously clean, and decorated with good taste. We had a bit of trouble getting the temp consistent in the shower but there was no shortage of hot water and the flow was good.
Breakfast was included and provided by a fantastic little place around the corner. Very charming, excellent food (quality and volume) and super friendly service.

The room is termed a 'suite' though it is really just a room, but well-appointed and a fair size for a city room.

Very easy to get an a cab to airport. Just walk half a block to the main street and cabs fly by every 10 seconds.

I would definitely go back. I would be interested in some of the larger rooms in the front too. Although they look out over the street they are on a higher floor and I'm betting they are quiet too, as the actual road this is on, though right off Temple Bar, is not itself busy.",5,2012,04,22
225,"Great room, great location, very little service","The Merchant House in Dublin is perfectly located in the Temple Bar area of Dublin. The room is spacious to say the least. It is nicely decorated and clean. In spite of being on a busy street there is NO noise. You cannot here a thing from outside.
If you are familiar with Dublin, this is a perfect place. However, we were not and could have used some advice as to what to see and where to go. You can reach someone by phone but our cell phone did not work in Ireland. We have been staying in B&B's and were use to the direct contact with our hosts usually at breakfast. At the Merchant House you eat breakfast around the corner at a wonderful cafe. ",4,2012,04,12
225,honeymoon stay,"We booked the Oscar Wilde 'suite' for the second part of our honeymoon. The hotel was fairly easy to find and in central temple bar. It was lovely and clean and the bed was very comfortable.

Unfortunately what was not mentioned ont he hotel information is that it is directly opposite a nightclub, and as you can imagine this was very noisy on a night, we were luckily on the top floor but the noise was still excessive. when going back to the hotel on an evening, there was often drunk people sat on the hotel doorset, this was not a nice thing to go back to! 

The room itself can not be classes as a suite, to me a suite has a different bedroom and lounge area but this was all in one, with this, the bathroom seemed to be an after though and had a glass door/wall. Its not the best thing in the world to see your new husband on the loo!! We share a lot but thats over the line.

Although breakfast is included in the price, it is not mentioned that this is in a cafe on a different street. Breakfast itself was lovely, the cafe was small and quirky which I love.

Overall the room was nice it just needs to have an actual wall seperating the bathroom and more information on the website. 

Unfortunately, i wouldnt visit this hotel again, it is very overpriced for what it was",3,2012,04,07
225,Sweet suites to suit business and pleasure,"4 differing suites - all of which I have stayed in over last 2 months. Always a new touch of sumptuousness or soft furnishings added. A bit of 5* deluxe luxury at 3 star prices.Ideal for working from or holidaying in. With breakfast available at the local upmarket cafe, it is ideal for the early bird or the party animal late riser - I have done both. right in the hear to the action, but the tight-fitting windows keep out the rowdiest pub smokers.",5,2012,03,20
225,Fabulous,The Merchant House is ideally located in Temple Bar with all the pubs and eating places close by.  We stayed in the Oscar Wilde suite which was gorgeous roomy clean and had a wonderfully  comfortable bed.  It is however at the top of the building which means a few flights of stairs so if you don't like stairs consider one of the other suites. The windows are soundproofed and we were not bothered in the slightest by outside noise and we had the bathroom window open to allow some air through. Would recommend and would stay again :) Very happy customer,5,2012,03,12
225,Beautiful suite & superb location,"My fiance & I stayed one night in Merchant House - to celebrate our engagement. Our suite was the Oscar Wilde suite which is at the very top of the house so lots of stairs to climb but SO worth it!  The suite is truly beautiful with a vaulted beamed ceiling & a lovely brick fireplace.  There was an i-pod docking station, tea/coffee making facilities, complimentary water & a mini-bar as well as free wi-fi. The bed was very comfortable and the room a comfortable temperature once the heating was switched off as it was an unseasonably warm day in Dublin. I would highly recommend Merchant House to anyone & would definitely stay again.",5,2012,02,29
225,excellent right in the heart of the city,"an excellent place to stay, very clean, spacious and modern.  I booked three rooms for three nights and everyone in our party was extremelly happy with the suites.  Situated in the very heart of the city within walking distance of all the pubs. It has been said about the noise from outside being very loud, but personally there was very little.  What can I say an excellent place to stay, will definately be booking for next six nations rugby.",5,2012,02,12
225,A stellar suite,"This is truly the best guest house we have ever stayed in. Located within Temple Bar, the Merchant House is perfectly located if you want to explore Dublin.

We stayed in the W B Yeats suite. Beautifully appointed with one double bed and a single bed. TV and DVD player, clock radio with iPod functionality, plenty of lights, a fridge, a bathroom with a heated floor. The service is impeccable and upon arrival, we were greeted and taken to our suite. 

The one thing that did surprise us was the inclusion of ear plugs. The Merchant House is opposite a night club so please bear this in mind.

All in all, the Merchant House is the best guest house we've ever been in. Thoroughly and highly recommended. We are definitely booking again.",5,2011,11,26
225,Lovely lovely guesthouse to stay in,"Superb little guesthouse delighted we chose it. Very clean, modern comfortable and we really enjoyed our stay. The location is perfect, right in the heart of temple bar. We found the parking in fleet street quite expensive, even tho u get a discount if ur staying in the merchant house. We were parked from 5pm until 4pm the following day and were charged 24euro. The breakfast in the little cafe around the corner was excellant and included in the price.. ",5,2011,11,13
225,Dublin`s best,"We spent 3 nights at Merchant House, Temple Bar, Dublin.  Excellent location and superb cozy suite.  Host and staff were very kind and welcoming. It was a pleasure to go for breakfast at the cafe around the corner.  Food was excellent.  Almost all the sights are within walking distance or a short bus ride. We really enjoyed our visit to Dublin and our stay at Merchant House.  We highly recommend!",5,2011,09,23
225,Great location!,"Stayed 2 nights in July over a weekend. Great location where we could easily walk to many sites, and our suite was very comfortable and nicely appointed. While the Temple Bar area did tend to get noisy at night, we still enjoyed our spacious suite and would definitely stay at the Merchant House again. As a side note, others have remarked that the bathroom glass door did not offer full privacy. In our suite the bedroom was on one side of the entrance hall and the bathroom on the other. We were traveling with our kids and just closed the bedroom door to provide more privacy.",5,2011,08,30
225,Great location and no problems with noise,"Just came back from 2 nights staying at the merchant house. We were in the Bram Stoker room and couldn't hear any of the noise that previous reviewers have mentioned. Great welcome by the manager. Food was fine at the cafe and the bed was really comfy. Brilliant location for all the sites. Would def recommend The Merchant House to anyone. Free, fast Internet is also a plus!",5,2011,08,29
225,Perfect location .... very noise,"We spent two night in the Merchant House. It is located in the Temple bar District .. ..perfect for everything in Dublin. Breakfast has been in a Coffee shop over the corner ... was ok.. but this appartments do have one big problem ..... You can¬¥t sleep, because of the noise coming from the street and the visitors of the Temple Bar district  are very loud, too..... Come with ear protection, then it is very nice there.",3,2011,08,26
225,"Very nice room, good location, but too noisy","The title says it all. Check in service was good, although a couple ahead of us had been waiting for an unknown length of time. The location is in the heart of the Temple Bar area and is convenient for walking. This is both a pro and a con. The room itself is great. Stylish, modern and well maintained. We loved the room and location; but we also hated the location: directly across the street from the Mezz Club. 

Until 2:30 or 3:00 AM all we heard or felt was the thumping/pounding bass. I expressed to my mife that I felt as though I was in an Essurance commercial (the commercial where they mention one person is a DJ). 

If you are the type who loves nightlife and bar hopping - the so-called, Pub Crawl - stay here. You wil love the location. 

If we go back, we will choose another location a bit outside the Temple Bar area.",3,2011,08,15
225,Gorgeous!,"It is a gorgeous hotel, the perfect place to stay in Dublin. I stayed in the Bram Stoker room on the first floor and it couldn't be better. As for the staff, perfect, helpful and kind. I am looking forward to going back to Dublin and I will definitely choose The Merchant House.",5,2011,08,07
225,"Superb, stylish and wonderful","Stayed just one night in The Merchant House Dublin, wish we could of stayed longer.  Our room the James Joyce Suite was superb and stylish, couldnt have wished for more.  The breakfast although not served on the premises was at a lovely small cafe at the bottom of the street where the staff couldnt do enough for us.  Would definately recommend The Merchant House and The Stage Door Cafe to anyone.",5,2011,07,19
225,The pictures dont lie,"Nice little B&B right in the middle of Temple Bar, where all the action is. And virtually all other attractions on walking distance. Rooms (only 4) are very spacious (over 50 sqm) and beautifully decorated. Our suite had a (small) queen size and a single bed. Not really fit for three, but very good for two. Personally, I would have preferred a large king size bed, but thats personal. 

Two negatives; they didnt change towells during our three-night stay, and the bathroom fan makes a lot of noise. As this fan is switched with the bathroom light, you cant leave the light on without constant noise. Peanuts.

Breakfast is in a cafe just around the corner (8 am to 8 pm, and you can order as you like). 

I read some remarks on the water pressure, but to me this wasnt disturbing. Also street noise nor stair case noise wast bothering at all.

On the day we left, we could store our luggage during the day. As these is no reception, you have to call to get your things back, and after calling it took only a few minutes before someone arrived. Perfect. 

One could say that an average ‚Ç¨ 150 per night is a lot of money, but for a room this size right in the heart of a European capital, I would say its a bargain. If I would ever visit Dublin again, I would definitely consider staying here again.",4,2011,06,29
225,Superb,"We stayed for one night and wished we stayed longer. The check in was friendly, fast and efficient. The girl checking us in gave a great level of customer service. The accomodation is modern, comfortable and very spacious. There are dvds to watch if you are staying in and refreshments in the mini bar. Breakfast in Stage Door Cafe around the corner was lovely too. We were also able to leave our bags the next day so we could go home later rather than at check out time. All in all a wonderful stay in this great place.",5,2011,05,31
225,"Roomy, comfy and cozy","Stayed here on the first leg of a tour around Ireland. The rooms were surprisingly large and nicely appointed. We stayed a few floor above street level facing a popular temple bar street.  The location was perfect base to tour around the city.  A few notes about our stay:

* There was a surge in noise around 2am due to the bars closing, but the noise died down quickly we were not bothered - the window helped insulate most of the noise
* We were informed that the showers were not pressure showers and found the facilities perfectly adequate
* After a full day of walking it was great to stop back into our room for a rest/break before heading out for the night. 

We tried to book again on our last leg  and were disappointed to find it full.",4,2011,04,23
225,Whatever you do don't leave negative feedback!!!,"Booked this through booking.com.  Our stay was overall good, and I left what I considered to some constructive feedback.
""The room was very well furnished and the beds remarkably comfortable. Beautifully decorated and good quality fittings. The outside of the building belies what is on the inside. The IPod dock, TV and DVD player provide entertainment if you can't find enough outside your door in Temple Bar!! The woman who welcomed us was very helpful and made us feel very welcome. The double glazing blocks most of the street noise which given this is in the heart of Temple Bar is no mean feat. Breakfast at the Stage Door was fantastic- the service there is second to none, we were made to feel really welcome- I'm only sorry we weren't staying for another night!! - highly recommended
- The shower was a huge disappointment, the owners have clearly spent well on good quality fixtures and fittings. yet the shower was a cheap electric job. In a hotel at 150euro a night I would expect a power shower at the very least. Also a surprise was the cheap powdered coffee left in the room, again I would expect better quality at these prices. Finally the James Joyce room is the first of the rooms and the layout of the building means that all other guests have to pass the room, making for a very noisy early morning. I would recommend not booking this room if you want a lay in.""
And for that I received this response!

Dear Ms W,
 
First of let me thank you personally for staying at The Merchant House on your recent stay in Dublin. I wish to thank you also for the high rating you gave us on the Booking.com web review page, however as you took the time out to write this review, it is my job as Manager to comment on this review.
 
On any of our profile pages there is no mention of The Merchant House having ‚ÄòPower Showers‚Äô. During the building renovations we had modern Triton electric showers installed, they are top grade in their area and more than adequate . The Temple bar area has a reduced water pressure most of the time and we were advised not to install power showers  for this reason.
 
The complimentary Tea / Coffee is more than adequate and is Nescafe Gold Blend. I am sorry you were disappointed with its flavour. We feel we offer excellent value in all our Suites. The James Joyce Suite is a triple and superbly good value at ‚Ç¨150 for max 3 Guests including full breakfast. I feel your negative comments were slightly petty but again thank you so much for the positive ones. On your next visit you might select a Suite on a higher floor , thus reducing stair noise but we will not be changing our Coffee selection or providing a power shower.
 
Again, on behalf of our small staff here in Dublin, a big thank you .................
 
Best regards
Mike Ryan
Manager",3,2011,03,11
225,Already looking forward to our return visit,"My Mum and I spent 2 nights in the James Joyce suite between xmas and New Year and are already looking forward to our return visit in March.

We arrived 4 hours prior to check in but were able to leave our bags whilst we went out for lunch. Upon check in we were guided up to the suite and amazed to see it looked even better than the website picture portrays. Spacious, great attention to detail and lots of nice touches. 

The location was ideal for a short stay - just round the corner from Temple Bar and Grafton Street. There was a late night venue across the street and so it could be quite noisy in the early hours but that‚Äôs a small price to pay in my opinion.

Breakfast is served at a lovely cosy cafe around the corner. On our first night we went out to look for somewhere to eat at around 7.30pm. It was 9pm before we found somewhere with a free table! The second night we went for the early diners option at FXB which is a 2 minute walk from the Merchant House. This place was definitely the highlight of our short break. Lovely cosy setting, friendly staff and amazing steaks. In fact it was the best meal I have had in a long time. Do not miss it! We also enjoyed food at Salamanca for a reasonable price and drinks at O'Neill's bar.
Dublin is very expensive with a huge mark up on UK prices. Expect to pay around ¬£5 for a glass of wine or pint and around ¬£17 for main course.

I have already recommended the Merchant House to friends and I am taking family back with me in March.",5,2011,01,07
225,"Lovely Hotel, Great Location","Very much enjoyed The Merchant House.  Right in the middle of the Temple Bar District - beware the bar just outside of the rooms though as it can be quite noisy for those who are light sleepers (despite the double glazed windows).  We had a little trouble with the power/lights inside the room but still, enjoyed this room thoroughly.  Lots of room, the bathroom is lovely and thought the semi-glazed doors wonderful (though be sure to keep your curtains closed!).  Magda in particular was incredibly helpful and a joy to talk to.  The beds were comfortable, it is within easy distance to everything you would need in Dublin and the breakfast down the street is more than ample.  The room was also clean, all the fittings fantastic and heating was spot on.  Definitely would stay there again.",5,2011,01,03
225,"Great location, but cold!","I know it is freezing everywhere just now but  I found the heating at the Merchant House less than adequate. It is preset on a small radiator,not really large enough to heat a suite of this size. We asked for and were given an additional radiator to heat us up. We booked two suites, James Joyce and WB Yeats. Both are indeed luxurious and impressive. I didn't like the IKEA pillows and duvets, call me fussy but I expected better quality at 150E per night! Towels were thin also. Staff were very helpful  and friendly. Despite the double glazing there is some street noise which in Summer I would imagine could be irritating if the windows were open. Not keen on the glass door into the toilet, not much privacy.",4,2010,12,07
225,Do yourself a favor and stop looking... STAY HERE.,"I don‚Äôt even know where to start. Our suite at the merchant house cost 3 euro more then a tiny little hotel room at the holiday inn, and yet it was without a doubt the most amazing room we had on our 2 week honeymoon through Ireland and Scotland. I almost didn‚Äôt want to write a review because I don‚Äôt want to let the secrete out, but this place was just too good to hide. The ONLY draw back was that at first glance the alley that it is on seems a little sketchy. After those first few seconds however you realize that the Merchant house is next to the Irish Film Institute, across the street from another quaint little B&B and as perfectly located in the center of town as you could possibly ask for. Also, if/when you do stay here check out the little courtyard down the alley next door. Local vender's sell fresh baked breads and pastries. If you are visiting Dublin just stay here... I don't know how else to say it.",5,2010,12,03
225,a stunning experience and a gem in dublin,"I've been looking forward to my trip to Dublin for quiet some time.
As i travel to Dublin several times a year i stayed in many hotels over the years but nothing prepared me for this place. The Merchant house situated perfectly in Temple Bar.
I was welcomed by Magda - the Lady of the House - and i felt like somebody very important. The room she showed me was stunning - it took my breath away.
As you enter there is two fireplaces and a huge room very well appointed 
flat-screen TV and DVD player with a selection of movies to choose from.
Magda explained everything to me and had even the time to have a small chat - 
very rare in the busy days - but it made me feel so comfortable.
The beds are amazing soft cushions and very relaxing mattresses very rarely to be found those days.
There is so much attention to details i hardly know where to start.
There is a fridge with some juice in it complimentary and tea and coffee facilities. 
Magda as well handed me a voucher for a coffee shop where i could have my breakfast from 8 o clock in the morning till 8 o clock in the evening and if you do not fancy a fry you have the choice of a wrap or other items.

I stayed 2 nights in the merchant House unfortunately it was fully booked for the 3. night i would have canceled my other place if there would have been space.

As from now on the merchant House is my number one place  to stay in Dublin.

If there is something to improve it would be the shower as it is the only thing not up to the high standard of the room.

I have seen the other 3 rooms in the Merchant House and they are all top notch fantastic place and i can't praise it high enough.

Last my thanks are going to the whole staff so friendly and welcoming specially Magda, Sheeshan and Renier.
My apologies if i wrote there names wrong.

The Merchant House worth a visit and well worth the price.

thank you so much",5,2010,11,17
225,One Word - FANTASTIC,Loved it.  We had the Oscar Wilde Suite - it was beautiful.  Breakfast in the Stage Door Cafe was brilliant and nice friendly atmosphere!  Very central to everything.  All in all a brilliant weekend.,5,2010,10,19
225,Brilliant!,"Really enjoyed our stay at the Merchant House, rooms were great and everything was catered for.  Each room had a mini fridge, hairdryer, flat screen tv, dvd player as well as shampoo and shower gel - everything thought of.  The staff are very helpful and breakfast was in a little cafe just around the corner - which again was great.  The location was brilliant, only a 2 minute walk from the temple bar pubs etc  We all had an excellent time :-)",5,2010,07,28
225,WOW,"This place is amazing! My friends booked this as a present for my 30th. 4 of us went & they booked 2 suites. I was staying in the Oscar Wilde Suite on the top floor, OMG it was amazing. The owner shows you around then you are left to yourselves. You are right in the heart of Temple Bar so it's not the quitest place for sleeping but the luxury of the room makes up for it. I couldn't recommed it highly enough & cannot wait to stay there again with my BF. You are given a voucher for your breakfast for an amazing cafe around the corner, it was fab.",5,2010,07,14
225,Ottima sistemazione in Temple Bar,"Ampia suite lussuosa, ben arredata al centro di Temple Bar. La stanza √® insonorizzata e si riesce a riposare bene. Pulizia perfetta.

Noi eravamo alloggiati nella suite ""Oscar Wilde"" all'ultimo piano, quindi la pi√π silenziosa, ma per contro la pi√π scomoda da raggiungere: tenete ben presente che non esiste ascensore  e dovete salire una scaletta ripida e stretta al terzo piano.

225,Mitten in Temple Bar,"Wir haben in der W.B. Yeats Suite √ºbernachtet. Die Suite war gem√ºtlich eingerichtet und sauber, das Badezimmer modern. 
Die Lage ist absolute Spitze! Pubs, Bars, Restaurants und Clubs sind in direkter N√§he. Es kann dadurch zwar teilweise drau√üen etwas lauter werden, uns pers√∂nlich hat es aber nicht gest√∂rt (f√ºr leichte Schl√§fer stehen Ohrst√∂psel bereit).

225,Ideal,"No es un hotel!!!!!!
Son suites. Situaci√≤n fant√°stica, en medio de todo ""temple"". Aunque es cierto que el lugar puede producirte respeto por el tipo de negocio que hay al lado, no os debe preocupar.

Las suites lo tienen todo!!!! Son c√≥modas y tienen todo lo necesario. Hay que confirmar la hora de llegada para que os est√©n esperando y os puedan hacer el checkin.

Recomendable 100%",5,2017,04,17
225,"Maravilloso lugar, no un hotel pero fant√°stico","Es importante al reservar saber que NO ES UN HOTEL. Como su nombre dice, son suites que cuentan con espacios muy amplios, minibar, plancha, cafetera, etc. Pero no es un hotel, no cuenta con servicio permanente (hay conserjer√≠a de 9AM a 7PM, te hacen la habitaci√≥n a diario), no hay comedor, no hay zonas comunes, no hay parking,... Por no haber, no hay ni recepci√≥n. Las habitaciones son maravillosas, muy espaciosas y decoradas de forma ecl√©ctica pero en conjunto hermoso. Muy bien situado, en pleno Temple Bar, al lado del Trinity College. El servicio de conserjer√≠a es muy atento y te ayuda en todo lo que necesites. En resumen, no dudar√≠a en volver, nos encant√≥.",5,2016,09,11
225,Come a casa!,"Centralissimo alloggio a Dublino, nonostante si trovi nel caotico,rumoroso e affollato Temple Bar District, la stanza era silenziosissima. Tutto molto pulito e confortevole. Lo staff preciso ed efficiente. Non esiste la reception, quindi niente orari... Solo un mazzo di chiavi e serrature da aprire e chiudere! Consigliato per coppie responsabili di qualsiasi et√†",5,2016,03,21
225,ECCELLENTE SISTEMAZIONE,"Diciamo subito che non √® un albergo ma si tratta di grandi suite nella zona della movida di Dublino: niente paura le camere sono totalmente insonorizzate e la tranquillit√† del riposo √® assicurata. 
Insomma se non avete a tutti i costi necessit√† di un portiere e di un servizio 24 h riteniamo che questa sia una soluzione ideale per soggiornare nel centro di Dublino. 
Unica pecca: non c'√® l'ascensore e la scala stretta ed abbastanza ripida pu√≤ essere scomoda per chi ha problemi (anche transitori) di mobilit√†. 
Macchina della Nespresso a disposizione...e qui non √® poca cosa. 
Gentilissimo il personale.

225,Luxussuite mit viel L√§rm,"Auf den 1. Blick eine wirklich wundersch√∂ne, exklusive Suite, der 2. Blick kommt dann am n√§chsten Tag. Leider ist kein Schlaf m√∂glich, L√§rm, trotz doppelter Verglasung bis am Morgen, das Kingsize Bett 150 cm breit ( laut Manager ist das das genormte UK Kingsizebett Ma√ü), sehr weich, zu zweit sehr unangenehm, dann kommen noch die mehr als 50 Stufen der steilen und sehr schmalen Treppen nach oben in die Suite, kein Lift. . Kein Vergn√ºgen mit schwerem Koffer! Bei der Reklamation, es sei sehr laut, wurde man auf die Ohrst√∂psel neben dem Bett verwiesen, da macht Urlaub nicht wirklich Spa√ü, leider. Der Service (Einf√ºhrung in die Suite, Sofortige R√ºckmeldung auf die Zimmerbewertung Vorort )allerdings ist ausgezeichnet.",3,2015,08,09

Barrio maravilloso. Y es que Dublin me enamor√≥.",5,2015,06,15
225,Nel cuore di Dublino,"The Merchand House √® una location comodissima per chi desidera esplorare il centro di Dublino. Nel cuore di Temple Bar, il Merchand offre camere splendide, confortevoli e silenziose anche per chi, come me, ha il sonno leggero. Adatto a persone indipendenti che non necessitano della presenza costante della conciergerie o della reception.",4,2014,08,28
225,Super Zimmer mitten im Vergn√ºgungsviertel,"Sehr sch√∂ne  und ger√§umige Zimmer (alles zusammen ca. 50 qm) mitten in Dublins Vergn√ºgungsviertel.  Modern, super Bad, einfach gut, sauber und sehr empfehlenswert. 
In Temple Barr wird bis zum Morgengrauen bei Live-Music gefeiert. Daher kann es auch recht laut werden. Im Zimmer sorgt eine zus√§tzliche, sehr schwere Scheibe f√ºr eine gewisse Nachtruhe, aber manchmal kann es notwendig sein, die am Bett bereitstehenden Ohrst√∂psel zu benutzen. 
Eigentlich handelt es sich um Appartements, da es zum Fr√ºhst√ºcken 60 Meter um die Ecke rum in ein Cafe geht. Super nett dort, netter Chef und super Kaffee. Dort hat man die Wahl zwischen verschiedensten Speisen, einfach top.
Das Bram Stocker Zimmer gefiel mir pers√∂nlich nicht so gut (liegt ruhig nach hinten raus, hat aber nur 2 motorbetriebende Dachfenster). Unser Yames Yojce Zimmer dagegen war super modern, mit Fenstern vorne und hinten raus. Alles ist fu√ül√§ufig innerhalb von wenigen Minuten zu erreichen. So zentral habe ich selten gewohnt. 
F√ºr Dublin- und pubinteressierte sowie sp√§t ins Bett-Geher bestens geeignet, f√ºr ger√§uschempfindliche oder z√∂gerliche Personen (aufgrund des Sexshops im Erdgescho√ü) eher nicht zu empfehlen.",5,2014,05,27
225,HORRIBLE EXPERIENCIA,"Terrorifica Experiencia!!!  este guest house no tiene ningun personal a partir de las 16 hs. Teniamos pagadas 6 noches en este establecimiento, en nuestra 3era noche un pasajero de la habitacion de abajo completemente borracho empezo a golpear violentamente la puerta de nuestra habitacion buscando pelea, lo hizo varias veces. Nuestros hijos estaban en otra habitacion. corriamos peligro de vida. Llamamos a la policia que por suerte llego rapido. les arrojamos las llaves por la ventana ya que estabamos encerrados sin poder hacer nada. La policia nos custodio para salir de ese lugar  e ir a otro hotel. A las 2.30 hs de la madrugada estabamos caminando solos por las calles de Dublin buscando otro hotel. Al dia siguiente hablamos con el due√±o del establecimiento y no nos quizo reconocer ni un centavo a pesar de que no usamos las 3 noches que nos quedaban pagadas.   Adjunto el reporte efectuado por la policia de Dublin.",1,2014,02,18
225,St√§dteflug Dublin,"Das Merchant House ist zentral gelegen und doch ruhig.
Das Hotel liegt mitten im Ausgehviertel Temple Bar.

Gute Busverbindung vom und zum Flughafen.",5,2014,02,12
225,Mieser Service,"Im Zentrum des Vergn√ºgungsviertels gelegen, das ist aber auch alles. Unfreundlicher Empfang, steile Treppen bis zum Zimmer unterm Dach ohne Aufzug erinnern an Altbauten in Amsterdam, besonders spannend mit grossem Gep√§ck. Fenster √∂ffnen wg. n√§chtlichem L√§rm unm√∂glich, Klimaanlage = Fehlanzeige, bei 28 Grad Aussentemperatur √ºber mehre Tage kein Vergn√ºgen. Kein Fr√ºhst√ºck im Haus m√∂glich.

225,Suite spettacolari,"Essere a temple bar senza il caso di temple bar.....non ha prezzo.
Le camere sono molto ampie, ogni aspetto √® curato nei minimi dettagli....ideale anche per soggiorni lunghi (considerando che si ha disposizione quasi un mini appartamento).
Manca la reception, ma a volta puo esser anche un plus.
Nulla da segnalare che non mi abbia soddisfato...",4,2013,06,15
225,stupendo!!!,"Sistemazione ottimale in pieno centro, ideale per spostarsi in citt√† a piedi e godere della vita notturna. Camera arredata  e curata nei minimi particolari, pulita e dotata di ogni comfort, lo staff dell hotel √® molto gentile e disponibile! se dovessi tornare a Dublino, sceglierei senza dubbio Merchant House!!!",5,2013,04,18
225,Ottimo!!,"Il Merchant House √® una guest house di ""lusso"" ,le camere sono tutte suite e hanno nomi di personaggi famosi irlandesi,noi eravamo nella suite  YEATS,dedicata appunto allo scrittore.
√® uno stabile indipendente i gestori non si vedono spesso,incaricano altra gente sia  per la consegna delle chiavi,tutte le relative spiegazioni e il pagamento,stessi ragazzi che spesso si occupano anche della pulizia,gentilissimi davvero tutti,alla fine del soggiorno ci hanno permesso di lasciare le valigie in custodia per l'ultimo giro senza alcun costo aggiuntivo.
La stanza era semplicemente stupenda,enorme luminosa con un letto fantastico e comodissimo. Unica pecca forse √® la porta del bagno in vetro satinato che lascia poca ""privacy"",ma per noi non era un problema. Le stanze sono insonorizzate grazie ai vetri delle finestre in questo modo non arriva nessun rumore dall'affollato e rumoroso quartiere di Temple Bar dove si trova la guest House,questo permette quindi sonni tranquilli pur essendo centralissimi alla movida Dublinese.
La Colazione √® servita in un piccolo e caratteristico caff√® THE STAGE DOOR CAF√®, nella strada subito dietro l'angolo, il posto √® molto piccolo e accogliente,la proprietaria √® una tipa biondissima, simile ad una Bratz (infatti c'√® una riproduzione),di una simpatia e una dolcezza incredibile e si mangia molto molto bene e tanto :D
Consigliato vivamente se si pu√≤ spendere qualcosina in pi√π,sia per i comfort che per la posizione!!!Ma ovviamente non √® una sistemazione economica,per√≤ √® il giusto compromesso per chi ricerca la qualit√† senza esagerare!!",4,2012,12,17
225,Scandaloso andare al bar per la colazione con i buoni,"Ubicazione fantastica e silenzio totale in pieno Temple Bar.Scandalosa l'accoglienza.Al nostro arrivo la ragazza della Reception(inesistente)era in macchina parcheggiata,quindi impossibile da localizzare.La colazione, seppur eccellente,√® in un bar distante dalla camera(in un'altra via) ed √® solo all'irlandese(vegetariani alla larga...).La camera Bram Stoker non √® 5stelle.",4,2012,08,22
225,Absolut empfehlenswert!,"- tolle Lage mitten in Temple Bar
- sehr geraeumiges, sauberes, gut ausgestattetes Appartement
- kostenloses WiFI
- sehr freundliches und zuvorkommendes Personal
- Fruehstueck a la carte (Sonderwuensche moeglich) von 8 bis 20(!) Uhr in einem Cafe 2 Gehminuten entfernt

Achtung: nichts fuer Menschen, die absolute Ruhe haben wollen (dann wohnt man aber auch nicht in Temple Bar ;)",5,2012,08,09
225,ottima scelta,"in visita a Dublino nel mese di ottobre, ho scelto questa Guest House per la sua posizione e per la bellezza delle suite che proponeva: scelta migliore non poteva essere fatta !
La camera che avevamo prenotato era esattamente come ce la aspettavamo, molto spaziosa e dotata di ogni comfort...la porta del bagno in vetro satinato riceve e da' luce alla camera, lasciando pero' meno "" privacy""..
le finestre sono dotate di doppi vetri, percio' non arrivano rumori dalla strada e dai locali sottostanti
piacevolissima la  colazione allo Stage Door Cafe', dietro l'angolo,  a pochi passi dal Mechant House: si e' accolti con cortesia e simpatia e sinceramente quello che ci hanno preparato ( su nostra richiesta) e' sempre stato molto buono
In pieno Temple Bar, con ogni comfort ed allo stesso tempo ben posizionato rispetto alla fermata del autobus da e per l'aeroporto, senza dimenticare che a piedi si raggiungono alcuni posti per mangiare assolutamente da non perdere !!!!!!!!!!
Consigliato vivamente !!!",4,2011,10,26
225,Centralissimo e super confortevole!,"Sono stata a Dublino dal 4 al 9 ottobre 2011 con due amiche e abbiamo dormito al Merchant House per 5 notti, che dire? Tutto perfetto; la suite era bellissima, spaziosa e moderna, con particolari ad effetto. Il bagno molto bello se non fosse per la porta a vetri che non √® proprio l' ideale per la privacy! La posizione √® perfetta a pochi metri da tutte le maggiori attrazioni di Dublino, nel quartiere di Temple Bar che potrebbe essere molto rumoroso ma le finestre hanno i doppi vetri e si dorme bene. La colazione non viene servita al B&B ma allo Stage Door Caf√® in Essex Street ( molto vicino), gestito da un tipo gentilissimo e simpaticissimo; irish breakfast oppure semplice pane burro e marmellata tutto buonissimo!",4,2011,10,18
225,Luxusunterkunft bestens geeignet f√ºr's Pubcrawling,"Zentral im Temple Bar District gelegen bietet das Merchant House Luxussuiten, die jeweils nach irischen Dichtern benannt sind. Die Ausstattung ist individuell und umfassend (mehr braucht es nicht), die Zimmer inkl. Bad sehr sauber und die Betten sehr bequem. Das Fruehstueck wird im benachbarten Stage Door Cafe angeboten. Das Full Irish Breakfast ist sehr gut und kann individuell angepasst werden. Nachts kann es im Club auf der anderen Seite der Eustace Street etwa lauter werden, aber schliesslich ist man selbst ja auch zum Feiern in Dublin, warum sonst sollte man in Temple Bar eine Unterkunft suchen? :-)",5,2011,09,25
225,Hervorragend!,"Die Zimmer sind gro√ür√§umig, die Liebe zum Detail ist herausragend. Die Lage direkt im Zentrum von Templebar ist optimal, trotz des L√§rms auf der Stra√üe bekommt man im Zimmer davon nichts mit!

225,"Im Herzen Dublins, sehr sauber, kostenloses WiFi","Ein sehr sch√∂nes Haus im Herzen von Dublin.

Trotzdem relativ ruhig. Kostenloses Internet. Die Zimmer sind mit Liebe zum Detail eingerichtet und sehr modern. Vor allem das Bad war spitze. Die Betten waren etwas klein.

Fr√ºhst√ºck gibt es im benachbarten Caf√©. An sich eine gute Idee. Uns wurde gesagt, wir k√∂nnen dort fr√ºhst√ºcken, was und so viel wir wollen. Dem war aber nicht so. Alles, was √ºber ‚Ç¨ 7,95 hinausging, mussten wir selbst bezahlen. Das sollte man vorher gesagt bekommen.

Ansonsten aber durchaus zu empfehlen.",4,2011,05,19
225,suite da premi nobel!,"con 5 amiche siamo state a dublino al merchant house per 3 notti. si tratta di un piccolissimo bed and breakfast di sole 4 stanze dedicate ciascuna ai letterati famosi di dublino. le stanze sono moderne, pulite, spaziose e dotate di buoni comfort. la posizione dell'hotel √® centralissima (zona temple bar) e quindi molto comoda per visitare la citt√† a piedi. l'aspetto negativo √® la presenza di un locale notturno proprio di fronte che, nonostante i doppi vetri, disturbava il nostro sonno. la colazione non viene servita in albergo, ma in un bar nelle vicinanze gestito da una simpatica e gentilissima dublinese fidanzata con un italiano. noi abbiamo optato per la classica colazione con cappuccino, toast, burro e marmellata, ma il men√π √® vario e si pu√≤ scegliere ci√≤ che si vuole per un corrispettivo di circa 8 euro. che altro dire? andateci.",4,2010,12,02
