221,"Good facilities, great location, poor service","Service in the restaurant and bar was poor: erratic, slow, error-prone and not of a 4 star hotel quality level. ",3,2024,10,19
221,Ideal location,"This hotel is very modern and clean, in the centre of Dublin City with only a 7 minute walk to Grafton street , very reasonably priced, staff were lovely and food was good too ",5,2024,10,17
221,Super nice place,"Nice and beautiful hotel, good restaurant, comfortable bed, employers super kind and good location, i will stay there for sure next time im in Dublin.",5,2024,10,16
221,One night stay; dissatisfied with service and noise,"Our room was in front of the Main Street which meant we could hear the loud music from outside. We were only there one night and it would have been a different experience if we stayed further from the Main Street as our sleep was definitely interrupted by the loud music from outside venues. I could hear the music throughout the room including the bathroom. I would suggest to avoid all front view bedrooms especially if your stay includes the weekend. 

The receptionist were not friendly. We had to wave a staff member to assist us when we first entered the lobby. There were two staff members at the front desk who clearly saw us waiting but never acknowledged our presence until we said something. This was not how we would like to be greeted at a hotel that promotes itself as upscale and 4 star. Overall we were disappointed with the staff upon entering the hotel. We also had no assistance with carrying our luggage nor were we asked by any staff member if we need assistance. ",3,2024,10,16
221,Don't expect it quiet before Midnight.,"Great service upon check in. Poor room assignment - why weren't any of those people who were attending the fully booked reception/party not given rooms right above the festitivies? Seems like a logical and respectful thing to do - not to put someone wholly unrelated to the party in a room nearest the loud music. And without any sort of warning, just very practiced apologies the morning after.",3,2024,10,15
221,Great Location to City Center,"Pleasant stay, lovely rooms and excellent breakfast. Rooms were nice.  Only drawback is the room didn't cool very quickly and we were on the fourth floor.  You also had to leave a keycard in the slot to keep the electricity on.",5,2024,10,14
221,We loved our stay at Iveagh Garden.,I'd highly recommend the hotel.  Great location to super spots in Dublin and super staff with every interaction.,5,2024,10,14
221,Best city centre lunch .,"Have been twice to this lovely hotel, in last few weeks,  to their terrific restaurant for lunch. Just off Stephen’s Green, it is easily accessible. Plenty of space in restaurant, so great for a business meeting or a catch up. The food is delicious and service is excellent. Especially the best chowder I have had in years. Also the seafood pasta.",4,2024,10,14
221,Excellent stay,This was a well appointed hotel and a great value.  We would stay again and suggest it to other travelers.,5,2024,10,13
221,Great value,"Very comfortable, central to city, great staff, relaxed atmosphere,
Best breakfast ever.
Friends were impressed. Looking forward to returning again on next visit to Dublin.",5,2024,10,09
221,Short stay,"lovely hotel, nice bar food, good atmosphere. Very friendly helpful staff.
Close to main shopping areas, great breakfast ",4,2024,10,06
221,Lovely and helpful staff,"Wonderful staff. The hotel is lovely, however the staff are the reason I am writing this review. 

A close family member had a medical emergency during our stay. Reese and Adam at the front desk were so empathetic and kind to my family. Adam stayed with us as we waited for the ambulance to arrive. Rob, the manager that evening, visited the room and was equally gracious, supportive, and friendly to my family. 

The hotel itself is fabulous and the rooms were great. However I will remember my stay best because of the people working there. 

Apologies if I’ve misspelled any of the names.",5,2024,10,06
221,Stylish townhouse hotel,"The hotel is a large townhouse, with a stylishly decorated entrance hall. I had a room on the first floor, which had no window, but as I was there to sleep that was not a problem and the room was excellent in every other respect; quite large, with soothing decor and an extremely comfortable bed. The bathroom was a good size, but only had a shower, no bath, which was a pity. The restaurant is also a pleasing place to be, although food at dinner was OK but not memorable - my burger lacked flavour. Breakfast is an extensive buffet, which has something for everyone. ",4,2024,09,27
221,Great place to stay,Hotel is perfectly situated and the staff were so accommodating and fantastic to deal with. Staff went above and beyond and made the whole experience at staying in the Iveagh garden hotel a wonderful experience. ,5,2024,09,26
221,"Room good, location good, staff not helpful","Not a good tourist hotel.  They take motor coaches but can’t provide restaurant recommendation, transportation information or provide accurate instructions.   Place is nice enough and room was clean but not much.  ",3,2024,09,24
221,Absolutely gorgeous,"This hotel is absolutely gorgeous, the decor is amazing and the staff were so friendly
Our room was beautiful, high ceilings, very comfortable bed and lovely bathroom.
Would definitely recommend for a city centre hotel as the location is perfect.",5,2024,09,24
221,Bumped and Bummed,"In more than 40 years of business and personal travel, I never had a hotel cancel a confirmed reservation the day I arrived. The reservation I made four months earlier and reconfirmed by American Airlines by email at 4 am was gone when I arrived at the hotel at noon. The hotel cancelled because it was fully booked and couldn’t comply with the request made earlier. The hotel did find us a room but not for the same price. As I went back and forth with American I watched groups arrive at the hotel. I guess it was easier for the hotel to cancel the room of a solo traveler and resell it than to bump someone traveling with a group.",1,2024,09,24
221,Comfortable and great location,"I stayed in one of the apartment suites,  which was very comfortable and spacious. As can be expected in central Dublin , the streets are noisy on weekend nights, but I had peaceful
sleeps as the bedrooms don’t look out over the street. The location is very convenient. Easy walking distance to the Temple Bar area, parks and  the airport bus stop is just around the corner. 

Staff were very friendly and helpful, and I liked the decor of lobby and restaurant. There was a fair variety of items of breakfast, and it’s very good value.",5,2024,09,19
221,Fantastic experience at Iveagh Garden Hotel,"The staff was absolutely fantastic! I was really in a rush when I checked in, and they kindly took my bags and handled the check in in less than 30 seconds. Very impressive! Overall, everything here was absolutely fantastic.",5,2024,09,17
221,I would stay there again,"This hotel definitely exceeded my expectations, especially for the price. The rooms are wonderfully decorated, very quiet considering their location in the city and have very nice bathrooms and extremely comfortable beds. It's a great location- easy to get to a lot of the city's attractions, and the staff were all lovely, friendly and helpful.",5,2024,09,11
221,VERY NICE UPMARKET HOTEL,"Very satisfied with stay, however the cost for one nights' stay, nearly €400, was exorbitant. I needed a hotel in that area at short notice and this was the only one available. If I could have found a hotel at a cheaper cost I would have book it.",5,2024,09,10
221,The best of hospitality and service,"We were booked at the Iveagh Garden Hotel through a tour company. We were so very lucky they chose this location. Every member of the staff we encountered was unfailingly warm and caring.

Every request and/or question we had was handled quickly and kindly. 

The rooms are well done, great showers and the restaurant on site  serves excellent meals - breakfast, lunch and dinner.  The gardens behind the hotel are beautiful and the locatiin put us in walking distance of St.Stephen's Green, Grafton Street shopping, we even  walked to and from Trinity College.

So great rooms, great location and great food but most of all professional, accommodating and super kind staff members! We would return here for sure!",5,2024,09,10
221,The real scoop,Nightclub across the street was loud all night. We prepaid for breakfast for four mornings and hotel would not adjust when we discovered we had to leave the final morning before breakfast was served. ,2,2024,09,07
221,Family Stay in Dublin,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Iveagh Hotel. Great location, terrific staff and the rooms were terrific. If you need air conditioning ask for the 4th floor!",5,2024,09,04
221,Iveagh Garden Hotel,"Clean hotel with friendly, helpful staff and a good location. Restaurant and bar are nice.  Large  attractive lobby. Tram line nearby",5,2024,09,04
221,Cute boutique style hotel.,"Cute and perfectly maintained. A bit pricey though and the room offered on first floor was directly above the garden bar with no AC, thus it made sleep challenging. The window had to be shut to prevent the noise but that made the room a bit stuffy. ",4,2024,09,03
221,"First impressions count and mine says- avoid, avoid, avoid!!","Honestly I don’t know where to start, I have been in this hotel for all on 20 minutes and I can’t believe I’m reading about the same hotel in the other reviews.
Checked in late after a delayed flight, told to go to room p1, get there, card won’t work as it’s not the correct room, I go back to reception and the gentleman tells me no it’s 7, so I go to room P7, open the door and there’s somebody in bed!!
So I go back to the reception by this time feeling pretty annoyed, the man says oh maybe a member of staff is in there?! Anyway, he takes me to P2 and makes sure it’s ok.

Now I know I booked a city pod, I’m more than happy with it being cosy, small, however you want to call it. What I’m not happy with is the fact that there’s no air con, it’s absolutely boiling in here. I can’t use the fan that’s provided as the plug socket doesn’t work next to the bed and the fan will only stay on if I hold the plug in, therefore the window has to be open but it’s extremely noisy! There is a smell from the bathroom like stagnant water, the bed is rock hard and there isn’t 1 clothes hanger to hang up my clothes for my business meeting I have tomorrow morning.

All for the pleased of paying €250!!! It’s absolutely unbelievable. Never, ever again!!",1,2024,09,01
221,Another Great stay,"Second stay at this hotel, Really nice hotel with great staff in a good central location. Stayed in a great room on the fifth floor. No noise, Comfortable bed and a very nice shower. Breakfast was good with plenty of selection and the bar/restaurant is also very good. Reception staff was wonderful for our check in and check out.",5,2024,08,31
221,Subtle elegance…,"Great service…
Our stay was perfect, everyone extremely helpful, Beautiful lobby, location perfect walkable to everything but, quiet. Restaurant and bar area perfect for a relaxing meal.
I will definitely return and recommend!",5,2024,08,31
221,Nice Hotel but Very Noisy Location,"The hotel is in a good location, close to everything. It is very clean, attractive and the room is large and the AC works great. There are restaurants and coffee shops a quick walk to Camden Street - shout out to Rise and Shine Coffee and Pickle Indian Restaurant.
The problem we had was the noise across the street. When I booked I asked twice for a quiet room at the back of the hotel but I had booked a deluxe double room which the management did not inform me until I checked in was facing the street and top of that they gave us a room on the 1st floor. There is a nightclub across the street that stays open until 3:00 AM. The noise was absolutely relentless and then when the nightclub closed there were all the taxis and honking out front. Also the Dean Hotel across the street is noisy as well with a lively rooftop bar.",3,2024,08,30
221,Summer Trip to Dublin!,Stayed for two nights in August 2024. Location is perfect as it is less than five mins walk to Stephens Green. I went with three friends and we had two twin rooms which are clean and spacious although they were a bit hot when we arrived but the temp was sorted out very quickly by staff. The breakfast was delicious and plentiful in a very nice dining room. We also had an evening meal which was very good. Bar area and lobby are open and bright and lovely to sit in. Overall a lovely stay which was good value for money for the time of year.,5,2024,08,29
221,Great Central Dublin Hotel. ," Brilliant location just 5mins from the top of Grafton Street. Rooms are very clean, complimentary water & tea/coffee facilities and a great shower.  Lovely breakfast with loads of choice. The key though is the staff, from very professional yet friendly receptionists to courteous breakfast & cocktail staff. Will definitely return, great Dublin hotel. ",5,2024,08,27
221,Nice hotel in the city center,The location is perfect 50  min by  bus from the airport and you do not need to change anyline. The staff is kind and rooms are confortable. Breakfast is super! A lot of choice,5,2024,08,26
221,Great location and very friendly staff!,"Thoroughly enjoy staying at the Iveagh Garden Hotel in Dublin, the staff are extremely friendly and very keen to help on any occasion. Rooms are nice and clean and provide all amenities needed. Great location, only a 10 or so minute walk into the centre of town! Look forward to our stay next week!",5,2024,08,25
221,Nice place to stay in a  good location,The room we had was very nice and it was located within walking distance of many of Dublin's top attractions. I would definitely stay there again. There was a concert in the park the first night we stayed there which was kind of fun to see all the activity but it also meant the park was closed to visitors. The staff was SUPERB - they even helped return an item I left in the room. They had to go through a lot of trouble to get this item back to me and it shows how much they care about their customers.,5,2024,08,22
221,Highly recommend this charming hotel,"The Iveagh Garden Hotel was exactly what you hope it will be: a warm, restful, comfortable, experience. From the staff to the well appointed, generously sized room, we felt like the hotel took extra steps to provide guests a restful, QUIET (more on that below), pleasant stay. In particular, it was a “big” birthday for me. How they knew, I do not know but there was a very nice birthday card and sweet treat in the room when we arrived.  The front desk staff were pleasant and helpful. Allan, the concierge, and Rob went out of their way to help us get our five bags (long extensive trip) across the street to the car/taxi pick up. (There is a tram that goes by so no cars at the front of the hotel.) When our car service driver called Allan to tell him he would be a few minutes late, Allan came across the street to tell us and also offered to make other arrangements if the car never showed (it did). As to the quiet, read on. The hotel is on a busy street with several night clubs across the street, as well as that tram. It was Saturday night and we had been warned by our uber driver when dropped off that it would be noisy so ask for a room at the back. However, the hotel’s soundproofed windows completely shut out all that sound! Our room faced the street. When we went to bed at 11:30 pm we realized we hadn’t heard anything, thinking no partiers were around. I was stunned when I peeked out the window and saw lines of people and cars up and down the street. We heard nothing! Great hotel.  Highly recommend.",5,2024,08,20
221,Wonderful stay at Iveagh Garden,Beautiful hotel situated in a perfect location in Dublin City centre. Wonderful breakfast with attentive staff and concierge services. Highly recommended. Will stay here again in our future visits. ,5,2024,08,20
221,Lovely!,"If you’re thinking of a hotel in Dublin, try Iveagh Gardens. Our stay was amazing and personally had a wonderful experience. We stayed on the third floor, it was nice and quiet so we could sleep comfortably. Adam at  concierge was kind and helpful with whatever needed. Paul at reception was professional with a smile. Always making sure we were comfortable and had the right accommodations for our family. ",5,2024,08,19

A sunning and classic hotel that hasn’t lost this historic charm.  
From the moment we stepped foot on those steps at the entrance to when we left,we were greeted and treated with warmth.

221,Beautiful location lovely staff.,"Overall a wonder location, normal sized rooms. Wonderful helpful good humourd staff huge shout out the the wonderfull Orla on checkin.

There were minor issues like The toilet flusher in my room was extremely difficult to press and inaccessible for people with disabilities, and the construction outside was quiet loud in the rooms. The restaurant was the only major let down firstly no good vegan options, secondly i ordered Sweet potato chips and they were over salted like White with the salt i could only eat 1/4 of them wiping each chip off individually before consuming.

This wasn't a problem at all but added a historic feel. There was a pedestrian crossing almost outside the hotel. The entrance lobby was spacious. All staff we encountered, especially at Reception and in Elle's Bistro, were very friendly, efficient and helpful. Our room was large and the bed very comfortable. We had requested a walk-in shower and our large bathroom had disabled facilities which I found very helpful.

221,Rest and Rejuvenation.,"The staff at Iveagh Garden Hotel are wonderful.  We arrived jet-lagged from our flight to Ireland from Seattle and they got us into our room (and bed!) so quickly. 

Throughout the remaining five days of our stay, we enjoyed eating there many times.  It is not in downtown Dublin, so tends to be quieter than some other hotels.  A bonus was that our room overlook the Inveigh Gardens themselves.",4,2024,06,30
221,PLEASE READ: There are many better hotels in Dublin.,"I regret to write this review as this was supposed to be a very special stay for my family and wedding party. 

I am very disappointed with multiple aspects of my experience which I will explain. As often as we travel to Dublin, I’m regretful I chose Iveagh Garden for this special occasion.

From the unforeseen charges, to the mediocre ambiance and breakfast I encourage you that there are many better options to stay in Dublin! 

Other guests in my wedding party stayed at the Keavens hotel nearby and absolutely LOVED it. 

After we over-paid for a mediocre buffet breakfast at Iveagh Garden, we visited their hotel and had an incredible Irish breakfast experience for literally a fourth of the cost. 

If you’re looking for a great hotel, I highly recommend the Keavan’s hotel, much better value and overall experience. 

Reasons for my review:

Starting at check in, the curly red-headed staff member (forgive me for not remembering her name) told us our card would not charged until check out. She not only charged the total amount of the stay immediately and later apologized for her mistake but also tried to charge an over €200 cancellation fee of my parents room who were arriving that evening as a  misunderstanding. She again apologized and I understand people make mistakes but as our first impression not followed with any better service it was disappointing to say the least. 

Additionally, were mistakenly charged over €500 as the staff failed to record a reservation modification we made 6 months before the reservation and refused the refund that now we must dispute with our credit card. 

We do travel to Dublin routinely and this trip was actually for my husband and I’s wedding. We brought in nearly €10,000 over night by our party through reservations and dining. 
The €500 that we were wrongfully charged should have been understood as error by the Iveagh Garden staff and refunded. Unfortunately, it resulted in weeks of emails to not receive a refund. 

For the future stays we plan to Dublin, we learned our lesson that Iveagh Garden is not the hotel to stay. I’m regretful of all the wasted time and money on a week that was supposed to be joyous and special. 

With all the great hotel options Dublin has to offer, look elsewhere.",1,2024,06,28

221,"Beautiful Hotel, mediocre amenities with zero follow up from staff.","We were very excited to come stay in Dublin.  While the amenities are gorgeous, the room lacked in this area.  The ability to control the temperature was frustrating and we sweltered through the night.  Upon check out and sharing this information, there was no compensation offered.  Along with this, the hair dryer was broken in our room which isn't a huge deal, but something that caused some switching.  
Over all, this is a beautiful location, but the rooms temperatures were frustrating.   ",4,2024,06,16
221,Really lovely hotel in a great location,"This hotel was recommended to me by a colleague after she stayed there and I'm very happy that I trusted her judgment. The room was lovely, the staff were very friendly and welcoming. The breakfast was quite nice. It's easy to find and convenient to enjoying Dublin city. I would stay here again in the future. ",5,2024,06,14
221,The perfect trip,"Finding this hotel was the cherry on top of the cake!
Family birthday trip to Dublin and they accommodated three adult children in a triple room. Our queen room was stunning!
Location for town was fabulous, 18 minutes walk to Temple.
The hotel bar was cool and classy.
Staff were polite and respectful.
Could not fault anything at all!!
Would definitely recommend. ",5,2024,06,12
221,Home away from home in Dublin,"Wonderful stay with attentive staff in a perfect location. Excellent restaurant with very good selection and service, including the best Irish soda bread of our trip. ",5,2024,06,11
221,Location! Location! Location,"Wonderful hotel.  Full breakfast included with lots of variety.  Staff were always friendly and helpful. The location is very convenient to local transportation, restaurants and shopping.  A lovely park was close by as well.  Thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  ",5,2024,06,10
221,Family Vacation,"Overall, we enjoyed our stay at Iveagh Garden Hotel.  The staff was very helpful and friendly and the location was perfect. The only thing I would change is having a softer more comfortable bed. ",4,2024,06,07
221,Another great stay at the Iveagh Garden Hotel.,"We have come to love staying at the Iveagh on our annual visit back to Ireland. Excellent location, close to shopping, art  galleries, restaurants, tourist  attractions. Very welcoming and friendly. Breakfast is buffet style with a large selection of hot & cold items. Rooms vary in size but are very comfortable & clean and all have tea / coffee ‘station’ in the room. ",5,2024,06,06
221,Iveagh Garden Hotel - great part of Dublin experience,"We had a fantastic room on top floor, very quiet  (had asked when I reserved months ago) with many windows that opened.  Reservations worked with me while I kept rebooking due to sorting out our itinerary.  Room was large, bright and clean, besides quiet.  Alan at Concierge was very helpful, bar staff were fun to talk to and excellent service.  Location was perfect on an old Georgian district street fairly close to everything, especially St. Stephen's Park.",5,2024,06,06
221,Wedding weekend at the Iveagh Garden Hotel,"We had our wedding last weekend at the hotel. We decided on the hotel mainly based on the design and decor in the hotel, the location to the city centre, the design and set up of the function room- it turned out to be the best decision for a much more important reason - the staff and team at the hotel. From start to finish with planning, organising and overall coordination of the wedding the team were fantastic. Nothing was too much trouble for them- all of our guests also commented on the team- amazing sincere customer service standards, pleasant, kind and great fun. The team work so well together and  no matter what we asked for - they delivered impeccably. Can only highly recommend the hotel for a city break, tourists and also for a wedding- it will always be a special place for us. Thank  you all.",5,2024,06,04
221,Wedding Trip,"My wife and I loved this hotel!  Amazing staff, great rooms, great service, great food, and great location!",5,2024,06,03
221,Short but very pleasant stay,"We were greeted warmly by the staff to this charming hotel. We arrived late in the day and felt we were well taken care of. Rooms were clean and comfortable and breakfast was delicious. Our stay, while short, was very pleasant - a nice way to end our Irish adventure.",5,2024,05,30
221,Great Hotel in walking distance to city center.,"Great Hotel with good service and location.
Breakfast is nice with all you need for a good start. Quiet and no traffic noise in our room, on the back near Iveagh Gardens. The hotel is also close to st.stephens Green, we walked through every day to get to city center.",5,2024,05,30
221,Weekend stay,"This hotel is one of the best I have stayed in. It is modern, very clean and in a great location. There is a tram stop a few minutes walk away. It is close to good restaurants and bars. The food in the hotel is of very good quality. The room was cleaned and beds made every day with fresh towels supplied.
The staff were very helpful, informative and friendly.
Prior to booking in, as we arrived early, the receptionist arranged for our luggage to be stored securely so that we could explore the area.There was a safe in our room which was free of charge.
The en suite shower and toilet was exceptionally good.
I will definitely book in to the Iveagh Garden Hotel the next time I visit Dublin.",5,2024,05,29
221,Really enjoyable and great location!,This place in Dublin is a great stopover when visiting. We've stayed in the general area before but found Iveagh to be superior at around the same price. Staff is also wonderful!,4,2024,05,27
221,A bit of a disappointment,"The last hotel on our Best of Ireland tour and we had high hopes but unfortunately it did not meet our expectations.  A disturbed Sunday night when (presumably) the night clubs closed at 3 am.  For an hour we were disturbed by noisy revellers followed by road sweepers clearing up the mess.  Appreciate this is not under the control of the hotel.  I felt they were struggling to cope -  breakfasts were chaotic, bell boy duties very slow etc.  Our bedroom and bathroom looked tired and was in need of a refurbishment.  Walking distance to Temple Bar etc but felt rather ‘out of it’.",3,2024,05,25
221,Nice place in the heart of the city,"All in all a good experience for a four night weekend stay.  Hotel is quite clean, rooms were nice but could get a bit stuffy with little air circulation.  Staff was very helpful and eager to accomodate any requests.  Location is terrfic, lots of activity in the neighborhood on the weekends made for a fun time.  Thank you.",4,2024,05,24
221,Dublin stay,"Great staff, very helpful, really nice room, great location near St Stephens Green, and overall very good stay ! ",5,2024,05,22
221,Great accommodations for Dublin first-timers,"The Iveagh Gardens is a lovely hotel, comfortable room, great location and wonderful restaurant and bar.",5,2024,05,20
221,"Elegant, comfortable and secure",We enjoyed our stay at Iveagh Garden Hotel (pronounced Ivy). Our cab driver told us it was a nice place and he was right. The room was comfortable. We needed to use the fans because of warm weather. (No A/C). We slept well and enjoyed the breakfast buffet both mornings. We walked everywhere and enjoyed coming “home” to the Iveagh to recharge. ,5,2024,05,13
221,Don’t stay here.,"Noisy, smelly and hot! This was a horrible experience. I’m angry that The NY Times recommended it. Shame on them.",2,2024,05,13
221,A comfortable and convenient hotel,"Very near the popular sight-seeing area but still have a very quiet surrounding environment
Very near to the Dublin Express Bus stop and also trams stop
Comfortable and clean room",4,2024,05,11
221,"Nice Hotel, Inconsistent Rooms","This was my second stay at the hotel, and it was fine but I don’t think I’ll be back. The first time I stayed with my wife, we were delighted by the room, especially the size of it. Second time around and we were not so lucky - the room was much smaller and, much more annoyingly, the WiFi reception barely worked in the room. The hotel was clean and delightful otherwise, although be wary that the nearby nightclubs are indeed loud on the weekends if you’re in the wrong room (my wife and I didn’t mind it too much but we’re from NYC), and the restaurant had a nice dinner (breakfast buffet not so much). ",3,2024,05,10
221,Excellent!,"Very beautiful hotel, excellent position, perfectly clean rooms. Next to the homonym lovely garden, very kind staff, high quality breakfast and restaurant.",5,2024,05,08
221,Arrogant management who won’t admit when they are wrong.,"When it transpired our room was opposite a building site, causing huge early morning disturbances, we were assured no repeat performance the next night as the site did not operate on Saturdays. The disinterested Duty Manager was wrong and the next morning we disturbed again. The Hotel refuse to accept they got it wrong and have made no recompense. If that is the attitude of arrogant money grabbing management I am done with the Iveagh Garden Hotel. Sad, as I have stayed three times previously and have been more than satisfied but as the old saying goes ‘you don’t bite off the hand that feeds’",2,2024,05,08
221,Nice spot in the city,"In the heart of Dublin. This hotel is kept clean  and the staff are very friendly and helpful. The rooms are somewhat basic and the  beds are comfortable and have decent pillows in my opinion. The restaurant offers a good selection with warm decor, the space well maintained.",4,2024,05,04
221,Try your best to get a room at the back,"The hotel itself is absolutely beautiful. Very well decorated. Very clean and wonderful staff. We are at the restaurant and it was really tasty and the cocktails were great. Location is Graf within walking distance of Temple Bar, Stephen’s park and Guinness storehouse. 

However. When we first arrived we were given a front facing room and that night we did not sleep. The noise of the music from the clubs opposite, taxis beeping and drunks was absolutely awful. And did not stop until around 4am. The next day we asked to be moved and the hotel obliged. Thank you Paul who was super helpful and really accommodating. We moved to a room at the back of the hotel and it was so much better. Overall a nice experience but sadly the front rooms I think will always be far too loud.",4,2024,05,01
221,Great hotel and fantastic personnel,The hotel is really central and clean. Personnel are extremely supportive. Rooms are specious and silent while the restaurant offers a good selection of food and drinks.,4,2024,04,30
221,"Amazing Time, Amazing Staff","Absolutely lovely stay, the room was lovely, all staff couldn’t do enough but Shakirul is brilliant, upon check in we headed to the bar where shakirul looked after us so well…. We went back up to our room and pondered back down where he made us two lovely brambles ! He’d make sure we liked them and tell us to enjoy ! Top service and would highly look for Shakirul at the bar !",5,2024,04,29
221,"Fantastic time , fantastic staff","Fabulous hotel , fantastic staff . Receptionist was great Ans so helpful , forgot to catch his name but a young man great  people skills . 
The bar was gorgeous Such a vibrant atmosphere , our barman Shakirul gave us fantastic cocktail recommendations and every single one was absolutely fantastic he put so much effort in so very thankful. 
Rooms were fantastic so clean and tidy 
Would recommend to anyone looking to stay in dublin",5,2024,04,29
221,"Perfect location, beautiful hotel, great bar","I had an amazing time staying at the Iveagh Garden Hotel. The location is perfect, far enough away the action that it feels relaxed, but close enough that you can walk to almost anything. The bar/restaurant is fantastic! I visiting multiple times during my visit. The staff was welcoming and offered great suggesting. The service was exceptional and fast. The food and drinks were amazing. The room, though slightly on the smaller side, was perfect for what I needed. Comfortable bed, nice shower. There was some early morning construction next door, but I was up and about before it really bothered me. 10/10 would stay again. Wouldn’t even consider another hotel in Dublin because I loved this one so much. ",5,2024,04,28
221,Another great stay,"This is where we stay when we are in Dublin, friendly staff clean rooms just a great place to stay. The location is perfect for exploring Dublin and this time the weather was good so made it even better.",5,2024,04,28
221,Great base from which to enjoy Dublin's delights,"Happy to recommend the Iveagh Garden hotel.  Convenient, central location.  Helpful staff.  Spotlessly clean.  Great breakfast.  Nice, airy lounge in which to meet pals.  Dublin Express bus to airport stops round the corner.",4,2024,04,27
221,Great hotel and staff,"Amazing little hotel! Great location. Great vibe. Beautiful beer garden. Great staff: Ryan at reception is great, the porters Jimmy and Alan are so helpful, Ian and Hazel at the bar are super efficient and friendly! I am a tour guide and loved staying here with my Italian group",5,2024,04,26
221,Amazing hotel,"We loved this hotel.  The room, the food, the atmosphere in the lobby, bar and restaurant were fabulous but what really stands out are the staff.  Every single person whether they were from housekeeping, wait staff, front desk etc were friendly, helpful and made us feel welcome and taken care of. The hotel is steps away from the Iveagh Gardens which are gorgeous and a few minutes walk to St. Stephen's Green and many tourist attractions as well as restaurants and pubs - try Devitts across the archway on Camden Road.  It's wonderful!",5,2024,04,26
221,Excellent,"Great experience all round,excellent service ,extensive selection for breakfast,punctuality when ordering taxi service",5,2024,04,26
221,Avoid at all cost !,"Stay away from this hotel - they have no concept of service and are everything but business oriented.
I was a loyal customer for several years, but I am done now.
There are much better places to stay in the vicinity.
If you don’t mind wasting your time and money, that’s the place to go !",1,2024,04,25
221,"nicely decorated, comfortable hotel in a nice street of Dublin",We loved our stay in this beautiful and extra comfortable hotel. The rooms are great and the breakfast is excellent. Nice service.We recommend.,5,2024,04,24
221,"Overpriced, noisy and unhelpful staff","Review is specific to “city pod” rooms which are on lower ground floor. Lots of noise from area behind hotel. Impossible to get a decent nights sleep, especially given that the rooms have no Ac therefore it’s unavoidable to have window open!",2,2024,04,21
221,A super stay in the heart of Dublin,"A trip down memory lane (we lived in South Dublin in the mid 80s), our visit was made perfect by this excellent hotel. We couldn't fault it: Location, decor and staff were all top notch.",5,2024,04,20
221,Great location in Dublin,Hotel was well appointed and the location was great near St Stephen’s Green and Grafton St. There was a nightclub across the street that was quite noisy late at night but that wouldn’t deter me from staying here. The beds were uncomfortable - extremely firm. Perhaps a foam topper would help a bit. ,4,2024,04,18
221,Great place to stay,"Definitely a place to be recommended. Great location, lovely room and although there is a nightclub opposite we didn’t hear any noise. I would definitely stay again ",5,2024,04,18
221,Wonderful Stay,"Stayed here last week and could not fault the hotel. The room, Bar, Restaurant and service were all wonderful. I'll be back. Paul at reception made check in seamless, Check out was just as good. Location is great, Close to good bars and restaurants.",5,2024,04,10
221,Fabulous,"Amazing hotel in an ideal location.
Rooms and bathrooms are spotless.
Bedding and accessories top class.
Customer service is second to none and every staff member is friendly and super professional.
Short walk to great restaurants, bars and sights.
Breakfast was one of the best and the restaurant is beautiful.",5,2024,04,02
221,Excellent,"Great spot with great service!! A big shout-out to Chef Fergal and the brassiere front of house team! Food was absolutely superb and cocktails just as good.
Also have to give thanks to Ryan and Neil for organizing the stay for me! Can't wait to return again during the summer!",5,2024,04,01
221,Dublin trip March 2024,Wonderful experience as first time visitors to this hotel and Dublin City . Excellent service and delicious food made for a very enjoyable and unforgettable trip. We would highly recommend staying here as everything is within walking distance a great location . ,5,2024,03,31
221,Dublin overnight,"Friendly prompt service with a smile.
Room was clean and well presented. Everything worked which is sometimes not the case on these city centre hotels. Good location fairly central in Dublin. Finished off with a good breakfast.",5,2024,03,29
221,Bad manners,"The worst service, a person at the reception desk in a very rude manner told me that I couldn't sleep in the lobby. I was with my family and they were looking for a tour to book, so I rested for about 5 minutes when this staff member told me which room I was in, that if I needed keys I could sleep in my bed but that sleeping in the lobby was prohibited. It's not like I had my feet on a couch or was snoring or anything that would ""disturb"" the customers. Their comment was very unnecessary, and when I showed them that I was a guest, they said: sleep in your bed, it's prohibited here",1,2024,03,28
221,"Thoughtful, careful attentiveness","We were spotted by the concierge as we emerged from the taxi at the other side of the street and from that moment felt looked after and assisted. Nothing was too much trouble, particularly for Adam, whose selfless and careful attention was evident throughout our stay and when we found a corporate event in the dining room rather noisy a quieter, more private space was quickly found for us. Breakfast (self service) was excellent with constant resupplying keeping food hot and a huge choice of healthy options. Highly recommended. Colin",5,2024,03,27
221,My number one choice so far,"5x the quality of any other hotel on the same road at a similar price. The deluxe getaway deal was only €20 more expensive than the alternative budget hotels on the same street for our date (Harcourt, Jackson Court etc) and it was SO worth the tiny bit extra as it also included breakfast and a welcome drink. Breakfast was one of the best hotel breakfasts i’ve ever had in Ireland/Uk. 

Unfortunately there is early morning noise which affected our lazy morning snooze but that’s the whole area as there is construction going on but not much that can be done about ",5,2024,03,26
221,Fantastic stay but with one caveat,"This is a wonderfully stylish hotel, well located and has incredibly friendly staff.  Please note that there is no air-conditioning in the rooms and the one i stayed in did not have a window that opened. It made it  difficult to sleep as it got very hot in the room. 
Otherwise if this is not a concern for you, the hotel is great!",3,2024,03,21
221,Well Done!,"Overall this hotel has great taste and resembles a 5 star hotel!  The  staff are accommodating, friendly, and there to provide their guests the best experience. The decor is elegantly modern yet traditional. The bathrooms are well designed to today’s standards with a glass partition for the shower and modern hardware for the faucets and shower.  The location is in walking distance to restaurants, shopping and the park. Would highly recommend!",5,2024,03,21
221,Solo Women Travelers - A Five-Star Stay with Personalized Care,"The Iveagh Garden Hotel really surpassed my expectations in every aspect, it was an ideal choice for myself as a solo woman traveler. The luxurious rooms felt comforting and sophisticated, while the friendly and accommodating staff made communication effortless before and during my stay. Cleanliness was impeccable throughout the hotel, and the complimentary water bottles in the room were a nice touch. During a bout of illness, the front desk staff went above and beyond to assist me, providing food, juice, and extra blankets promptly and compassionately. The area felt very safe, just blocks away from restaurants, coffee shops, St. Stephen's Green, and a short walk from all of Dublin's best travel spots. The hotel is right on the tram line, which made traveling around very easy and convenient. Overall, I am still in awe of the value of the Iveagh Hotel and will remember it fondly from my trip. Highly recommend!",5,2024,03,17
221,handy location in city centre,booked a city pod room on internet. room was small but good standard no complaints it is good value for money and very near to st Stephens green. Too short a stay to comment on any other aspect's of the hotel service,4,2024,03,17
221,Dublin city centre hotel,Good location and very efficient staff but I did not like the room very much and would look elsewhere next time. This is just a personal view as the bed was v comfy and the bathroom was fine with lovely warm water and both a bath and a nice rainwater shower with good power. Robes were thin but serviceable and slippers provided. No mini bar or fridge. Good breakfast and friendly staff. ,4,2024,03,11
221,excellent conditions,"I have really enjoyed my stay; excellent conditions, lovely staff, everything was well organized, the location and the overall conditions were really great; the breakfast was diverse and accommodating all tastes.",5,2024,03,11
221,Perfect stay,"Perfect!
Stayed with a group of girls for a hen and I could not fault this hotel at all. Staff, rooms food, everything was unbelievable.. highly recommend! A huge shout out to Alan at the desk he is a gentleman and fantastic to deal with!. Will definitely be staying again!",5,2024,03,10
221,Style over substance,"Good location on the day, 10 mins walk from town.  Terrible at night 10 metres from nightclub.   Very loud.   Building site close by and constantly sounds like heavy duty maintenance in the hotel.  No chance of a lay in and building work is ongoing.    Still paying a lot of money and not even a free drink offered as a sorry.   Wouldn’t recommend.    ",2,2024,03,06
221,Great place to stay,"This is an excellent hotel, centrally positioned with very friendly and helpful staff. This was our fifth stay this year and the standard of service and accommodation was of high standard. The brasserie is a great place for food when jet lagged or just too tired to stray outdoors but several good bars in easy walking distance. We’ll be back.",5,2024,03,05
221,Great location of relative tranquility,Quiet and comfortable rooms with modernised bathrooms. Nice bar area. Full breakfast but they could have included a cappuccini in it. Would definately go back when next in Dublin for a short break. Thank you!,4,2024,02,27
221,My first choice when visiting Dublin,"After our stay at the Iveagh Garden Hotel, I immediately booked it for an upcoming trip and cancelled the other hotel reservation I had already made. The Iveagh Garden Hotel is both elegant and welcoming. The staff are charming. The restaurant and bar were excellent and our meal especially good. The ambience was perfect. The room was lovely, spacious, comfortable, and immaculate. The Iveagh Garden Hotel will now be my first choice when I visit Dublin.",5,2024,02,27
221,Girlie Getaway Package,"Had a really enjoyable, relaxing stay at this very conveniently located hotel. The decor is fabulous, the staff were very attentive and we got excellent value for our stay.

That is exactly how the pictures are on the website. ",4,2024,02,25
221,Exceptional Hotel,"We recently booked the Iveagh Garden Hotel as our Dublin base at the beginning and end of a tour of Ireland. We could not have chosen better. The central location was perfect, close to all the things we wanted to see, including a lovely garden for a quiet walk after the city bustle. The service was the highest quality with a consistently attentive staff. We will return to the Iveagh Garden any time we are in Ireland (which I hope will be often).",5,2024,02,23
221,Superb in every way,"The Iveagh Garden Hotel just hits all avenues, just superb in every way from the Staff, the food and selection of food for breakfast was fantastic, the location is ideal even though it’s situated just off St Stephens Green the hustle and bustle of a busy city never disrupted our sleep which I have to say the rooms are so comfortable and the cleanliness is second to none ",5,2024,02,22
221,Dublin holiday,Travelled from Australia. This hotel was central to enable easy walking to the major city attractions. Room was comfortable and well appointed. Service was spot on.  Breakfast was excellent and the lobby / lounge was perfect for a drink with friends. ,5,2024,02,21

221,"Disappointed, was looking forward to staying here","I stayed in one of their cheaper rooms, the city pods and found mattress surprisingly uncomfortable. Sort of like a camp mattress and you can feel the metal springs when you’re lying down. There’s a very high pitched buzzing in the basement too so you feel like you have tinnitus!",2,2024,02,19
221,St. Valentines getaway,Lovely hotel and bar with great staff and the hotel 2as very clean and bright. Good value for money considering you're in the City Centre. My only gripe was no parking which could be an issue for some. The hotel offers a small discount for St. Stephens Green centre car park - but even with the discount it was the best part of €30 per night for the car park. ,5,2024,02,19
221,Bad mattress,"The mattress needs to be replaced. The hotel is very pleasant and in an excellent location. The room is a basement pod, which is ok, but doesn't provide enough space to sit down. Very clean. Bar staff very friendly.",2,2024,02,19
221,"Clean, quiet, great service","Great experience. Clean, stylish hotel and rooms. Was so grateful they could accommodate us at 5am when we arrived in Dublin even though our check in wasn’t until 3pm. Also very nice they allowed us to get small breakfast for small price even though we didn’t opt in for the breakfast buffet. ",5,2024,02,18
221,Iveagh Garden Hotel,"Well worth a try. 
In a quiet location but easily walkable into Grafton street. St Stephen’s park close by for a quiet walk or take in the scenery.

A smashing full Irish breakfast included in the room rate. Second time to stay within six months. It has become our go to hotel in Dublin.  ",5,2024,02,07
221,Too warm,"The bedroom was consistently 26 degrees, the ac unit banged and clicked all night. Reception showed no care and told us ‘that’s how the hotel owner prefers it.’ A miserable stay in a beautiful hotel. I’ve contacted the hotel and so far received no response.",1,2024,02,01

221,We Loved This Hotel!,"My sisters and I stayed here 5 nights and had a wonderful time. The staff were very helpful in answering any questions we had about the area and our room was perfect for the 3 of us. A lot of hotel don't have rooms large enough to accomadate more than 2 people, so we were very pleased to only have to pay for one room. We also loved the location - it was very quiet (save for some seagulls in the morning) and it was never more than a 20 minute walk from anything we wanted to do. We will definitly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin! ",5,2024,01,22
221,Beautiful Stay in Dublin,Beautiful hotel - lobby  and suites. Great location.  Front desk staff most inviting and professional.  Would absolutely stay again.

221,Glad we chose this gem in Dublin!,"I stayed here with my sister and friend on a vacation to Dublin. The hotel was within walking distance of many popular Dublin locations, the room was comfortable, and the staff were friendly. We’d considered an AirBnb near the Temple Bar, but after walking around that area we were glad to stay where we were in a more quiet part of town. We chose to have breakfast at the hotel and loved the continental breakfast. It had many high quality items such as honey comb, smoked salmon, and bonne mamon jam, along with all components of a traditional English breakfast and more typical items such as cereal and yogurt. Thank you Iveagh staff for a wonderful stay!",5,2024,01,18
221,"Amazing location, beautiful amenities and friendly staff","If your are looking for a perfectly located accommodation with beautiful and confortable rooms, friendly staff and great service then this is the hotel for you.

221,Superb hotel,"Great rooms, wonderful lobby good location. We upgraded our room so the robes and slippers plus coffee machine were included. Comfortable bed great shower and toiletries. The nightclubs on the road are noisy.",5,2024,01,17
221,Helpful and friendly staff.,Would definitely stay again at Iveagh Garden Hotel. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff. The location was wonderful with regard to sightseeing and shopping. Only drawback was amount of beggars around Stephen's Green area.,5,2024,01,13

We were very happy to have ended up there and will certainly be back.",5,2024,01,09
221,Lovely stay but room very small!,Would highly recommend this hotel for it's location and a lovely atmosphere and very friendly staff who are only delighted to make your stay a pleasant one. The only thing is our room was tiny despite me prompting them at time of booking that it was a special occasion ,4,2024,01,08
221,Hidden Gem On Harcourt Street,"The location is ideal for a short stroll into Grafton Street or into the city centre. The bustling nightlife of Camden Street is a two minute walk with plenty of choice for the local bars and restaurants The Luas (tram) runs directly outside the hotel and the nearest stop is only a brisk minutes walk. On a personal note I do like a fridge or mini bar in my room to keep drinks cold when settled in for the night. Maybe this will be something the hotel will consider in the future, overall a lovely hotel with friendly staff and very comfortable bar and restaurant areas. We will definitely be staying again the next time I am back home in Dublin. ",5,2024,01,08
221,Won't stay anywhere else!,"When we return to Dublin, we know where we'll be staying! I've already recommended it to a few friends planning to travel to Dublin. The room was very clean, and very comfortable. We were always refreshed and ready to tackle our busy itineraries! The location is perfect, it's so close to things that we were able to come back and rest before venturing out to look for pubs with live music, and the hotel staff gave us GREAT recommendations. Everyone who worked there was very kind, and made us feel so welcome. We were sad to leave!",5,2024,01,08
221,Iveagh Garden first class hotel,The Iveagh Garden is a high class hotel in a very good location close to Grafton Street. The staff are very friendly and the service is excellent. The restaurant is very nice and the food is very good. Overall I would recommend this hotel.,5,2024,01,07
221,Great city base,"Great hotel to base yourself in fir a visit to Dublin. Easy walk in to Grafton Street and Luas very close by. Great staff, very friendly and helpful. Lovely food in the restaurant (we had a birthday dinner here for six) and the breakfast really sets you up for the day. ",5,2024,01,07
221,Wedding,"We got married at The Iveagh Garden Hotel in June 2023 after looking high and low for a Dublin wedding to save guests having to travel overnight.

We got married in the nearby Unitarian Church and had a five minute walk to the hotel which was seamless with wedding photography done on the walk up to the hotel and in the nearby Iveagh Gardens.

It was apparent immediately that the staff were absolutely top drawer from management right down to the bar staff.

They were a great laugh too and their attention to detail was flawless, led by a lovely lady called Guita.

We went for the soiree package as we wanted an informal event where guests could let their hair down and this was one of the few hotels in Dublin city centre that could facilitate this type of wedding.

All of our guests were able to mingle openly and weren’t stuck at designated tables. This saved us the politics of having to sit people at certain tables. We got great feedback on this from guests.

Food supper bowls went down a treat and our guests were very complimentary about all aspects of the venue.

We had a late afternoon wedding @4pm and guests had canapes/drinks upon arrival for 2 hours at Ellies Bistro @5pm. We then moved guests downstairs and had usual band and DJ @7pm.

Most importantly for a lot of couples, it didn’t cost us a fortune and guests appreciated that they could go home after the wedding, because this saved them an extra cost too.

For a premium venue we got outstanding value for money. 

I couldn’t recommend The Iveagh Hotel highly enough.

Thanks again,
Barry and Kelli",5,2024,01,06

221,Lovely stay but,"Really nice stay, comfy, clean, friendly staff on arrival, perfect location, but the experience was sadly tarnished by loud drilling from 9am onwards. Couldn’t get the lie in we were hoping for. Very inconsiderate of guests",4,2023,12,21
221,"Lovely hotel, fantastic location","Overall a good experience. Beautiful room, very clean etc....fab breakfast. Only drawback was a lot of hammering or banging sounds of work being carried out beside or very close to our room. Coukd be put off til even 10am would be preferable ",4,2023,12,18

221,Christmas shopping,"Perfect stay! I was originally supposed to stay with my God mother and Mum but both took ill unfortunately. The hotel was extremely accommodating about this and I ended up bringing my husband instead. 

Location was easy to get to from the train station and the hotel looked very festive upon arrival. We checked in early as we wanted to head into town and our room was ready immediately which was great for a Saturday (11am). The room was perfect - lovely and modern. Perhaps only niggle was the sound at night from the bars and it was quite warm. 

Breakfast was excellent - huge array of selection and everything was very fresh. 

Will definitely be back to rearrange the original trip!",5,2023,12,14
221,Great hotel in a convenient location,"We have stayed in so many hotels in Dublin searching for somewhere we'd be happy to come back to and The Iveagh Garden Hotel looks like the one. The location is great with only a short walk to the major shops and bars. The hotel staff were friendly without being overbearing and the hotel bar is a must in the evening with a great buzz about it (unlike most hotel bars). The breakfast was superb with a fantastic array to choose from, including fresh honeycomb which I've never seen before. The only criticisms would be the need for a fridge in the room, either a mini bar or an empty fridge for your own drinks, if there is an option to upgrade in the future I would certainly do so. Whilst I understand the sentiment of being ""green"" these days, the recycled brand of toilet paper needs a rethink! Finally (on a personal note) I would have loved a coffee pod machine in the room but was happy with the selection of tea available. Overall an excellent stay and we'll certainly be back.",5,2023,12,14

The location was perfect and the rooms absolutely gorgeous, with the most comfortable beds/pillows and not a bit of noise was heard for a hotel in such a busy spot. Each and every one of us enjoyed our stay so much, the breakfast was fantastic and the decor is just fabulous, such a relaxed, warm and welcoming setting. Every member of staff we encountered was genuinely friendly, helpful and personable regardless of how busy it was- and as someone who has experience working in hotels, I know what a skill this is and your team have it in spades. Just gutted we couldn't stay longer, can't wait to visit again!",5,2023,11,22

221,Disappointing afternoon tea,"Very disappointing experience at Afternoon tea. Multiple issues regarding miscommunication, staff kept referring to ""the manager"". When a member of the party had to drop out at last minute (life happens) we were informed we would have to pay for their afternoon tea regardless. When I then asked for that afternoon tea portion to be boxed up since we had to pay for it (noting it wasn't served to us) they then said we didn't have to pay. There was also an issue making a substitution of one sandwich by my pregnant friend. Then at another stage they asked did we want to charge bill to room - we weren't residents!  Overall the service was like a circus. 

Tea itself was OK. No milk served and they seemed confused as to why we would ask for it?! Also no clotted cream for Scone which was tiny. 
Overall poor experience and none of the party of five of us plan to return. 
",2,2023,11,19
221,Short Stay,"Ideally located hotel, only a very short walk to Grafton Street.  a little expensive but city centre prices I guess. Lovely large room, ideal for a group of friends staying together for a night our in town. ",5,2023,11,17
221,Great Dublin Getaway,"I have stayed at the Iveagh Garden Hotel twice now and each time I have had a wonderful experience. The rooms are spacious, clean and well designed. The service is outstanding with a very good full breakfast. Having a very nice bar and beautiful lobby added to a comfortable and enjoyable stay. Location is ideal! ",5,2023,11,17
221,Lovely birthday treat,"The location of this hotel is hard to beat and even though it is opposite some busy nightclubs, didn't feel too busy and there was minimal noise (I'd suggest requesting a room at the back of the hotel - it's great). At under €300 a night (incl. breakfast) it's great value for Dublin city centre. When I told staff it was my birthday they left me me some thoughtful chocolates and a card. The room was large and clean with a lovely, calming shower. The only improvement I'd suggest is in-room breakfast service. There should be a more discreet way for staff to leave trays inside the door as opposed to coming all the way in. The breakfast itself could do with some improvements such as a proper coffee service (china cups, jug of coffee as opposed to takeaway paper cups), proper toast (not warm bread) and ketchup wasn't included. We were woken early by screaming seagulls but then there is not much the hotel can do about that!",4,2023,11,15
221,Matt and Pam Casey,"Staying at the Inveigh Gardens was a marvellous experience and a great way to conclude our visit to Ireland.

221,Excellent,It's clean hotel with very friendly and helpful staff. The power outlets in my booked room did not work and I was then booked to a different room. Problem solved within 20 minutes. - The hotel is easy to reach via tram (5 minute walk from the nearest station). It's quiet and comfortable. Highly recommended.,5,2023,11,13
221,"Wonderful, affordable, comfortable - highly recommended.","The Iveagh Garden Hotel is a beautiful boutique hotel in the centre of Dublin, with welcoming staff, great facilities, and a wonderful bar and restaurant.

221,Would highly recommend!,"Would highly recommend here. We had a bit of an issue getting into our room late but they apologized and rectified the situation quickly.
The breakfast was a great selection and was never waiting for food to be replenished. Very friendly staff and knowledgeable of the area. Organized taxi's for us and gave us advice.

Room was very spacious, we were lucky to get a room with a balcony and see part of the gardens. It was very clean with everything you could need. Far enough away from the center to get away from the noise but close enough that we would walk there every night to experience Dublin nightlife! There is a night club and building works going on outside the hotel but it didn't bother us and couldn't hear a thing -  we may have just got lucky with where our room was.

Dublin is an expensive city so thought prices for everything in the hotel was very reasonable too compared to the center. You need to try the cocktails!",5,2023,11,06
221,Couple one night stay,Great location - rooms fresh and clean - breakfast good - friendly staff - parking a bit away from hotel but good rate (taxi only 8e up to hotel). In fairness good value for money as location really central. ,4,2023,11,06
221,Poor disabled access,We were hoping for an enjoyable stay but wheelchair access was most challenging and noisy construction works were upsetting   during the daytime. I couldn’t consider a return visit due to these factors. Not good value for money,2,2023,11,06

Staff were very helpful with restaurant suggestions, and arranging extra bottled water in the rooms when we ran out. The hotel lobby lounge was perfect for gathering and having a bite and a drink in between outings. The location is ideal as a launching point for anything you'd want to do in Dublin. We highly recommend the Iveagh, and don't miss wandering the Iveagh Garden itself which is just behind the hotel.",5,2023,11,04
221,Dublin treat ,Smart hotel in a good position for easy access to City Centre attractions (Grafton st. and Temple Bar).Good food reasonably priced and excellent breakfast.Down side of our visit was that our room was at the back of the hotel facing a noisy night club(the hotel advised they were addressing this issue) and had we asked they would have changed our room for us.Highly recommend!,5,2023,10,30
221,Lovely local hotel walking distance to St Stephen’s Green and Trinity.,"We had a lovely stay at Iveagh Garden Hotel. The lobby and lounge are stylish, beautiful and comfortable and our stay came with a delicious breakfast. The beds were very comfortable and the bathrooms modern. I was looking to stay someplace that didn’t feel like I could be back in the US while also being comfortable and having breakfast included. This fit the bill. And the staff were top notch helpful the whole time, especially the front desk and doormen.",5,2023,10,29

The food was also excellent. ",5,2023,10,28
221,Fantastic  stay !!!,"We knew it would be special when we were greeted by genuine  smiling faces  at reception 😀.  We booked one of the handicap  rooms . It is near the lift  and we'll equipped  for a person with disabilities,  lower sink,great shower and space. Mattress is also lower for easy access. For one person its super. For two, it's a bit tight with a double bed!!! 😳  next time we will book a room with either 2 beds or a queen size bed.  However. Pillows, mattress are comfortable, lots of complimentary bottled  water, and tea/coffee facilities.  

We also enjoyed  an afternoon tea with lots of goodies and perfect service with pretty dishes and 🫖. 

Housekeeping was exemplary  and very kind if you needed anything.   The Iveagh  staff from reception  to dear Alan at concierge,  the wonderful  restaurant  staff, everyone  made us feel very welcome and comfortable.  The breakfast  was yummy with loads of choices . We also managed to squeeze  in 2 lunches and the homemade soups are delicious  and the curry ... I need the recipe.  
We used the lift outside  which was never too much trouble  for anyone  so thank you for making our stay so  nice and  memorable.  Location is Aldo very convenient  to Luas which we used to get about.  

Looking forward  to our return visit and will look no further  than the Iveagh  our new address away  from home in Dublin.   Big thanks to all.",5,2023,10,27
221,Amazing Hotel in Dublin,"Wow what can I say , I have stayed in many hotels but this hotel is exceptional, myself and my daughter decided to treat ourselves to an overnight stay in Dublin as we were attending a concert in the national concert hall and am I glad I chose the Iveagh Garden Hotel. We had a very enjoyable stay from the moment we walked through the doors . The reception area and bar are beautiful. Alan the concierge is a huge asset to the hotel. A big thank you for the beautiful cocktail. We had a great nights sleep and breakfast next morning had a wide range to choose from and was hot which is hard to find with a buffet breakfast. I will definitely be back even if it is just for a drink or a meal.
Highly recommend",5,2023,10,27
221,Birthday celebration ,"Everything about the IGH was excellent. The pre-trip service from reservations, the location and guest relations,  the space, the bar and restaurant staff - friendly and accommodating and the prosecco! The bar food was very good and there was a vast choice of quality food at breakfast . No noise in the rooms despite the hotel being full and weddings taking place. Everyone of my group of 12 would go back in a heartbeat 👌",5,2023,10,25
221,Nice place,"This is a great hotel.  The staff here are amazing, and the food excellent. 
It is also in a great location.  The only issues I had here was the poor wifi signal inside a room that was at the end of the hallway, and some loud music coming from across the alley on Saturday night.  The music stopped at 130am, but this is obviously something that is not in the hotel’s control.  Overall at great hotel!",5,2023,10,25
221,Good and bad,"The room was nice, the staff professional and the location great. However, there was a party on in the bar in the basement with music playing at night club levels until after 1am, which meant we got very little sleep. We weren’t warned about this. V disappointing for a 4 star hotel.",3,2023,10,22
221,First time on Dublin,"Hotel with good location, shops and restaurants nearby.  Good size room, comfortable beds and walk-in shower.  Great breakfast, impeccable service.  Soundproofed room.  Everything ok. We will definitely be back.",5,2023,10,21
221,Highly Recommend!!!!,"Great location with friendly, helpful staff. James is by the door to help with whatever is needed. 
Breakfast is delicious!!!!!!!! Restaurant is amazing, as are the drinks. Beds and pillows comfy.
Quiet stay. Highly, highly recommend!!!!!",5,2023,10,19
221,Overpriced and underwhelming,The location of the hotel and reception area were great but the city pod rooms are tiny and dark. Their was a very small window and bathroom only separated by pain of glass. It was hugely overpriced and I felt I was ripped off.,2,2023,10,17
221,My stay,I’ve already mentioned about the breakfast. I was absolutely taken back by having to pay for it. I won’t be looking to stay at your hotel for my next trip to Dublin. I don’t know what else I have to write,2,2023,10,17
221,Thank you to Dafydd Rhys Jones and his staff for a great experience.,"We wish to extend a sincere thank you to Dafydd Rhys Jones, the Front Office Manager. We arrived in Dublin, booked in to a sister hotel to the Iveagh, but unfortunately those rooms and that hotel in general were not at all what we had been led to expect. We made our way to the Iveagh Garden hotel and had the good fortune to meet Mr. Jones. We asked if he could arrange a transfer of our credit from the sister hotel and he worked diligently on our behalf to make that happen. We couldn't have been more pleased; we feel he rescued us!

Our rooms were spacious, clean, and bright. The furnishings and bedding were of good quality. We don't usually eat in the hotel restaurant, but are glad we did in this case.

In addition to Mr. Jones, the other desk staff were helpful and professional.

The hotel is in a great location for walking to the sights we wanted to see. 

We would return and would recommend it to our friends.
",5,2023,10,13
221,Perfect Stay in Dublin,"Stayed for 3 nights (mom/daughter traveling). This hotel is just a short walk to most of the major attractions of Dublin. The breakfast is one of the best I've had at a hotel; plenty of options and all food was fresh. The outside entrance, bar, lobby, etc. are all very picturesque. The hotel room was large and very clean. And, the staff was incredibly welcoming and helpful. I'd definitely book here again when visiting Dublin.",5,2023,10,13
221,Excellent hotel and concierge,"We stayed her for a day upon our arrival in Ireland for vacation.  This hotel is an excellent choice while you’re in Dublin. The concierge was exceptional.  The room was luxurious.  The breakfast was delicious. We did read in the room information booklet that the water in the rooms is not potable, which was surprising.  I wish they had been made that more obvious for safety since we were traveling with an infant.  Regardless I would recommend this hotel highly with that one caveat. ",5,2023,10,12
221,Dublin Treasure,Loved this location and the staff was very helpful and friendly.  Our room was comfortable and clean.  The restaurant is lovely and the food was delicious.  I would recommend this place for anyone exploring Dublin!,5,2023,10,11
221,Dreamy Hotel with Excellent Service,"Next time you're in Dublin, be sure to book the Iveagh Garden Hotel. The location is ideal (steps from St Stephen's Green) and a couple mins walk to shopping, restaurants and nightlife. The lobby, guest rooms and restaurant are beautiful. The staff are both friendly and knowledgable. ",5,2023,10,10
221,Fabulous place to stay in Dublin!!!,"The rooms are gorgeous and spacious! The pillows and bedding wonderfully comfortable. We had three adults in a room and there was plenty of space! The place is immaculately clean. The staff courteous, helpful and knowledgeable. Breakfast was very, very good. The location ideal, walking distance to all the sites, e.g., St. Stephen’s Green, Trinity College, Temple bar, Grafton Street!",5,2023,10,10
221,Good stay near St. Stephen's Green,"We had a good stay at Iveagh.  It is close to St. Stephen's Green and most attractions in Dublin are a short walk.  Large, comfortable room.  Great breakfast buffet in mornings.  Decent bar in the evening but music is a bit loud.",5,2023,10,09
221,Great hotel in perfect location,"Friendly and efficient welcome and check-in. Room was great and bed was comfortable. We could sometimes hear music from the restaurant/bar but this was not a major concern. Location is ideal for first time visitors to Dublin - we were able to walk to all the major attractions. Service in the bar and restaurant was good and the concierge was extra helpful arranging a taxi to the airport on the day of our departure. Overall, we would highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2023,10,07
221,Last two days in Dublin,"Really like this hotel.  It's location is great, very proximate to Grafton Street.  the room was very nice as was the rest of the hotel.   It has a very nice restaurant and bar and the breakfast was amazing.  ",5,2023,10,07
221,Outstanding hotel,"I loved everything about this place! The staff was wonderful, the price was reasonable, the location was great, and the room was (surprisingly) spacious and clean. Lots of coffee shops nearby, and numerous restaurants in walking distance. We walked to all the major tourist attractions without a problem. We didn’t get the breakfast, so I can’t comment on that part of it. I would definitely stay here again if I ever find myself back in Dublin.",5,2023,10,06
221,Do not stay here if you want to sleep,"My mother and I are currently staying here. Thankfully only one more night before we move to another hotel!! It’s 15 degrees outside and yet its 30 in the room, it’s way too hot to sleep, we have to have all the windows open and a fan on and it’s still way to hot. 
Reception staff can’t help they just blame it on no air conditioning and yet a year ago people were complaining about this and the hotels response was that it was being implemented, it very much has not. They must have the heating whacked all the way up, it’s off in our room but it’s genuinely nearing 30 degrees in here.

 We specifically requested a quiet room due to my autism and yet there are building works right outside our room going on from 8am or earlier which means we can’t sleep until 3 or 4am due to the heat and get woken first thing by the immense noise because we have to open the windows otherwise we’ll suffocate from the heat! I have chronic fatigue meaning if I don’t sleep I get very very unwell. It’s a beautiful building and an amazing location but the point of a hotel is somewhere to sleep and sadly this hotel isn’t able to provide this. ",1,2023,10,04
221,Lovely hotel in great loscation,Very nice staff and perfect location. The concierge Allen was always available for help and the room was very well appointed.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone planning a trip to Dublin.  Lovely little boutique hotel.  ,5,2023,10,04
221,Double Room Review,"The hotel was overall a great place to stay. The breakfast was exceptional and the service we received from the staff was most accommodating.

However, the facilities need to be improved for such a high price bracket:
• Lift at the front entrance is not operational at time of writing. That means if you are someone who requires a wheelchair or cane, you will find it most difficult to get in and out of the hotel.
• The rooms are very hot, even with the AC on the lowest setting and on chill mode, expect to wake up in a swear
• Each floor directly outside the main elevator has a stairs going down on the left so, once again, accessibility would be an issue for those with prams or with mobility issues.",4,2023,10,03
221,Comfortable Value in Dublin,The hotel location was ideal for us. The room was comfortable. Although the breakfast buffet was included in our deal we would have preferred breakfast service rather than the buffet which was akin to a cafeteria experience.  The food was plentiful and quality was okay ,5,2023,10,01
221,Disappointing,"This hotel lacked charm and service - tired and dirty carpets, soft beds and very expensive - not as advertised. Even asking for a quiet room did not work and when I asked to move reception offered ear plugs ",3,2023,09,30
221,Great little city break hotel,"Beautiful 3 day stay here this week. Beautiful room with balcony, lovely hotel, clean smelt amazing. Paul the guy in reception was lovely and charming and the bar staff were more then friendly and very nice people. Will defo recommend and defo stay here again.",5,2023,09,29
221,Comfortable with attention to detail,"Highly recommend this hotel.  Comfortable bed, spotless, and the staff were simply the best.  Friendly, funny and helpful.  Location was perfect for us.  I ran in a half marathon up in Phoenix park and the Luas stop was a very short walk.  The tram took me most of the way to the start of the race.  It was lovely to come back to the hotel and relax at the end of each day.  Would certainly stay again",5,2023,09,26
221,A Really Good Choice for Your Stay in Dublin,"On our second visit to Dublin, this hotel lived up to its reputation as a high-quality, comfortable place to stay. We liked that it was next to the Iveagh Garden Park. Also, it was just outside of one of the busiest tourist areas, giving us a little respite from the throngs crowding the sidewalks. The hotel offered a typical breakfast buffet, but our reservation did not include the choice of ordering breakfast off the menu. Camden Street, with lots of restaurants and shops, is only a block away. On this visit, we toured the EPIC Museum and the Jeannie Johnston ship. Both were extremely interesting and well worth the visit. Otherwise, we did a lot of walking around to enjoy the Dublin atmosphere. We ate dinner at the Wilde Restaurant and were impressed with the top-notch service and exceptional food. ",5,2023,09,24
221,Wonderful stay,"Large rooms with free bottled water, large shower area. Comfortable and quiet. Wifi worked well. The breakfast is an amazing feast. All the staff were friendly and helpful, and didn't get flustered with all my questions.",5,2023,09,23
221,4 night stay,"Great location, and terrific front desk, bar and restaurant staff. Only drawback was our rooms. If staying June-September request a room with A/C.  Breakfast great, and we also had afternoon tea for the first time. ",4,2023,09,18
221,Delightful stay in Dublin!,"Excellent hotel in the heart of the city, within walking distance to many sites, close to restaurants serving delicious food, drink and music. Sumptuous decor. Comfortable bed in quiet room. Would highly recommend!",4,2023,09,18
221,Great location in the heart of Dublin,"On the upside: Beautiful hotel in great location in the city centre. Beautiful garden terrace for breakfast and drinks at night. 
On the downside, our room was very hot (to be fair: during an exceptional heatwave). ",5,2023,09,14
221,Central location but disappointing beyond that,"Basic hotel centrally located. Rooms were clean but very noisy and too hot, and lacking in basics like sheets. Breakfast included but at the price, remarkable that an espresso costs extra. Key card failed to open room door on no less than three occasions during a two night stay ",2,2023,09,13
221,Not a great experience.,We checked out a day early because we couldn’t sleep there another night. Rooms don’t have any air conditioning or fans and the windows barely open up at all. It was like a sauna in our room and we couldn’t sleep at all. My wife had trouble breathing at night so she stepped out in the hallway for some air. The hallway smelled horrible. Smelled damp and gross so that didn’t help her. We had to leave immediately. ,1,2023,09,12
221,Iveagh Garden Hotel not the best option in Dublin,"Unlike the previous reviewer, when we arrived at our cramped, oppressively hot room, we were not provided other accomodations. Our ""deluxe"" room was small, hot, and had a double bed (not a queen, a true standard double bed). My husband and I have not slept in a double bed in over 30 years. In a stifling hot room with no AC, we had very little sleep the two nights we were there. We were able to open a window (overlooking an alley) to allow some air movement. The bathroom was clearly for a handicapped guest. The sink was ridiculously low in so much that we had to sit on the shower stool to use it. Paper products were definitely not upscale. You aren't saving the earth by making people use twice as much. Morning buffet was average at best. We had scrambled eggs and fruit. Everything else was not at all appealing.
The only reason I gave this location a 2 rating rather than 1 is it's location. You can walk to just about anything you want to experience in the St Stephen's Green area of Dublin.",2,2023,09,11
221,Disappointing,We arrived ti a small hot room with no air circulation.  There was a fan which helped.  We were there for three nights.  I spoke with the lovely receptionist and we were moved to a bigger cooler room.  All in all a nice hotel but if we hadn’t been moved we would have been miserable.,4,2023,09,08
221,Perfect location and stylish hotel,Stylish hotel close to St Stephen’s Green and walking distance to many of Dublin key sights. Comfortable rooms including a fabulous spacious family room with double and 2 singles (great for our teenage kids). Lovely reception and bar area also. Would definitely stay again.,5,2023,09,07
221,"Understated Luxury, centrally Located","A first-class hotel for amenities, comfort, and understated luxury. Centrally located on the Luas, it was easy to get about Dublin. The staff were friendly and extremely helpful. The hidden asset was the secret garden behind the hotel, namely Iveagh Gardens. A stroll through the gardens to the courtyard cafe behind MOLI, or Newman House to older UCD Graduates, is a delight, As Maeve Binchy wrote ""It was peaceful there and unfamiliar. Not like every other square of Dublin"".",5,2023,09,06
221,4/5,"Overall 4/5 as dont feel the rooms live up to the rest of hotel decor - sorry 
They’re nice, comfortable but basic I feel compared to the rest of the building and other hotels - really really disliked the recycled toilet paper & tissues
Breakfast - very good choice and buffet layout - coffee not very nice though
Staff friendly enough - breakfast staff bit standoffish
In a handy location for city centre - just be sure to ask for a quiet room if you want a good sleep as bars & nightclubs opposite",4,2023,09,06
221,A fantastic stay,"A fantastic stay. It is a pleasure to find a hotel that will book a room for one night over a weekend. We were welcomed warmly, the room was perfect, well appointed, in excellent condition and all staff we encountered were pleasant, friendly and efficient. Its location is perfect for the city and we will definitely stay there again when back in Dublin. Very highly recommended.",5,2023,09,06
221,"A very pleasant, convenient stay","My wife, daughter, and I had a very pleasant stay at the Iveagh Garden. The hotel is attractive, well appointed, and well located, and our interactions with the staff were pleasant and professional. I would definitely recommend the hotel to friends and hope to stay here again on a future trip to Dublin.",4,2023,09,05
221,Upscale Hotel in a Convenient Location,"We had a very nice stay at the Iveigh Garden Hotel.  Great breakfast, included with our stay.  Hotel is upscale and service is friendly and professional.  It’s in a great location, close to downtown, but far enough away to enjoy some peace and quiet.",5,2023,09,05
221,Historic charm & modern comfort,"I never leave reviews but this was such a lovely, unique hotel I just had to take the time. We couldn't believe the amount of thought and planning that clearly went into every detail of the room - beyond just the usual. A high quality hair dryer instead of the cheap type that burns your hair, a powerful fan that kept us cool at night, and a surprise balcony overlooking the gardens. We usually don't get breakfast included since we like to find a local spot to try, but I'm so glad we added it—well done all around. We will recommend this place to anyone we hear is heading to Dublin.",5,2023,09,05
221,A beautiful hidden Gem,"Staff were helpful and friendly. Hotel is beautiful and just 5 minutes walk to NCH, to National Gallery to Grafton Street...a gem in the city.  I would hightly recommend staying here.  The food is also great.",5,2023,09,05
221,"Fantastic location, and a good hotel","Stayed for two nights - the location is a great combination of close to everything in Dublin and out of the hustle and bustle. We easily walked everywhere we wanted to be. The hotel itself is nice and modern - great bar on the ground floor and a good sized room for the price. Only downside was that the room did get a little stuffy - hard to get airflow in the interior facing location looking across at offices across the way. 

But all in all, a great location and a great experience.",5,2023,09,04
221,Lovely hotel,"Lovely hotel, full of character. Great service. Close to St Stephen’s Green, Grafton St and other key Dublin sights. We had 2 rooms a double and a triple. The triple was great for our teenage kids - very spacious room with a double bed and 2 singles.",5,2023,09,04
221,Great hotel in Dublin,"Amazing team, great service. 
Will recommend to everyone traveling to Dublin. 
We were met by a great team at reception who arranged anything that we needed: from taxi to the airport, to recommendations and mint tea for our room. Nothing was too much!  ",5,2023,09,03
221,Nice hotel in good location,we have been located on 5th floor. good room service everything very clean. not that loud as claimed from others. good located and quite near to city at least for our purpose we have been to dublin for a citytrip. would book it again. ,5,2023,09,01
221,Loud Music kept me awake most of the night. No AirCon. Small Rooms.,"Nice lobby. Nice restaraunt/bar. Great location. Decent service.  There is a bar next door that plays booming club music from 5pm until late late into the night. You will not be able to sleep if your room is on the same side as the bar next door.  Also, there is no air con, just a $10 desk fan, so you will need the window open, which only makes the noise worse. Rooms are unusually small. Bathroom & shower is nice.  ",2,2023,08,31
221,Wonderful stay!,My husband and I stayed 3 nights at the Iveagh Garden Hotel and enjoyed it immensely!  We had been on the road for a week and it was very refreshing to arrive at the Iveagh Garden Hotel in the absolute best location for our needs.  The room was very comfortable and had everything we needed.  It was especially nice to have a restaurant on site (and a bar)!  I would 100% stay here again and recommend to other travelers.,5,2023,08,30
221,Definitely stay here again,"The hotel is located on a beautiful street. Inside, the decor is exquisite. The staff are incredibly helpful and go out of their way to assist you. Their breakfast, which was included in our booking, was fantastic. Such a wide selection to help ourselves to. We had dinner in the restaurant one night too and food was brilliant. The rooms were clean, large and we loved the shower",4,2023,08,30
221,I will be back,"Great central location in Dublin, a short walk to tourist attractions, tram in front of the building - very nice building, modern interior, very friendly staff. Unfortunately we do not have enough time to use the bar or breakfast.
What you need to know - it's a classic city hotel with just that charm.
I will definitely book the Iveagh again on my next trip to Dublin.",5,2023,08,30
221,No Air Conditioning. Noisy & Uncomfortable,No air conditioning so very hot even with the windows open. Our room on the 3rd Floor looked out onto back yards. From 3pm to 10:15pm there was very loud “Bollywood” type music emanating from a leisure hall opposite the back yards. The hotel said they could not change our room which we requested several times. Don’t risk staying at this hotel !,1,2023,08,29
221,disappointed,"would not stay here again.  the staff were great but the room was not what I reserved and my Coach bag chain was broken while I wasn't in the room.  I spoke with front desk twice, but no follow up from them to date. Food, service and concierge were wonderful. ",3,2023,08,28
221,A bit of Heaven on earth,"This is the place to stay in Dublin.  Central to all the things you want to see, the staff provides all the helpful information you need to see all that"" Dublin has to offer.  A delightful theater with great shows, like ""RiverDance--the 25th th Anniversary"", is within walking distance. 
It's a place where memories are made.  You surely want to return.

 Riverdance..the 25th Anniversary",5,2023,08,26
221,Fab Stay,"Fab Stay, Really nice Hotel we had a ball, fab food fab atmosphere, service excellent and so friendly from the Front Desk to the Bar Staff to the restaurant staff.  Would definitely return again for a girlie weekend.",5,2023,08,24
221,Satisfied in Dublin,"Wonderfully situated hotel, fantastic staff in every way - go out of their way to help, restaurant with good menu, very clean/modern/comfortable rooms, sustainability policy, always easy to access assistance",5,2023,08,24
221,Will be back,Beautiful hotel with excellent staff service and friendliness.  Expensive but worth it. Rooms are comfortable and clean.  Breakfast was lovely with a great selection to choose from.  Would definitely come back again. ,5,2023,08,24
221,Highly Recommend,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Iveach Garden Hotel. It's in a central, quiet location close to two lovely parks but not in the center of the tourist area. The rooms are a nice size (comfortable and roomy for two people) and well-appointed. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They bar and restaurant is stunning and has great food and drinks.",5,2023,08,23
221,"Comfortable and well decorated, but a bit noisy at night","The hotel is well decorated, and our room was spacious and clean. It did get a bit hot at night, and since there are nightclubs in the area, there is audible music with the windows open - pack earplugs. The breakfast buffet was great!",4,2023,08,23
221,A very nice and refined urban  hotel.,"The hotel is well situated in a calm area near St Stephen’s Green.  It has nicely appointed, large rooms with comfy beds.  The breakfast is quite fine.  All this makes the hotel a good value and great option. There needs to be some more attention to basics:  toilets were an issue as was the room temperature.  The staff was often helpful but uneven in their competence. All in all, based on gge value I would stay there again.  ",4,2023,08,22
221,Georgian Dublin,"We enjoyed every single minute in this lovely hotel in the heart  of Georgian Dublin.  A block or two from St Stephen's green & Grafton Street, Trinity college, Temple Bar.  We had no agenda & it was nice to stroll and observe this lively City.",5,2023,08,22
221,Excellent location - room temperature issues though,"The hotel is well located, good access to the centre of town  - but not in a tourist hotspot. Our room was on the smallish size, but fine in terms of features - beds were comfortable.

Main issue for us and others in our group was the temperature in the rooms. We were ""lucky"" as we had a portable Aircon in our room - very loud but did the job; others were offered just a fan (ineffective) or got themselves moved. 

Breakfast was fine, standard hotel buffet style. Staff were friendly and helpful.",4,2023,08,22
221,Short city break,"This is a nice comfortable Hotel, it is about 5 mins walk from Grafton Street and less to the Luas rail stop. The breakfast and bar food are excellent, and the staff are friendly staff . Overall Its good value and I  would highly  recommend it.",5,2023,08,21
221,Great location for a city stay!,"I’ve stayed here many times in the past 6 months, the service has been consistently good and the rooms have been impeccable. 

The team there never fail to help of needed and make themselves available for anything you need. 

Highly recommended for a stay in the city, with most attractions walkable and easy to get back to after a night out, but even the on-site restaurant and bar are decent enough for a stay in if you need a break. ",5,2023,08,20
221,Wonderful hotel.,We had a lovely 2 night stay in this beautiful hotel. The location was ideal to walk into the main part of the city. The rooms were comfortable and the staff polite and helpful. We would definitely stay again when we return to Dublin. ,5,2023,08,19
221,Wonderful Hotel!,"Wonderful, clean hotel, enjoyable lush lounge, lush bedroom bedding & great look of it, very clean, delicious breakfast buffet with everything, great staff, excellent location to the Iveagh Gardens, Stephen's Green & Grafton Street.",5,2023,08,16
221,One night stay - poor room,"Do not accept room 1111 if you are allocated it in this hotel.  Windows completely frosted open, zero view, windows only opened a very small amount and the room was unbearably hot at night and it was not that hot outside. No air con or cooling fan.",3,2023,08,15
221,Great Place to Stay," We had a great stay at the Iveagh Gardens Hotel.  The staff, the food, the bar and the service were all great.  Location was perfect to central Dublin and taxi’s are right outside your door should you need one.  We will definitely stay there again.",5,2023,08,14
221,A week in Dublin at the charming Iveagh Garden Hotel,"I found the Iveagh Garden Hotel in a guide book of Ireland. It sounded charming and it lived up to my hopes for a boutique hotel in Dublin. It is just off St Stephen park, a great location. The staff were friendly and attentive. The room was large and comfortable with a terrific shower and large vanity in the bath. The on site restaurant provided a buffet breakfast each morning and we also had dinner there several nights. Overall, a delight and would stay there again ",5,2023,08,13
221,It's all about the location,Very comfortable hotel where it is all about the location.  Close to the action but a little outside of the tourist onslaught.  Rooms are nicely designed and comfortable.  TYou can either walk or tram to most places and if the weather is nice enjoy the gardens ,4,2023,08,12
221,Great location and great bed!,Lovely hotel. GREAT bed. Nice room. Coffee could be better. Great breakfast too. Conveniently located and not in touristy Temple Bar area. Staff was friendly. Wish they had honored their towel service promise to not wash towels when not needed but glad they offered it. There was a wedding and since we were on first floor we could hear it so I would ask for 2nd floor if there is a party in basement (underground floor.) but we slept just fine. Glad to have expresso in room.,5,2023,08,12
221,"Wow! Amazing hospitality, beautiful space & excellent breakfast!","The hospitality of the staff was second to none, the breakfast was great with lots of fresh, local ingredients, the rooms are beautifully decorated, great shower, comfy bed, and stellar location. Don't change a thing! I highly recommend the Iveigh Garden Hotel and I'll definitely stay there again!",5,2023,08,10
221,Great boutique hotel with a great location,Can’t go wrong with this one. Rather new hotel with a great location with walking distance to pretty much everything relevant. Good service and quiet as well as spacious rooms. Decent breakfast buffet with an outdoor garden which is nice when the weather allows for it.,5,2023,08,10
221,Gorgeous Hotel,"We had a wonderful stay. The room was really spacious, spotless, and beautifully decorated. The hotel is just gorgeous, I with we had a chance to visit the beautiful bar and restaurant. The location was perfect, within very short walking distance of fun restaurants and pubs.",5,2023,08,08
221,"Great location and service, beautiful hotel",We booked 7 rooms for the family for the night of our wedding. The rooms were lovely. We had a drinks reception with friends and some finger food and charcuterie. Everything was great and they looked after our kids really well. Breakfast next morning had everything you could think off. Not to mention the whole hotel looks lovely too.,5,2023,08,07
221,We loved coming home to this hotel!,"This hotel is delightful, quietly luxurious and very quiet hotel is very accessible to Public transportation and two beautiful parks. The amenities and hotel restaurant were excellent.We found the staff very helpful!",5,2023,08,06
221,Excellent hotel except the breakfast,"Iveagh garden hotel has an excellent location in Dublin, close to all commodities. The rooms are beautiful and clean.
My only suggestion is to improve the breakfast which was the same as in february (5 months before) and not enough international",4,2023,08,06
221,Enjoyed Our Stay,The Iveagh Garden is a really nice hotel. We visited on a Monday so it was quiet. The staff were very accommodating and the room was spotless. The only downside to our visit was the dinner we had at the Elles bistro. ,4,2023,08,04
221,Piss poor customer service,"Hotel was similar compared to others in the area. overall customer service from management was horrible. We had several meals and cocktails in their bar/restaurant. One of those meals we were double charged. I emailed the hotel after we checked out and never heard back..AT ALL. On our way back through Dublin before we flew back home, we decided to stop back in and speak with the manager. We talked with Kunal and provided him all the documentation about the $81 double charge. He said they would research and know by the next morning and to call him. I asked that he email me instead so I don't have to incur international calling charges. He said no he couldn't do that and I needed to call him, horrible service issue #1. 

Needless to say I called from the airport before our flight the next morning and spoke with him again. He stated they did find the double charge but needed to do additional research but couldn't tell me what or why, horrible service issue #2. He assured me that I would see the refund on my credit card in 3-5 days  and to call him back if I had additional issues, again I said I don't want to keep paying international call charges,horrible issue #3. 

It's been over a week and still no credit. I have to dispute the charges now with my credit card. When on vacation, especially an international one you shouldn't have to worry about things like this. I get mistakes happen, but not to even reply to an email is poor customer service. We went out of our way to go back to the hotel and talk to a manager in person, which we shouldn't have had to do, and they still brushed me off, made me do the follow up at my expense and still didn't resolve the issue. 

There are so many other hotels on that same street, save yourself any possible aggravation and book one of those instead.",2,2023,08,02
221,Excellent hotel,"Excellent, so refreshing, beautiful hotel.  Rooms were so spacious and clean. We went to a concert in the Iveagh Gardens. Excellent location. Will most certainly return. We had dinner and drinks pre concert.  It was lovely, service was very good.  Friendly staff.  Great location short walk in to town.",5,2023,08,01
221,Excellent Hotel,"This is one of best hotel in Dublin. Close to everything, quiet, clean and comfortable. Excellent staff who anticipate your needs. The beds were comfortable with high-quality linens. The bathrooms were clean. The rooms are large and quiet. ",5,2023,08,01
221,Poor customer care,"We got no welcome when we arrived, the receptionist just looked at the screen and said..you owe €269!
The room was small but quiet.
The bar staff had to read instructions on how to make cocktails, on was we received them we were told to move to the foyer as they want to set up for breakfast, it was 1155pm
At breakfast the plates were cold for the hot food, there was no hash browns and the cheese/salmon was not replaced once the supply was empty. The crockery was not removed from the table, between the cereal and hot breakfast.
On check out the receptionist and just looked at the screen and said…that’s it! 
Very disappointing, I would not return or recommend ",1,2023,07,30
221,Everything perfect except for the heat in the bedrooms. 3 different rooms no sleep for anyone.  Aircon is a con.,"We had 3 rooms on the first night for a family get together. None of the six adults got a nights sleep. The rooms were unbearably hot and not conducive to a pleasant stay. I was staying unfortunately for a second night and complained. They moved me to a room with “air con” apparently. With the air-con switched on all day and night the heat in the room actually increased. When I spoke to reception about it I got a very curt reply that they would switch it off and germs a fan if I wasn’t happy.  Having spent the first night sweating with the fan going flat out I knew that was no solution to the problem. Basically I was told discreetly to sod off.  
Never ever will I be back.  Sad as everything else was perfect but not sleeping is not acceptable in a hotel of this supposed calibre.",3,2023,07,29
221,Birthday visit for partner,"Prior information does not highlight the difficulty in dropping luggage at the hotel, the tram lines, the lack of temporary parking, particularly as blue badge accessibility. We did drop our baggage only for it to be put in the wrong room, which could have had a very poor outcome with the documents and belongings  enclosed. We waited 90 minutes for it to arrive and when the fact was reported to the reception they insisted on coming to our room to check it wasn’t there, as if we can miss a very large suitcase?! The sink in the room was enough reason not to visit again. Who ever designs the facility with the tap in the corner is truly inept. You can’t get your hands under it. The situation with the water quality was not made clear prior to arriving and that is another reason not to want to return. Our only other contact with reception was on our final evening. We ordered room service at 21:30 prior to the 22:00 end time. This was from the room via ‘0’ and we got transferred to the kitchen with our order. After two hours the food did not arrive and I went down to reception to ensure we weren’t going to be charged for this extremely poor service and not receiving our order.  No information was given prior to the fact that there are a number of night clubs opposite and from 3am until about 4am, it is the source of beeping vehicle horns and tens/hundreds of people shouting with even some fighting and riotous behaviour breaking out. It is a beautiful hotel ideally located for the city but located in the wrong location for so many reasons. ",2,2023,07,28
221,Good hotel in excellent location.,"Lovely hotel in good location both for transport in from the airport and walking distance from the sites. Excellent breakfasts and evening meals. Lovely bar area and tasteful decor throughout the hotel. Staff very helpful in all areas.
Only down sides are tram tracks directly outside hotel which start around 5am and a nightclub Thursday to Saturday til 2am on opposite side of the street.",5,2023,07,26
221,"Lovely hotel, ideal location","We had a lovely stay in this hotel.  It's right beside Iveagh Gardens so ideal if going to a gig.  
Room was spacious and spotless.  The service for food was a bit slow but the food was lovely when it did arrive.  Definitely recommend this hotel. ",4,2023,07,26
221,Fantastic stay,"We stayed at the Iveagh gardens hotel for 2 outdoor concerts at Iveagh Gardens, just around the corner. It was a brilliant weekend. The location of the hotel is brilliant.  It is located close to Grafton Street for shopping and close to public transport (light rail and buses). The bedroom was spacious and the shower was amazing.  The buffet breakfast was delicious with lots of choice. There was a wonderful atmosphere in the hotel. I would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely return. Thank you for a most memorable weekend in Dublin",5,2023,07,26
221,Weekend,"Fabulous hotel in a fantastic location. Price very reasonable. Everything about it is great.  Reallly enjoyed my stay here.   Right beside shops, iveagh gardens and St Stephens green. Very close to Luas line.  Staff very helpful.  Lovely food in the restaurant ",5,2023,07,26
221,Friday night,"Good location. Nice restaurant and bar. Room was a little shabby...carpet was lifting up in places and did not feel it was tended to properly prior to our arricalWe did not receive a welcome on check in, just handed the key card. ",4,2023,07,25
221,Wonderful stay,"Lovely hotel, clean spacious room & ensuite. Staff so helpful, breakfast was amazing! Really good value for money as it was a Friday night. The location is super as it’s very central. I will definitely be returning. ",5,2023,07,25

221,"Well located, elegant hotel with a great bar and restaurant","Clean and very well-located on Harcourt street, close to shops, restaurants and the tram.  The hotel exudes a quiet elegance. You can open the windows (at least partially) in the room!.  The bar and restaurant are pleasant too.",4,2023,07,19
221,Almost perfect - but warm,"Beautiful hotel, great service, great amenities, nice location. No a/c control in room, so room in mid-July was very warm. We opened windows which helped but allowed humidity into the room. Would recommend with caution for the mid-summer months. To be fair, we found many hotels throughout Ireland do not provide temp control by room. ",4,2023,07,19
221,Trusted Hotel & Experience,We ended our 10-day trip in Dubin staying at the Iveagh Garden Hotel.  Amazing staff and facilities!  Only thing I would add was a workout gym...but that might just be an American think :). Got us outside walking early.,5,2023,07,19
221,Iveagh Garden Hotel is a gem!,Iveagh Garden Hotel is a lovely hotel near Camden and Grafton Streets. Such a nice hotel with a helpful staff and convenient to everything. Our room was large so we didn't feel crowded at all and it was super quiet allowing us a great night's sleep after long days and nights of sightseeing - highly recommended!,5,2023,07,18
221,POD Rooms are great,"Great hotel and the POD rooms are ideal for a one night stop over, single occupancy and they have a great walk-in-shower, not the typical claustrophobic box shower.  I arrived, changed and attended the event that I was invited to. Returned slept well, had a shower, breakfast and returned home.",4,2023,07,18
221,Really comfortable stay.,"Great location for exploring Dublin, just a few minutes’ walk from the centre of the City and in a lovely neighbourhood.  Very welcoming team throughout our very comfortable stay. Great breakfast and a fun, lively bar in the evening.",5,2023,07,17
221,Iveagh Gardens Gig,"Excellent location serving a number of entertainment venues including the fabulous Iveagh Gardens. Food and service was top class, room was spot on and well insulated from the buzzing nightlife outside. Highly recommend",5,2023,07,17
221,Great hotel in Dublin,"This hotel has everything: perfect location, friendly, competent, service, and a warm atmosphere. There were 11 in our party, using 8 rooms, and everyone was very happy. I would return in a heartbeat.",5,2023,07,16
221,Lovely stay,Very nice hotel in great location. The tram is right outside and lively areas all very walkable.  Room was clean and comfortable. Hotel breakfasts were excellent and a good value. Staff very helpful too. I highly recommend. ,5,2023,07,15
221,Perfect for a family’s first trip to Dublin.,This was our first visit to Dublin and this hotel was perfect in nearly every way. The location is central with easy access to transport and walking to everything. Definitely pre book the breakfast for the lower rate. It’s a great value for the area and the food was exceptional. We’ll be back.,5,2023,07,14
221,Superb Hotel in Beautiful Area of Dublin,"A Quality hotel which can hold its own against all the top hotels in Dublin.  Service was excellent from all members of staff, and you could not ask for a better location (and I am a Dubliner).  I highly recommend this hotel, I honestly could not fault anything in this hotel.  If you are looking for a place to stay in Dublin - just book it, you won`t be disappointed.",5,2023,07,13
221,Look no further,"I have had the pleasure of staying at The Iveagh Garden Hotel, on many occasions. I've never had reason to complain and therefore keep returning. Very simply, it is an excellently run Hotel with professional staff and super decor that makes you feel relaxed as soon as you walk through the door. ",5,2023,07,13
221,Poor Staff Attitudes,"The hotel is nice enough but beware, customer service makes you feel very unwelcome. I like to think that we are somewhat seasoned travelers and this was our fifth visit to Ireland. We are not a demanding group either. We ended our final night in Ireland with a stay at the Iveagh which we read about in a magazine review. While the room was comfortable, it was hot. We had 2 rooms as we were traveling with our 3 university age kids. One room had ac (nice surprise), but the other room was HOT (no ac but they did provide a fan). That's not where the problem was. Seriously, we run a business and understand that it can be difficult to get engaging staff, but seriously? . Other than checking in, asking for parking directions and asking for coffee, we had no other interactions with staff. All interactions were horrible! We could not have felt more unwelcome from the moment we stepped into the hotel to the moment we stepped out. Every staff member we encountered (3 employees) had poor attitudes. Hopefully this was just a ""one off"" but you can be sure, we will not be returning. ",2,2023,07,11
221,Perfect location and very nice room,The hotel is located in an ideal location. The room had a really nice king bed and modern bathroom. And the restaurant downstairs had a really nice outdoor patio with good food and drinks. Definitely worth the price! ,5,2023,07,10
221,"Noisy, expensive, average hotel","The hotel is in a good location provided you don't mind the noise for the wedding below the rooms or the gardens just behind the hotel, when the concert season is on. Very expensive hotel for a very basic room, terrible restaurant service and less than good service throughout.",3,2023,07,10
221,Lack of communication and unpleasant  experience at the breakfast buffet.,"This was our first time trying your hotel. It was very expensive compared to other options but we knew this was likely due to the location. Everything was fine until we went down for breakfast on our first morning. We followed the instructions of the hotel reception by booking over the phone as we were advised it would be cheaper. When we went down to breakfast, a guy called Eren looked us up and down and began asking us if we paid for our room and if we are sure we had the correct room number as he didn’t have it on his sheet. Needless to say, this was a bit embarrassing but we explained that we had booked via reception, as advised. Then he followed us around with the bill. I said we would like to just pay immediately and take care of it. So that’s what I did. Very unpleasant experience. To make matters worse, when we checked out, we were told we had an outstanding payment for breakfast! We had to prove to the front desk that the charge had come off our card! Really awful and clearly a lack of communication between staff members. Now, we are just one small family. I’m sure whoever will read this couldn’t care that they’ve lost customers. We didn’t go back for breakfast again - we ate outside the hotel and had a much better experience. We are often in Dublin for work and we will not choose this hotel again. Of course, we will advise our friends to avoid your hotel too. Just unnecessarily unpleasant and with so much choice in Dublin, why go back to this?",2,2023,07,08
221,Lovely hotel in Dublin,Lovely hotel just south of St. Stephens Green.  Great staff and lovely interior.  Food also pretty good.  Rooms were nice and comfy.  We had a room with a queen bed and a twin bed. Not sure if there were king beds available.  We stayed here for 5 days and had a very time.  Porters and reception people were very helpful when we needed assistance with taxis and directions.,5,2023,07,08
221,Fantastic experience ,"Went to a gig at Iveagh Gardens so stopped into the hotel for some food & wine. From the minute we got there just loved the whole vibe. Staff were so friendly & lovely. We sat outside in a beautiful area & we got food which was perfect & lovely wine. We stayed there for a bit & even met Damien Dempsey who was playing the gig we were going to. Such a lovely experience. Fabulous staff, lovely food & great wine ❤️🥰",5,2023,07,08
221,3 Night Stay - Pleasant Experience,"Make sure to pay attention to emails because multiple are sent when you book online. I misread mine and thought I only booked 1 room and not 2 like I needed, so I ended up paying for third room (my fault entirely but the emails confused me).",4,2023,07,07
221,Lovely Stay in Dublin,"Wonderful location right by the St. Stephen’s Green. The hotel staff is kind and helpful, particularly the gentlemen at the front desk today around 4pm. Rooms are clean and well-appointed. Would absolutely recommend for a stay in Dublin.",5,2023,07,04
221,"Great location, staff, and restaurant.",Staff went above and beyond to allow our older child to check in before us because of our flight delay. The restaurant was delicious and convenient for our late arrival.  Very convenient location near St. Stephen's Green.,5,2023,07,03
221,Lovely hotel in good location ,"Nice hotel on Harcourt St. Very close to Camden St which has lots of bars and restaurants. The room was lovely and a good size. Modern bathroom with double shower. Bathrobes, slippers, toiletries, tea/coffee in room. Room very clean. Staff need a bit more training. The girl who checked us in and out not very friendly and could have greeted us with some enthusiasm.  Staff at breakfast need to focus on customers. Had to ask for cutlery and coffee at breakfast then after i got the coffee had to ask for a teaspoon and milk. Shouldn't have to ask for the basics. Breakfast was buffet, was nice. We had some cocktails but were told we couldn't sit in the bar so sat in the lobby which was fine. Hotel in a very good location.",4,2023,07,02
221,Lovely hotel ,"Lovely hotel, beautiful location, loved the decor, clean comfy air con room.
Excellent breakfast, with super choice, 
Great service all round, and will be returning when in Dublin again. I am delighted to have found it,

",5,2023,07,01
221,Excellent location and great service.,"The Iveagh is the perfect hotel for any first time visitors in Dublin. The location is excellent and in a safe area, as you are only a 10 minute walk away from the city center and can walk through St. Stephen’s Green park on your way. Alan was extremely helpful at arranging a taxi to the airport for my family. 10/10 would recommend. ",5,2023,06,29
221,Bring your earplugs!,"Very noisy at nights with bars/clubs playing late.  AC unit required window to be open to allow a heat exhaust hose access to the outside and noise access to the room.   The standard breakfast should have been complimentary, or if a la carte much better.. Room, bed,  and hotel service were excellent.",4,2023,06,27
221,Excelent location,"The hotel is very well located to visit Dublin, the room was ready before time of check in and has a very good and complete breakfast. My regards to Elio and also to Alan
Enrique y Liliana de Argentina",5,2023,06,26
221,Room was 30 degrees when it was 17 outside.,One of the worst stays in a hotel I have had. The room was over 30 degrees. Went back to the room early to try and get some sleep to get up early to explore the city and because the room was so warm we couldn’t sleep until 5 am. If you are going in the summer please help yourself and stay somewhere else. They offered us a fan but it did nothing. Complained twice and nothing was done. Even after telling the front desk how bad it was they just said you have to deal with it.,1,2023,06,25
221,Festival next door,Had a miserable stay with broken air conditioning. Had to leave windows open and be subjected to terrible bands playing a festival next door all day until midnight for 5 days. Not even earplugs helped. ,2,2023,06,24
221,Dublin short break,"Return visit to centrally located very well appointed hotel.  Room clean and well presented, spacious bathroom with lovely shower.  Staff all friendly and welcoming.  The food in Elle's Bistro was delicious - lovely buffet breakfast with plenty of choice.  Fruit, cereals, danish pastries, full cooked options, toast, soda bread.  The food in the bistro at night was also delicious.  Would definitely recommend and look forward to the opportunity to return.",5,2023,06,24
221,Blasting music,"Please be aware that this charming hotel happens to be in a nightclub area and dance music will BLAST outside until 11:00 pm.  It is unbelievable.  Unless music that is so loud you can’t hear your spouse across the room doesn’t bother you, think twice about booking this hotel.",3,2023,06,23
221,A little disappointed,"This promising hotel stay in a fantastic location was undermined by no parking facilities and undertrained staff. 
The room was spotlessly clean but we were entertained by people leaving the nightclub opposite at 2am. 
Breakfast was ok. Lunch was very slow. 
For the price it was disappointing. ",3,2023,06,23
221,Olga McAteer,The hotel is everything that it said it was. Brilliant buzz about the hotel. Very professional yet friendly. Excellent location with great food and rooms very tidy. Can’t fault it. We would definitely recommend this hotel for location and price. ,4,2023,06,16
221,Fabulous hotel in Dublin,"Stayed at the Iveagh Garden Hotel in Dublin. Location was great, easy walk to nearby restaurants and pubs. Room had air on which was a godsend with the hot weather we were experiencing! The staff were very helpful with a dinner reservation, nothing was too much trouble. Will definitely recommend to friends.",5,2023,06,14
221,A blind room overlooking the ventilation,At first I was given a very small room in the basement. After claim I got a nice big room on the first floor but with three opaque and non opening windows overlooking the air conditioning. I also found on the hotel website a cheaper price with free breakfast.,3,2023,06,11
221,Nice hotel but do not stay on street side,Everything about this hotel is good except for the night clubs across the street. DO NOT stay in a street side room. Night Clubs across the street close down at 3 am on weekend and 1 am during the week. The noise is unbelievably loud! Lots and lots of noisy drunk people outside on the street. Woke us up every night.,2,2023,06,11
221,Delightful,We were delighted to hear Iveagh Gardens had a room available after we discovered another near by hotel had booked us in for the incorrect date. We were greeted warmly by a porter who ensured we had a comfortable stay. He called a taxi for us the next morning waiting with us until it arrived and assisted with our luggage. Above and beyond service! ,5,2023,06,10
221,"nice atmosphere, bad matresses","Bad, old, worn-out matresses, backs hurt, breakfast packages(we had to leave early) not worth the money we paid for breakfast, containing gluten and lactose though we asked for gluten- and lactosefree. Had to wait for the packages though it was promised the would be ready.
Clubs in the neighbourhood too loud.",3,2023,06,08
221,Beautiful hotel with amazing staff,"Stayed here for a long weekend. Perfect location for us, walking distance to town but in a quiet location next to beautiful parks. Room was gorgeous but our lasting memories will be due to the staff. Every one of them without exception were warm and friendly. ",5,2023,06,07
221,Vacation,"I would highly recommend this hotel. You can see the pride they take in keeping it very clean.The staff was fabulous, extremely helpful and courteous.The room was clean with plenty of outlets. The breakfast was very good and location was a 15 minute walk to grafton st.",5,2023,06,05
221,Excellent service,"All the staff were helpful and provided assistance when required, eg tea while waiting in reception for the taxi they ordered for me. The location is quiet and only 19mins walk from Temple Bar and most attractions",5,2023,06,03
221,Wonderful Stay!,"Our stay at The Iveagh Garden Hotel was perfect. Incredible value for the price. The hotel restaurant served wonderful food as well. We were here for just one night, but I wish we could have stayed longer. I will definitely choose Iveagh Garden Hotel again during my next trip to Dublin. ",5,2023,06,01
221,Great Location!,Nice location near Grafton Street.  room was clean but AC wasn’t working.  Had a window we could open but a bird outside the window made me nervous it would come in.  And noise was an issue with the window open.  Room was comfortable and clean.  Best shower!  Breakfast options included hot and cold options with a large selection and variety.  We had dinner at hotel one night and it was really good!  Bartenders were friendly.,4,2023,05,30
221,Great location,"Solid hotel, good location, clean, friendly and pleasant staff. Noisy night clubs across the street bad for sleep if you want the windows open but good for fun if have young people in your group.  The AC wasn’t working very well.",4,2023,05,29
221,"Nice hotel, but no air conditioning in rooms","The hotel is well located and is very nicely decorated. Service was good, with friendly reception staff etc. However, there was no air conditioning in the room, which was very hot and therefore led to a sleepless night. Reception advised that only a small number of rooms have air con. ",2,2023,05,28
221,A realy nice place to stay,"The location of the hotel is very good. You are not in the hustle and bustle, but you can reach the city centre comfortably on foot. The staff is very nice and helpful. The restaurant is very good and the breakfast very rich.",5,2023,05,28
221,"Fine, but some less than ideal things","Comfy beds, great staff. Faucet in bathroom was ridiculous and basically unusable. Tap water not potable according to the in room info guide but they only give you one small bottle of still and one bottle of sparkling water in the room. For two people we would need at least 3 times that for one night but we'd have to ask for it. In essence, it is beautiful but the design needs work to make it more functional.",3,2023,05,26
221,Wonderful start to our Honeymoon!,"We had a wonderful start to our honeymoon here. The room was stylish and comfortable, the complimentary toiletries were high quality, the staff were friendly and helpful, and the location was central and on a very nice street. We couldn’t ask for anything more! Highly recommended!",5,2023,05,26
221,Nice hotel in good location,"The breakfast was great, the service was good, the location was excellent, and the rooms were nice. The price was reasonable as well, all in all I would stay there again when in Dublin. My wife also had a great salad for lunch that she was very happy with.",5,2023,05,25
221,"Great service and location, unfortunate issue with cooling.","The place was lovely and we felt really taken care of by the staff. However, there were some issues with the cooling system which made the rooms really warm. The staff did provide us with fans, which helped. But be warned that it may be an issue if you travel during hot temps. ",5,2023,05,23
221,JD Keegan NCH Overnight Stay,"Great location, friendly staff and good value. Would recommend to anyone visiting Dublin. The only negative are the steps up to the entrance, not ideal if carrying bags or perhaps for older people, bit overall a positive experience.",5,2023,05,22
221,Lovely hotel,"We stayed for four nights in mid-April. Very professional staff, clean rooms, nice quiet floor and view, easy walking to everything, great buffet. Rooms kept clean for the entire stay without prompting from us. We arrived early but staff secured our luggage until room ready while we walked around Dublin. Nice restaurant, actually best food we had in Dublin. Compliments to chef and restaurant staff.",5,2023,05,20
221,Poor Service,We spent the first night in a lesser room before moving to Presidential Suite. I was I'll and asked to have Suite ready ASAP. It took them 4 hours to clean room. Terrible and disrespectful service. Everything else was fine.,4,2023,05,19
221,Holiday in Dublin,"The hotel is professional and well maintained.  They were accommodating with requests and when we had a mix up with the rooms, they corrected their mistake quickly and efficiently.  I would recommend staying here.",4,2023,05,17
221,Great location and everything we needed,"We loved staying at the Iveagh Garden, it was stylish and comfortable.  The air conditioning worked great, the bed and pillows were perfect.  The location was walkable to museums and locations in the city center.   I loved going through St. Stephens Green back to the hotel at the end of the day.  We also enjoyed walking through Iveagh Gardens to get to the National Concert Hall.  We also really enjoyed the full Irish breakfast every morning.  This hotel had everything we needed.  There was also a cute little Tram Cafe just down the street for coffee and sandwiches.",5,2023,05,12
221,Spotty customer service,"The hotel is an average experience at premium prices. Air conditioning does not work in the rooms leaving them very warm. Even when the staff insisted they were assigning us a room (during a second stay) that had cooling, it did not. The complimentary drink coupons were not honored at the bar. It's an okay place, but not worth the luxury prices that they charge. ",2,2023,05,12
221,Disappointed for the price ,"The location of this hotel was perfect. The room was clean and we felt safe here. For the splurge of money we spent, I was disappointed in our room and in the service. The bed was comfortable, but the TV was small and wayyyyyy off in the corner away from the bed and the sitting area - silly, really. The help at the desk could usually not help me with my questions. Thank goodness for the one Irish gentleman working there who saved the day over and over as we tried to navigate this big city. Thank you to him. And, no one ever mentioned to us that there are actual gardens relates to this hotel that would have been beautiful to walk through. ",3,2023,05,10
221,Gorgeous,"We loved the place. It was beautiful, and clean. The staff was very kind and very helpful with all of our needs. The location was perfect. Walking distance to the main square.  Breakfast was amazing. We hope to visit again soon.",5,2023,05,10
221,Lovely Location and Service,"We had a great stay at the Iveagh Garden Hotel. They had an unexpected early check-in for us, which was a welcome surprise. Loved that they had a fan in the room--it helped a lot with sleeping in an unfamiliar bed! The service was kind and lovely. We had some absolutely gorgeous weather, so it was an easy hop to both Iveagh Garden and St. Stephens Green to relax and enjoy the Dublin sunshine.",5,2023,05,10
221,Good but not great. Solid 4 star,"Great location, friendly and helpful staff. First time in Dublin so perhaps that is just the going rate for hotels but I found it pricey for what it offered. Room was a little small, no mini bar and a little dusty (relative to the price). But it was by no means a horrible stay. Overall a good but not great stay. A solid 4 stars hotel. ",3,2023,05,10
221,Upstanding Dublin Hotel,"Great location, parks right there and easy walking or use of public transportation to get all over the city. 
Staff are pleasant attentive and helpful. Fast to respond to requests for service to your room. ",5,2023,05,08
221,"Great location, hotel so comfortable",I was here as part of a group tour and booked accommodation for 2 extra nights post tour . This hotel is in a great location and everything central is very walkable . The bed was comfy and I loved the walk-in shower .. huge by European standards . My room also looked into the Iveagh Garden area behind the hotel . Front desk eased my transition to my personal post reservation by making sure I didn’t have to change rooms . Very helpful . The bar area amazing as it was comfortable to sit and relax and enjoy a drink . Very spacious and with table service as well . Bartenders very knowledgeable about   Off the beaten path places to visit . So pleasant I hated to leave . Will stay again when in Dublin ,5,2023,05,07
221,Great week-long workshop at Iveagh Garden Hotel,"I brought a group of 25 people to Iveagh Garden Hotel for a week-long workshop. We had an excellent experience and I would highly recommend this hotel. Clean rooms, kind and helpful staff, and great breakfast. It is also in a wonderful location, a little removed from the craziness of Temple Bar, but still very close to the heart of the city. Plus, the hidden park of Iveagh Garden (behind the hotel) was great for quiet afternoon strolls. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2023,05,01
221,Perfect Dublin Stay,"The hotel was in a great location for our family of four with friendly staff and a comfortable atmosphere.  We had a large suite which was perfect for gathering the four of us together to plan our days, and a second room for our girls.  We would definitely stay again!",5,2023,04,29
221,"Small, nicely decorated, comfortable","Townhouse style hotel.  Small, nicely decorated, comfortable.  Garden restaurant.  Room service was very good.  Walkable distance into shopping area of Dublin.  I enjoyed sitting in St. Stephens Green to relax when not doing other touristy things.    ",5,2023,04,27
221,Highly recommended!,"Excellent location and room quality. Reception staff were helpful, kind and friendly. Two very small things to be aware of- the rooms can get very warm and the thermostat is a little tricky to figure out- but windows can be opened for ventilation etc. The breakfast buffet selection is great, but not super vegan or vegetarian friendly- there is cereal, fruit, toast and eggs available, but apart from that, you might struggle a bit if you're vegan and looking to have breakfast at the hotel. If I'm being really nitpicky, the wifi was a bit slow/temperamental in our room. But overall, would definitely recommend! ",5,2023,04,27
221,"Classy, friendly hotel","Family trip - 6 of us in three rooms for three nights. We all had a great time at an excellent hotel with very friendly and helpful staff.
Quiet location but within easy walking distance of the major attractions, parks and some great bars.  Comfortable rooms (continental style coffee in rooms though with condensed milk - that was the only, very minor, negative!). We all loved the hotel and would return as and when we are next in town!!",5,2023,04,26
221,Elegant boutique hotel with a feeling of luxury!,"This is a fantastic hotel. Dublin is expensive we found when looking to book, however, this hotel stood out as one that was worth paying that extra amount. It is in a great location, to explore the city, as the walking is flat and nothing is too far away really. The Castle, shops, other historical sights and, very importantly to us, the RTE National Symphony Orchestra, symphony hall was close by along with some very nice restaurants. The light rail runs along the street, right past the lounge window which we found quite a novelty! The lounge I mention is large with very comfy sofas and lounge chairs. It was great to return to after our concert with our relatives to have a relaxing drink. The rooms are well appointed and the staff are very engaging and helpful. We’d definitely consider staying at this hotel again when we visit Dublin, hopefully again soon. ",5,2023,04,26

221,Best hotel in Dublin?,"Had a fabulous stay at the Iveagh Garden Hotel. Everything was excellent... location, comfort, decor, food and especially the staff! Have to specially mention Simone, Barbara, Esha and Ryan... but all the staff were superb! As a 'porridge person' I have to give top marks for the lovely hot, creamy porridge! Though all the food was great... the poached eggs at breakfast were lovely! We have stayed in many Dublin hotels over the years but this was probably the best...would definitely recommend! ",5,2023,04,23

221,Good service,"I just want to write a note to thanks Jones for his execellent service. We have a group of close to 20 ppl for different checkin and checkout date. 
Jones is very helpful to help to print out each individual rooms check out invoice which gives us very much help for our travel claim when we back to the office. 
As 7 out of our group are VVIP for us. Jones are very helpful to extend the check out time so that the VVIP will have more time to pack and ready to the airport. 

Very much appreciated Jones' service.",5,2023,04,18
221,Careless,"I am only giving one score because of how immaculate the hotel is and how nicely decorated.
Myself and 4 work friends stayed here for one night. Upon arrival we were tripled charged(although the manager apologised) it took a lot of negotiating with staff for them to finally notice and realise the triple charge. The service was not helpful checking in either, no information about breakfast, check out etc was given. 
We went to the restaurant for our dinner. The service was absolutely shocking. We were given menus & we did not get asked if we wanted drinks. When our food arrived it was not up to the standards that matched the price. Not one waiter/waitress asked us if everything was okay or if we wanted more drink. We sat for 20 minutes after finishing our dinner and still no one to our service. My friend had to leave the table to go and ask for the bill. It was early in the evening and there was only 3 groups of people at the restaurant so they were not busy. 
Later on that evening we went back to the bar for a cocktail & again we were overcharged. I know mistakes happen but the whole service we received was very careless.",1,2023,04,17
221,"Poor response to genuine complaint, first negative review I have written on trip advisor","Beautiful hotel and restaurant, staff lovely and very clean 
Great location 
Disappointed in how our complaints surrounding heating/air con breaking in room 
We were having to sleep in 25 degrees as system broke and maintenance couldn’t fix, hotel provided a jet engine fridge size air con as a fix but it was too loud to sleep next too, three nights of poor sleep, dry throats etc, polite requests to try and rectify resulted in nothing and a promised box of chocolates never appeared, since returning home I have sent two polite emails and still zero response ",2,2023,04,17
221,Overall good,Had trouble sleeping due to the quirks of the AC unit and the proximity of our window to the kitchen exhaust. But everything else was lovely. My wife and I had a lovely time and would certainly stay there again on our next visit to Dublin. ,4,2023,04,14
221,Excellent city centre base for a shopping trip,"My daughter and I stayed in the Iveagh Gardens recently and it was exactly what we wanted. The room was clean, quiet and comfortable. The Luas stop is nearby but we walked to Grafton St for shopping and Dawson St for dinner. The staff are friendly and helpful and the breakfast very good. ",5,2023,04,14
221,M,Ok. Comfortable but not much services to avail off. Staff were friendly and hotel was very clean. Only one restaurant open with very little to choose from and the bag was closed before 11:30. Overall an ok experience but for the price of the hotel room for one night would have expected a little bit more ,3,2023,04,13
221,"Lovely hotel, central location","This was our first stay here and we would stay again. Great location and lovely hotel. A good sized room and at the side of the hotel which was quiet.

221,A lovely hotel and will defiantly be back again,"Me and my girlfriend had our first holiday away and stayed in this lovely hotel. The hotel/room was incredibly clean and tidy and had a nice feel to it. All the staff were very polite and helpful throughout our entire stay. We had an evening meal there on one of the nights however expensive the food was lovely. We both agreed the one and only thing that could of improved our stay would of been a mini fridge in our room, for food we found around the city/cold drinks. We would 100% recommend this hotel to others and we will defiantly be back again.",5,2023,04,08
221,"Fine, but front desk lets the hotel down",The check-in and check-out experience was tarnished by inattentive staff members. Room allocation was also an issue which all came down to poor communication by the reception staff. Otherwise it is a nice hotel in a good location. ,4,2023,04,08
221,Great hotel,"We loved everything about this hotel! The hotel itself is nice, and the staff went above and beyond for me and my friends. Truly a great experience. I would 100% stay here again if I come back to Dublin. ",5,2023,04,06

221,"Great stay, centrally located. ","Overall, my experience at the hotel was excellent. The hotel is located in a great area, within walking distance to many of Dublin's main attractions, including St. Stephen's Green and Grafton Street.

The room I stayed in was stylish and modern, with a comfortable bed and all the amenities I needed for a comfortable stay. The room had a flat-screen TV, a desk, a wardrobe, and an en-suite bathroom with a shower. The room was spotlessly clean and well-maintained, and I appreciated the little touches, such as the complimentary bottled water and Nespresso machine.

The hotel restaurant, Elle's Bar & Bistro, had a great atmosphere and offered a delicious menu. I had dinner there on my first night, and the food was fantastic. I particularly enjoyed the seafood chowder and the steak. The staff were friendly and attentive, and the service was excellent.

The breakfast at the hotel was also impressive, with a range of hot and cold dishes to choose from. There were traditional Irish breakfast items such as bacon, sausage, and black pudding, as well as pastries, fresh fruit, and cereals. The coffee was excellent too, which is always a plus!

The hotel also had a lovely rooftop bar, which offered fantastic views of the city. It was a great spot to relax and enjoy a drink after a day of exploring.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Iveagh Garden Hotel Dublin for travelers who are looking for a stylish and comfortable stay in the heart of Dublin. The room was well-appointed, the restaurant served delicious food, and the breakfast buffet was impressive. The staff were friendly and attentive, and the rooftop bar was a great added bonus. I had a great stay and would definitely return to this hotel in the future.",4,2023,03,27

The room was amazing, so spacious and luxurious - the beds were so comfortable! 
The time we spent in the hotel was great, and even location wise it's so handy for town - within walking distance or literally 2 mins in a taxi which was so handy!

221,The perfect break away,"Everything from start to finish exceeded our expectations. The room was really comfortable and clean. The triple glazed windows did an amazing job of blocking out the sounds from the road outside. Dinner was top class. Possibly one of the best meals I have eaten anywhere in Dublin. Cocktails were a work of art. Staff on every level were polite, courteous, friendly and helpful. Nothing was ever too much trouble. Decor throughout the hotel gives off a calm yet happy vibe. Location is ideal for anyone wanting to enjoy the city center atmosphere. Close to Stephen's Green, shops, bars, restaurants, museums, National Concert hall etc. With the Luas stop 2 minutes away, and the Iveagh Gardens themselves directly behind the hotel it is the perfect spot to unwind. Can't wait to go back again. ",5,2023,03,16

We ate in Elle’s Bar & Restaurant where we enjoyed great food and even greater cocktails!  We headed out to a concert and returned for a nightcap in the bar.  We had a very restful sleep in the comfortable and most important of all, peaceful rooms and breakfast the next morning was plentiful and tasty.  I would definitely recommend the hotel for a mini break.",5,2023,03,14
221,Average stay,Room fairly comfortable but temperature was not great. Cleaners extremely noisy outside the room and showed no concern for the noise levels - banging around outside the room every day making lots of noise - breakfast was buffet style and all food was cold even though I ate breakast at 08:00,3,2023,03,13
221,Paul ireland,The hotel is a lovely hotel and everything nice… there the only problem as I said is i used there own site a couple of times once u have got to final page and u have paid it  might not b what u thought u had done as in I think they have a very clever site ie maybe no breakfast included yet it was when u paid and maybe not the 20 euro off yet was when u we’re paying  … saying that I have stayed at least 6 times in the last 12 months as it is a lovely and clean hotel ,4,2023,03,12

221,Wonderful experience,"Very much enjoyed our stay here - we were reluctant to leave! Everything felt very high quality, couldn't fault the room, particularly appreciated bottled water replenished daily and breakfast was outstanding - hot & cold buffet with everything you could wish for; my partner works as a breakfast chef and competition rarely lives up to his standards, but here succeeded! Only very minor complaint would be the bar seemed to close quite early for a hotel of this type, although could still be served basic drinks in the lobby (no cocktails). Service was excellent with no issues.",5,2023,03,10
221,Elegant city centre hotel.,A lovely chic hotel just five mins walk from Grafton street. Extremely spacious bedrooms with pleasant decor. Very little lacking in the bedroom except for a minibar. Great view of the city skyline from the top floor. All in all it is very difficult to find fault with this hotel. It's top quality and at the upper end of a 4 star rating. Definitely one of Dublin's finest.,5,2023,03,09
221,Fantastic,"What a wonderful hotel to stay in, the location was great,  the room’s were beautifully decorated,  very high standard of cleanliness and the breakfast was amazing so much choice, would highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2023,03,09
221,Don't Drink the Water - Literally! No potable drinking water or amenities. Death by 1000 cuts.,"Pretty lobby. Staff would rather be anywhere else. They lock the front door at night. You can hear the TV of the other room through the wall of your suite crystal clear.  They've cheaped out on everything: no robes, bad bad shampoo/conditioner, there was a toxic chemical smell in the hallway that appeared and the staff started wearing masks. Fitness Center is $15 and a walk across town. One of our lights was out. Oh and here's the kicker. In fine print in the manual of the room it says ""the water is not potable."" So we would ask for some drinking water and were met with sighs and this feeling from the staff that we were asking for the world. Why is the drinking water not potable at a 4 star hotel? ",2,2023,03,08
221,Highly recommend for a wedding,The staff go out of their way to make sure you are looked after. The location is great. The hotel is modern but still homely and comfortable. The food is great and the rooms are really nicely decorated and a generous size ,5,2023,03,08

Everytime I have stayed in this hotel, I have stayed with different people be it for a girly night, or a Family night away. Everyone I have brought to this hotel has raved about it and loves it just as much as I do. 
The staff are so polite and friendly up and down the corridors its hello form all the wonderful housekeeping who keep the hotel and rooms imaculate. The recepetion staff always try their best to accomadate you and the waiting staff are always busy and friendly with a smile on their faces,
An absolute credit to any hotel.
Everything done right.",5,2023,03,02

221,Fantastic Hotel - best in Dublin,"Look no further. This hotel is the best in terms of service, location, breakfast and comfort. Highly recommend for your stay in Dublin. Go for the superior room if you can - even though our room was street side, the noise from outside was minimal. The staff here are excellent and nothing is too much trouble.",5,2023,03,01
221,Perfect for a stay in an authentic Dublin area,"We had a great tim at the IG Hotel. The hotel is perfectly located in a fine recreationnal area (pubs, clubs) but with very quiet bcourtyard facing rooms that make for a fine sleep. Nice service, tidy rooms and a restaurant/lobby that is open till late. The basic fare (no breakfast) could still be lower or include a few more (coffee etc) than 1 water bottle per day…",5,2023,03,01
221,Wonderful stay,"Clean, comfortable, and central. All the staff were friendly and helpful. I really enjoyed my stay, and would definitely stay here again. Highly recommend - was the best hotel I stayed in during my time in Ireland. ",5,2023,02,27
221,Iveagh Garden,"Enjoyed the walk from the station to the Hotel. The location was very attractive and the street was rather beautiful, seamlessly reflected by the inside of the hotel. It was dark and atmospheric but not offensively so, this was accentuated by the friendly staff that greeted me upon my entry and politely and efficiently handed me my room keys and let me know of any other services that were offered in the hotel, including breakfast. I would definitely stay here again if I was ever to visit Dublin. ",5,2023,02,24
221,No response from hotel,I booked through 3rd party site and acknowledge cancellation charge within 24 hours but contacted 3rd party site within timeline and hotel just slightly outside. No response from hotel and charged full room charge although contacted and hotel did not confirm or acknowledge.,1,2023,02,21
221,Art Deco Gem,This hotel is set apart by its staff who are extremely friendly and welcoming. The hotel is a boutique gem in the heart of Dublin. With a tram stop practically outside the door it is remarkably convenient to the main shopping district and the principle tourist sights. The dinner menu is sufficiently varied and top class in flavour while being great value for money. Breakfast is plentiful too. Rooms are comfortable and well appointed with rain showers. Have stayed here a couple of times now and would find it hard to pass up this Art Deco gem when visiting Dublin. ,5,2023,02,20
221,No air conditioning unless you have a Superior Room,"This hotel is located in a very convenient place for seeing everything Dublin has to offer and we walked everywhere quite easily. Unfortunately, the beautiful public facade of this hotel disguises a huge fundamental issue that the majority of residents face which is being constantly ignored. After reading many reviews bringing it to their attention, and the hotel's complacency to overlook this, the problem seriously needs addressing. 
Apart from the superior rooms, THERE IS NO AIR- CON. You would think in February that this shouldn't have caused us an issue, but our room was 24°c and stifling hot. The window had a safety catch and only opened a few centimetres. We had booked for three nights and were on the 4th floor. We hardly slept at all on the first night, sleeping on top on the covers with two fans on (we should have guessed we would be roasting from the start), but hoped that the room would cool down if we left the window open for the day and turned the air off. The lowest the air could go down to was 19°c but it never went below 24°c so was clearly broken. After showering and getting ready to leave that morning, it was like a permanent sauna.
When we came back to our hotel after walking 10 miles around Dublin, we were tired and in need of a good night's sleep, especially after a disruptive night before. We tried to sleep but at around 12.30am we just couldn't stand it anymore. I rang down to reception and after going through suggestions of turning off the air and turning on the fans, the receptionist said he would move us into another room. I queried why another room would be any different and he said we were near the boiler(?). So, we got dressed, packed up and went down to reception and were given an accessible room on the 2nd floor. On arrival I could see straight away that the duvet inside the cover had a huge, dark stain that was showing through, there were hairs on the cover and that the pillows were old and bobbly with one pillowcase having a mark so I immediately went back to reception to ask for these to be replaced. The man on reception arrived at our room with a whole set of bedding and two SINGLE BED duvets. I mentioned the pillows and he returned with one old looking pillow saying there weren't any more. He said we could mention it at the desk in the morning so that housekeeping could change the whole bed. We even had to change and make our bed ourselves that night. The pillows definitely werent clean as mine smelt strongly of aftershave. I think we finally dropped off at around 3am so the following day we were just so tired. 
The lack of two full nights' sleep took it's toll on our break away and we ended up coming back to the hotel mid afternoon to go to sleep for a few hours.
Yes, the hotel is impressive looking, but cleanliness, comfort and customer service HAS to be top priority. We weren't even asked how our stay was when we left. I read a recent review about this hotel after our experience saying 'all fur coat and no knickers' and that sums it up perfectly. The hotel's constant responses of upgrading the air con is definitely not happening if it is still an issue at least six months on. I dread to think how horrendous it must be to sleep there in the summer. At nearly £400 for the privilege we definitely wouldn't recommend or go back. ",3,2023,02,19
221,Lovely hotel but odd breakfast,"We had a really nice stay here having booked it at a treat for two nights over half term. The hotel felt very fancy and the staff were really friendly. The breakfast was generally very nice, but we both didn't enjoyed the cooked element. Those parts felt poor quality and/or not well cooked. This really stood out considering how fancy everything else seemed.",4,2023,02,18
221,Excellent Hotel,"I recently stayed here with my 2 teenage daughters, everything from check-in to check- out was so relaxing and stress free. The staff were all professional and courteous.

221,Free drum and bass!,"Do you like paying €330 a night and listen to  live club music from the hotels basement in the early hours whilst in bed? Then this place is for you! 

I like hotels that actively try to keep you awake by laying on a school disco! If I'm describing something you love, I highly  recommend you try it!

",2,2023,02,11
221,Fantastic location and value,"This hotel offers superb value, stayed with my two daughters, fantastic room, bottled water in the room, very comfortable. Room was ready at check in at 12.45. Discounted overnight parking in RSCI car park. Staff extremely helpful, breakfast was a tad hectic but obviously that was due to the huge numbers there but overall it was great. Wasn’t my first time to stay and it won’t be my last. I’ll be back. ",5,2023,02,09
221,a two day stay to coincide with a conference in camden street,"excellent value for money for an excellent hotel. The parking is fifteen minutes walk away, but it is not a problem, because they do tell you this before you book.  I have no complaints about this hotel.  I would thoroughly recommend the Iveagh Garden Hotel for a Dublin City Centre stay.",5,2023,02,08
221,Great stay,"Great stay, great service and great location.  The staff were helpful and courteous, no taxi's necessary during our stay due to the location and great breakfast to start your day.  Highly recommend, not the cheapest, but worth every penny.",5,2023,02,08
221,Excellent. Would recommend.,Very clean and well located hotel with charming staff. Great location. Good sized bathrooms.

221,Beautiful hotel in a perfect location,"Staff was friendly and welcoming, especially Sergi. He booked tours for us and was so patient about helping us navigate Dublin on foot. Hotel is beautiful and is perfectly located. Only a five minute walk to the airport express bus and a 10 minute walk to St. Stephen's Green/Grafton Street. Trinity College and Temple Bar are within a short walk. Breakfast buffet offered a wide variety of hot and cold choices. Rooms are spacious and well appointed. Shower had plenty of hot water and pressure. We would definitely stay at this hotel again.",5,2023,02,04
221,Lovely City Pod Room,"Well designed small space for 1-2 persons. No major complaints. Situated in a prime location of Old Georgian Dublin, close to St Stephens Green and grand canal. Luas stop close by for connection north and southbound. ",5,2023,02,02

The staff were friendly, helpful and extremely responsive.",5,2023,02,01

221,Overnight Stay,"Arrived late and was looked after very well by the hotel staff, I ordered room service a bit on the late side bit they accommodated me and sent it to my room very quickly.
The seafood chowder was excellent.
The room was a superior facing the main Road.
It can be a tad noisy as the trams start early and trundle past regularly, but the double glazing does its job as best it can.
Nice breakfast the following morning and I have to say that overall a very pleasant experience",5,2023,01,27
221,Shocking,"The Iveagh Garden Hotel in Dublin. It was a beautiful hotel however we found one or two members of staff quite rude making my girlfriend feel extremely uncomfortable and this would put me off and going again.

221,A beautiful boutique hotel in Dublin,"I can't fault any aspect of our stay in the Iveagh Garden Hotel. Its beautiful 1920's decor really won me over, the place had a really luxurious feel to it without the luxury price tag. The reception and bar staff were very attentive and professional. The  cocktails were lovely and the breakfast was delicious. I'd stay again in a heartbeat. ",5,2023,01,24
221,Girlie night out,"We went for the girlie package which included dinner. B&B and drinks on arrival. They upgraded us to a room with three beds as they had it available at the time. Really nice of them. Place was super clean and a lovely vibe. Would definitely stay again. It was for my friends 60th birthday and when I told them they had a lovely card and butlers chocolates for her in the room. So it was a really nice inviting vibe. Breakfast was lovely and served till 10.30 which is nice. Dinner also good, however some produce tasted a little synthetic. It is a hotel after all and not a restaurant. I would definitely stay again.",5,2023,01,24
221,Perfect!,"Perfect hotel! Room was clean and big, bed was fantastic, nice big shower, delicious  breakfast and everyone was so helpful and kind! The location is also great, so there are only pro’s for this hotel! ",5,2023,01,24

221,A perfect night away!,"The location was perfect, the interiors are a stunning art deco style, the staff were honestly the most friendly and helpful hotel staff I’ve ever encountered! Everyone went out of their way to ensure we felt welcome and all were so approachable and accommodating. From the reception staff to the bar/restaurant staff to the cleaning staff, every one of them should be commended. A wonderful atmosphere throughout which made it a lovely place to unwind. The food in the restaurant was also divine. It was worth every penny and I will be back! A 10/10 experience at the Iveagh Garden Hotel.",5,2023,01,05
221,a mid week break,"Stayed at this hotel for the first time recently.  The experience was most enjoyable.  Stafff very friendy and attentative without being intrusive. Breakfact was to avery high standared with a large selction of both contenintal and irish food. available 
The bedroom was lovely and confortable as was the shower
The hotel iks located in close prosity to all the propular attreactions in Dublin city centre.",5,2023,01,05
221,Stunning Hotel,"I would highly recommend the Iveagh Garden hotel as the decor is stunning, it is a very clean hotel, the bedrooms are beautiful and the location is great a 10 minute walk into the centre. So if you’re planing Dublin I would stay here! ",5,2023,01,05
221,Great hotel 🤩,Stayed here dec31st great value for money seeing as it was nye in Dublin. The staff were very friendly & accommodating. The breakfast was amazing & well worth the money. Cocktails were fab too. All in all a great hotel. Would defo book again. ,5,2023,01,04
221,"Great hotel, if a little loud.","I stay here every time I come to Dublin, it almost never disappoints, comfortable, stylish and convenient. The room I stayed in this time wasn’t the best part of the hotel, very loud from both the staff room and the street noise. A once off, but quite disappointing. ",3,2023,01,03
221,Outstanding! ,"Excellent from the moment I arrived at the door! The staff were so welcoming and helpful. The room was perfect. Breakfast was a feast.
The hotel is so central, so many sites which can be explored on foot from the Hotel. I will definitely be booking it for any future trips to Dublin. ",5,2023,01,03
221,Just Ok,"Rooms and location are lovely, just don't expect a friendly welcome from the staff. At breakfast the food was nice but don't expect to get coffee or tea as you need to wait for one of the few staff to come around.",3,2022,12,31
221,Fantastic experience 👏,"To find a fault the only one would maybe loading in and out of luggage where you have to double park on a busy road. The porters are there to help however still a pain to do so. Car parking is 8min walk away and has a discounted rate. 

This hotel has top notch finish inside and the place is run very well. The up keep and cleanliness is 5 star

Hotel prob 4.5 star overall.",4,2022,12,28
221,Pre Chris break,An enjoyable stay but not special. Room ok food ok service not great and pricey. The parking is a nightmare and better rates need to be negotiated. I won’t rush back but the stay was pleasant enough without te wow factor. Christmas decorations were lovely on the hotel. ,4,2022,12,27
221,Great hotel and great location,"The Iveagh Hotel was exactly what we wanted for a pre-Christmas shopping trip. It was really central to the shops and restaurants. Iit was clean, comfortable and staff were helpful and friendly. We ate in the bar and the food was excellent. I would definitely recommend.",5,2022,12,22
221,Incredibly Helpful Staff and very central location,Incredibly helpful Staff and very central location. Staff went out to their way to help. The restaurent had a basic menu but it was good value and excellent for what it was. Room was a good size for a city hotel. ,4,2022,12,20
221,"Stylish hotel, ideal for business and pleasure.","I checked into a stylish, spacious deluxe room on the top floor with views of the The Ivy Gardens. The Ivy Garden Hotel is ideally placed for touring Dublin City, with the tram stop just a short walk away to take me into the city centre and beyond. I was spoilt for choice at the extensive buffet breakfast. Thoroughly enjoyed dinner on both nights at Elle's Bar & Bistro. The Ivy Garden Hotel offers good value for money and I will return. ",5,2022,12,18
221,The perfect stay in the heart of Dublin,"My wife and I stayed in the Iveagh Garden hotel midweek for one night night to get all our Christmas shopping done.
The location is perfect!!!! It’s a 7 minutes stroll from St Stephen Green shopping centre and Grafton Street.
We stayed in a room Deluxe room. The word deluxe is very appropriate for the room. The bed was very comfortable, the soft furnishings plush and the large bathroom even came with a bathtub which is no longer a given in most hotels

After a full day shopping we decided to order room service. The food was delivered in minutes and was piping hot. 

The staff were very friendly and helpful.
As we booked directly with the hotel we got a good deal which included breakfast.
There was a good selection of hot food and continental breakfast.

Overall we were very impressed with the Iveagh Garden hotel. It represents exceptional value for money compared to most other hotels in the area",5,2022,12,18
221,Very stylish. Nice breakfast. Good location. ,"Great location for being able to walk about Dublin— we walked to both the Temple Bar area and St. Stephen’s Green. The hotel lobby and restaurant are gorgeously decorated. 

The breakfast is very nice with lots of options. They even had a full honey comb, which we thought was very cool. I echo the many comments that the service is a bit spotty— there appeared to be a lot of new people who were very kind and willing, but it was often hard to track someone down when you need help (mostly in the restaurant.) But they were very helpful when you could catch them! In the evening the charcuterie board was excellent. 

A very nice small room where everything was comfortable (it’s true there is no temperature control in the room.) The club across the street was loud through the night but I wore just earplugs— it’s conveniently in the middle of town, so noise is to be somewhat expected. Overall, I would return. ",4,2022,12,13
221,Not Helpful,"Do not stay here if you arrive late an expect any assistance with food. No food after 9.30 pm!
Staff totally unhelpful for a bedraggled traveller having stressful airport experience.

Room was comfortable and clean.",2,2022,12,13
221,Lovely modern hotel in central location,"The hotel is in a location close to the sights of the south side of Dublin. It has a lovely lobby and a lively bar/restaurant. The breakfast has multiple options. Staff is very friendly and accommodating. Room was very comfortable. The only issue is the noise coming from the surrounding nightclubs. Even though we were on the 4th floor, the noise kept us awake until 2am on the weekend.",5,2022,12,11
221,Great stay,"Centrally located, parking at less than 10 minutes on foot - nice central walk. Not a huge lobby but very nice and elegant. My room although facing the main street was not too noisy. I was surprised by the room, very well appointed, nice bathroom, everything looked new and well kept, hard to complain. I didn’t have breakfast but I had dinner, and I have to mention the staff at the restaurant (as a business customer I hate wasting hours at restaurants) - well, probably I had the fastest dinner in a while, great and attentive staff. Food itself was also good. Checking out at 8.00 was also quick and smooth.",5,2022,12,08
221,Contender for best hotel in Dublin city,"The hotel is on a great location for Grafton Street and St Stephen's Green and for the less opulent but very vibrant and fun, Camden and George's Streets! The hotel's interior is beautiful and rooms are comfortable and of a good size. Staff are helpful and friendly. 
My only complaint (& I'm nitpicking) are the breakfast sausages... for a nation that loves its sausages, the hotel's offering is poor, and the staff seemed stretched at the breakfast service.",5,2022,12,07
221,Great location but staff need training!,Great location and clean hotel with good breakfast. Poor customer service. You don't feel welcome in the evenings as the staff prioritise functions and external bookings. We couldn't even get a seat at 6.30 in the evening and were told that all the empty seats and tables were reserved for the night.  ,2,2022,12,05
221,Close but no cigar,Great hotel with some really nice design features. Lacking in some areas such as the Breakfast and general hospitality of some of the staff. Would stay again if changes were made staff training is vital!,3,2022,12,02
221,"Excellent People, Great Facilities",Really enjoyed our night in modern renovation of Georgian houses in Dublin. All done to a high class with really comfortable bedrooms and great night sleep. We didn’t eat on this occasion but have done previously and found it very good.  I would suggest slight reorder of the bar area to provide bar type facility - at moment is an eating area where you can hav3 a drink ! ,5,2022,12,01
221,Beautiful and excellent location,The holiday decor was beautiful and the staff could not have been more accommodating. The location was perfect for walking to Grafton street where there is lots to see and do. We ate at the restaurant one evening and had a wonderful meal. Take advantage of the garden area if you choose the Iveagh!,4,2022,11,30
221,Disappointing and overpriced for the low standard,"Overpriced for what it is. Small rooms with no temperature control. Disappointing breakfast, felt more like a low budget hotel. Designed more for people on business than pleasure. Wouldn't recommend.. 
",2,2022,11,30
221,Great hotel,Beautiful hotel. Staff helpful and friendly. Extremely clean. Location perfect with Luas on the doorstep. Great breakfast. Short walk right to the heart of Stephens Green and Grafton Street. Would highly recommend.,5,2022,11,30
221,All Fur coat and no knickers.,Unfortunately this was a case of style over substance! On first appearances we were impressed by the decor etc however the facade is just that! The room was comfortable but lacking the facilities of a hotel at the level the Iveagh Garden is trying to imitate! Poor tea and coffee facilities and toiletries. The staff at the bar/restaurant seemed lacking in any hospitality training and the same could be said for the breakfast team (the attitude was just that an attitude)! The breakfast was mediocre at best and really didn’t excite! I suppose it’s more for the corporate customer but I wouldn’t waste my money and stay again!,3,2022,11,29
221,Outstanding location and service,"The Iveagh Garden is beautifully situated just to the south of St Stephen's Green, an easy walk from the heart of Dublin. The service was exceptional and I can recommend its city pods for the solo traveller. All you get is a comfy bed, a big TV and a hot shower... but what more do you need?",5,2022,11,29
221,Dublin City Break,Stayed for 2 nights at this charming hotel which is 5 minute walk to St. Stephens Green. Luas passes right in front of hotel and taxis no issue. Parking is off site at a rate of €22 for 24 hour and adds expense on to your trip. ,5,2022,11,29
221,A nice city centre stay,"We stayed here for two nights. It has a lovely atmosphere with the Christmas lights. 

The bedroom & en-suite are very well laid out and very comfortable. The bed and pillows were very cosy indeed. The shower was excellent. The toilet paper is no doubt eco friendly but really is atrocious quality for a hotel like this! 

The room did face onto the street  (which is a party street) but this didn’t bother us even with keeping the windows open. The room was quite hot and the AC wasn’t up to much. Keeping the window open worked better for us. 

I had booked this hotel months in advance and  yet only received an email the week before about needing to book the restaurant. We did eventually get a restaurant booking for one of our nights but there was a lot of unnecessary fuss about this if they had emailed me earlier about this. 

There was a private function on the other night  of our stay so could not access the bar this night. I find this ridiculous that you can’t access the bar of a hotel you have booked to stay in. 

The restaurant food was reasonably good and the cocktails were excellent. 

The breakfast food was very good but the waiting staff were extremely chaotic and disorganised and management need to step in here to train them up better as it was a bit laughable. 

We had a meal and two breakfasts here and for each we had to sit at high tables which was not very uncomfortable.

It’s a good hotel overall and if they made some tweaks it really could be an exceptional one.",4,2022,11,27
221,"No Air Conditioning, Great Location","This hotel is walking distance to many of the great spots in Dublin. The front desk was courteous. Our room was average, with poorly designed lighting, and even worse ventilation system. Be aware, this hotel does not have air conditioning, which was not advertised when booking. If you like a cool room at night or have allergies, I would look elsewhere. I will most likely book the Westin next time.",3,2022,11,27
221,Excellent central hotel,"This is a beautiful hotel in central Dublin very close to St Stephen's Green. Although on the outside it looks like one of the Georgian buildings in Harcourt Street, inside it is something else. I loved my stay here. My room was relatively large for a European Hotel and had everything I wanted.
I was here on business and loved the speed and ease of getting onto the Internet.
There is a very large restaurant with a first class buffet breakfast.
There was nothing I would want they did not have. 
I will gladly stay here again.",5,2022,11,26
221,"Spotless, great value and fab location","Loved our stay at the Iveagh Garden Hotel. We stayed in the deluxe double room, it was great - spotless, spacious, big TV and free slippers! A mini fridge would be have great but otherwise, no complaints. ",5,2022,11,24
221,Besuch Dublin 17 - 20.11.2022,Noisy superior rooms - Otherwise nicely decorated hotel - Staff was courteous and competent - Location is ok - Price-performance ratio is OK - The overall impression is massively trumped by the noisy rooms.,3,2022,11,23
221,very good choice,"but = duvet a little too small / no ""save the planet "" : - towels were changed everyday  - light around the bathroom mirror was on permanently .
beautiful Xmas decorations and excellent location for tourists .",5,2022,11,23
221,Business trip,"Great location, service was great, room beat my expectations (i was in a city pod). The food was great and well presented. The staff were very accommodating. Even after i had booked out they were happy for me to return later that afternoon and book my taxi for the airport.
Great customers service, thank you",5,2022,11,21
221,Irish Adventures,"Wonderful atmosphere in a quiet, good location for all that Dublin has to offer. Lovely on site restaurant we took advantage of for a late night drink and breakfast. Very friendly staff on arrival, generally all around. ",4,2022,11,19
221,Beautiful hotel but ask for a quiet room at the back!,Hotel is lovely but if you have a room at the front of the hotel - the noise from the street and clubs opposite can be very loud! I would recommend this hotel but definitely ask for a room at the back of the hotel! ,4,2022,11,17
221,A fabulous place to stay in Dublin,The hotel was in a great location for exploring Dublin. Near to pubs for live music.  Rooms comfortable and exceptional customer service.  Staff were amazing and extremely helpful. I would highly recommend thus hotel.,5,2022,11,15
221,High-quality hotel with excellent staff,"Really lovely space with a great staff, and the location cannot be beat.  Just a short walk to St. Stephen's Green and Grafton Street, this is a truly lovely location.
The breakfast is top notch, and I can't say enough about how helpful the staff are.  ",5,2022,11,14
221,Lovely Stay,"Great stay in this hotel. I've stayed here many times with work, but this time it was with my family across multiple rooms for a number of nights. We all had a great stay - modern decor, lovely staff and great location to Grafton Street area. Would recommend staying here! ",5,2022,11,14
221,Iveagh Weekend stay,"Staff were excellent, attentive and very friendly, rooms and showers were great, and probably one of the best coffees in Dublin. Front desk made a plan to check me in earlier due to coming off a long haul flight - this was a real win. ",5,2022,11,14
221,Marcella kelly,This is a gem. Perfect location and price. We just stayed one night but will definitely be back   The hotel is a few minutes walk to city centre.  It  is clean and the bedroom  is a good size with slippers and gown. Water and chocolates in the room when we arrived. Just perfect. We had dinner in the hotel restaurant last night   It was delicious.   I had a vegetarian Thai curry and almond rice for dessert 🥰   Breakfast this morning was perfect. Plenty to choose from.   What made the hotel was the staff. They are all so professional and friendly but more importantly they are so kind and helpful to each other.  5 star staff.   Lovely girl at the reception in the restaurant last night.  She  was pleasant to everyone  we needed water for the room and within a minute she gave us  bottles of water and a jug of milk.   Thank you for making our stay so enjoyable,5,2022,11,10
221,Leonard O'Connor,"We were absolutely thrilled with the quality of the hotel during our stay. The value was excellent for the price we paid, the staff were so nice and the breakfast was unreal. We will definitely be returning for another stay.",5,2022,11,10
221,Eco-credentials aren't sustained.,"I was excited to stay at the Iveagh because of its eco-credentials. Sadly, on arrival, I found these only related to energy consumption - an important component but the hotel could have done much better on other aspects of sustainability. While there was the usual towels on floor to wash option, there was no option not to have linens changed daily (as I've seen in other Dublin hotels) and the shower room toiletries had too much disposable plastic and cleaning staff replaced soaps daily even when they were barely used. Although I had requested a quiet room and had been put at the back, the noise from local nightclubs was unbearably loud on several nights in the 5 days I stayed there. When the rules on opening nightclubs changes from an 02:30 time to all night, I couldn't imagine being able to stomach that level of noise all night. Staff were friendly and room service good. So come with good earplugs and be prepared to close your eyes to eco-shortcomings if you decide to stay.",3,2022,11,09
221,"Overall good hotel, except for the restaurant","Don't go to the hotel restaurant unless you want to be very sick. We had to extend our trip a day because we were so terribly ill. Otherwise, it was a wonderful hotel. The ambience was great, it was quiet, and in a central location and close to Grafton Street. ",5,2022,11,07
221,EXCELLENT CITY CENTRE SEJOURN,"Beautifully decorated hotel in a super location.
Dinner and breakfast delicious.
We were delighted with our room at the back of the hotel as it was very quiet.
The staff were very helpful too. We will be back for sure!",5,2022,11,05
221,An excellent hotel in the perfect location,"I have stated at the Iveagh several times and its location is excellent… but for me it is the kindness , friendliness and the welcome of the staff that always make my stays ‘ outstanding’ … 
Rooms are comfortable and quiet, everywhere is spotless and I always feel ‘ very  welcome’",5,2022,11,03
221,Weekend Stay,Great break in a excellent hotel in a great location. Very friendly staff and very helpful I would recommend hesitation recommending this hotel to family and friends. Only small down side is car parking it’s a little inconvenient ,4,2022,11,03
221,A little luxurious gem,"A recent overnight stay to take in the city. This hotel had been highly recommended by family. Upon entrance, the decor is very charming, relaxing, exuding a sense of unsophisticated luxury. An Italian feel. Opulent. Pops of vibrant yet restful colours. The staff so helpful, friendly, pleasant & courteous. Hilaria in the restaurant was especially so, making the best espresso Martini ever. Bedrooms are small but functional, still & sparkling water in the room, for me, a Nespresso machine would have sealed the deal. Decent sized bathroom, nice rainforest walk-in shower, own branded toiletries. Breakfast was very tasty, no bustle, all very civilised. A great sense of space in a city centre hotel, immaculately clean and great value. Looking forward to a return trip.",5,2022,11,02
221,Should have been better,"The room could have been  lovely, but the air con / heating was broken. Room was roasting.
Not sure how, but a false nail was in our bed. 

Breakfast was poor, luke warm at best. Not what you expect a hotel of this class. Didnt even go to breakfast on our second morning.
",3,2022,11,02
221,Excellent experience,"Great location and charm.  This is a lovely charming old hotel with modern amenities.  Breakfast, dinner and drinks in Elle’s were outstanding.  I will stay here again when I return to Dublin without a doubt.  Highly recommend iveagh garden.  Great value for a city center Dublin hotel.",5,2022,11,01
221,Wonderful Stay,Everyone was friendly and efficient. Highly recommend this hotel. So accommodating especially when our room proved too warm they moved us to a room with air conditioning. The restaurant was very good and the breakfast was exceptional. Would definitely stay here again.,5,2022,10,29
221,Impaccable stay at garden hotel,"This is one of the best hotels i have ever been. excellent service, lovely setting and interieur, breakfast was amazing, very good organised and a wide range of choices. We had very tasty at the restaurant at the hotel (elle’s bar & bistro). Not a single minus point to think of.",5,2022,10,29
221,A good hotel,"A good value, good service, excellent location. I was very pleased overall with the Iveagh Garden Hotel. It was the second hotel I stayed at in Dublin on this trip. I moved from another hotel down the street. The Iveagh was a superior property at approximately  half the price.",5,2022,10,28
221,Extremely good staff,"Everyone from the porters, receptionists, cleaners, restaurant staff.. everyone, were extremely friendly and helpful. Lovely place to stay, close to City Centre, with access to parks just around the corner also.",5,2022,10,27

Staff was very attentive 
Close to restaurants and St Stephen’s Green
Got us in to room earlier/ even called my son to advise 
Had breakfast in hotel restaurant 
Huge selection of food
Very quiet hotel",5,2022,10,24
221,Above & Beyond Staff,"Recently attended my brothers wedding and the staff were exceptional. Front of house, waiting staff, bar staff all went out of their way to ensure my brother and his wife had a wonderful day. Breakfast was nice, would love it to be a bit warmer if possible but none the less very enjoyable. ",5,2022,10,24
221,Wedding guest,"My mother and father got married on Thursday, had the afters of there wedding in the Iveagh garden, the staff were amazing, they were so helpful, the food was incredible, the rooms were lovely, such a great sleep after a busy day. Couldn’t recommend enough ",5,2022,10,24

221,Surprise birthday trip,Loved this hotel for its great location and luxury feel. Perfectly clean and staff were lovely. The breakfast has plenty of options and is good value for money. Unfortunately we never got to sample an evening meal due to time constraints but the setting looked lovely. ,5,2022,10,21
221,Super stay,We really enjoyed our overnight stay. Hotel is in a fantastic location very close to St Stephen’s Green and city centre. Our room was stylish and comfortable and we really enjoyed our stay. I would highly recommend!,5,2022,10,20
221,Sweet and Sour,"We stayed here just for one night last weekend. We were in Dublin attending an afternoon show. We were very impressed with the decor in the hotel lobby area and Elles Restaurant. Dinner was booked ahead and we decided to have a drink in the lobby area beforehand. A good decision as its such a lovely place to sit in the window and watch the world go by. Dinner was perfect helped by the attention of both waitresses  Ilaria and Abi, they are an asset to Elles Restaurant.  
Our room was comfortable and although we were opposite a nightclub on the street we could not hear anything. We had a lovely evening.
Next morning our experience changed, only one bath towel for the two of us and the hairdryer was faulty. My wife was not happy. We headed down to breakfast admittedly not in a good mood. We were asked 'tea or coffee', we chose coffee but got tea. I asked for a tea spoon twice, it didn't arrive. Bacon, Sausage and Egg luke warm on a cold plate from the hot plate serving area. GF toast had to be asked for twice. 
We left and decided to go back to our room put on the kettle for a coffee and watch some TV until check out. The TV had a  scrambled signal so unwatchable and the  kettle was not working.
We decided to check out and get a coffee at the coffee tram on the street outside instead. At check out I asked for the duty manager to calmy register my complaints.
He said he would check these out himself and if I could wait. 
I told him I could not wait and had to leave. I was offered a free drink sometime as a token. I thanked him and informed him I would not be returning for the free drink. 
All I wanted was acknowledgement of their shortcomings and an apology. 
I got that in an email this morning, that is I got the standard appreciation reply for my criticism and how important it is to receive feedback. Also mentioned was if I was ever to return I might give them an opportunity to impress.  The matter is now closed for me. 

",3,2022,10,19
221,"Cracking hotel, probably the best 4* in Dublin City Centre, great rooms and close to all the action","Iveagh is a gorgeous hotel-fresh, new, quite plush and glamorous, very comfortable rooms, with a good breakfast. The location is excellent, very close to Stephen’s Green and many bars and clubs. Despite a room overlooking Harcourt St we weren’t bothered by noise, so you should be fine unless you’re a very light sleeper.
The only disappointment on our stay was the dinner which was very average. Simple things like salads, burgers and chips etc were just…fine, in our view. However there are many far better dinner options easily found just a short walk away. 
In summary, it’s one of the nicest hotels for your money in central Dublin, probably the best non-5 star, and we’ll definitely be back to stay, but eating elsewhere.",4,2022,10,19
221,Overpriced for Premier Inn style accommodation,"Room was like a sauna despite opening window and a little small. Breakfast buffet was also a disappointment. Bar very good though and location perfect. 
The overall experience was average and to add to it all the staff seemed ambivalent to us just like we were a commodity l.",3,2022,10,18
221,Disappointing,"Hotel lacks warmth, the staff at front desk seemed Kurt, other staff seemed friendly. . Our room had a portable air conditioning unit that was loud and cumbersome  The type of room we requested was not available.  It is difficult to park and dropping off luggage was a bit challenging. the positive side it was clean, the lobby attractive with an bar restaurant on site",2,2022,10,16
221,Fam date,"Overall Excellent and memorable... staff are lovely and approachable.. breakfast is perfect. Instagrammable lounge area ;) 
Child friendly place.
We have a wonderful stay together with my husband and son. ",5,2022,10,14
221,Hot room.,"Room did not have a working cooling system.Room was hot. The hotel sent up a fan to cool the room. I didn’t spend $200 a night to sleep in a hot hotel room. Location was good, near St Stephens Green. Breakfast was average.",2,2022,10,13
221,Iveagh Garden Hotel,Stayed here at the start of October for business purposes. Hotel lobby and restaurant is very nice. 5 stars from me. Food was excellent too. Would definitely recommend this hotel to friends when staying in Dublin and very centrally located also. Thank you!,5,2022,10,11
221,First time in Dublin,"First time in Dublin loved the ease of being near St. Stephen’s green. Easily walked around Dublin to see major sites. Near lots of good food, like brother hubbard. We also could walk to Grafton street easily. ",5,2022,10,11
221,Highly recommend!,"Hotel is in an awesome location. Near a beautiful park and by wonderful shopping! The restaurant Elle’s was outstanding. Try their seafood chowder! Nice breakfast buffet as well. Great service, all around!",5,2022,10,10
221,Iveagh Gardens Hotel Review,"Great experience overall. Location in just off Stephen’s green, which mean if you’re a tourist your right beside Grafton street. Luas is just outside if your looking to make those journeys across the keys. 

Lovely hotel. Staff are very professional. Greater upon arrivals and taken care off. Very welcoming. ",5,2022,10,07
221,Wonderful hotel,"We would certainly use this hotel again and have told others about it!  I’m glad I found your ad on the web.  Pure luck in our choice.
Walking to and from the town center was no big deal and we got our chance to walk through St Stephens Green.  Lovely!",5,2022,10,02
221,Sleep Deprivation Hell,"Visited the hotel in June. Was immediately impressed by the decor/look/feel of the hotel, along with the central location.

HOWEVER - be aware! Our room was a furnace! We awoke (not that we slept!!) after the first night to the room being 26 Degrees (note: it was 13 Degrees outside!!!) despite having a fan on and the heating off.

We spoke to Fiona (Manager) who was LOVELY and put arrangements in place for a discount, free drinks etc however we experienced a second night of sleeping with three fans (noisy), windows/curtains open (fresh air) it was still ridiculously hot. When only in Dublin for a short stay, a good nights sleep is imperative but unfortunately this hotel falls dramatically short. We felt as if we were participating in a sleep deprivation experiment!!!

It’s a shame but honestly - I’ve had a better nights sleep in a Travelodge for half the price. Would not return out of choice - shame since I plan on visiting Dublin regularly in the near future.",1,2022,10,01
221,Get married here! ,"This hotel is a gem. My wife and I got married here and have no regrets. It's interior is stunning. Every photo we have is like an art deco masterpiece! As soon as the events team showed us the dining room we fell in love, no other venue was gonna match it. We pushed the hotel on our numbers but man did they help us create a great party. The place was bouncing. The ceremony was on the terrace and on a sunny day there is no better backdrop for a wedding. The staff were exceptional. From Rachel and Rob in events, to the porters, everyone really looked after us and they even came up to our room the next day to wish us well. We stayed in the presidential suite as it's part of the contract and it is exceptional. Opted to stay an extra night. Our guests loved the whole day and we can't wait to come back.",5,2022,09,30
221,Disappointing Stay,"I was excited about staying at this hotel based on reviews, however it’s been extremely disappointing.  First off the AC has been shut off therefore it has been very hot in the rooms.  You have to know to ask for a desktop fan for a little relief.  Another issue is that the street side of the hotel is along a party street meaning that there are drunk people yelling  into the early morning hours, which wouldn’t be a game changer if you didn’t need your windows open for some circulation and air.

The cherry on top is that today the hotel smells like a sewer.  Plumbing issues.  The amount of money spent on this property is not worth it.

I do want to leave with a positive.  The staff has been nothing but nice.",2,2022,09,27
221,Had a contented stay,"Our room was comfortable and quiet, away from the street. The furnishings were pleasant and clean. The staff was always cheerful and helpful. We had several meals in the restaurant during our stay, both breakfast and dinner. The meals were tasty but not exceptional. We walked to attractions within a mile of the hotel and enjoyed the street scenes.",5,2022,09,26
221,Lovely hotel for our Dublin stay,"Nice, boutique style hotel.  Very comfortable, well appointed, and stylish which feels good.  Warm, friendly, and helpful staff who made us feel welcomed.  Good restaurant and bar.  Located close to 2 LUAS tram stops.",5,2022,09,25
221,Strongly recommend,"This is the perfect hotel. The room was very comfortable, breakfast was excellent, it is on a tram line and easy walking to city center, and the staff was friendly and courteous.  The building and common areas are elegant and very clean. We will absolutely stay here again.",5,2022,09,24
221,Overrated Hotel - Just Average,"It’s hard to believe this hotel is categorized as luxury. The only selling points are the friendly and helpful staff and the location is decent. The worst part was the ridiculous temperature of the rooms. There is no AC and the rooms were HOT. Same for the dining area. The rooms themselves were clean, but just average. The bed/pillows weren’t comfortable. The breakfast buffet was decent, but again, just average. I would object less if the hotel wasn’t so pricey or marketed as luxury. There’s better options in Dublin (try The Westbury).",3,2022,09,22
221,Great Hotel!!!!!,"Great location, two blocks to Grafton Street!!!!!  Very nice rooms!  Breakfast was a buffet and had everything you would want. The staff were very friendly and most willing to help carry luggage from and to the bus,  Stunning lobby!!!!!!",5,2022,09,20
221,Loved it!,"The hotel was gorgeous and very comfortable. The location was perfect and within walking distance of everything we needed. Next time we are in Dublin we will definitely stay here again, we loved everything about it!",5,2022,09,19
221,Nice but not for families,"We had a lovely stay at the Iveagh Garden Hotel! 
LUAS line was right outside the hotel - which whilst it is a positive, it can also be a negative. We had car hire (drove around Ireland), with the the hotels car parking being 10 min walk away and not on site. Staff were lovely and the location is great - only 5-7 min walk to Grafton St! One other thing I noticed was they did not have a fridge in the rooms which would have been nice. I would stay here again if I were not travelling with my child.",4,2022,09,15
221,Loved the stay.,We had a nice stay. Clean and people who work there are really nice and helpful! We definitely recommend this hotel to our friends and family. Wish we could have time to try the restaurant but the cheesecake was delicious!,5,2022,09,14
221,"Good location, tiny room, unreliable wifi, rubbish breakfast","This hotel has a great location and the room price was reasonable.  The reception and bar staff are good, the staff at breakfast less so.  The room was tiny.  One light in the bathroom could not be turned off.  The wifi was unreliable and this caused me to miss two business Zoom meetings.  The breakfast was very poor.  The cooked food was cold.  The ingredients used were cheap and low quality.  The coffee was thin and undrinkable.  You have to make your own toast and the toaster had not been set up correctly by the staff.  The information in the room states that breakfast starts at 0630 on weekdays but the staff refused to serve breakfast before 0700.",2,2022,09,12
221,Beautiful property,"Pricey but lovely. Good location near St Stephen’s Green. Room was spacious, clean, and well appointed. Bathroom was spacious, though as with many places, counter space was at a premium. Breakfast buffet was extraordinary- all offerings were excellent (especially the little yogurts.) Staff was very nice and helpful. (We had to race via public transport to the Connolly station at the last minute and the concierge trotted out the door with us to make sure we headed in the correct direction for the bus!)",5,2022,09,09
221,Location!,"This is a great hotel with excellent service. Everyone was very friendly who worked at the hotel. The location was close to everything, but far enough away from the major tourist areas that you got to experience true Dublin. The room and building was well-decorated. Would recommend! ",5,2022,09,05
221,I hope to go back again for another excellent stay in this luxurious hotel.,"I would Highly recommend staying in this hotel.
Excellent service and fabulous decor.
It would suit every ones taste.
I cannot wait to go back .
The room are very comfortable and spacious .
In the morning the Service staff were very quiet on the corridor.",5,2022,09,04
221,Great hotel,"Lovely hotel! Staff were very friendly, our room was light and spacious. We had a evening meal in Elle’s and it was lovely & service was really good, also had the breakfast which had a great selection",5,2022,09,03
221,Wedding Party,"The Iveagh Garden Hotel is an excellent hotel. Professional staff, very clean with modern fixtures in the rooms. A bit on the expensive side, but then, it’s in the heart of Dublin. Breakfast buffet was outstanding   including everything you might want to eat or drink. A memorable experience.",5,2022,09,02
221,Great hotel,Over excellent.  I gave my room an average score only because my city pod room was very warm…but other than that it’s just a great place with excellent staff.  Breakfast was excellent.  The location is close to touristy sites but definitely where locals eat and play.  ,5,2022,08,31
221,Impossible to relax,"Nicely decorated hotel and rooms. Bathrooms are fancy with amenities like rain fall showers.
But if you want to enjoy this you have to be a heavy sleeper. 
Hotel is located in city center and very convenient in this regard. The flip side is that the street is the “nigh club” street downtown. 
Be prepared to hear, coming from almost everywhere, loud music and penetrating basses late in the night. 
Worst rooms are overlooking the street but you are not out of reach in the rooms overlooking the backyard because a restaurant nearby seems to fancy loud concert starting around midnight.
Then in the wee hours of the morning you have the noise made by people leaving bars and nigh-clubs … 
Truly impossible to have a restful night in such conditions. 
Having spent my professional life in big cities hotels, I would say that it is probably my worst experience.
",1,2022,08,30
221,"Dublin, Ireland 2022","The staff at the hotel were incredibly helpful and friendly.  The food was excellent, as was the value for what we received.  Great location, only to be outdone by the restaurant and hotel staff.  We began and ended our Ireland vacation at the Iveagh Garden Hotel and I wouldn't hesitate to do the same on our next visit to Dublin.",5,2022,08,29
221,A night's stay in Iveagh Garden Hotel,Great location with a great restaurant and bar with outside setting area.  Breakfast buffet style with all the traditional Irish Breakfast eats.  Close to downtown and plenty to see within walking distance.  Helpful pleasant staff.   ,5,2022,08,28
221,Modern and central!,Great place to stay if you’re in town! It’s a modern hotel with beautiful and spacious rooms. The rooms are easily accessible. It’s a full service hotel and centrally located near St. Stephen’s Green!,5,2022,08,28
221,Would not recommend,Noise from a night club in the vicinity of the hotel played music until 2 am both nights of our stay. Then the tram started up in the mornings so we barely slept. Too bad because the room & hotel itself were lovely.,2,2022,08,27
221,Room To HOT,"The room was far too hot to sleep in which was very disappointing. We have stayed in the same hotel before but last time it was far better.

However the room was very clean and tidy, Nice food, Nice staff, The room just was not worth 215 Euros   

                     ",1,2022,08,26
221,Perfect stay in Dublin,"Very comfortable and clean rooms. The staff is friendly and the location is perfect. A shortly walk to the City centre and to the Trinity University. The breakfast is changeable with fresh fruit, toast, all componets of full Irish breakfast ",5,2022,08,26
221,A gem in an eclectic area of Dublin.,"I was quite pleased with this establishment. This boutique hotel, although situated on a very lively and eclectic street of downtown Dublin, is remarkably calm. The hotel's interior décor is beautiful, the bar/restaurant is welcoming, and the staff is knowledgeable and friendly. ",5,2022,08,25
221,Perfect Dublin weekend,"Book it, walk around Dublin and take it all in, went to the The Ivy and Nolita for dinner. Drank wonderful cocktails and wine, went to rds horse show. Hotel bar was fab great staff.  Stay here was massive value for money ",5,2022,08,24
221,Charming boutique hotel,First visit to Dublin but not our last. The Iveagh Garden hotel made our stay easy and the location made walking trips to Dublin's highlights and notable restaurants very convenient. Definitely a return destination,5,2022,08,23
221,Nice hotel in a really nice area,"The hotel is pretty good. Location is perfect to walk everywhere and the main stores and restaurants and pubs are very close. The bus from the airport leaves you just 2-3 minutes away from the hotel.

Breakfast is good although not too many options.

Negative points to the installations, our room's ventilation system wasn't working. We were informed that this is common in most rooms at the hotel since it is often cold here, but the week we were there in August was hotter than usual and the blankets were thick and meant for winter times making sleeping quite sweaty. Service was super helpful though providing us with a portable HVAC machine that made our stay so much better!",4,2022,08,23
221,No Air Conditioning,"No air conditioning in the room. Two very loud fans were the replacement which could not be used when sleeping, window could not be opened as the loading bay was outside and extremely noisy. Disappointed as its a beautiful hotel, to not be informed of the room situation but still pay full whack for the most important feature of a room is unacceptable really ",2,2022,08,22
221,Good location for Grafton Street,"We have recently returned from our stay here, beautiful hotel, stayed 2 nights, unfortunately no air conditioning so had to try and sleep with 2  fans in the room to try and cool down.  Great walk in shower and room decorated nicely.  There is an iron and ironing board in room and kettle with tea and coffee but there is no fridge.  The main reception area is really lovely and staff are very polite and accommodating.  ",4,2022,08,19
221,"Great Stay, One Problem","Great location, good restaurant/bar on location.  Used it for several meals. Service was very good in both hotel and restaurant.  Room was very warm and could not be cooled down so sleeping suffered.  Otherwise a great stay.",5,2022,08,18
221,"Very good, glad I stayed","Great hotel, really enjoyed it. Staff were very helpful and really “did me a solid” by getting me in a room as my flight arrival was sillily early. The portable aircon unit in the room was huge as it was a hot one. ",5,2022,08,15
221,A very good hotel in a perfect location,"A very pleasant hotel ideally located close to St. Stephen's Green. Staff all very friendly and helpful. Breakfast and the meals available throughout the day all very good . The nearest car park is a ten minute walk away; very expensive, but the hotel has an arrangement which gets you half-price. Though the room itself was fine, the weather was unusually hot whilst we were there. Inevitably for Ireland, there was no air-conditioning and the window could only be opened for six inches. A couple of fans were provided, but the room was almost air-less. It was  extremely uncomfortable and very difficult to sleep. Given the likely effects of climate change, this is something to which the hotel will have to give serious consideration. Despite this, we very much liked this hotel and would be very happy to stay here again. Finally, don't miss the beautiful Iveagh Gardens that are tucked away and out of sight  just behind the hotel.",5,2022,08,14
221,Iveagh - Beyond expectations,"Iveagh staff make you feel valued and this is a rare quality.  Always there to lend an ear and help.  Fiona in particular at the front of house is someone every hotel in the service industry would want and was absolutely wonderful to my wife in retrieving some lost property.  The hotel is situated so well and close proximity to the Dublin sights, but the staff is what makes the difference.",5,2022,08,11
221,Way beyond!,"We must thank our favourite girl Fiona, the front desk manager who was the biggest instigator of all in making us comfortable. We would also like to thank the general manager, other managers and employees of the Iveagh Garden Hotel that went way above their duties in looking after my partner who had a bad accident at another establishment fracturing a bone in her pelvis and dislocating her left shoulder. We are forever in your debt, thank you all. Much appreciated, Dennis & Heather",5,2022,08,10
221,Absolutely flawless,"The hotel itself is beautifully designed, staff are welcoming and kind. The rooms are so comfortable and in a great location! Truly a brilliant stay for those who want comfort and nearby entertainment",5,2022,08,09
221,Dublin wedding,Absolutely charming Hotel!!  Location was just a 10 minute walk to Grafton Street and the hotel sweet potato fries are the best I’ve had!!  Hotel was very clean and room service was excellent!  Would stay again if I return again!,5,2022,08,08
221,Mr,"Nice hotel in good area.
Twin room small but comfortable.
No air conditioning meant that the room was stifling in the humid conditions  of early August. Fans supplied but insufficient to make significant difference.
Returned to hotel after theatre at 10:30 pm.
No food of any sort and no room service available.
Luckily, a sympathetic staff member took pity onus and rustled up two bowls of soup.",3,2022,08,04
221,"Very central location, good buffet breakfast, nice cocktail, clean new rooms","Walking distance of Grafton St, very central. Requested a quiet room with a window that opened and other than the seagulls, it was nice and quiet! Rooms are newly done up. On the small side but it is Dublin city centre. Buffet breakfast was varied and pretty good. Cocktails were delicious. ",5,2022,08,04
221,Great location and stay,"Exellently located within walking distance of St Stephen Green and Dublin's restaurants / bar scene.
Staff was very accommodating as given the heatwave we requested to be moved to a room with air conditioning (not all of them have one).
Buffet breakfast was great, and the hotel was very clean and comfortable.",4,2022,08,02
221,Classy and friendly,We stayed at Iveagh Garden Hotel before a wedding in the country. We met friends for cocktails and stayed overnight. The bed could have been larger though. I thought we would have a king size bed but I don‘t think room 1103 had a 180 cm large bed. Breakfast was varied and plentiful. The service was very friendly. The hotel is very classy and well situated.,4,2022,08,02
221,Fabulous,"My cousins and I stayed at the Iveagh Garden for three nights. The location is ideal. You can get to any part of Dublin easily from the hotel. In addition, the staff of the hotel is fabulous. The manager at the front desk was extremely professional and friendly.
Restaurant and bar are great. Ask for Jack and you are in for a treat.",5,2022,07,31
221,Dublin trip,"Iveagh Gardens contributed a great deal to our experience while visiting Dublin, thank you for making it so pleasant.   We were especially pleased with the kindness and helpful nature of all the staff we interacted with.  Thanks too for the great breakfasts.",5,2022,07,28
221,Gorgeous hotel,"We stayed here for a friends celebration party. A beautiful hotel, staff very friendly and helpful. Very central location. No onsite parking available  but reduced rate at a local parking block. No drop off zone in front of hotel. ",5,2022,07,26
221,Nice hotel,Good hotel but it was way too warm inside our room. There was no air conditioning in it. Once we changed for a room with air conditioning it was fine. Staff was very helpful. Very nice breakfast. Good location!,4,2022,07,24
221,Poor customer service,"I pre-paid for a bottle of Malbec wine to be left in my sisters room as she was just starting her honeymoon. Upon ringing her, I discovered that there was no wine left in the room. I contacted the hotel - they tried to insist the wine was there and made no apologies whatsoever for their error. Very poor customer service. Not impressed !",1,2022,07,24
221,"Great location, good value and easy walk into Grafton Street","Three girls sharing a family type room. We found that the facilitates were great. The only thing that let our stay down was on one of the days, our room wasn’t serviced. 

The breakfast was fantastic and really good value 
 (£16). Ideal location for walking into Grafton Street (10 mins max and a flat walk). 

We stayed directly opposite the row of bars and we didn’t hear much, so wouldn’t let that put you off. Maybe for young families, ask for a room around the back of the hotel. 

Straight on the tram line, but we didn’t use this and opted for Ubers instead. We didn’t try the restaurant or bar, but looked great quality throughout.",5,2022,07,22
221,Hard work and too hot in summer,"Pretty hotel in a great location with a nice looking room and generally nice floor staff BUT very unusually and unexpected hot hallways and room, confusing advice from staff and website regarding parking and check in, very annoying parking, no free breakfast. I don’t think I could do it again. ",3,2022,07,16

221,Great Stay,We greatly enjoyed our time at Iveagh Garden Hotel. All of the staff were kind and helped answer any questions we had. Our room was spacious and tidy. We would definitely recommend the hotel to anyone traveling to Dublin.,5,2022,07,13
221,Great hotel,"Great location,  the beds were very comfortable and a good size room. The breakfast was great plenty of variety of food. The staff was very friendly, loved the bathroom the shower was big. The cocktail menu was varied which I loved.",5,2022,07,12
221,Very Nice - If it's not hot out,"3.5 stars in the summer / 4.5 stars the rest of the year.

The rooms do not have air conditioning, and while the temperature was nice and cool at night, we only had 1 window that would open and it would only open a small amount.  This made sleep uncomfortable even with the 2 fans they provided. Everything else about the hotel and the staff was wonderful.  

In summary, I would whole heartedly recommend this hotel if you will be there during cooler months, but I don't know that I would return again during the summer.",4,2022,07,12
221,excellent location and very accommodating staff,"We enjoyed our recent stay at Iveagh Garden Hotel very much. The location is ideal, giving its proximity to St. Stephen's Green, the LUAS, Grafton Street, et cetera. Two things of note:   the breakfast on offer is fairly expensive (though very well done!) and since there are a number of nightclubs on Harcourt Street, there is a little bit of noise (not an issue for our party, but others may be slightly bothered). The staff of the hotel could not have been more gracious or helpful - we would absolutely stay here again!",4,2022,07,12
221,Great place to stay!,"This hotel is superior class with an affordable price tag. It was a great location on a relatively quiet street for the Temple Bar area. The lobby and rooms are beautiful, and staff is very accommodating. Easy to walk to St Stephens Green, Grafton Street, Trinity College....",5,2022,07,11
221,Nice hotel,"This is a lovely modern hotel, room was nice and spacious and showers amazing.  Only issue we had was the heat in the room, it was unbearably warm.  Would stay again but probably not in summer time as no air conditioning.",3,2022,07,10
221,Beautiful hotel. Highly recommend!,"Great location. Great service. Room was really nice. One of our 2 rooms was a bit small and tight. But still, we were 1000% happy with our choice. We will return to the Iveagh Garden hotel for sure. You will love it.",5,2022,07,09
221,Absolutely beautiful and fabulous location!,We were upgraded to the suite once Fiona (at reception) discovered we had to get up at 2.30am for a very early flight. What a very kind gesture on her part. The suite was gorgeous and the bed was super comfortable. I wouldn’t think twice about staying there again!,5,2022,07,09
221,"Great hotel, ideally located!","We had a great stay at the hotel. The staff were friendly and it was in an ideal location. Breakfast was good and the rooms were clean. Our only issue was that we were in a heating only room and even with it switched off it was very warm, which made sleeping difficult. Otherwise, we would go back again and recommend it.",5,2022,07,09
221,Property was not helpful,"We left an expensive hat in the room and called the property a couple hours after check out. We explained exactly where it was left in the room. They said it was not yet reported to lost and found and to call back the next day. We called the next day, and a couple more times. The hat was never returned. I would not recommend. Later that week, we stayed at the Dean across the street later and had a much better experience.",2,2022,07,06
221,Beautiful Accomodations,"The Iveagh Garden Hotel King Superior Rooms are beautiful. The bed was amazingly comfortable - one of the nicest hotel beds I've had in a long time. Also came with a single large comforter instead of 2 (European style) and was truly a full-size king bed. The room was spacious and beautifully decorated. I love the old crown molding and details they've kept (or put) in place. 

Super easy access to the Luas tram system and so many things within walking distance. It was a great location and so much quieter than staying up in the Temple Bar area - a quick 5 minute tram ride and I was there and back in my quiet, comfortable room.

There was a VERY loud private event one night in their lower level and they didn't do anything to control the obnoxious music and PA system, despite a phone call - and I can't imagine I'm the only one who called. The floor was vibrating it was that loud. I look at it as a minor blip - the rest of the stay was just great.

I wouldn't recommend the dining though. The turn-around was very prompt but the selection is limited, I never did find a breakfast menu, and the food quality wasn't that great. Go out to some of the fantastic nearby restaurants instead. 

Still a 5-star review simply because the staff were incredibly gracious, the location ideal and the amazing comfort and beauty of the room. Highly recommend.",5,2022,07,05
221,Poor value,This was the mist disappointing stay I have ever had in a hotel . Room was a “POD” and was nothing more then a plank of wood with a thin mattress . Bathroom was adequate but sink was blocked. Nowhere to hang any clothes and it was very noisy ,1,2022,07,05
221,Attractive hotel with friendly and helpful staff in a great location,"I have visited Dublin for many decades and I like to stay near St. Stephen’s Green so I can go walking there.  I looked online and found the Iveagh Garden Hotel attractive and located in the neighborhood I like, and they boasted a kind and helpful staff.  I was going to meet a friend for a holiday so I booked us two rooms.  We were both very happy with the rooms and cleanliness.  Our only concern was the noise level at night from very loud concerts in the neighborhood.  There was also one occasion where I heard loud TV from a neighboring room.  I slept with earplugs every night.  I was a casualty of the Dublin airport chaos at the end of June and I was bumped from my return flight to California!  I immediately called the Iveagh from the airport and they fortunately had a room available for me, so I came back from the airport and stayed another night!  The staff were amazingly kind and helpful to me in my rather stressful situation.  Thank you Iveagh Garden Hotel!!!!",5,2022,07,03
221,Lovely hotel but….,"Lovely hotel and good restaurant. Morning breakfast which was included was very good. Quaint neighborhood about a block or so from St. Stephens Green. The only downfall was we had a room facing the street. When the bars across the street let out, we were woken up every night from the noise and ruckus. ",4,2022,07,03
221,excellent hotel,"We very much enjoyed our experience at the Iveagh gardens Hotel, tastefully furnished, spotlessly clean, very friendly and efficient staff . Breakfast was ok could have been a nicer experience. Overall I would return and highly recommend to all",5,2022,07,03
221,Gorgeous,"Stunning hotel in a lovely location just by St Stephen’s Green. The whole place is beautifully designed, the room was gorgeous and the staff were excellent and couldn’t do enough for us. Highly recommend",5,2022,07,03
221,"Beware this hotel's ""city pod"" rooms.","Beware of the Iveagh Garden Hotel’s “city pods”.  These are hot, largely unfurnished basement cells.  I blame myself for spending two nights in one of these.  I booked late, so didn’t quite grasp what, in exchange for 200-250 euros per night, I was getting.  

The name “city pods” must be intended to make these rooms sound hip and stylish.  Actually, they are tiny, uncomfortable, basement rooms without basic furniture.  They have a bed built into about half the room, a tiny high window at alley-level (this is the only source of light and air and is accessed by standing on the bed), a bathroom built inside the room, and nothing else.  And by nothing, I mean nothing.  These rooms lack:  a closet with normal hangers, a chest of drawers, a desk, a chair, a luggage rack, and facilities for coffee and tea.  They have none of these things.  They also don’t have air conditioning and are (even on a cool June day) hot and stuffy, as the floors are hot to the touch, presumably because the pipes run underneath.  Given that rising heat, one *must* keep the tiny window open, which means the room is noisy well into the night, what with trams, partyers, etc.  I was tempted to just take the duvet and pillows and sleep on the floor in the corridor, which is air-conditioned so probably would have been more comfortable.  In July and August these rooms will be unbearable.  

Is there anything positive here?  Well, there’s a nice guy taking care of bags (it must be demoralizing to work here, so I found his good cheer sort of endearing), and the linens are decent quality.  Oh!  The rooms do have, for some reason beyond fathoming, an ottoman.  If you were furnishing a hotel room, would you decide that the one thing you’d provide would be, not a desk or chair or luggage rack or air conditioning or coffee, but an ottoman?  Weird.  Be warned.  

Staff:  Please don't bother apologizing, as I see  you routinely do.  This is not a problem of bad service.  It is a structural defect:  the rooms are badly constructed on top of hot pipes and lack basic furniture.  You can't remedy that by apologizing.  The hotel owners (not you) are responsible and need to get the workmen in.",1,2022,06,30
221,Dublin trip,"Excellent location walking distance to Grafton street, the staff were fantastic providing a high level of service, excellent food quality and choices, indoor or outdoor seating available.Rooms were very clean and comfortable. Would have no hesitation recommending this hotel",5,2022,06,28
221,People of colour think twice before booking,"Booked a twin deluxe room 4 months in advance for Friday and Saturday night, €477. Worst first: At 1am on Sunday, the front wooden door was closed, we rang the bell, waved at the cctv and side windows, we could see x3 male staff and I am sure they saw us, I phoned the hotel reception twice, but it went to voicemail. After a stressful time my friend got the attention of another guest through the window and she went to reception to ask them to let us in. When my friend tried to complain and asked for a name, the staff member, a big guy, shouted at us, banged his name badge against a screen and said 'complain then see how far it gets you!' We are two petite, older, brown skinned women that had already endured being locked outside our hotel with drunken male revellers from the clubs opposite. I cannot say for certain we were treated badly because of the colour of our skin, so please judge for yourself, here are the other issues: The room had no aircon! It was hot and stuffy, with the windows open we had the noise of clubs opposite, I complained but was told I should have stipulated aircon in the booking, I had just heard the same receptionist be very courteous and pleasant to a white American tourist complaining about toiletries before of me. I noticed there were no other dark skinned guests or dark skinned staff front of house and that staff greeted white guests routinely, but not us. Other things to note: The plumbing was noisy, we heard the toilets flush in the room above and the water gush down in pipes behind our heads at night, we had to ask twice for towels, it was a twin room but there were only towels and toiletries for one. I have written and complained to the manager about what happened on Sunday, he said the bell was broken, whereas the staff at the time said the CCTV was broken, so excuses rather then apologies. Given how serious a complaint, being aggressively shouted at is, I was not offered a satisfactory apology or indeed any form of refund or compensation. Again perhaps if we had been white guests, we would have been offered something, but then this may not have happened to us in the first place.",1,2022,06,27
221,Excellent Room except hot,Everything about the Hotel was excellent except room was very warm due to no Air conditioning in Summertime. Location was fantastic. Breakfast was very good. The hotel did let us in early at 10 am but we arrived at hotel at 8 am. They do allow you to sleep in lobby until room is ready. ,5,2022,06,26
221,Great location…some issues,"This is a lovely hotel, great location and very modern. Room lovely (deluxe twin) great shower and very comfy beds. Room was however stiflingly hot even with fans provided. Breakfast was lovely and plenty of choice. Service so so, slow at reception, there should have been a second member of staff on. Check out was the same with a member of staff standing idle in the lobby while we waited 10 mins to hand over a key card. Totally unnecessary! If you are looking for a residents bar I wouldn’t stay here. Having only booked for one night my sister and I wanted to enjoy the hotel as much as possible so after the concert in 3arena we went straight back to the hotel getting there around 11:45 only to find the bar was closed with no residents bar or room service option. We had only wanted to finish the night off with a drink or two to actually see some of the hotel seeing as the check in time was 4pm. It was a lot to pay to not spend any time there at all.  It was a disappointment to say the least. I don’t know if it was a staffing issue but I would have expected a hotel of this stature to have a bar open until midnight at least. A few gripes but it is a lovely hotel, so quiet too given the location, our room was at the rear. However, I would be hesitant to return with the multitude of choice in Dublin ",4,2022,06,26
221,Daughters shopping break,"I stayed here with my Daughter aged 17 & 13 for a mini shopping / treat break. Our room was very spacious with full facilities of T/C , safe, minibar. The hotel has an understated luxury feel whilst being located right beside main shopping (grafton street)  we had planned dinner in a parallel street ( Dawson Street) so perfect location for that too. 

Breakfast was a fabulous cooked or continental self serve banquet where I was delighted to see smoked salmon and a variety of cheeses as an unexpected level above many other self serve breakfasts.",4,2022,06,26
221,Nice hotel,Excellent hotel. Breakfast disappointing. Great location. Clean modern rooms. Very good value for money.  Walking distance to stephens green and grafton street. Close to Lucas stop. Very convenient location ,5,2022,06,26
221,Perfect.,"Iveagh Garden Hotel is a beautiful property in a residential looking neighborhood.  The reason we chose this hotel was because we wanted something that wasn't in the noisy Temple Bar area but rather something walkable and in a quieter location. 
Iveagh Garden was a perfect fit.   It was very easy to get there from the airport ( just under an hour bus ride).

The hotel is in top condition and very nicely updated.  Chairs a little hard -- but that's really trying to find something to criticize.   The hotel is minutes walk to Grafton Street (fancy shopping), and also minutes from St. Stephen's Green and the area where you can book hop-on/off buses.  Temple Bar area is about a 10 minute walk.

I can't think of any other word than perfect.  Service at this hotel was exceptional.
We travelled with another couple who arrived in Dublin at 5:30 a.m.  went to breakfast and proceeded to the hotel around 7:30 a.m.  Upon arrival at Iveagh Garden  they asked if they could pay for a room for the previous night just to get some sleep.  Iveagh Garden front desk said the hotel was full and they would see what they could do.  We joined our friends around 10:30 a.m. and asked if we would be put in nearby rooms.  At 11:00 a.m. they accommodated us with both requests,  very early check in and also put us in rooms across the hall from each other. 

The front desk service was outstanding.  Including the above, they were very accommodating with the following services:  

Storing our luggage over-time on our last day
Ordering taxis
Giving information about trams, buses and trains
Giving advise where to go out to eat.  

The exceptional service extended to the restaurant staff.  Food was very good  there and desserts and drinks to die for.  

Some tips when staying at this hotel:
 
1 - hop on/off bus includes free Guiness at one of the stops and also 50 percent of at a couple participating restaurants.  We took advantage of both.  Also - we found that we could bargain the price of the bus ticket down about 10 percent.

2 - Front desk recommended Balfes or 31 Lennox for breakfast.  We went to Balfes and had a wonderful breakfast.

3 - Transportation from the Airport to hotel is very convenient.  We took the Dublin Express bus, which several Euros more than the city bus routes.  So a little more expensive, but very convenient. 

4 - Very good location both for public transportation and for many tourist sites. 

You can't go wrong with this one. Happy Travels!",5,2022,06,25
221,Room was warm but otherwise Wonderful experience.,We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. The bed was comfortable and shower was wonderful. Location was centrally located to attractions. Breakfast was an excellent Irish breakfast. The room temperature was warm because their is no air conditioning. We would definitely stay again.,5,2022,06,23
221,Wonderful hotel,In a ideal location this beautiful hotel was perfect for our trip to Dublin. The staff was helpful and kind. Very walkable to the City Centre and St Stephen’s Green park.  I would highly recommend this hotel. ,5,2022,06,22
221,Check in was too late,whilst it was a lovely hotel a short walk from the city centre. it had the luas outside the door.  Check in at 4pm however is too late. We had to get ready for an event in the hotel toilets. This is not satisfactory for a weekend short stay as it interrupted our plans. ,4,2022,06,22
221,Excellent and very nice hotel that is close to city center but still quiet and peaceful.,We stayed here for 4 nights and it was wonderful. The breakfast each morning was great and the service could not be better. It was a perfect place to stay in Dublin. Our room had a balcony that we used daily and the room was very spacious. We had to book last minute so our room was very expensive but we have already said that we will definitely stay here again the next time we are in Dublin.,5,2022,06,17
221,Cold shower start to the day,"Water temp in shower was lukewarm momentarily and changed quickly to cold. No matter what I did, couldn’t get water warm for a shower. Cranky start to the day! Such a pity as it is a lovely hotel in a great location. ",3,2022,06,17
221,"Warm,Inviting,Great Location","I enjoyed the five nights I spent at the hotel.  Decorated with books and flowers, the atmosphere was warm and inviting.  Location was very good.  Short walk to St. Stephens Green and Grafton St to shops and places to eat.  ",5,2022,06,13
221,vacations,"nice locations, nice place, nice personal. I liked my staying there.
the chicken is excellent at the restaurant, coktail are good. 
my room was clean and confortable. also nice restaurants on the same street. The center is 2 ninutes walking.",5,2022,06,13
221,Lovely hotel with great staff in a perfect location,"We stayed one night, the room was perfect,  the windows had a second layer that could be pulled down and it acted to sound proof the room so that despite the nightclub across the road, we slept soundly. Also there was air con. Staff were warm and friendly. We ate dinner in the outdoor seating area and the food was very good as were the cocktails.  Breakfast was also excellent. ",5,2022,06,10
221,Great overall experience!,"Amazing staff, friendly service, great food, great aesthestics and atmosphere! 

The staff was more than accommodating with our luggage storage as our flight landed earlier than our check-in time. This helped us explore the city without worrying about our luggage.

Highly recommend as it is central / walking distance to all of the Dublin attractions.",5,2022,06,10
221,Great hotel,Excellent staff room comfortable excellent food I stay here all the time. I have recommended it to friends they have stayed here many times. I wished they continued to do the deal with breakfast and dinner that was amazing. ,5,2022,06,09
221,"Overpriced, loud, poor service","This hotel was way over priced. Service wasn’t that great either, people weren’t too friendly. And it’s in a neighborhood that has a bunch of clubs, so it was insanely loud all night loud, we stayed on a Sunday. Would not recommend.",2,2022,06,08
221,Beautiful Hotel Super Location,"The hotel is beautiful and in such a great location for both Business and pleasure. 
The staff exceptionally attentive if not slightly rushed off their feet, Food in the hotel excellent plentiful and tasty ",4,2022,06,08

221,Friends stay,"First time staying in this hotel and we were very impressed. Modern and clean, we had a triple room for 3 of us girls and plenty of space including the bathroom! Really good location on Harcourt Street so situated within walking distance to many of the main central areas and for those times you didn’t fancy walking the LUAS stop is only up the street. The staff were very friendly and welcoming. Would definitely recommend to stay here again. ",5,2022,06,07
221,"Great location, close to St Stephen's Green and Grafton Street","Friendly, welcoming and efficient staff.  Classic and luxurious decor in dining room and restaurant/bar.  Breakfast buffet is very generous, with full continental items plus hot items to order.  Our room was small and the view so-so, but the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was modern (shower only, so ask if you want a bathtub).  The only off thing was all of the fake flowers in the restaurant.  ",4,2022,06,06
221,Drunk and rude staff,"We stayed here the night we got married expecting a 4 star experience.

The night porter was clearly drunk, slurring his words, was rude to my wife and had no idea where our luggage was. Told us he started at 11pm and no one told him so can’t help us. 

Rooms were ok but after an experience like that I would never stay there again",1,2022,06,06
221,Nice hotel in a great location,"We enjoyed our stay.  The staff were excellent, as was the location, very close to St Stephen's Green and central Dublin.  The only slight downside was that our street facing room was across the road from several nightclubs, and the revellers kept us awake in the middle of the night, despite our closing the window and double glazing...",4,2022,06,06
221,highly recommended,"We felt very comfortable. The entire staff (front desk, restaurant, room service) was very courteous and nice. We ate lunch and the quality of the food was excellent. The breakfast was very good - everything from fruit, cereal, toast, cheese, sausage, sweets.....and more. The hotel is very clean and fairly new and furnished to a high standard. Above all, we found it very pleasant that we didn't hear any noise from the street. In front of the house there is a tram and quite a lot of cars. No noise could be heard thanks to the double windows. We would love to come back here.",5,2022,06,04
221,Disappointing & absolutely roasting hot.,"This hotel is absolutely boiling inside. They have heat in the room but no aircon. Opening the windows let’s in the noise from the street but you have to or else you’ll get no sleep at all. I noticed as I walked along the corridor that all the rooms had a fan of some sort. We asked for one & got it but we weren’t offered when clearly EVERYONE was struggling with the heat. It was not hot outside. The hotel is lovely looking with great decor & style but no substance. The interactions I had with the staff left me at best cold and at worst disappointed. The kids serving in the restaurant don’t seem to have much of an idea, there is a lack of direction for them, the inevitable nonsense with tea & coffee, then having to ask for milk  etc, one of the girls was positively surly when I pointed out the cup was dirty. She didn’t seem like she wanted to be there. The food was very good but the service was non existent. The front desk don’t seems to have any local knowledge and little interest in helping, when we asked directions to a certain bus stop the woman gave scant info which turned out to be lacking in the important bits which we ended up working out for ourself. She made no effort to help at all. The hairdryer was missing it’s guard and caught my hair in it. This may  all sound a little petty but at €640 for 2 nights I expected much better. Would not recommend and would not return.",2,2022,06,03
221,Staff are exceptional,"We had a great stay in large part because of the efforts of the staff. Everyone we dealt with, especially Fiona at reception, were exceptional. 

The rooms are clean and modern. Beautiful ensuite bathroom with spacious showers. 

Because of the streetcar tracks in front, the  location is slightly tricky for arriving in a car, but the hotel is a short walk from many wonderful restaurants and bars, and is a good base for exploring Dublin. ",5,2022,06,03
221,Great hotel central Dublin,Stayed here recently for a work trip. The hotel is central and close by St. Stephens Green. Though close to lots of nightlife I never heard any noise on the street. The hotel was kind enough to get me a room early after an overnight flight. Breakfast was very good. Can't go wrong.,4,2022,06,02
221,Good Value,"Great location; service was as expected; rooms clean and well apportioned. I haver stayed at the best hotels on and near St. Stephen's Green and this hotel ranks equal with them for location, room size and breakfast food service.  The front desk service was prompt and helpful.  I picked this based on reviews and location.  We were not disappointed.",5,2022,06,01
221,`Great Hotel Great Service,"I loved the Iveagh and would come back many times.  it's a prefect location, close to everything but not right in the middle of it all.  I had a room at the front on the street, they're beautiful and are in the older more ornate part of the hotel.  Fully remodeled and the windows are new and well insulated. There is a club across the way that when it lets out I woke up, but my partner didn't.  Guess I'm a lighter sleeper.  It really isn't loud, but just loud enough for me, I drifted back off easily.  The staff were gracious and later in our stay we moved to a room at the back and it was perfect, smaller but perfect. Would highly recommend the Iveagh and if your a heavier sleeper the rooms at the front are the best!",5,2022,05,30
221,Fantastic Easter Trip,"Booked this hotel because of the location and the good price. Polite staff and we may received the best room of the whole hotel. Room 4126 is spacious, located at the end of the hallway but close to stairs with nice views towards the garden (therefore exceptionally quiet). The Queen-size bed was very comfy. There was even a small patio attached to the room and with this patio window door the whole room felt very bright.
Breakfast was good too and reasonably priced.
Overall we'd definitely recommend this hotel and would stay there again.",5,2022,05,29
221,Hot and noisy,"When we arrived our room was about 85 degrees, even tho it was cool out side, no AC in the room.  The location was good but incredibly loud as there is 3 night clubs near by.  Also the hotel had a wedding one night which had a very loud band playing until 3am, with the combination of heat and open windows, it was impossible to sleep.  The beds were comfortable but no fridge in the room.  At €350+/night this is not the experience I would expect.  Staff seemed mostly new and not very knowledgeable about the area.  ",2,2022,05,27
221,Disappointing stay,"Parking was not subsidized and was inconveniently located. I asked for a refund of 9 euros and provided a copy of my receipt.  It was denied. Whatever happened was my fault, not the hotel’s. Very disappointing customer service. 
The lobby also smelled strongly of cigarette smoke. ",2,2022,05,26
221,Wonderful Wedding Experience,"We chose the Iveagh Garden Hotel to hold our wedding reception & it was absolutely amazing, 

Firstly the hotel has a elegant but with modern charm to it that fit perfectly to our black tie wedding, A a bit of a Gatsby feel to it ,
It is  also in a prime location just a brisk 2 minute walk to Stephens Green in the heart of Dublin City 

Arrival drinks & nibbles where had in  Elle's bar & bistro which went down a treat with all our guest , then it was down stair to Iveagh Suite for Dinner followed by live music & dancing, 

The food was fantastic & the staff where absolutely brilliant through out the whole day,  

A big thanks to the staff & management team who made such it such enjoyable occasion for all 100 guest , 

The Presidential Suite was large & stylishly furnished with the biggest balcony's iv personally seen in a Dublin City Hotel , 

Myself & my wife look forward to returning in the future, 

Thanks again for everything 

Kind Regards

221,Weekend city break,"Last min city break from London. Gorgeous hotel in a great location for access to central Dublin, restaurants, entertainment and transport. Lovely staff, great bar and service just a tad too warm in our room although it was very spacious.
30min drive to airport which was good even in peak time",4,2022,05,26
221,"Great location and room, but some room for improvement","Overall, our stay here was very nice, and the room was very pleasant.  The location of the hotel is great; however, the street is one way and on a tram line; therefore, there is no place for luggage and passenger dropoff and pickup in front of the hotel.  I'm not sure what the hotel could do about this (or the noise all night in the area one night), but it is inconvenient.  Also, the reception in general is poorly run.  We were told two different things about our rooms being ready.  Also, the service was slow.  I was asked to provide a credit card when I checked in.  Almost ten days later a large sum is still pending (not for the room; this was another charge).  My last time to stay here.",3,2022,05,25
221,not happy with the Iveagh Garden Hotel,"It is May and quite cool outside. Its been cool, in the 50s (f) for days, but inexplicably my room is more than 77 degrees (f). The staff gave me a portable fan but the windows open only a crack and the hotel staff tells me they are full and so can't change my room. The hotel is well located, clean, and updated and the staff is pleasant but overwhelmed. This is not acceptable in a four star hotel.",2,2022,05,23

Staff all friendly and welcoming.  The food in Elle's Bistro was delicious - lovely buffet breakfast with plenty of choice.  Fruit, cereals, danish pastries, full cooked options, toast, soda bread.  The food in the bistro at night was also delicious.  Would definitely recommend and look forward to the opportunity to return.",5,2022,05,23
221,Not a 4 Star Experience!,"We were not allowed to check in until 4 o clock, by then there was a large queue, with no apology.The room was quite small and the air conditioning did not work so it was stuffy. The noise at night was just unbearable, if I could have gone home I would have. I never slept a wink. The breakfast the next morning was poor, and cold. The service was terrible, we had one jug of milk between 2 tables. Check out was much the same, I was waiting to be asked how my stay was but unfortunately that did not happen",1,2022,05,23
221,Great night in Dublin,We were going to a gig so this was perfect. Hotel is gorgeous and the staff are always so nice and friendly. Breakfast was lovely. Location was perfect and everything is within walking distance. Will definitely be back!,5,2022,05,21
221,Lovely staff,"My husband & I stayed here for two nights of our honeymoon. We had had a very stressful morning prior to arriving to the Iveagh Garden & they went above & beyond by accommodating us with a room upgrade. We were so appreciative & totally recommend staying here! Also a fun location in a ""posh"" area of the city.",5,2022,05,19
221,Iveagh Garden Hotel Dublin,Excellent quiet hotel near St Stephens Green minutes away from the centre of Dublin by Tram or a leisurely walk. Breakfast excellent.  Staff very helpful. We also booked into the restaurant one evening and there was plenty of choice on the menu and it ws well presented.,5,2022,05,19
221,Amazing stay at Iveagh Garden Hotel!,"I booked this hotel for a surprise weekend away in Dublin for my partners birthday. The hotel was beautiful and spotless! Fiona the manager was so lovely and made our stay feel so personal, she arranged for a birthday card with complimentary local cafe chocolates in the room and remembered us when we were checking out. Couldn’t recommend enough! The public St Iveagh Gardens we’re amazing so peaceful with history to look and read about throughout the grounds! The hotel was located  in a lovely spot and not far from the town centre. There was a staff member in the hotel who would help you book taxis and had great knowledge of Dublin to help us and recommend places (feel really bad to not remember his name as he was lovely).",5,2022,05,19
221,Superb stay,"Faultless one night stay, top marks all round, especially for the wonderful staff. My first visit, definitely will not be the last. I will be recommending to all friends and colleagues coming to visit Dublin.",5,2022,05,18
221,We’ll be back!!,"A beautiful hotel with a homely feel right in the heart of the city.    Ticks all the boxes.   Comfortable, friendly, elegant, warm, great staff, lovely food.   Ideal location for a city break.   Street feels safe and Luas is close by.   ",5,2022,05,17
221,"Good for cocktails, could improve on their Afternoon Tea.","I like the foyer for cocktails, it's spacious & comfortable & they have a nice selection on the menu, (though they don't make any off the set cocktail menu).  It's a stylish interior with some nice nice light fittings & decent toilets on the floor below.
I got my sister a voucher for Afternoon Tea here & she was a bit disappointed with it.  The sandwiches had that ""been made for a while now & not so fresh"" look to them.  She & her daughter had to ask for napkins & ultimately didn't feel the selection or value was as good as other hotels they'd been to for Afternoon Tea.",4,2022,05,16
221,Dublin digs,"Very modern and clean. Great location. Nice area. Unloading bags and parking are not ideal, but manageable. Restaurant was pretty good. Iveagh Garden is a nice place to walk and relax. Would definitely stay there again.",5,2022,05,15
221,Lovely Dublin Visit,"Arrived to a welcoming staff, clean room and bottled water.  Staff was helpful in offering suggestions and helping us print COVID test results.  The location is very walkable to many sites.  I would recommend this hotel to friends. ",5,2022,05,15
221,Nice hotel,"Location was great (near the city center, accesibile by tram), the hotel itself and the room were clean. Breakfast might be improved (fresh vegetables and fresh breads should be added as the toast is not to everyone's taste). ",4,2022,05,15
221,2 night stay at the Iveagh Garden Hotel,"We enjoyed this smaller boutique hotel located on Harcourt Street , a ‘stone’s throw’ from St.Stephen’s Green. Location was excellent - walking distance to Grafton Street for shopping, also to the. Action al Gallery as well as many restaurants and bars that we used to frequent in our college days. Service was excellent - from greeting at reception to the bar / restaurant staff. Luas transportation is located very close to the hotel if you are not a ‘walker’. ",5,2022,05,14
221,Terrific stay,"Highly recommend this hotel. We stayed here at the beginning & end of our trip and both rooms were attractive, spacious and very clean. Hotel staff was friendly and helpful. Location was very convenient to Grafton St/Trinity College and very walkable to other sites. ",5,2022,05,14
221,Overall disappointing. Lack of Staff and No  real air conditioning.,"Overall disappointing. 

As you can't really stop outside Hotel I would expect some guidance in advance for those arriving by Car. Also no one available to help with bags.

Hotel looks great in public areas but obviously has an issue with a lack of trained staff. Many we came in to contact with were obviously struggling with language and many not suited to the industry.

We booked a room we thought had air-conditioning we wouldn't book one without ( says air conditioning on Web site) only to find the basic room comes with a fan and a window that bearly opens not air conditioning.

The superior rooms do have air cooling and eventually moved to one with no help from the young lady who over saw the move. She watched us struggling with our cases didn't offer any help then disappeared before we got to our new room. 

At 3.30pm our new superior room temp was 24 degrees by 8 am next morning 22. That is not air conditioning. We used a fan to make it bearable.

Bar food was ok sent back sliders as they were cold. Bar noisy.

Tried charging food and drink to our room but apparently we didn't have credit so had to go to front desk. This happened 4 times!

Fiona was the only person who knows what's going on and trys to fix things but she was fighting a losing battle but thank you for trying.

Late at night the area is noisy as hotel opposite a few night clubs. 

I don't often write negative reviews but I found this hotel to be a mistake it really isn't what it should be and we wouldn't visit again or recommend.",2,2022,05,13
221,Beautiful place ruined by one poor acting chef,The only issue I had was a mistake made on my steak order. I asked for it medium well done and it medium rare. I believed this could have been easily rectified but was left appalled to hear the chef making disparaging remarks about me. I do have a problem saying my r's so I would have spoken quietly to the waitress so I can understand a mistake but to hear the chef speak ill of me and the staff was off putting to say the very least. I did voice my displeasure at the time to the hostess who was wonderful. But when asked about my stay its always the first thing I have mentioned with overshadows the wonderful other staff,4,2022,05,11
221,Birthday Trip,"Can’t fault the hotel staff or location of the hotel cleanliness was also great. Only downfall is we our room for almost £600 didn’t have a mini fridge to store water and our room was 27 degrees with the windows open the most they could offer was a fan, for a budget hotel I wouldn’t of minded but it was expensive to not have AirCon or an alternative room as it was difficult to sleep that sadly let the stay down slightly. If your thinking of booking especially in summer request a room with aircon if possible ",3,2022,05,11
221,"Good, beautiful hotel. Lacking amenities","Beautiful hotel, great location. No AC in our room, it was very hot and we were told to just open the window (which meant it was quite noisy from some local nightlife) and to use the portable fan in the room. No scale available for guest use to weigh suitcases before flying either. Would expect these from a high end hotel in Dublin city centre.",3,2022,05,11
221,Gorgeous hotel & great location,Stayed with friends and very impressed overall. Rooms were gorgeous and staff very friendly. Lovely bar to have drinks/food in. Great location and right beside luas. Would definitely stay again and highly recommend to anyone wanting to stay in city centre ,4,2022,05,11
221,"Great location, spacious room size, amazing staff","As a family we booked 2 rooms for 8 nights, and loved our stay at the hotel. The location is great, the rooms are spacious (in particular for Dublin standard!) and very clean, the staff were super helpful & funny, the inhouse restaurant and bar was also great. The daily provided glass bottles of water were appreciated. We definitely come back to the hotel.

We were only slightly irritated that there was no fridge in the room, and no room service was available. I tried to keep a fresh orange juice over night in the room for the morning, but as the rooms were so warm it was gone off by the time I wanted to drink it at 7 am. 
There is an option to order food & drinks from the restaurant, but the delivery charge is an additional EUR 8 which is in my opinion is little overpriced to only order a soft drink or juice to the room - taking into consideration that you cannot keep a juice fresh overnight in the room due to the room temperature. 
And the rooms were very warm (an average of 25 - 26 Degrees Celsius, whilst the outside temperature was an average of 10-12 Degrees). The AC unit only works when a key card is plugged in (which is obviously not the case if you leave the room with your key card). Even with the AC setting of 17 degrees and the highest fan setting, the rooms only cooled down to 23.5 Degrees, but the bathrooms remained uncomfortably warm. We asked the hotel staff to adjust the heating and a technician came immediately. But there was not a lot what could have been done except using the AC unit. 

And last but not least, I hope to see a more 'sustainable' way to provide bathroom amenities for our next stay. Shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, body wash etc. was provided daily, but in very small plastic bottles. Between our 2 rooms for 8 nights we have used over 50 small plastic bottles (!!!). Furthermore (due to covid??) our hand soap bar was replaced daily (wrapped in plastic), although we easily could have used the soap bar for multiple days. 
I personally would welcome big dispensers filled with shampoo, and conditioner and body wash etc. fixed to the wall inside the shower. 

But this did not ruin our stay at all, and we look forward to returning back to the Iveagh Garden for our next trip to Dublin. 

Thanks to the staff who made our stay very pleasant! ",5,2022,05,10
221,This place is gorgeous!,The staff is lovely. Excellent bar with good selection and great bartenders. Interior decorating is updated and has a fabulous art-deco feel to it.- just love the lobby. Great shower too. I sincerely hope I get to stay there again.,5,2022,05,09
221,Convenient,"Good value, great location.  Checkin was easy and room was good quality..  only issue was on ground floor so quite noisy outside at stages of the night. Would definitely recommend for comfort, convenience and location. ",4,2022,05,07
221,Perfect for a couple going for a night out,"Really nice and clean hotel, staff we're lovely especially Fiona who was at the front desk when we arrived, she gave us a free room upgrade and some free drink vouchers to be used in the bar to celebrate our anniversary. Will definitely be staying again!",5,2022,05,05
221,Nice hotel.,"This was a lovely hotel that had everything we needed for a nice, comfortable stay in Dublin. The room was spacious, the bathroom up to date with great shower. Overall just a really comfortable stay. Perfect for our trip.",4,2022,05,04
221,Great combination of comfort and location,"Centrally located and within walking distance of virtually every point of interest in the city. Very comfortable and spacious rooms. The shower was especially nice, with plenty of water pressure. Really enjoyed the outdoor patio for tea, cocktails and snacks.",5,2022,05,03
221,Do NOT stay in the City Pods!!! I did not heed the warnings and I regret it!,"Pretty hotel and good location, but the City Pods are an absolute scam. DO NOT STAY HERE! I read the reviews and thought it would be fine....it was not. I stayed in early May when the temp outside was 52 to 62 F, but the temp overnight in my room was 83 F. The room is small and cute and may otherwise be a good value, but who cares if you can't sleep. The only window you can open for air flow has no shade, is at street level in a busy alley, and looks directly onto your bed. As a solo female I did not feel comfortable leaving this open overnight. To compensate you are given one tiny rickety desk fan that does absolutely nothing except make a lot of noise. I would never recommend staying here under any circumstances, but I can't even imagine it in any warmer weather.",1,2022,05,03
221,Nice location,"In the room I stayed in, there was a constant low noise from outside the room, the ventilation ducts from the restaurant or kitchen running close by, I had to  sleep with earplugs1
Location was good. Breakfast was buffet, all was there for a full Irish breakfast. ",3,2022,05,02
221,Graduation and buffalo wings,I booked the Iveagh for my mum and I to stay in for my graduation. Our stay was wonderful! The room was clean and the decor was fabulous! The heat in the rooms for us personally was a little much to bare and therefore our sleep wasn’t the best but the breakfast the next day certainly more than enough to put a spring in our step! The staff truly brightened our day! And the dinner we had both nights of our stay - including my graduation was more than delicious! I’m still craving about the buffalo wings and the chicken!! Will be recommending the hotel and Elles bistro to everyone! Having worked in a hotel myself I must say this hotel by far is my favourite and can’t wait for an excuse to come back!! ,5,2022,05,01
221,Fantastic hotel,"The location was perfect for all of our wanderings.  The receptionist at check-in was so pleasant to our jet-lagged selves, and recommended Devitt's for lunch.  It was just 2 minutes away on Camden Street, which is chock full of pubs and restaurants.  That also turned out to be an excellent place for a few pints and to hear live music, later that evening.

The hotel is beautifully clean and well appointed.  The bed was super comfortable, and the room was very quiet.  There are plenty of fluffy, fresh towels.  The breakfast buffet was very comprehensive, and all the food was tasty.  There were tons of service staff to clear plates and pour coffee/tea.  If we return to Dublin, we'll definitely stay here again!",5,2022,05,01
221,Excellent in every aspect.,"The service, facilities, location and cleanliness were superb. I cannot fault the hotel and I look forward to returning.  Excellent value for money and congratulations to the Hotel team for getting things so right!",5,2022,04,30
221,Excellent,"The receptionist was very welcoming and helpful she was so nice an accommodating nothing was too much trouble at all for her.  She was excellent! The hotel was very clean and inviting, the food and service was very good.",5,2022,04,27
221,Mr Morner,"All in all good but, received a handicap room and i am not handicapped? Meaning that the basin was extremely low.
No help with booking guide, and also no real interest to recommend a restaurant. Not part of service?",4,2022,04,27
221,Super hotel,"A very pleasant stay in a particularly nice central location. There was a lovely quiet yet atmospheric feel to the hotel. The staff were respectful, and without airs and graces. Lovely fresh breakfast. Hope to return soon!",5,2022,04,25

Rooms were a bit stuffy in the night but not overly. Shower was great. 
………………………………. 200 word min ",4,2022,04,22
221,Bad breakfast experience,"The team is not welcoming at all and asks you to pay extra for a hot drink when you have already paid 10€ for breakfast. If you don't want to be upset in the morning during your stay, stay away from this hotel.",1,2022,04,21
221,Beautiful Hotel with fantastic staff!,"We stayed here for a long weekend at the end of March 2022. I cannot fault this hotel. The rooms were spotless, staff were very courteous and always willing to help. The hotel itself is in the perfect location to explore Dublin and is very close to the University, shops, restaurants and local pubs. I would not hesitate in staying here again and would definitely recommend it to everyone looking for a break in this wonderful city.",5,2022,04,21
221,Fantastic stay,"Only home from  great stay in this hotel 
From the entrance this hotel just feels good 
Friendly staff great location lovely rooms and really nice bar and cocktails

221,Afternoon tea,"What an fabulous hotel, I booked afternoon tea for a friends birthday and we were not disappointed. The hotel itself is a beautiful tranquil spot nestled away from the hustle and bustle of Stephen’s Green. 

The food was delicious and fresh. The table setting was very pretty and the staff were so friendly. 

My only suggestion would be to expand the gluten free menu:",5,2022,04,19
221,Excellent,"Luxus in a cosy atmosphere for an affordable price . Great location too . Yes we are fan . For several years we visit Dublin a couple times a year and we always stay in Iveagh Garden Hotel , we can’t but recommend it .",5,2022,04,18
221,"Comfortable and convenient hotel, be prepared for night-time noise","Staff at the hotel were polite and friendly at all times and our room was comfortable with no luxury spared - gowns, slippers etc.  All cleaned to a high standard.  We ate in the hotel a couple of times and the food quality was good and not too expensive.

The only downside of this hotel is the fact that it is situated opposite a number of night clubs which, when everyone leaves in the early hours, creates a lot of noise.  You fall back to sleep and then the trams start at 6 am!

However, all in all we had a good stay and would return.  St Stephen's Green is a great area to stay in terms of convenience to a number of shops, restaurants and tourist attractions.",4,2022,04,17
221,Nice hotel near city centrr,It was a family trip to attend a ceremony stayed in Dublin two night in total. Nice restaurant close by . Traveled to Belfast and Londonderry . Weather was very nice. The room had no view and was very close to the street so had to wake up from early morning ,4,2022,04,16
221,Loved it!,"This hotel is beautiful, modern, and clean, with a very welcoming and helpful staff. The breakfast was also tasty. The only downside is if you are renting a car, you need to find a place to park. It’s a very central location, though!",4,2022,04,15
221,Wouldn’t recommend restaurant,"The hotel itself was lovely the staff the rooms everything was great however we had issue with the restaurant Elle’s within the hotel, were made to feel very uncomfortable got dirty looks even caught the manager talking about us to another member of staff she also continued to roll her eyes at us while we left the restaurant, after we left she  chased behind us thinking we didn’t pay even tho we had it included in the package we payed for we had spoken with with our waitress and shown her the vouchers given by the hotel, overall the experience was great at the hotel but the restaurant experience did ruin our night",3,2022,04,13
221,Fabulous stay,"Stunning hotel, luxurious, warm and welcoming.

221,Lovely Hotel,"The hotel is gorgeous, very high end feel with affordable rooms, food and drinks. The staff are extremely helpful and friendly, always willing to give advice. The location is central enough to walk most places, but out of the way enough for it to be quiet and have a feeling of safety.

The hotel was always clean, tidy and very decadent, with nice rooms, lovely bathrooms and a comfy bed. 

Good variety at breakfast and really well cooked with plenty of availability. For dinner, ensure you book in advance to avoid disappointment.",5,2022,04,05
221,Beautiful & green,"If you are looking for a nice hotel to explore the city centre of Dublin, the Iveagh Garden Hotel is a great option. This hotel is not only located a mere 5 min walk from St. Stephen's Green, but it also runs on green energy, has super friendly staff and the decor will take your breath away. Highly recommended!",5,2022,04,05
221,Green hotel with green staff,Either inexperienced staff in hospitality or could care less. Requests for information? Essentially Be prepared for reply to google it Room clean and comfortable but lighting is so dim one can not read in there.  Cabs are readily available out the door. Nice park behind hotel for morning walks. Safe neighborhood close to most things I was interested in but I’d not stay there again based on my unresponsive staff.,2,2022,04,05
221,Highly recommended,"Very well located for central district. Hotel room clean, well appointed with comfortable bed and shower. More than adequate space. Reception staff knowledgeable and efficient. Staff communicate effectively when booking with an immediate email response. Although i arrived late, shortly after the kitchen closed, the staff made an attempt to provide a most enjoyable bowl of soup. Water supplied in the bedroom daily. Small things make a difference.",5,2022,04,05
221,Good experience,"Value for money , great location , very clean , the breakfast was really nice and fresh, lots of options. Price was high, but with the location I think its ok. Will definitely recommend after a night out. ",4,2022,04,05

221,Perfect Stay!,"We reserved the Iveagh Garden Hotel because of its location, it was much more than that.
The hotel has a very pleasant space at the reception. Our room was comfortable for the three of us, husband, adult son and myself.
On Saturday night we had drinks at the bar and dinner at the restaurant, good music and nice ambiance, we had a great time.
The staff was very friendly and helpful in all hotel services.
We did not mind some noise from the street so we loved our stay. We would definitely recommend it.",5,2022,04,01
221,Great value for money!,"This is my third time staying there! Great location, lovely restaurant! The hotel is very central and easy to get to! Love that they have a dyson in the room which is great for the summer season! Would definitely be back✨

Only a few mins walk from Opium, Little pyg & cafe en Seine 🥂",5,2022,03,31
221,Lovely decor,"Nice stay. A bit far from the Temple bar area. A well known nightclub just a cross the street. Hotel from 2018 and lovely decor inside. The wndows can only open 20 cm in the room but aircondition can be activated

221,Great Hotel/Experience,"The Location is fantastic and the breakfast was excellent.

221,Accidental Find,"We were let down in a huge way by our original hotel and were very lucky to find an available room at such short notice on St. Patrick's weekend. On listening to our plight, Fiona the Front of House Manager made sure that we could check in early and get to the rugby in team - this was such a help. Fiona herself was ever present and visible in the foyer and the restaurant throughout the evening and the following morning. To make matters worse, our flight home was cancelled the following day and on hearing about that, she couldn't have been more accomodating....and genuine. She's a real credit to Iveagh Gardens and we recommend the place just for her ! In saying that though, the hotel is beautiful and clean. Great room, very comfy bed and the breakfast is right on the money - which is a good job as I didn't eat for 8 hours after it due to our flight issues!!",5,2022,03,22
221,A night away with friends,Hotel is in a great location. Rooms were lovely. Door man was very friendly and ordered us a taxi. Bar and restaurant had a great atmosphere and the cocktails were fab. Comfortable bed.would recommend to friends,5,2022,03,18
221,Couple getaway,"Iveagh garden hotel was just lovely. 
The staff are super friendly and welcoming. Our room was ready when we arrived at 11am which was wonderful. The room was very clean, spacious and comfortable. The hotel is right in the centre of it all and within walking distance to all the bars, shops, park etc. 
we had a fabulous stay and would highly recommend. ",5,2022,03,16
221,"good stay, comfy beds and quiet rooms","Staff is very friendly, rooms are nice with comfy beds and a rather spaceous bathroom (no tub though, but a large shower cabin). I cannot recommend to have breakfast in the hotel, a better one is probably available in a café or bar nearby. ",4,2022,03,14
221,Awesome hotel,"Excellent service, excellent food and excellent hospitality. The Iveagh Garden hotel is perfectly located with easy access to Grafton street and city centre whether by foot or tram. We would definitely recommend this hotel and will definitely return very soon. ",5,2022,03,14
221,The place to stay in Dublin,"The whole experience of staying at your hotel is to say the least very pleasant and enjoyable, it is my go to place in 2022 for any visits to Dublin. A closer car park would be an advantage but arrangement with St Stephens Green works well and is fair price.",5,2022,03,14
221,Peaceful and clean hotel out of the action,"This is a beautiful hotel in a lovely area. We only stayed for one night but it was incredibly comfortable and clean. It’s not in the center of all the action, but that means it’s very peaceful as compared to other areas. I would certainly recommend.",5,2022,03,13
221,Wedding in the Iveagh,We had out wedding reception in the Iveagh Gardens Hotel. It was absolutely amazing. The staff were brilliant and the room was gorgeous. It was exactly what we wanted. We stayed in the Iveagh that night and our room was huge and very clean. Would recommend this hotel to everyone.,5,2022,03,12
221,Short trip to Dublin,"Good well run hotel near the centre. Great breakfast.
Good helpful staff. Would have loved a Bath but good  walk in shower.
Very near tram station into centre but all walkable across St Stephens Green.",4,2022,03,11
221,Amazing!,"Visited Dublin for a couple of days and stayed at the Iveagh Garden Hotel for two nights. The hotel is lovely, the lobby is warm and inviting, the reception staff were always polite and attentive. 

We stayed in a Deluxe Double Room and what a lovely room it was, soft lighting, all expected amenities present, very comfortable bed, and most importantly the room was squeaky clean! The bathroom was equally impressive, very clean and the rainfall shower was a nice touch. 
The only negative point is that the room was very warm, there was a window which did open but this didn’t help much. Air conditioning control unit was not functioning or wasn’t for guest use?

We booked one of the deals online which included a three course meal and a welcome drink. We ate in the on-site restaurant on our first night, a small set menu was provided, the offerings we chose were very nice, hot and very tasty - beware the portion sizes are big, we rolled out following our meal! The waiting team were very polite and extremely attentive. 

Breakfast was equally nice, buffet style offering with Irish cooked breakfast as well as continental options. The waiting team constantly checking in on all guests and offering refills on hot drinks throughout.

In the city center close to the excitement Dublin has to offer still having the Irish touch and flavor to it. Friendly and amazing staff. Transportation is available at the doorstep.  ",5,2022,03,10

221,Night away,"Fabulous  hotel, great location. It is only a couple minutes  walk from Grafton Street/St.Stephen’s Green. We were up staying for a show in The Sugar Club, it was an ideal location as it was less than a 10 minute walk away. We got breakfast included when we booked direct with the hotel and we both loved it. Small bit noisy outside bedroom window at times but nothing too disruptive considering it’s across the road from Coppers and Diceys. €20 for parking in St.Stephen’s green for 24 hours. Late enough check in at 4pm.
Overall very happy with the stay.",5,2022,03,01
221,Extremely convenient location,"Second time in this hotel, and mainly because of its location. The rooms are way too warm, and this is considering we stayed during an ice and snow warning. We  kept the windows open but still found it hard to sleep at night. The restaurant was very slow with service and menus..etc, but the cleaning staff were very nice. The desk staff were borderline dismissive, and wouldn't look you in the eye when talking to you which was disappointing. ",4,2022,03,01
221,"Modern hotel, great location","Gorgeous room and the best value for money price we could get in that location. Yummy cocktails and lovely staff.

221,Family visit,"Lovely decor. Mattress in our room 4121 was lumpy and bed base was unstable. Requested a quiet room location and was allocated. View however was not desirable, looking directly into an office block with over flowing skip and dumping area to side. 
Overall stay was good. Bar area great although was given incorrect wine choice and it was questioned by staff! Breakfast on third morning was cold and not replenished efficiently. Did not appreciate having to stand for 10 mins waiting for food and not be assisted even though chef could see I was there plate in hand. Few other niggles hotel aware of so hopefully feedback will make stays even better. ",4,2022,02,24

221,It’s a shame about the parking,84 Euro for a 2-night stay at Q-Park at St Stephen’s Green with ticket being validated at hotel will put me off booking again.  Hotel advertised it would be 20 Euro.  They would need to update there website - only thing disappointing of the entire stay,4,2022,02,22

221,Service was very disappointing.,"Could not check until after 4pm despite requesting an upgrade and early check in as it was a special birthday treat. Very little apologies offered. 
The next morning we had to wait 30 minutes for a table at breakfast. No orange juice, cold coffee and no milk available. The waiters were arguing with one another and with the kitchen counter staff. It was very disorganised despite having plenty of staff available. 
Our overall experience was very disappointing. ",2,2022,02,16
221,First and last time,"My partner and I stayed for one night on the 13th of February. Our first time here and this will be our last. The receptionist did not make us feel very welcome did not explain anything to us like where the Wi-Fi code is. Or even ask how our day was. The small things might not mean anything but they matter. Is the room was nice, clean and small. However the room was noisy. I only got five hours sleep that night. 
The cleaning staff in the hotel are the best and they get a five bubble rating for how friendly they are and how clean our room was. It is really handy walking distance to every think you need that’s a plus thing. For us this will be our last time and we will never return.",1,2022,02,16

   The reception area was beautifully decorated with warm Christmas lights, beautiful trees & a lovely fireplace. 
  Our room was bright, spacious & modern. The bathroom had a lovely walk in shower with rain shower. Also on the table in our room was a little treat of chocolates with our water bottles(nice touch)
  We dropped off our bags & headed off to explore our surroundings.
   We had dinner  reservation for 7.30pm & the restaurant was well laid out. The menu was nice with a good selection of meals. We had starters of Asian pork salad & Supergreen salad - both were fresh & very well presented. Our mains were a salmon dish & also a chicken dish. Again - compliments to the chef, our plates were empty.
   We had drinks in the conservatory area which was dimly lit & had a lovely atmosphere with heaters.

221,Found meat in my 'vegan' salad,"I found a piece of meat in my vegan salad. 

I have tried to contact the hotel in regards to my complaint but they are refusing to acknowledge it. 

They did take my meal off the bill at the time, however I feel that ignoring complaints instead of  taking the time to acknowledge guests of the hotels is unprofessional. 

I recommend staying somewhere else.",1,2022,01,07

221,Xmas weekend trip,"Hotel looks beautiful from outside - the lobbey area equally beautiful with modern decor as is the stairs and hallways to bedrooms - Art Deco Style even tho everything is very dark.
The standard rooms here are very small esp if you have booked a room for more than 2 people eg 3friends - be prepared for very small space for u all!

Rooms were clean and fresh beds comfortable Room Temp at Nite time was great which is hard to find in most hotels !

Only negative really was the breakfast in the AM - lots of food tho the ‘hot breakfast ‘ was either VERY lukewarm or cold - plates freezing which also didn’t help!
Service v slack for tea coffee and all just seemed a bit lifeless for this hotels Name and where it is situated also!

Hotel location is spot on for just a short walk into Grafton Street - there’s some supposed wel name niteclub oppsite this hotel which I’m sure really they could do without !",3,2021,11,29

221,A gem in Dublin,"We recently stayed for three nights during a busy weekend when Ireland played the All Blacks. From the moment we stepped into the hotel we felt safe (from Covid), welcome (by all the staff) and delighted by the service we were offered. The staff were so friendly, despite the huge pressure they faced, and constantly sought us out to check if we needed anything. The arrangements at breakfast were superb and the lunch and dinners could not have been bettered. To our surprise we discovered that the hotel is completely carbon neutral, having invested in two turbines 50 meters below the hotel and driven by the river swan. The hotel is simply a delight and well worth the cost. The location is absolutely perfect, close enough to walk to Grafton Steet or St Stephen’s Green or to a myriad of bars and restaurants in Camden Street. I can only recommend it and I will be staying there in future trips to Dublin. Well done and thanks to everyone for making our trip so enjoyable.",5,2021,11,18

221,Best avoided,"This place was awful and overpriced. The food was expensive yet you'd get better in McDonald's. Cold and rubbery chips and a plain probably from frozen burger. Staff were very short tempered and rude. I will not be back only good point was the setting, nice atmosphere and great location. ",1,2021,11,14
221,Weekend stay at Iveagh Gardens,Very happy with our stay and the location. Iveagh Gardens themselves are a surprising 'oasis' in the centre of Dublin. Harcourt Street is busy with b=various well known clubs etc BUT we did not notice the area being noisy or rowdy.,5,2021,11,10

221,Well located hotel with good cuisine,"We had a very nice stay here, and although there is a disco/ club in the basement, there was not a lot of noise in the rooms upstairs. The breakfast buffet is very good, as is the food in the restaurant at dinner time. The staff is very friendly and helpful. One strange thing: when checking out I remarked that the room had not been cleaned and the beds weren't made up. The answer was: then you hadn't put out the ""Please clean room sign"". Indeed we had not, kind of strange that this works differently from every other hotel in the world I have been...",4,2021,11,04

221,Family Stay,"While all the staff were polite, the service was very slow. It took ages to check in. I ordered drinks at the bar, I had to remind the bar staff twice and eventually they came after 20 minutes. The breakfasting experience was very regimented and disappointing. Despite half the restaurant not being used we were not able to get a breakfast time that suited us. Overall a very disappointing experience.",2,2021,11,01
221,Iveagh hotel,The hotel was excellent and the staff extremely helpful and friendly. They went out of their way to ensure we had a good stay at the hotel. The rooms were very nice and the cleaning staff did an excellent job.,5,2021,10,31
221,What a treat,Loved it. Went with a couple of friends for a meal and we've enjoyed every bit of it. Staff is very attentive and friendly. We were looked after by a tall manager with glasses( can't remember his name)  but he made sure that we felt welcomed and special. The hotel itself looks great. We will definitely be back. Thank you for a great evening,5,2021,10,30
221,Super Stay,"Excellent location, great food, great staff, comfortable room, lovely cocktails. A great spot for exploring Dublin. We really enjoyed our stay here. Make sure to check out the Iveagh Garden park behind the hotel for a hidden treasure in the city ",5,2021,10,30
221,Noisy ‘oasis’,It’s weird - the windows onto Harcourt Street have been carefully double glazed so the disturbance from the street is minimal and yet they book noisy parties into their basement which reverberate through all 5 floors. The staff were not massively sympathetic: ‘if you book a hotel in the centre of Dublin you have to expect noise’. Disappointed and won’t be booking again.,1,2021,10,29
221,Excellent hotel in heart of Dublin,"A fantastic location within short walking distance of the parks and shopping areas. Beautiful bar and a great affordable cocktail menu - excellent value overall with a great breakfast, we will be back! Thanks!",5,2021,10,29
221,5 Star Quality hotel in a brilliant location,"I cannot overstate how much we enjoyed our stay at the Iveagh Garden Hotel. The location is incredible, a stone’s throw from Stephen’s Green and it really is one of the most stylish hotels in Dublin. The room was very spacious and stylish, and luxurious. The soundproofing on the windows is simply incredible, you can’t hear anything from the streets during the night. 

Breakfast the next morning was superb and the staff were brilliant throughout and accommodating. 

We will definitely be returning in the near future
",5,2021,10,28
221,Great Experience,"Went to the Bistro for the first time, loved it , food was great, Seafood linguini to die for. Service was brilliant, thanks to Michael he was very attentive and look after us very well and make us feel very welcome.

Great atmosphere, I will be back again to try other dishes on the menu which all look absolutely delicious.",5,2021,10,26
221,Good hotel in central location,"Central location, modern rooms, OK (not great) breakfast, friendly staff. Would I come again: probably not because (I am aware that most of those are not failings of the hotel):
- no fitness facilities
- no family rooms for 4. As a family with 2 kids you need to book 2 rooms
- nothing special that will be remembered, no design feature or anything else
- no fridge or mini-bar in the rooms",4,2021,10,25
221,Superb hotel,"The location, decor, WiFi signal, comfort, food, staff were all amazing. 
As a nurse I was particularly impressed with the cleanliness & covid protection measures, especially the tv remote control wrapped in clingfilm…..fabulous.
My only gripe is that the selection of tv channels was poor. ",5,2021,10,24
221,Stasho,"If in Dublin must stay in this hotel, staff and even owner John couldn’t have been so good to us while we spent our wedding anniversary there, ideal location for everywhere in Dublin City, thanks again ",5,2021,10,24
221,Lovely hotel great location,Lovely hotel beautiful decor. Nice breakfast. Lovely room. The hotel was very accommodating as I had to change the booking the day before our arrival.  The only one thing we weren't happy with was on our return to the hotel at 11.30 we couldn't get a drink in the bar which may be because of restrictions but we asked for one in the room and this could not be accommodated either. If hotels are going to do this they should reduce they're rates as they are not operating at full service. The staff said the bar was closed. ,5,2021,10,20
221,Great hotel,Hotel well located to reach the main attractions in the city. Helpful and pleasant staff with great facilities. Rooms were spacious and very clean. Would recommend this hotel as a perfect base when visiting Dublin.,5,2021,10,20
221,Girly night away,Couldnt recommend the Iveagh Garden Hotel enough. I stayed with friends to celebrate a birthday and they staff were so friendly and helpful. The shower in the room was also amazing. The only down side was the wall in the middle of the room but it wasnt a big issue.,5,2021,10,19
221,Excellent service and so friendly,"In July we stayed at the Iveagh Hotel, we had a lovely stay but staff had alot of confusion to last orders etc and staff shortage but that's ok as covid had created a shortage in staff and a massive strain, this time, staff, service all excellent massive difference keep it up and ""well done the Iveagh"" we had a wonderful stay and look forward to a revisit",5,2021,10,19

They also ensured that on night 2 the dinner went off without a hitch and was perfect! There is a huge rang of Cocktails and drinks available at reasonable prices.
The breakfast at the Iveagh Gardens is the best Hores breakfast I have experienced in years. Freshly cooked, well served and again friendly helpful staff. I would 100% recommend the Iveagh Gardens hotel to everyone and I will be returning!",5,2021,10,18
221,Staff seal the deal,"We stayed here for 2 nights to celebrate my sister's 50th birthday. The hotel is beautiful but the staff just give it the extra dimension.  Well trained, friendly and professional. It was a great experience. Lucky for us though that the local nightclubs are still closed as street will be noisy once they open...but that's not the hotel's fault. Everything was just lovely.",5,2021,10,17
221,Fantastic team of staff. Plenty of them and they were very attentive.,"Hotel rooms were great, clean and very comfortable with adequate space. 
Car park is a ten minute walk away though which may not suit some. The staff made our stay a very special one. What a great team and endeavoured to meet all our needs. ",4,2021,10,15
221,Fantastic,Myself my mother and daughter stayed here after my daughter told us how fantastic it was for her getaway with her friends.  It certainly lived up to her experience. We arrived early and our room was ready. I cannot recommend this highly enough the staff the hotel and the food was excellent and I didn't really want to post this as it may get so popular I may not get a room in the future but they deserve to be recognised as it's superb.,5,2021,10,14

Would definitely stay again and will recommend to friends.
NB One of the stay highlights was walking through the delightful Iveagh gardens at the back of the hotel. ",5,2021,10,05
221,Elle's Bar & Bistro Lunch,I met my work colleagues for lunch in Elle's Bar & Bistro after a long 18 months working from home and we had the most wonderful lunch. The food was wonderful and the service from Vanessa was exceptional. Ideal for a work lunch!,5,2021,10,01

221,"Fab hotel, restaurant needs improving","Restaurant service ridiculous. 2hrs 20mins seated for a 3 course meal, time between meals ridiculous. Nobody came to us to ask if we’d like drinks etc, we had to keep calling servers over. 4 chicken wings for a starter portion? Couple beside us sat down half hour after us, and were finished their meal half hour before us. We were just not served all night! ",3,2021,09,29
221,We'll Be Back,"The staff are just lovely here - friendly, attentive and just really ready to make your visit enjoyable.  LOVE their outdoor bar area!  Rooms were spacious - absolutely loved the walk-in shower - and very clean.  And, of course, you're less than a 10 minute walk from Grafton Street  We'll definitely come back again.",5,2021,09,28
221,Fabulous Hotel,"Stayed here with a friend last weekend and we just loved everything about this hotel!! We booked the one night stay with arrivals drink,  dinner & breakfast.

Very much enjoyed the hotel, only complaint was not enough pillows and I should have just asked for more they were so accommodating I’m sure they would have taken care of us. Will definitely choose this hotel when we return to Dublin!",5,2021,09,19
221,Great city centre,"The hotel is in a great location and they really made our stay feel special. The rooms are clean and spacious, the staff are friendly and the room was really quiet at night despite being so central. I’d recommend staying here.",5,2021,09,16
221,Shopping trip,"The hotel is in an Excellent location, however it had very poor hotel service, the staff either were unsure of their role or there was insufficient staff to begin with. I would really would only recommend as a base",3,2021,09,15
221,Great place for a stay in Dublin,"We enjoyed our stay in Iveagh Garden Hotel, great location, staff very friendly at reception. Rooms too dark and too hot, no air …. Same in the breakfast room. Breakfast was very rushed and not a relaxing experience, staff are a bit messy",4,2021,09,13
221,Highly recommend this hotel,"Amazing hotel, great location, breakfast was delicious. Staff are super friendly and the beds are very comfortable. Overall an excellent experience from start to finish, would definitely recommend...:) ",5,2021,09,08
221,Very Good hotel,"We found this hotel to be very good. Well located 3 or 4 minute from Grafton st. Food was very good and staff friendly. Although reception staff where very friendly and professional, they did forget to offer the welcome drink offered as part of the package, that said we forgot it ourselves. But it would have been nice.Also not sure what the noise level from the Harcourt street side would be like from Thursday over the weekend nights when nite club restrictions are lifted..We had a back area room which was quiet with some background music noise from the Iveagh garden, I guess from a local festival?
Would definitely stay midweek again.",4,2021,09,06
221,Excellent Hotel,"Staff were exceptional. Hotel was excellent. Food was excellent for what it is. Best full irish I've had in along time. The parking needs sorting out, currently it is very difficult to drop off at hotel as the LUAS line is outside the door, and one needs to park a 10min walk away",5,2021,09,03
221,Great stay,"We booked a deal online which was extremely good value for money and the service we received was great. Overall it was a great stay, I would recommend to anyone. Especially the deals and offers currently available.",5,2021,09,02

Also the Location brilliant for those not from Dublin, South Dublin, 2 mins walk from St. Stephens Green and beautiful Grafton Street... and the Iveagh Gardens right behind it, national galleries you name it a few mins walk from all the lovely sites....",5,2021,08,30
221,Lovely hotel,I have the pleasure of staying at the Iveagh Garden for three nights on my own. The location is excellent and the staff friendly and well-trained. Not all the rooms seem to have air-conditioning and this normally would not be a problem. However it was very hot in Dublin on those three days. The staff handled a power cut with ease and my being a celiac was absolutely no problem. I look forward to staying at the Iveagh Garden Hotel soon again.,5,2021,08,30
221,Fantastic hotel,"Beautiful hotel, rooms are lovely & very comfortable. Staff were very friendly, polite & helpful. There were 4 of us, we booked a package deal (twin room, bottle of Prosecco, 3 course dinner, a drink each with meal & breakfast) fantastic value. Food was really good, everyone had something different, all throughly enjoyed it. Would highly recommend a stay here, we will definitely return.",5,2021,08,29
221,Luxury stay in a very nice neigbourhood,"Enjoy the parks, the city life while staying in a luxury environment. Good beds, well isolated room, friendly service. All needs can be met, even a powerbank. Excellent location, quiet but closeby the pubs and the parks. Absolutely recommendable.",5,2021,08,29
221,Comfortable but service can be improved ,"The hotel and the room (double deluxe) look nice, modern luxury style, a little generic but well done. Comfortable beds and bathroom,  shower a l'italienne.

First impression on the service wasn't good, someone jumps on us to check temperature, then the cold front desk staff checks us in and gives the bare minimum information, then ask us to pay upfront immediately. In fact, at this hotel, staff always ask to be paid upfront for everything: the room, breakfast, room service.. Isn't it common practice to put everything on the room tab and pay at checkout? It almost felt like they were worried we wouldn't pay. It seemed to be an inconvenience to the staff so I paid upfront every time. 

For room service, you need to go downstairs and carry the food to your room by yourself. The only time I called reception, to ask to borrow a spoon to eat desert in my room, I was told ""you need to go downstairs and ask the restaurant yourself"".

 At that point, I was starting to get negative emotions about the service, but the rest of the stay was OK. Some of the staff were nice and helpful but it was not consistent. Many 4 star hotels actually take extra care and special attention to their guests, I didn't feel like it was the case. I still give 4 stars because overall we still had a good time. ",4,2021,08,28
221,"Overall great hotel, as long as the power stays on","Very nice and stylish hotel in a nice area of Dublin. I had the misfortune to stay there on a night when the power went out and stayed out for over 2 hours. The whole neighborhood was affected by the outage. But I had read all about this hotel being “the greenest hotel in Europe “ with its own power source from an underground River. So it was frustrating that there was no backup system even. The emergency lights in the hallway worked, but the phone to call reception want dead and for some reason the water stopped flowing also. I expected a more proactive response from management, such as a PA announcement or even a note under my door, but we’re literally and figuratively left in the dark. I also expected some gesture such as a free breakfast or even an apology at checkout, but again no response. I sincerely hope the management has learned from this experience and will do better in the future, keeping in mind that not all travelers are able bodied adults and that we are in unfamiliar surroundings. Luckily most of us have lights on our phones nowadays but I have learned to pack a small flashlight for future trips. 
In closing, I would stay here again and don’t discount all the other aspects I enjoyed. I commend the bellman who was very personable and helpful. ",4,2021,08,28
221,"Excellent staff, great location and a luxury stay.","The staff were all excellent, from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. The breakfast was fabulous, with fresh orange juice, lovely fruit bowls and an excellent full Irish. A luxury stay in Dublin! ",5,2021,08,28
221,Avoid,"This is my second time I have stayed in this hotel, the last occasion I recall the staff being rude but the hotel decor to be nice and great showers- I gave a second chance as I stayed here previously when the hotel first opened.

This time, a sour taste was left in my mouth for different reasons. On check in- we were informed of everything that could not be facilitated “due to covid”- no room service, bar closing early etc. 

I arrived to Elle’s for breakfast in the morning at my allocated time to be shown to a table in the center of the restaurant. The room was completely full. The table to my left was less than an arm length away from me- I could hear all conversations and feel the girl beside me cough. The same to my right hand side.

Even though the rules were apparently so stringent in the hotel, the hot breakfast was being served from a central area with a queue the length of the room with no social distancing. I did not feel one bit comfortable and left quickly. 

Covid has become a great excuse for cutting back on good service",2,2021,08,27
221,A stay in Dublin,Stayed one night with friends in this hotel. The location was brilliant. Staff were very good. Rooms so comfortable and the breakfast was delicious. I would thoroughly recommend the hotel and am already looking for an excuse to stay again. ,5,2021,08,27
221,Girls night away,"We stayed in the Iveagh Garden for one night and we’re not disappointed! We dined in Elle’s bistro and the girl who served us was so friendly and efficient, as were all the staff! Food and cocktails were second to none. We will definitely be returning!",5,2021,08,24
221,"Gorgeous hotel, amazing location - Definitely recommend","I have recommended to all my friends after my stay on the 20th of August 2021. Amazing location, beautiful hotel and amazing value. Such lovely staff also. Rooms were spotless and much bigger than expected. Breakfast was also lovely. Very happy with stay and will definitely be back.",5,2021,08,23
221,Lovely Hotel,"This is a very clean well run hotel in a great location.  The rooms were good size and well equipped with tea/coffee, towels and product. Beds were very comfortable. The bar was clean spacious and well run.  It is near the city centre and access to and from is easy.  I would stay again!!
Only downside is parking but the hotel do offer a discounted rate at a safe carpark near the hotel.
",5,2021,08,23
221,Not great but nice decor,"Firstly, I arrived at 2pm and was told off for being early given checkin was 3pm. When I returned at 3pm I was then told that the room was not ready due to another guests choice to pay for later check out. As a result of them being granted late check out I was not in my room by 3pm. I had to wait around the foyer. When I finally got to the room there were rings on the tables and make up on the carpet. What’s more, the electric didn’t work. The key didn’t hold in the holder, in fact when we put the key in the holder fell off the wall and the electric kept flashing. I rang the front desk and they sorted it but over all not a great experience.",2,2021,08,23
221,Beautiful Hotel,"A beautiful hotel with amazing decor! Teenagers had a fun time as staff so friendly and hotel is relaxed.
Location is great - LUAS a few steps away and St.Stephen’s Green within walking distance.
Menu is good and food delicious. 
Will definitely return. ",5,2021,08,21
221,A wonderful experience in Dublin,"From the moment we arrived being greeted at the door by a young friendly gentleman to the moment we checked out two days later, the staff were wonderful, kind, helpful.  The restaurant evening staff were the best I have ever encountered and so pleasant.  We had our meal in the restaurant the first night and drinks, and we were treated so well by the staff.  The food was lovely too.  We dined out the second night and we couldn't wait to get back to the hotel for our few night caps.  We did not even want to check out the next morning.  It was the staff the made our overall experience so pleasant.  I have stayed in a lot of hotels in Dublin but by far this outdid them all.  The hotel itself is lovely and the rooms were good.  But without a doubt it was the staff that made our stay the best.  I was in a group of 3 people and we all agreed it was the best stay in Dublin.  I cannot say anything bad and will be returning again, hopefully in near future.  Oh, and I have to mention the bar staff that made the ""Mojito"".... the best mojito I have ever had :-) ",5,2021,08,20
221,Fabulous ,Fabulous stay in a bright modern hotel so close to everything you need in Dublin. Few minutes from st Stephen Green and all the restaurants around temple bar. Helpful lovely staff. Nothing too much trouble. Great breakfast. Will be back for sure. ,5,2021,08,20

221,Couples stay,"Would definitely recommend. We got a couples package deal and couldn't fault it. The room was great and the staff were so friendly, helpful and on the ball. The breakfast and dinner we had was so nice. The location was handy but would definitely be a lot more noisey if the nightclubs on the street were all open again. Lovely stay overall and would definitely go back!",5,2021,08,17
221,Excellent Location,"We had a great stay in the Iveagh Garden,  The hotel is fab and really nicely decorated.  Elles Bar is huge and nicely spaced out.  Food was lovely and staff were really friendly.  We were a party of 8 and highly recommend this location and will be back.  Only one problem was with our triple room which was extremely hot but we informed reception on checkout.",4,2021,08,17

Cannot recommend the Iveagh Garden Hotel enough.Special shout out to the porters sorry never got names wish we had , they were all super friendly and helpful.Thanks so much.",5,2021,08,16
221,Dissatisfied,"Requested housekeeping four times. When we finally got through the hotel sent up a young boy (Adam) to hand us bedsheets and towels. We had to dress the bed ourselves. I understand with covid housekeeping is limited but they were requested upon checking in. 12 the day they were needed. 4pm the same day and we only got service at 5pm. Very dissatisfied. 
Breakfast was really strange I hadn’t even finished eating and my plate was taken away. Staff really didn’t seem to know what they were doing ",2,2021,08,16
221,The best hotel !,"Absolutely beautiful hotel, great staff and service and in the perfect location! This wasn’t my first time staying in The Iveagh Garden hotel, and it won’t be my last, I was given an excellent rate in a wonderful, comfortable hotel room. I would recommend to anyone who is thinking of staying in Dublin. The hotel is also very central but not so close that it’s very busy outside or loud throughout the night. ",5,2021,08,16
221,Wonderful stay,The bed was amazing. Love the rain head showers and the power outlets right next to the bed. Would love to stay here again.

221,"Excellent Hotel, great location",I recently stayed at the Iveagh Gardens Hotel for one night and I can not recommend the hotel more. Every aspect of my stay was great. I had a nice welcome at reception on arrival. They have really good covid safety measures in place. The room I stayed in was perfect. Great facilities in the room. The breakfast the next morning was lovely I highly recommend it. I would definitely stay here again and have no issue recommended the hotel to others.,5,2021,08,09
221,Handy for shopping,"Not an exceptional hotel. Comfortable, good beds. Would have preferred a bath and shower instead of just a shower. Breakfast first morning was chaotic, no information given as to the Covid-19 precautions and how the breakfast was arranged. Much better if they served people at their tables like at dinner. Second morning we were met by a martinet who barked information at us. I don't think she meant to be rude but it came across that way. Anyway, at least we knew what to do! Dinner  was excellent, the place was hopping with a birthday party at one end, very enjoyable. 
Not having a car park is a big drawback with this hotel. I don't think I would return, this hotel doesn't have enough to draw me back.",3,2021,08,08
221,Great Location,"Good location, restaurant was very good and staff top notch. Very enjoyable stay. Definitely would stay here again. Although I would bring my own pillow or request a thin pillow for a better night's sleep, personal preference. ",5,2021,08,06
221,City break,"Stylish city centre hotel, close to peaceful park. Well organised for breakfast & very good value meal and accommodation package. Would stay again. Comfortable bed & very nice spacious bathroom. Garden terrace is lovely & a bonus in these pandemic times. ",4,2021,08,06
221,Nice stay,Lovely hotel with helpful staff and excellent food. Would have no problem recommending the hotel for a stay. Rooms were very clean and tidy as was the hotel itself. Would certainly stay again when in Dublin.,5,2021,08,06
221,Dublin Night Away,"Wouldn't advise asking to watch a match on the bar tv..... Some staff very unhappy with this and we were made to feel very uncomfortable. 
Room was lovely and very clean, the rest of the staff were very friendly. Breakfast was only only ok, I've had better.  ",4,2021,08,05
221,City hols,"We loved this hotel. The decor is amazing and the food on our stay was fantastic. The staff were on the ball. The room was basic but clean and tidy 
We would definitely stay here again. The hotel is in a nice area and just walking distance from grafton street and Stephen’s green",5,2021,08,04
221,Gorgeous hotel,"Could not fault this hotel at all,in fact I'm surprised it's not 5 star hotel because we had a 5 star experience. Staff were so polite and friendly and on top of all your needs, especially in the covid climate we are living in",5,2021,08,04
221,"Great in the evening, not in the morning","We booked in for the romantic package, loved the way the room was set up with rose petals and swan-shaped towels on the bed when we arrived. 

Dinner was excellent, reduced menu because of Covid, but the staff were helpful and efficient. However, my companion asked for a burger with nothing except the burger and chips, and they put salad on his plate. And my ice-cream dessert which was the only gluten-free option, came with crushed biscuits scattered on it, and had to be sent back. 

Lovely room, great views from the window, amazing shower in the bathroom. Comfortable bed, even if it wasn't the biggest I've slept in.

However, in the morning, not as good. We had been given a 9am time for breakfast, which was much earlier than I would have liked, but that was the latest we could get.  
Breakfast consisted of the worst of both worlds. Instead of sitting down and having food brought to you, you had to queue up for a bain marie buffet and tell the staff what you wanted from it. The food was limp, tepid and tired, and the gluten free selection was mushrooms, tomato, bacon and eggs.  I actually asked for mine to be microwaved for 20 seconds to heat it up. The waitress said they didn't do that, then took it and said she microwaved it for 15 seconds!  And exactly 35 minutes after we arrived in the breakfast room, we were asked to leave so they could clean the table for other guests. 

If you are planning a romantic trip here, avoid the breakfast, it will take the gloss of your romance.",3,2021,08,03
221,Great place!,"Couldn't fault this hotel, everyone was so friendly and helpful! Great cocktails! Service was slow at times. Rooms are fab! The hotel is super central also so it's easy to get around Dublin and also great to have reduced rate parking in the Qpark at At Stephen's green",5,2021,08,03
221,Amazing Staff and Fabulous Hotel,"Cocktails were amazing and Staff were so helpful and friendly. Rooms were great apart from one of our gables having stains that were not cleaned. Breakfast was overall good, food service was fast but tabke service was slow for tea/coffees etc. ",5,2021,08,01
221,Fab hotel,"Great location, beautiful rooms and the service was excellent! Stayed there for a family wedding. The staff were so accommodating, we all had such a lovely time. Would definitely stay there again! Highly recommend it! ",5,2021,07,30
221,Excellent overnight trip,"Everything about the hotel was perfect from the location, comfort of the bedroom, value for money, service of the staff and quality of the restaurant. I would definitely stay again and recommend to a friend.",5,2021,07,30
221,Top notch city hotel,"We enjoyed most everything about the Iveagh Garden Hotel - location is top notch, near to tram and bus lines but outside the noisier districts. The staff was exceptionally pleasant and helpful. The room was stylish and comfortable, and the food was good.",5,2021,07,30
221,Overnight stay Iveagh Garden Hotel,"What a cracking hotel is all I can say . We stayed here for one night only (unfortunately) but from the moment we arrived until the moment we left it was top class ...The staff were fantastic from the minute we checked in through to the bar and restaurant guys...Everyone was so helpful and friendly towards us..I know that should be a given but they all genuinely made us feel so welcome ...We haven't been to a hotel in over a year and we were a little nervous tbh but the hotel and all staff gave off a really good vibe and the wearing of masks and sanitizing in communal areas didn't take away from our experience one bit..The Food in the restaurant was fantastic, with my wife being a Vegan , I thought that would be a bit of an issue but she was well catered for and had a fantastic meal as did I .. the food was faultless and delivered to our table promptly and piping hot and was one of the nicest meals we've had in a hotel in a long time...We couldn't recommend this hotel highly enough .. thoroughly enjoyable stay.",5,2021,07,30
221,Birtday celebrations,"Very nice hotel, friendly staff lovely decor and garden. Food disapppointing and expensive for what you get on your plate. Won't be rushing back again a good walk grom carpark to hotel. They should have a shuttle service especially if you have alot of luggage. ",3,2021,07,29
221,Excellent Hotel,Stayed in the hotel on Saturday night. The rooms were beautiful. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The location was ideal. Breakfast was good. I thought the set menu for our meal was a bit limited. But overall I would highly recommend this hotel and will be back again.,5,2021,07,28
221,Poor customer service - food ok,"Standard breakfast - buffet style.  Nothing to complain about there apart from the 15 Euro cost.

When we entered, despite saying we were staying at the sister hotel the Harcourt, the young lady told us our names were incorrect on the sheet - she eventually realised her error and looked at the correct sheet.  We were then told that we had a table for 45 minutes.  This was 10:10.  She came over at 10:41 and quite poorly advised us that we had to vacate the table.  When I kindly informed her that we were advised by her of the 45 minutes and still had a short period of time left, her lack of care about that was extremely obvious and her shrug very contemptuous.  We felt rushed and not at all looked after/comfortable.  We also reported this to the Harcourt hotel upon departure.  Plenty of other fantastic places around in which to have a breakfast with much more value for money and customer service.",2,2021,07,27
221,A girly night away,A night away with my daughter. From start to finish it has been the best staycation break away for me. Everything was spot on 100% a great hotel with wonderful staff. Highly recommend a visit to the Iveagh Garden Hotel,5,2021,07,26
221,Great night away in central Dublin,"Just returned from a great night away at the Iveagh. Great location with very convenient parking at a discounted rate. Hotel itself was beautiful we found staff welcoming and attentive. Got a great package for dinner b and b, managed to get lucky and get a room with a terrace which was fabulous given the great weather. We needed to make a change to our booking at last minute and Joseph was very helpful and efficient.  We will definitely be back to the Iveagh, hopefully soon.",5,2021,07,25
221,Shambolic Service,"While the terrace is very elegant and the menu reads well, the service is an absolute joke.
We were waiting 20 minutes before i had to go find a waitress and ask for menus despite it being a relatively quiet Wednesday afternoon.
We ordered drinks from a different waiter who never returned so we ordered again from yet another waitress and waited a further 20 minutes for them to arrive.
Our simple order of chicken wings (crispy and delicious but no finger bowl or side plates and tiny portion) and salad was wrong. There were 2 of us but they only brought one portion of both wings and salad.
We tried multiple times to pay the bill but were ignored by the inept wait staff.
I would have left without paying but my dining partner has more patience than me and waited it out.
Awful service, so bad it overshadowed everything else. 
Won't be returning or recommending.",2,2021,07,25
221,Great Stay,"Stayed here in June with my girlfriend for a quick getaway from Belfast.  Very welcoming hotel + very comfortable rooms.

Had a few drinks in the bar and felt like a bit of an after thought as we were not eating but apart from that, zero complaints & would stay again!",5,2021,07,24
221,south facing oven,"You should avoid a south facing room  if a hot day/night - room tempeture is unbareable, duvet is way to heavy.  otherwise, lovely hotel and staff. great location in centre of dublin . bar and terrace are very nice.",3,2021,07,21
221,Iveagh Garden Hotel my stay,"Good quality rooms.
Meals portions where tiny and too expensive the breakfast is good reception staff are good great location the only negative I have is meal portions are tiny and  drinks are expensive.",2,2021,07,17
221,Perfect location for central Dublin,"Beautiful hotel in the heart of Dublin. We stayed for a night and had a perfect stay from start to finish. Very early greeted and check in was smooth. Rooms are really lovely and well appointed. We ate in Elle’s Bistro, the food was really very tasty and service was good although plates were cleared as soon as we put our cutlery together with others on our table still eating which is a real pet hate. The restaurant wasn’t busy but we felt rushed. Breakfast was good although for the size of the hotel and number of guests the buffet serving area could be larger as it was hard to socially distant whilst queuing for it as the hotel staff serve the food on to your plate. At one point there was around 20 queuing snaking round the tables.",5,2021,07,15
221,Great Location for a stay in Dublin,"Location could not be better to explore Dublin city. The room was really good and modern. We eat in Elle's bistro and the food was very good. The staff were really friendly and helpful. We had to change a dish because we did not ask about an ingredient, the dish was changed with no fuss or delay.
We would highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2021,07,15
221,Very disappointing stay,We booked for a couples get away in Dublin to celebrate a graduation and birthday. The service was very disappointing and not up to our standards. Non residents were out before residents. After requesting room cleaning we got a white bin bag thrown in our room with fresh towels etc . Dirty towels were not removed from the room. Very very disappointing ,2,2021,07,14
221,Dublin staycation,"Great hotel, food was excellent, superb location right in the heart of Dublin, yet not noisy and right beside the Luas line, the team there are very friendly and helpful; great service all round. Will be back.",5,2021,07,14
221,Weekend stay,"We had an enjoyable stay in the iveagh gardens. The staff were great and helpful. The room was clean and bathroom facilities were nice. One drawback about the room is that the pillows were too soft, But that’s just a personal preference. 

The balcony above ours were throwing their cigarette butts down on top of us all night and when we woke up our balcony was covered with them. Walls are a bit thin it was very easy to hear the people beside us and above. ",4,2021,07,14
221,One night treat,Had an amazing stay. Location central. Staff welcoming and friend. Food was lovely and cocktails went down lovely. Terrace was buzzing and everyone in great form. Breakfast was lovely. Even with COVID restrictions in place had a wonderful stay. ,5,2021,07,14

221,One night break,"Great unique hotel in walking distance to everything you need in Dublin, very easy car parking at the W park, hotel room was immaculate and very comfortable - can’t wait to stay again - complete bargain at the price we got compared to other hotels we have stayed in Dublin 

Really nice and efficient served breakfast 

Thanks again",5,2021,07,12
221,Good location for city break,"Our second stay. Friendly and casual, but with nice rooms and very clean. Restaurant and bar all in one area, but makes for a very casual atmosphere. Really like the location, and is on Luas so very accessible.",5,2021,07,11
221,Brilliant Weekend,"My son and I had a super two night stay, breakfast was serviced so well under restrictions and dinner was also lovely, we're going back - loved the place and luxury of the hotel and a stroll in the Iveagh Gardens after breakfast helped.",5,2021,07,09
221,Overnite in dublin,Great value one night stay with dinner and welcome drink.  This is a very central location.  The decor is lovely and all common areas were very clean.  Staff were very pleasant and helpful. We would be happy to go back to this hotel again.  I would recommend this hotel to other people.,5,2021,07,07
221,Stay at Iveagh Garden Hotel,"Hotel was clean, inviting, staff are very friendly and location is great.  Delicious dinner at Ellie's Bistro.  Breakfast is disappointing - cold ""hot"" food and not the best quality produce. Would stay again but for room only - skip the breakfast.",3,2021,07,07
221,Terrible service,"Would not stay again or even visit for food and drinks as the service was absolutely terrible.  Staff were not friendly and treated us like an inconvenience.  The way your staff speak to each other is even disgraceful, at breakfast I witnessed the chef and a member of staff arguing with each other beside the buffet.  I staff female staff member with short blonde hair was extremely rude to my partner when he approached the buffet for a pastry.  She literally tapped her watch and asked him to hurry up.  The whole experience of breakfast was not relaxing at all - do not book people in for breakfast for 11:00, tell them they can stay for 45 mins but then start completely pack up the buffet by 11:30 - I have never in my life rushed through breakfast on a Sunday morning while staying in a hotel in my life!  Plus the noise of the buffet being packed up and staff practically killing each other over who’s doing what was stressful!",1,2021,07,07
221,Len,Fabulous hotel in a great location. Spotlessly clean. Great food and amazing cocktails. Staff extremely helpful. Have stayed here twice. Once with my daughters and then with my husband. This hotel suits all types of parties. ,5,2021,07,07

221,Family of 4 overnight in the City,"Overall this Hotel was great value for myself and my three daughters overnight stay in Dublin. We had not visited the City since Covid spread so it was a special stay. The family room was a great size and probably hard to match in this location at this price. The Hotel is perfectly situated, a stroll away from Grafton Street and next door to the Iveagh Gardens which is a hidden gem. The majority of the staff are very helpful. Breakfast needs to be improved on.  ",4,2021,07,02
221,Christmas gift,"Fabulous night in this lovely hotel, location excellent and staff friendly except on check in, found him a bit uppity. Didn’t eat here so can’t comment on food, but would recommend the cocktails they were delicious ",5,2021,07,01

221,2hour wait for a main course,"We really had high hopes for our first night away in over a year, we had lunch in the hotel which was lovely and some drinks, while I do feel like the cocktails are overpriced for the size. 
We had dinner for 8pm, I ordered the ceser salad for starter as did my partner, the chicken was far too undercooked for my liking, I did not complain I just asked for my chicken with my main to be cooked well, the waiter did not even ask why my plate was still full. 
An hour after this at about 9:20pm we asked for our main as we had been waiting nearly an hour, we were told the place is very busy and they are not used to this volume of people. 
We asked again at 10:15pm, a waitress Amy came over to tell us she did not clear our plates from our starter so that’s why we never got our food. 
We finally received our main at 10:40pm. We had both ordered the chicken curry, curry came minus the chicken. We received the chicken at 10:50pm, along with being told it was last orders for drinks.
At this point I did not want any food as it was far too late, with no real apology. 
We received our desert at 11:15pm. 
When we went to pay we charged 22 euro extra for chicken for our mains, I explained I was not paying this, it was accepted with reluctance.
I spoke to the manager the next day, whom was nice but I really felt we should have been refunded the meal after such a horrible experience.
We were offered a room upgrade if he ever returned or a free lunch, but again I feel we should have been reimbursed the meal at a minimum.",2,2021,06,16
221,An amazing night away,"Myself and my best friend stayed for one night in the Iveagh garden hotel and it was so worth the money. The room was spacious, modern and extremely comfy. The trip was for my friends 21st and the staff were kind enough to leave us chocolates and fruit in the room which was such a lovely touch. The one thing I should mention is that we were disappointed we couldn’t watch Netflix on the television as the featured channels did not have a lot on and the fact we did not receive slippers or dressing gowns in the room. Otherwise, it was all amazing. We also received excellent service from all the staff, particularly one of the food and beverages assistants named Alexandra who took great care of us at dinner and went out of her way to make sure we had a nice night. She’s a great worker! We would 100% stay again.",5,2021,06,16
221,Awful,"After a day out with my partner we decided to head back to the hotel to have a drink in the residence bar. I needed to use the loo so he headed on in without me. Girl at the front needed proof we were residence in the hotel and had to take a key card to check which I thought was strange, we ordered a drink and after 20 minutes no sign of it. I asked a very nice server about our drinks and he said they are on the way, another 10 minutes pass still no drink!? I ask the girl who had showed us to our seat, not one bit friendly and as my partner was pulling in his chair said ‘you better be careful or we will cut you off’. As hotel guests I thought her comment was very rude and uncalled for. We felt we didn’t belong and looked down on be the staff, very unprofessional! I have never felt so degraded by staff in a hotel before, our every move was being watched and I couldn’t wait to get out of the place. We took our drinks to our room to finish and left promptly the next morning. If you don’t want to feel like you ‘don’t belong’ as a paying customer don’t stay here. First night away in over a year ruined. All I could hear from our room was shouting and laughing from the bar",1,2021,06,14
221,Elle’s bar. Alexandra is amazing,I Stayed in the iveagh garden hotel with my friend for a night away. The hotel room was lovely although it had a few things missing we would of liked. We went to Elle’s bar and bistro for dinner and Alexandra was our server. The hotel and bar should be delighted to have a girl like her working for them. Such a nice girl who was bubbly and so sweet. She recommended the best food options and even surprised us with cocktails when we weren’t sure what to pick. She couldn’t of been nicer and was so accommodating and really made the night for us.  I really have to say she made the experience memorable and was so nice to meet someone like her during our stay. Alexandra definitely gets a 6/5 stars from us.,4,2021,06,12
221,"Fabulous hotel, lovely staff","We stayed in a family room for one week, the room was a generous size, spotlessly clean, quiet and easily accessible. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Perfect location for visiting the city centre. The interiors are beautifully presented in art deco style in gorgeous colour schemes. The lobby and restaurant are elegant and spacious. The food and cocktails are highly recommended.",5,2021,06,12
221,Everything was given the 5* treatment,"Best night's sleep I've had in a long time, shower was superb and much needed after all my travels throughout the day and the meals and cocktails I had in the restaurant were sublime.

221,Oasis in the heart of Dublin!,"The absolute perfect hotel while staying in the heart of Dublin, stayed here on multiple occasions and it will be my go to hotel for all future trips to Dublin.

221,Post Lockdown Hotel Stay,"This is a lovely hotel, only 5 minutes from Grafton Street, the hotel is spotless and the staff were lovely and followed all Covid rules so felt very comfortable.
Our room was lovely and they gave us a room with a balcony (could have had a little table and chair on the balcony) because it was our Anniversary and some nice chocolates, which was a real nice touch.

221,Luxury stay,"My partner and I stayed twice in this hotel - when it had just opened and again last September. Its a stunning hotel, and the staff is fantastic.

 Last time we stayed three nights for a late summer staycation and they had a great two nights deal on, so I contacted reservations to add a third night to the deal and talked to Krisitina who was so nice and helpful, really happy with our reservations experience. She gave us a complimentary upgrade which was most welcome in these trying times!

We availed of a dinner in the bar, three courses and it was lovely. Nice portions, beautiful presentation and tasty food. We ordered daiquiris which tasted lovely but I have to say I wouldn't recommend the mango daiquiri - very difficult to sip due to the mango consistency. Passionfruit daiquiri was nicer.

We also had breakfast and it was lovely. No supplement for cappuccinos which was lovely.

Room was comfortable and large, all you need for a nice relaxing stay in the city.

Staff was friendly, especially the man in charge of taking the temperature (strange times we live in) and the receptionist who looked after our check in, I'm sorry I never got their names.

All in all a perfect staycation with a touch of luxury. If I had a bigger holiday budget it'd probably be my go to hotel in Dublin! ",5,2021,02,05
221,Excellent staff,I was very impressed with how accommodating this hotel is. We messed up the booking and staff did their upmost to make sure it was fixed and accommodate us as best they could. Also decor is beautiful and food is delicious ,4,2021,01,24

221,Brilliant Wedding,My sister and her husband got married here in Sept 2020. It was a small wedding party of 25 but one of the nicest weddings I have been to. The hotel decor is so nice and the location is perfect. What did it for me though was the staff. They went above and beyond and could not have been more friendly and helpful. Covid rules were followed very well and they really went above and beyond for everyone. I would highly recommend this hotel.

From the moment you step foot into the hotel and your temperature is taken you are made feel at ease and relaxed. everyone from the reception staff, to the bar and restaurant staff were so kind and accommodating. The room was spotless. We ate in  Elles bistro and we had beef cheek and the chicken. i am still dreaming about the beef cheek- it just melted, it was beautiful! The only thing was the room was incredibly warm, we did have the Dyson on but that is quite loud. In all we had an absolutely incredible stay and cant wait to come back.",5,2020,12,16
221,Iveagh Garden Hotel,"Fabulous place for a city break for couples, friends, girls. Staff so accomodating and the food was really great. Plus the cocktails!!!!

221,Fab fab fab,"After reading some really bad reviews on this hotel was very nervous of staying! Bad food, service etc etc
Well all I can say is - we had a wonderful experience!! Everything from the decor, staff, dinner  to covid prevention procedures was excellent! Yes the bar closed at 11pm but get real people thats the government not the hotel! The staff were just excellent in particular Cliff who was our waiter at dinner- and Callan at breakfast! Food was excellent at both!!! 
Honestly such great value of a lovely hotel!! And believe me our standards are very high!
Our experience was faultless!! In fact we are booked again next Thursday so hoping it will be again!! 😀
Don’t hesitate to book!!!",5,2020,12,12
221,Lovely stay,"The staff at the Iveagh were really lovely and accommodating and followed all the government guidelines so we felt safe the entire time. The breakfast included in the stay was excellent and the atmosphere from the lobby to the bar was really nice and Christmassy, almost felt like normal! Will defintley be back.",5,2020,12,11
221,Super Stay,Super Hotel in the heart of Dublin. Would highly recommend it for all trip types. Food was great. Lovely room and comfy bed. Great value overall. Staff were very friendly and couldnt do enough for us.  Thanks! ,5,2020,12,11
221,Amazing Stay,Stayed one night and our experience from start to finish was amazing! The Christmas decorations In the lobby were beautiful. The staff were brilliant and was able to answer any queries. The room was beautiful and very clean. We booked a deal and had dinner and breakfast included. The dinner at Elle’s bistro was amazing and all the staff that served us were brilliant. 10/10 stay would book again,5,2020,12,10
221,Shopping trip,"We really enjoyed our stay, the service was efficient and friendly from start to finish. The hotel is in a great location to access Grafton Street and Camden Street areas.  We will be back next year we hope!",5,2020,12,10
221,A very enjoyable stay,"Stayed in Iveagh Garden hotel overnight with dinner included. Food was good and I’m fussy! Staff make that hotel, so friendly and welcoming. Very clean and felt safe in regards to Covid safety protocols. Amazing location, the beautiful Iveagh Gardens park behind the hotel, a 5 minute walk to Grafton Street. Very easy to get to by public transport, car or taxi. I would highly recommend this hotel and will return. ",5,2020,12,10
221,Dec 4th,"Stayed in this hotel when the first reopened after Covid 19 closure, Felt very safe with the hotels covid procedures . Hotel was very welcoming and rooms was fabulous and breakfast was very well organized. Will defiantly be back.",5,2020,12,09
221,Disappointed,"Room was lovely as was hotel but Staff were rude and dismissive .. breakfast was very average as was the  dinner that  evening with  very little choice on menu and we felt we were putting staff out by asking for extra drinks etc!!

putting waiting staff out by asking for drink etc .. wont stay again",3,2020,12,08
221,"Great Location, more attention to detail needed","Apart from initial experience (no friendly welcome at front desk and no record of the package booked, dinner reservation or pre payment receipt, had to provide proof via my phone and reconfirm booking which was very strange. The room was comfortable, clean and hotel lobby had a wonderful festive atmosphere. We were however refused a nightcap @11pm after we took a walk around the grounds only to find the barman randomly serving other guests when we questioned this he responded ""oh ok what do you want then but last one"" felt like scolded children. The dinner downstairs of Turkey and Ham also not great quality and waitress couldn't accommodate any request off the menu for eg my husband requested cranberry sauce, it felt like heated microwave food of sub standard, we much preferred the breakfast on the main floor the downstairs area felt like dining in a nightclub imo. The package I purchased I assumed was good value however for the hotel it was made feel like a bargain basement night away and unfortunately ruined the overall romantic experience for us both. ",3,2020,12,08
221,Great experience,"A most enjoyable experience in this hotel with my friends. We’ll b back ... I have no negative comments about this hotel...the staff, the food in the Elle restaurant...all good ... the rooms very clean and comfy...",5,2020,12,08
221,Great Value.,"We really enjoyed our stay but were let down by a few simple things. Service staff out of their depth, menus mains unavailable, and the lack of gluten free beer that we were assured would be available was disappointing. ",3,2020,12,08
221,"Good Hotel, poor restaurant service.","This is a lovely hotel, comfortable, trendy decor in a great location. We were very happy with the service on check in and pleased with our rooms.  Unfortunately the service we received in the restaurant and bar was very poor and quite annoying. We had dinner in Ellie's Bistro and arrived on time for our 8.15 booking.  We were not approached by a single staff member by 8.55 and had to go in search of one to take our order.  The order was taken, both food and drinks but only the drinks were brought.  One member of our party did not get her drink for a further twenty minutes.
Our food arrived at 9.15, four main courses, but we had ordered two starters which 
had not been delivered ahead of the mains.  We promptly cancelled the starters.
When we got the bill we were charged for the starters we had cancelled.
After dinner we went out to the Bar and had one round of drinks.  When we ordered a 
second round we waited for twenty minutes.  I went to the Bar to say they hadn't arrived and the Bar Man showed me that the order was ready on a tray for delivery.  
However they had a mistakenly poured a glass of white wine and we had ordered red 
wine.  The order was changed and we got our drinks 25 minutes after we ordered them.  Again we were charged for the white wine that we had to send back because we had ordered red. In all we were charged for two starters and one glass of wine 
that we had rejected.  We feel as these were mistakes made by the restaurant staff 
they should have taken care not to include the items on our bill. Had we not noticed the mistakes on both the food and drinks bill we would have been over charged by approximately 30 euro.  
So overall we enjoyed our stay from an accommodation point of view but the catering service was poor and disorganised.",3,2020,12,07
221,Favourite Hotel.,"Superb Location, stunning Hotel, great food and even better cocktails.  The rooms are spacious and spotlessly clean.  Lovely Foyer to sit and relax and watch the world go by. Elles garden is a lovely heated outdoor space just perfect for a Cigar and nightcap.  ",5,2020,12,07
221,Start of our Christmas,An excellent way to start our Christmas.  Staff were very friendly and helpful. The service was great too. The location of the hotel is excellent .  Definitely recommend this hotel and will book again ourselves too.,5,2020,12,06
221,Ellie's Bistro and Bar,I visited here for lunch and drinks with friends.They have a gorgeous and warm outdoor area with lovely food and drinks.The espresso martini's were sensational! Look forward to returning soon.     ........ ,5,2020,12,05
221,Really enjoyable,"While the rooms were lovely, it was the staff and service who made our stay really great. Location is super also, really central and within easy walking distance of lovely places to eat and interesting places to visit.",5,2020,11,26
221,Mini Wedding Staycation!,We stayed at the Iveagh Garden Hotel for 2 nights after our Mini wedding (our big wedding is postponed to next year due to covid). We were upgraded to the president suite which was amazing. A fabulous suite with an enormous balcony.We had champagne afternoon tea which was delicious!All the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The hotel was great with regards to its Covid policies. Thank you for a lovely stay.  ,4,2020,10,25
221,Dublin staycation,"We stayed to celebrate my partners 40th birthday. I had mentioned this in advance so there was a thoughtful birthday card and petit fours on arrival to the room - this was a nice touch. 
Overall our stay was pleasant and nice however two things I feel tainted it for us - the heat in the bedroom was too much - we had the heating off and there was no aircon. The dyson fan in the room did nothing to rectify this, and the small window available to open didnt either. - This led to a sleepless night. While all staff members were very pleasant apart from one - we were told at reception (by the very friendly lady) that we could go to the bar without reservation as we residents, but when greeted in the bar the waitress said this was not correct and when I said what I had been told, she said ""fine sit where you want"" while giving out under her breath... she then didn't come back to serve us so we had to go up to the bar ourselves to ask another waiter. The service was quite slow - from the outside looking in - it looked like there was more than adequate staff for the number of tables in the hotel... The food and cocktails were lovely and the setting is modern, clean and in keeping with a city centre trendy hotel. ",4,2020,10,23
221,Birthday Get Away,"We booked a special deal on the website and it was amazing! The food was delicious, the bed was HUGE, over all a great experience!! Rooms come included with robes which is a plus and not usually common but room also came with a bath!",5,2020,10,20
221,Absolutely terrible,"Stayed here on 17th October . First impression it looks nice 

Staff are all polite and friendly 

Due to lock down they had added extra tables in restaurant as all guests were dining in as local restaurants were all closed 

Surely this defeats the whole lockdown theory . Cause the restaurant was rammed and packed it was really hard to even hear or have a conversation.

 Then they played loud nite club music in the restaurant while people were dining ( not sure who thought this was a good idea as ever guest in there was unhappy )

Then order drinks which took 50minutes to arrive 
Food was canteen-like but restaurant prices 

Room was nice on a positive And sanitising stations on all floors ( see pics)

But overall very disappointing and think it there are a disgrace 

Smart TV does not Connect  to internet 
Many functions on TV Just don’t work. No YouTube , no Netflix
( see pic ) 

Trolleys blocking wheelchair Assistant ( see picture) and no respect for COVID regulations - There are actually dangerous 

Overall poor poor stay and awful experience. I recommend anyone stay somewhere else TBH",1,2020,10,18
221,Beautiful hotel in a great location,Hotel is nicely decorated and in a great location 2 min walk from Stephens Green and around the corner from the Iveagh gardens. Staff were very friendly . The downside was the food dont order the burgers if you expect it to be juicy and the dessert wasnt good . Would stay again but woudnt have dinner there.Breakfast was nice though.,4,2020,10,14
221,Perfect experience,Enjoyed every second of my stay. The staff were all lovely. The room was the nicest I’ve ever stayed in in Ireland! Dinner in Elles bar was lovely and reasonably priced. The service was quick and our waitress was a lovely young girl with curly hair (didn’t catch name!) breakfast was very good quality and lots of choice. Felt very comfortable and safe in regards to Covid. Temperature checked on arrival and sanitizer available. Would recommend to all,5,2020,10,11
221,Stylish oasis in great location in heart of Dublin City.,"Could not recommend higly enough this great new hotel in Dublin's Harcourt Street, which is perched beside Dublin's beautiful and hidden Ivy Garden. We enjoyed our two night stay, during Dublin's lock-down as a result of Covid-19 but always felt safe and welcome by the staff, whose attention to service and residents is top class.   ",5,2020,10,09
221,Urban oasis in central Georgian Dublin,"Having had a long awaited  Birthday trip to Waterford and Cork cancelled owing to Covid travel restrictions we decided to holiday a few km from home in our capital city and I am highly recommending same. I confess to not having heard of the hotel but my search criteria for a quiet, stylish and good value hotel kept me returning to this spot. 
The Iveagh Garden hotel was fabulous from check in to check out. We were upgraded to a room with a little balcony overlooking the  treetops of the same named gardens, A coffee machine, comfortable bed and powerful rain-shower all added to a great stay. Bottled water and Butlers Irish chocolates were a delightful touch. 
The hotel has the feel of an art deco boutique style despite having  approximately 150 rooms with none of the inoffensive neutrality of a larger hotel chain. We dined  that night al fresco in the lovely heated outdoor space as friends joined us and as non-guests could not eat  indoors. The hotel staff were great and welcoming. Staying at a time of uncertainty we were a little apprehensive about being away but this hotel  reassured us with its strict adherence to hygiene standards. Our temperatures were checked every time we re-entered the hotel, sanitisation stations were everywhere, rooms were sealed, staff constantly wiped down surfaces and all wore protective masks. 
Location of the hotel is super -a cool stroll through the Stephens green park gets one to Grafton street and it is right beside the beautiful Iveagh gardens. Harcourt street itself is a beautiful example of Georgian Dublin architecture. It was great to be able to have lunch on Bruxelle's heated terrace, enjoy a few drinks whilst people watching and not to have to go home--'Dublin can be Heaven....' as the song goes.

All in all I really cannot recommend this hotel enough and despite all the negativity and heartache that Covid 19 has brought about we can live a little by seeing what is on our doorstep. In fact the quieter streets and traffic makes for a very enjoyable trip to the city.  I encourage you to take the trip to the city and stay.. why not! This Irish owned hotel offers great deals at the moment and most impressively it sources its energy from the underground Swan river.",5,2020,10,08
221,Great stay!,"I really enjoyed my stay at The Iveagh Garden. The food was lovely and the staff who served us were very attentive. The room was spacious and clean and I felt very comfortable with the efforts the hotel had in place during these times.

I have already booked again for later this month.
Many thanks!",5,2020,10,08
221,Fabulous iveagh gardens,"Fabulous iveagh gardens, do not miss this hidden gem . Beautiful hotel and the staff are so efficient and amazing at what they do , they make you feel so welcome.  The rooms are fantastically bright clean and fresh , great bed too",5,2020,10,05
221,Lovely Saturday Evening with the Girls,"We were a group of 3 girls who needed a get together.  What a great choice we made.  From the moment we walked into the hotel week knew we had made the right choice.  Beautiful  foyer. fantastic colour scheme.  You could just feel the cleanliness.  Nice check-in.   Very strict covid regulations, which made you feel very safe.   Temperatures were taken at all times on entering the hotel.  Bottle of Prosecco in the room.  We went for lunch and when we came back had wonderful cocktail on the terrace, served by lovely staff.  Dinner was booked for 8pm, plenty of social distancing.  Nice food.   Finished with an after dinner drink in the beautiful lobby.  Good breakfast once again served by lovely staff.  I would definitely recommend this hotel.  We finished our stay with a very nice walk in the Iveagh Gardens a hidden gem.  We will be back",5,2020,09,25
221,My few the best Hotel in Dublin City Center,"Superb and excellent
The rooms are very stylish, incl the bathrooms
Staff utterly professional and all your needs are cared for. 
I have been to many Hotels in Dublin City Center, yet I am drawn back to Iveagh Gardens 
A treasure to the City - a true gem",5,2020,09,24
221,Great stay at Iveagh Garden Hotel,"Had an excellent stay with my family. Great hotel, clean and welcoming with friendly helpful staff. Great location  about 5-10 mins walk to Grafton street. Parking is available nearby again a short walk and hotel gives discount on parking rate. Food was delicious and overall stay was great. Would recommend and stay again.",5,2020,09,16
221,Special occasion,Despite Covid19 restrictions everything that could be done while still complying made our stay enjoyable. Great staff great location. This is a homely relaxing hotel with everything within walking distance ,4,2020,09,16
221,Lovely stay in the heart of Dublin,"This was our first stay at the Iveagh Garden hotel. The hotel is beautiful and the staff were extremely friendly and professional. COVID preparations were comprehensive and put us at ease. We stayed in a superior room which was spacious and well laid out, with some nice little extras. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it if you are looking for a city break. ",5,2020,09,15
221,Superb Hotel in Dublin City,"Fantastic overnight stay in this hotel, all Covid restrictions were adhered to by staff and guests. Room was beautiful and extremely comfortable bed. The breakfast was on point as was the location. Top tip, we booked Toners pub for food and drink which is about a fifteen minutes walk from the Hotel which was hugely enjoyable. Also make sure to pop into the Iveagh Gardens for a stroll which is a lovely hidden gem directly behind the hotel. ",5,2020,09,08
221,Dublin Trip,On a recent trip to Dublin we stayed at this beautiful hotel which is in a great location. Every member of staff we dealt with was extremely friendly and helpful.I would have no hesitation recommending it or visiting it again. ,5,2020,09,05
221,Alexandra/Claire Top Notch ❤️,Enjoying a staycation in the city centre & we felt that we have been looked after superbly. Claire was the receptionist who welcomed us in & answered our queries in such a friendly manner. She was a delight to deal with ☺️ We then had a few pre dinner drinks & nibbles in Elle’s Bar & Bistro and we were looked after by Alexandra. The cauliflower tempura was unbelievable (hats off to the chefs!!!) but the highlight was Alexandra’s attention to detail & friendly manner 🙂 She is definitely an asset to this superb team. Her colleague (blonde hair but didn’t get her name!) was also very polite & friendly ☺️ Definitely recommend 🙃,5,2020,09,03
221,Fabulous!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Iveagh.  The staff could not have been more helpful.  We had breakfast and it was delicious.  The rooms were spotless and had everything you could need.  The hotel provides excellent preventative measures to combat Covid-19, and are clearly taking the pandemic very seriously.  Highly recommend this hotel!!",5,2020,09,03
221,Weekend Break,"The hotel is about a 5/6 minute walk to St Stephens green shopping center. The rooms are bright modern and airy. The food in Elle's bistro was very good indeed, so much so we ate there for the two nights of our stay. The menu is a bit limited at the minute and it would be useful to have a choice of items from the dinner menu that those on a package deal could choose from. The bed in the room was on the soft side and we prefer a firmer mattress. The staff from check in to check out could not be faulted. All in all a very good stay in Dublin. Excellent hotel - would highly recommend",5,2020,09,02
221,Gorgeous hotel,Had a one night stay at this beautiful hotel. The rooms are stylish and comfortable. Had a great stay. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a boutique style hotel. The location is perfect. Stephens green just a 5 minute walk! ,5,2020,09,02
221,Dubliners being Dublin tourists!,"The Iveagh Garden made for a great 24hrs break in Dublin City. Very Covid aware, efficient & friendly staff and lovely spacious and well appointed room.

We also had a delicious charcuterie board (part of our overnight offer) in Elle's Bistro. Highly recommended! ",4,2020,08,31
221,My experience,I enjoyed my stay at the Iveagh Garden Hotel in August with my friend as it was my birthday during our stay and I appreciate how helpful and kind the staff were towards us during our time there. I would love to come back very soon.,5,2020,08,30
221,Marvellous ,We stayed just one night but the hotel is very well located in a central and picturesque part of Dublin.  The Covid 19 protocols are all in place and well executed.  The room was spacious and the bathroom was exceptionally well done.  Had lunch and cocktails both were of excellent quality.  The breakfast was wonderful and the staff very helpful.  I would like to give a special mention to the concierge who had a difficult job taking temperatures etc but to his credit at such a stressful time to travel made us feel safe with the extra safety measures that are in place on arrival.  I highly recommend this hotel.,5,2020,08,30
221,Ideal short stay,Great location and atmosphere  choice of cocktails really good. Staff really friendly. Rooms nice and comfortable but pillows no so much. All Covid 19regulations adhered to. A lovely stroll around the Iveagh Gardens which is located at the back of the hotel  just finished our stay perfectly ,5,2020,08,26
221,"Fantastic stay in central, modern hotel.","I have stayed in the Iveagh Garden Hotel twice this Summer. I was so impressed with the hotel and the staff, that I have recommended it to family and friends who have stayed there this week also. The staff are fantastic. Friendly and efficient. The rooms are spotlessly clean. The correct precautions are taken with regard to Covid 19 and we felt very safe. It is now my 'Go To' hotel whenever I travel to Dublin. Thank you for a great stay.",5,2020,08,25
221,Elegant hotel near S.Stephen Green,"Nice, silent and very confortable hotel. Good restaurant inside. Staff controlled temperature to all the guest and there are dispenser of disinfectant at any corner. Fast check in and check out. Nice place to be.",5,2020,08,19
221,Quality and comfortable hotel,I stayed at the Iveagh last week for two nights. The rooms were very comfortable and the staff were very friendly and helpful. I couldn't fault the hotel and would certainly return. The location is perfect within a short walk of Stephen's Green and the city centre. Highly recommended!,5,2020,08,19
221,Excellent experience ,"Enjoyed a one night stay in this hotel in a great location. From arrival to departure the staff were warmly welcoming and very efficient. Compliance with Covid 19 regulations  was very evident. The room was spotless, spacious and equipped with all we needed. Breakfast was good. Looking forward to returning.",5,2020,08,17
221,Amazing Hotel,Will def return. Great hotel in the heart of the city. Breakfast was amazing & we had dinner in The Bistro. We sat in the outside part which is just beautiful especially when it’s gets a bit dark. We were given a room upgrade on arrival for no reason which is always great. Friendly staff who couldn’t do enough for you. We will def return another time here. Walking distance to everything but also on the luas line if you don’t want to walk..,5,2020,08,17
221,Short staycation break that surprised us,"I felt that I would have liked to have given a five star rating as we, as a family, enjoyed this short break in Dublin, and whilst there were a couple of issues (most completely out of the control of the hotel) that took away from our stay, it did not, in my view, take away hugely from the experience for us, so much so that we have vowed to return to the Iveagh Gardens Hotel. The rooms were very comfortable, well presented and spotlessly clean. The staff were more than friendly and accommodating, in difficult circumstances with the Covid 19 restrictions. The central location is a great bonus. One major plus for us is the dedication of the Iveagh to running an eco friendly hotel and a commitment to a carbon neutral existence. The value was something to behold for a city centre hotel, but that may have been due to the lack of demand in the current Covid crisis. 

One problem is the lack of parking and drop off facilities. They have an arrangement with the Q carpark in St Stephens Green where you get a discounted rate if you are staying in the hotel. It is an 8 minute walk from the car park and if the weather is inclement or you have a large amount of luggage, it would be an issue. Thankfully, neither the weather or amount of luggage was an issue for us. 

Another issue was the failure of our air conditioning system to work in our room. It was a particularly warm evening and night and the temperature remained high for most of the night.

We had alternative arrangements made for dinner and breakfast, so I am not in a position to judge their food service, but we will try this out the next time. There was an outdoor eating area which looked fantastic, particularly as it was a lovely evening. We had some drinks in the bar and the layout was very pleasant and the staff were very friendly and efficient.

The actual Iveagh Garden public park is located beside the hotel and is very enjoyable for a morning walk. 

In short, this is a place I would recommend as a place to stay and I look forward to returning to experience the food service and I can update my review. ",4,2020,08,15
221,Disappointing Experience ,"Stayed here for 1 night as the hotel has always looked nice from the outside.  Unfortunately the majority of staff were not warm or friendly at all. The Eastern European gentleman on reception was more concerned about taking everyone’s temperature than actually welcoming guests in a friendly manner. Whilst I do understand the importance of Covid measures, the check-in was quite cold-mannered. Upon check-out one of the female staff members behind desk was gossiping about a previous guest. Yes we can hear you loud and clear from the lobby.  

Breakfast room is really nicely decorated but sadly the breakfast was let down by staff who could not cope with the number of guests. It was hilarious.  None of the staff apart from a young Irish female waitress smiled.  So rude.  I ordered a tea which took forever to order & it was hurriedly plonked on my table & they forgot the milk. I did not manage to catch staff attention to correct this since they all looked so stressed and unfriendly. Was not offered any condiments with breakfast which is not cheap. 

This hotel has potential given the location & the decor but the staff really let it down and need training on customer service. I have stayed in hotels all over the world including in Dublin & given the Covid situation, one would think the staff would welcome guests & be more friendly to encourage them to return. What a shame. Disappointing. Expected more friendly service from Ireland but this was not the Irish hospitality I have been used to elsewhere. ",3,2020,08,11
221,Great Hotel ,"We stayed in the Iveagh Garden Hotel for one night. The contact, pre arrival, was excellent, in-line with current Government Guidelines. We we arrived our temps were taken and everything was explained really well. Our room was lovely and everything was good. 
I have to say the beds (twin beds) were quite uncomfortable (there was definitely a slope on my bed) and the sheets weren’t great either. Not what I would have expected for a hotel of this standard. The Tv wasn’t working properly either, but that’s wasn’t an issue and we mentioned it on check out.
Our breakfast this morning was also just Ok. Firstly we were offered a choice of tables - which was good - but some of the tables were very close together and therefore, I believe, not adhering to the minimum distance between tables. This bothered me. The breakfast obviously is now a very different experience to “normal times” as the Buffet style can’t operate, and whilst Im sure hotels are doing what they can, I just feel that it wasn’t being managed as best it can be in a hotel of that standard. I would have expected a better service. 
I know the current situation within the Hospitality Industry is very challenging and Hotels are doing what they can to survive. I just think a few extra little things will make it even better. ",4,2020,08,10
221,Great hotel,Lovely hotel. The room are stylish and bar is lovely. Very clean and staff are friendly. Cocktails pornstar and 50 shades are the best I have had. Breakfast is good. 1 star off as room had no fridge and no pancake or French toast for breakfast which I love bit would totally recommend this hotel. great stay,4,2020,08,09
221,Really great stay here.,"Just back from a brilliant stay in this hotel. Everything was  perfect. The dinner I had on the Sunday evening was very tasty. I ate the most beautiful steak I have ever eaten, compliments to the chef. Would definitely stay here again. Town is about a five minute walk away.",5,2020,08,03
221,Anniversary staycation,"This hotel makes you realise that Harcourt street is more than just a nightclub area. Warm greeting from the minute we arrived and lovely touches like chocolate, chocolate strawberries and chocolates left on the bed as well as a beautiful Swan display made of the bathroom  towels,  obviously  due to recent  pandemic  known as the Covid-19 pandemic  things like atmosphere  , the social  distancing , and need for staff to wear personal protective  gear to keep themselves  and the guests safe was a bit of a dampener on the experience  but I do very much appreciate  their professionalism  towards those regulations , the bar is beautiful  and very tempting  to sit and enjoy  one too many cocktails  and enjoy  the stylish  outdoor  seating area on a warm evening. One thing to mention would be that we had dinner included in our package on one of the nights, however it was an even smaller menu than the already reduced menu, being told this when making the booking would have aided in the decision to go for that bundle or not. We really enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back. Thanks to everyone who helped make our anniversary even better.",4,2020,07,23
221,Outstanding! Would highly recommend!,"On Saturday me and my partner went out for a nice meal as we are due our baby tomorrow!, as a last night out for the two of us. I have never went into a restaurant and felt so comfortable! Every member of staff was social distancing they had face masks on to match the uniform and were so friendly the food was OUTSTANDING!! And we were not waiting around for our food it was great service our waiter was very polite and catered our every needs! I would highly recommended to anyone who is worried about heading out for a nice meal and tables were spaced out so no one was on top of anyone, hand sanitising stations everywhere and also they took our temperatures when we come in the door. It was like a normal thing we didn’t even feel any way unsafe or uncomfortable! 

Thank you to the staff of Elle’s! We will definitely be back here again! And recommended to friends and family also! 
Chantelle",5,2020,07,07
221,Absolutely fantastic hotel,"If I could rate this hotel any higher I would, very friendly staff and very comfortable rooms, ideally located, close to Grafton street and then temple bar area and city centre isn't that far from Grafton street then",5,2020,07,02
221,Great place to hang out when Dublin closes down!,"We arrived in Dublin just as all the tourist attractions closed due to the COvid-19 virus.  However, if you're going to be stuck with not much to do, this is a lovely place!  Great shower, great bed - athough warm - the duvet was too heavy for us.  Easy to get around from this spot.  There were pubs and breakfast places within walking distance.",5,2020,03,20
221,Great service,We loved our stay at Iveagh Garden Hotel. We had a group of nine and were warmly welcomed upon arrival. We enjoyed the restaurant while there for breakfast and dinner. The rooms were clean and the bed was very comfortable.  Easy walk to St. Stephens Green and all the other things you want to see and do.,5,2020,03,20
221,excellent stay,"Stayed at the hotel for 2 nights to celebrate a wedding.
The hotel is clean, well run and in the city centre just a short walk to shops and bars,
the breakfast is very good with plenty of choice and the bar is well stocked.
Overall it was a great couple of nights and the hotel did a great job with the wedding party as well,
i would definitely stay here again.",4,2020,03,17
221,Fab hotel,Stayed here for a friends party in the hotel. Amazing fabulous  hotel decor beautiful and rooms fab too staff were lovely and great location. Loved the decor. And rooms were fab but a bit too warm but other than this lovely stay ,5,2020,03,12
221,Very Disappointing,"This hotel is not on St Stephens Green and there are no facilities for loading/unloading luggage and the nearest off-street parking is a ten minute walk away. We had  an Executive room which was very poorly lit and smaller than should be expected at this level. The restaurant and bar area is very noisy and we found conversation with our dinner guests very difficult even after changing tables. The breakfast buffet is comprehensive. We had stayed in 6 hotels during a 10 day trip to Ireland, this was the most expensive and by far the worst we experienced and would not recommend or return to it.",2,2020,03,11
221,Amazing stay !,"Myself and  my son stayed here in late January 😊beautiful hotel lobby and bar and restaurant . Hotel is on a very central street  and has a very grand air as all old buildings. We didn’t have a problem with any noise from  the bars  on the street at night  that seemed to annoy other reviewers , rooms were also spacious , clean with a nice bathroom . Would highly recommend this hotel for a stay in Dublin . ",5,2020,03,09
221,Top class stay,"We recently spent a girly night in this fabulous hotel. From start to finish it was an absolute dream. The hotel is spotless and very tastefully decorated. The staff were friendly and courteous. A special mention the gentleman who works at the front of house. We didn’t get his first name but he helped us with our bags, advised on where to get buses and taxis and was great fun to talk with.
The breakfast buffet had a large selection of well prepared fresh fruits, cereals, pastries, hot breakfast, cheese & juices. Again the staff were very attentive to the guests offering tea/coffee and clearing plates from the tables.
Our bedroom was very spacious and immaculate. The bathroom had a large walk in rain shower.
The hotel is in a very central location just minutes from St Stephen’s Green. I will definitely return to this fabulous hotel.",5,2020,03,08
221,Amazing stay,"Excellent hotel in a great location, breakfast is amazing definitely not to be missed. Shower in bathroom is a rain shower head so refreshing. Staff are very friendly would definitely stay again room are very clean..  ",5,2020,03,06
221,Excellent Location,"Great location, wonderful staff, all very helpful and friendly.  Spotless room, lovely food, excellent price paid for room €139 for three of us, well worth it for the location alone - what more can you ask for!",5,2020,03,05
221,excellent hotel," I highly recommend the Iveagh Garden Hotel .an excellent hotel in a great location and excellent friendly staff. Bedrooms very tastefully furnished and spotlessly clean. great breakfast also. would return in a heart beat.",5,2020,03,05
221,Modern new hotel in an amazing location!,"Stayed in a 3 person room at the Iveagh Garden Hotel. It was a perfect location, close to great restaurants, pubs, and attractions. Staff was friendly and accommodations were top notch. I would definitely stay here the next time I am in Dublin",5,2020,03,04
221,CRACKING HOTEL IN A SUPER LOCATION,"Last minute Dublin trip, usual hotel full so decided on here. Stayed in a city pod room, okay it might be small but it’s perfectly functional, well kitted out, clean and stylish. Staff are extremely helpful and great cocktails at the bar! Definitely be coming back!",5,2020,03,04
221,Great but showing a little wear and tear in public areas,"Great location, great service and super rooms. Public areas now looking a little grubby and jaded unfortunately with what looks lke permanent stains on the coffee tables in reception area. A little disappointed.",4,2020,03,04
221,Great hotel,Great hoteL in a lovely location - perfect for a night or for business . The pods provide a cost effective option. Very nice breakfast in a eco friendly hotel.    Highly recommended - have stayed there a number of times ,5,2020,03,03
221,Great value for a family room,"And the room was a decent size too. The hotel itself is lovely, noting there wasn’t  great atmosphere in the bar at night which is a shame as there’s a DJ there. Location is spot on for the Luas and access to shops and bars/restaurants off Grafton st. No negatives we’d stay again.",5,2020,03,02
221,Mid week break in Dublin.,"Lovely hotel, staff very friendly and helpful close to all amenities, would recommend it highly although i would be reluctant to stay there at the weekend because of the proximity of nightclubs to the hotel.",5,2020,03,02
221,Excellent,"We stayed here recently for two nights. Rooms are beautiful. Art Deco/modern style with clearly no expense spared. Shower amazing. Excellent location. Value for money is really incredible compared to other hotels of similar caliber. Stunning Bar and foyer. Food/drinks delicious but you will pay City prices. Same as anywhere In Dublin. Staff very friendly and very helpful. Will definitely be back, any time we’re in Dublin will only stay here now.",5,2020,03,01
221,Excellent  hotel for business and pleasure,Stayed at this hotel on an overnight business trip. Great location and service. Room has all the amenities you need and both dinner and then breakfast were excellent. Staff friendly and knowledgeable. Will definitely stay here next time I am in Dublin.  ,5,2020,02,28
221,Dublin February 2020,Wonderful hotel perfectly located in the heart of Dublin! Stayed for 3 nights with my wife and daughter in a Deluxe Family Room in the 5th floor. NIce restaurant (1900 Bar and Restaurant) and many cosy pubs nearby.,5,2020,02,27
221,"Great stay, beautiful hotel!","Hotel is beautiful, great location 10 min walk to Temple Bar. Clean rooms, friendly staff and overall great hotel! The bar hotel is also a lovely area to have a few drinks and snacks. Not far from Dublin airport. Would definitely stay again.",5,2020,02,26
221,Highly Recommended,"Beautiful hotel in very central location, exceptional staff. Lots of nice touches in the hotel & elegant decor. Nice bar/restaurant area. Very comfortable beds, lots of extras in bathroom . Complimentary water & tea/coffee making facilities in rooms.",5,2020,02,25
221,Weekend in Dublin,"Just arrived home in Belfast from the hotel, great from start to finish, lovely decor, great food, and lovely staff. Best part is the location, a short walk to Camden Street with its bars and restaurants. To the back of the hotel is the lovely Iveagh gardens, hope to return soon.",5,2020,02,24
221,Very nice hotel,"Beautiful hotel and fabulous cocktail bar. Rooms are small but greatly decorated and shower was amazing. No coffee machine and no bathrobes. Superb location close to all the shops, bars, clubs, restaurants and beautiful walks in both parks close by. ",4,2020,02,24
221,Value Quality And Lots Of Class,"The hotel is situated on an old Georgian street with beautiful old houses converted to business`s, nightclubs(copper face jacks only across the street) and of course hotels.

The effect is like stepping back a few hundred years, but still having access to modern conveniences.

The lobby on entry has the desired effect, with bookcases lining the shelves, fireplace and lots of comfortable seating. There is real wildflowers throughout which is a nice touch.

There was a queue on check-in, but dealt with easily and without fuss or pressure from the receptionist. 

The reception area is clean, minimal and without clutter. There is a concierge in the area and available to help and very present in his manner. Dublin accent, bald and super friendly and had a taxi hailed with the magic of an invisible wand.

The rooms have rainforest showers with comfortable and welcoming pastel and crème colours throughout the bathroom.

I also had dinner here and ordered the curry, which was tasty and was eaten with speed and finished off with a shining empty plate.

Breakfast was equally good, if not better again.

To summarise:
I booked this place online at a great value rate and stayed with a group while attending an event at the 3arena. 

The facilities were clean, presentable and staff were helpful throughout my stay. The beds were comfortable with 3 to 4 pillows more that I needed in the bedrooms.

I would stay here again if coming back to Dublin, and this would be the first place I would check for availability.",5,2020,02,23
221,Great Stay,"Stayed here between Christmas and New Year as a present for my other half. Loved our stay - the room was lovely, felt very luxurious and expensive. Bed was huge and super comfortable! Some noise from neighbouring bars and clubs but didn’t disturb us once asleep. 
Breakfast was absolutely fantastic - worth every penny. Great selection and range (hot and cold buffet style). The breakfast room had an equally luxurious feel to it. Staff very attentive- always refilling hot drinks. 
Location was perfect for us, we enjoyed walking to/from different attractions each day. Usually through the shops!! Can see why some people would think it was a little out the way but this is just down to preference. We personally felt it better not being right in the centre. 
Would definitely return when visiting Dublin again.",5,2020,02,23
221,Sunday Night Stay,Delighted to get checked in early upon arrival as we were only asking for luggage to be stored for a few hours.  Really comfortable room. Hotel in great location convenient to walk to shopping area. Enjoyed a meal in the bar and good variety at breakfast.  Will stay again.,5,2020,02,21
221,David & Jennifer’s Dublin trip,"Brilliant hotel, highly recommended will definitely be back soon. Very clean, lovely rooms and bar restaurant area   Nice part of Dublin near St. Stephens Green , also close to Grafton street which is a nice area for bars and restaurants                           

",5,2020,02,21
221,What A Fabulous Surprise,"This hotel was booked for me by the company and what a fabulous find as I was not aware of it 
Great room and breakfast and dinner in the grill was very good 
All the team were very good but the person who stood out for me was Sean who is brilliant at his job and a great communicator",5,2020,02,19
221,Very good but.........,"I stayed here for 1 Sunday night in February. Everything was looking good——warm welcom, good sized room, very comfortable, nice bathroom, fluffy towels, OK breakfast ( except the scrambled egg was reconstituted, the smoked salmon was fishy) so what was wrong? Nothing much except the room was dark. I don’t mean slightly gloomy, I mean DARK. Dark so you need the torch on your phone to find your specs. Impossible to read a book. That dark! Until, that is, you give up and move a chair under the lamp by the door. A very helpful young man called Adam brought me an additional lamp but a desk lamp doesn’t help if you want to settle down with a book for a couple of hours does it?
Full marks for the eco natural toilet paper. But I suggest the manager tries using it. Enough said.
The other minor irritation which does not even apply to me, except that I always look at the 1 star reviews is the way the management have a word for word identical response to all criticism. At least pretend to have read it!
I would come again but hope that by that time they will have done something about the lighting",4,2020,02,17
221,Slightly Off,"The lobby seemed nice, but a lot of the issues came after check-in and were what seemed like cost cutting on multiple levels.  First, the room I had was oddly laid out with a double bed and twin, which was squeezed in the corner.  I went to use the restroom, which was subarctic and had no way of increasing the temperature.  So, I thought I would just go work out.  I looked up in the directory and it said under Fitness Center to see the front desk for a pass to the local gym. A That actually seemed like a great option until I realized that the ""complimentary"" pass (as printed on the pass) was a 15 Euro charge.  I think after that I was hyper sensitive about things for a four star hotel...very cheap hangars, housekeeping that had to be requested, etc.

So, nothing egregious, but not really up to how I think about a four star place.",3,2020,02,16
221,Valentine's Special ,"We have just arrived back from our stay at the iveagh Garden Hotel. We got the Valentines Deal which included B & B and an evening meal. The positives included the Hotel reception area was fabulously decorated, the reception staff were very welcoming and the attention to detail in the room was fab for Valentines. The negatives were we were seated at our table for 9PM as booked for dinner, we waited and waited to get menus but didnt receive any so we had to ask for same, then we waited nearly 40 minutes for our starters to arrive, the food was nice and presented well though. Then we went down for breakfast told to take a seat wherever we liked and tea and coffee would be offered - again we waited around 20 minutes before we had to ask for same, we poured milk into our tea and coffee and some of it sat on the top where it must of been left sitting in the jug since early morning, I explained this to a waiter who was very nice but there was a clear language barrier as she was questioning did I want the milk heated etc however did rectify the problem. I think it's clear the service needs to improve as this is a 4 star hotel.. ",3,2020,02,15
221,Perfect location and super friendly service,"We spend 5 nights at the Iveagh Garden Hotel in February 2020 and we really liked it.
The hotel is very nice, the service very friendly and the location PERFECT.
We were in 2 rooms one after the other: 1104 (superior) et 5118 (standard). Both rooms were very nice and very well decorated. Unfortunately, none of these rooms had ANY storage space to put our clothes besides the hangers and the desk small drawer, so just be prepared if you stay for more than one or 2 nights.
In the room 1104 we could hear the TV when it was used in the room next door and unfortunately we could also hear the tram in the street (but honestly not too bad).
Besides the lack of storage in the room 5118, we LOVED it. So much cozier and quiet than the room 1104. Hard to believe that it is a standard room and not a superior room.
In both rooms, the thermostat was not working properly: the temperature announced was totally different from the actual temperature in the room and we had to use the heater manually, but that was ok.
Overall we had a very nice experience and we would go back and make sure that we can get a room on the garden side and note the street side.",4,2020,02,11
221,Iveagh Gardens Hits The Mark,"The Iveagh has a real boutique hotel feel but has all the trapping and service of a top end hotel. Really nice service in a great location right in the heart of Dublin.
The food menu was limited though they did make the effort to offer and cook up some alternatives that were not on the menu.
Not being a meat eater - I was offered fish and chips (which was not on the menu) and their caesar salad with salmon was delicious.",5,2020,02,10
221,Nice stay,"Nice hotel with comfortable beds and a good breakfast and breakfast area. 
Nice calm area, and not far walking to restaurants and pubs. 

They don’t offer meeting rooms, but we were offered meeting rooms at Harcourt hotel, just 2min walk from the hotel. This is not a good option. Their Green room was not meant for 10 people working. It smelt horrible, was either too hot or too cold, no windows to open and very bad equipment. Lunch was very good in their cafe/cantina. ",4,2020,02,10
221,Rugby weekend with wife,"First impressions of the hotel was very positive. Clean and very well presented. Staff were very polite and helpful. Room was more than adequate for the two of us and the bathroom was quite large and spotlessly clean. Now for the negatives: the selection of TV channels were limited and could not get any programme scheduling. Programmes kept pixelatting and losing sound throughout the stay. As far as the food goes the menu was very limited for the class of hotel. The choice of food was almost the same for lunch/brunch as it was for dinner. Also if you require room service between 22:00 and 23:00 you’re out of luck! After 23:00 you can get a cheese and ham or chicken sandwich that’s it!! 
The stay was let down by the poor menu choices and poor room service.",3,2020,02,09
221,Excellent hotel,"This is a stunning hotel with very glamorous decor. The check in was efficient and we were taken to our huge room on 5th floor. For a city this is an exceptionally large spacious room which was lovely and airy with a large window spanning full length of room. The room itself was very clean and all the amenities you will need. 
we had lunch & breakfast in the restaurant and was very impressed! Great prompt service in a lovely setting. 
The staff were all very helpful and made the stay even more special. 
Location wise it’s very central to everything with the green luas line a few minutes walk. 
Look forward to returning! ",5,2020,02,09
221,"Fantastic hotel, even with an 8 month old baby!","Our stay at Iveagh Gardens was excellent. Ahead of staying we requested a cot and a room to be in a quieter section of the hotel, all of which was provided and our room was great. Even with our excessive amount of luggage, pram etc, the room was very sizeable and nicely furnished (the whole hotel is). The room was slightly warm, but we were on the 5th floor so maybe expected, but there was several fans in the room but we didn’t feel the need to use these. Concierge was very welcoming and consistently offered to help. Overall we were very satisfied with the hotel and wouldn’t think twice about returning and recommending it. Surrounding area really cool aswell, nice bars and restaurants a street or so away. ",5,2020,02,04
221,Rugby weekend ,"Pleasant hotel with attentive staff. Clean rooms and excellent shower. Just one night spent there. Beds good but better duvet would be a plus. Ideal location near the Green. But noisy in the early hours with the clubs nearby. 
Would return. ",4,2020,02,03
221,Perfect hotel for Dublin,"Very comfortable, beautiful hotel. Friendly, helpful staff and the location is perfect for sightseeing in Dublin. I was able to walk to all the sights I wanted to visit really easily, then back for a relaxing drink in the bar and a good night’s sleep.",5,2020,02,02
221,Recommended for a brief stay,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and found it very worthwhile. The staff were incredibly helpful, the hotel was generally clean although our room was not cleaned very well on the one day (nothing serious) and our Aircon had been switched off because, as was explained to us, it was there for heating purposes only. The bar is worth having a few drinks at, and we really enjoyed the breakfasts. It's very well located however, difficult to unload a car at because the tram lines are directly in front of the entrance. We have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.",4,2020,01,31
221,"Great hotel, great location, great service but please turn down the heat.","Extremely handy for a group of friends intending to go out on the town. Couldn't fault anything, great service, lovely friendly staff and decent rooms for the price but the heat in the room was so uncomfortable for sleeping. It was 27 degrees all weekend, we couldn't turn off the heat or open a window. We were on the ground floor so was noisy but you couldn't expect anything else in thiz location. Lobby is beautiful for hanging around in. We had brunch in the restaurant which was very slow but otherwise tasty and good value. ",4,2020,01,30
221,Iveagh Garden hotel,"Great hotel convenient location lovely decor and friendly staff, would definitely stay there again, Iveagh gardens direct behind hotel and just a stroll from Grafton St, didn’t have breakfast but lunch was really lovely ",5,2020,01,28
221,Love this Hotel,"Have stayed at this hotel several times and love it. Never any issue, always spotless, extremely comfortable and amazing customer service. And incredible value for money. I always recommend this hotel to all my family and friends. ",5,2020,01,27
221,Lovely hotel,"We had a lovely stay at the Iveagh Garden. 
Fantastic location. Fabulous fire in the lounge/reception area. Pretty bedroom and superb walk in shower but twin beds a little too narrow. 
Didn’t have the breakfast as a little pricey but might try next time.",4,2020,01,20
221,Weekend stay with teenage girls,"Great location, clost to St Stephen's Green. Short walk to shops, restaurants and bars.
Hotel is stylish and very clean.
Staff are helpful. 
The bar was well staffed (although still a little slow).
I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2020,01,15
221,"Excellent hotel but too noisy due to disturbances in the middle of the night from nightclub! Breakfast was outstanding,","Excellent hotel but sleep was badly disturbed due to nightclub facing the hotel- the breakfast was gorgeous, the bar is beautiful, staff very helpful and friendly, room modern and very clean! Would recommend if you know the night club won’t be in or are happy to loose a couple of hours sleep ",4,2020,01,15
221,Great accommodation in great location,"This is an excellent, well run hotel in a perfect location for any trip to the city. The staff are always friendly and helpful. The rooms are always spotless. This was my first time in a room fronting on yo harcourt st and thought noise might be an issue but it wasn’t. Can’t speak highly enough of this hotel. Breakfast great too. Hard to believe this value is available in the city centre ",5,2020,01,14
221,A home from home stay.,A very comfortable and new hotel. Found the staff very friendly and very accommodating. The hotel was very clean. Excellent and tasty breakfast served. Bar food was very tasty and good value for money. Great location.,5,2020,01,13
221,Great hotel,"My wife booked this for a post Christmas trip of 3 days. We flew in on Friday morning and were at the hotel for around 9.30am. Amazingly we were able to check in and get a room straight away. The room was spacious with a safe and great shower.
Breakfast choice was excellent and no shortage of food.
The bar was equally as good and there were always plenty of staff on hand all willing to help.
The location is great for restaurants and Grafton Street.
Having stayed at other hotels in Dublin this was the best and we would stay here again without question ",5,2020,01,12
221,Highly recommend the Iveagh Garden Hotel,"Our experience at the Iveagh Garden Hotel was great,   From the moment we arrived the staff was attentive and friendly.  We had a medical emergency in our room on our first night and I appreciated the concern and professionalism of the staff, specifically Jullienne and Gary during the night.  

This hotel is in a great location and within walking distance of Saint Steven's Green Park and Grafton Street restaurants and shopping.   We also had easy access to the Luas which made getting around very easy.

We definitely plan to stay here again!",5,2020,01,11
221,Great location & staff let down by poorly designed room layout,"Here for 6 nights to work. Very very frustrated by shocking room design hence the rating.
So to balance the review here are the +ves
Great location
Friendly helpful staff
Decent breakfast 

Negatives
The room is small though the shower is a good size
Lighting is terrible, could not see to iron or write
No effective place to work on a laptop; worst I've been in for ergonomics for a business person.
Terrible clothes storage.
I had pillars in my room made it a very small space
The iron and ironing board attached to each other and make it almost impossible to properly iron a shirt.
I would not stay here again simply as not possible to work in your room.",2,2020,01,11
221,Great stay...,"We regularly stay in dublin in different hotels but Iveagh Gardens is defintely a first pick for us from now on. 
On arrival the first impressions of the hotel were lovely,  the decor and cleanliness of the hotel was to a very high standard. The staff were very friendly at reception and made us feel very welcome. 
Our room was spacious and very clean. 
Even though we didnt get to use the facilities of the bar/restaurant they looked fab. 
We will defintely be back up for another night to avail of them.",5,2020,01,10
221,Best high-end hotel value in Dublin!,"Great new hotel in Dublin!  Friendly staff, great rooms with nice bathrooms.  Bar and restaurant are great, as well. Convenient location within walking distance of St Stephens Green, Grafton Street shopping district, and Temple Bar.",5,2020,01,08
221,Beautiful hotel and the best of Irish hospitality!,"Family of 5 from late teens to 80 year old aunt this hotel was perfect for everyone. We stayed 4 nights late December. It is the one hotel that is exactly as the photos portray. Minutes walk from Grafton street, everything no more than 20mins walk away and tramway on the doorstep to all places to visit.
The rooms very comfortably and clean, my only gripe was no robes or slippers but.....
The bar was beautiful and all the hotel staff from reception, bar and waiting staff to room cleaners, everyone was very helpful and pleasant at all times!
Thank you Paul the concierge who gave us wonderful suggestions for restaurants etc. 
The breakfast was the only meal we had there and it was well worth getting up for!
I would highly recommend this hotel!",5,2020,01,08
221,A great place to stay,"Very good hotel, ideal for an extended weekend visit. Room very comfortable and clean. Also quiet despite being in the centre of town which meant it was well positioned for getting out and about. Breakfast was well stocked.",5,2020,01,07
221,Dublin stay,"Great location for Dublin city, staff all lovely, decor great.  We changed rooms when we arrived and there was no problem at all (the 1st room was a strange shape and the TV was a million miles from the bed).  That was the only reason for the move.",4,2020,01,07
221,Dublin City weekend break.,We stayed with friends  for the Gatsby New Year's Eve experience and really enjoyed it. The evening was 1920s style attire with a swing band performing hits from the swing era. The hotel is in a super location for visiting Dublin with shops and amenities close by. Do not miss the breakfast buffet which we enjoyed. You won't leave hungry.,4,2020,01,07
221,Night away,The hotel was excellent. Absolutely perfect for a night away in Dublin.  The hotel leaving tasty chocolate dipped strawberries with a happy birthday note was a lovely touch. The hotel itself was very elegant and all the staff were friendly and professional.,5,2020,01,06
221,Fab hotel!,"Overall fab hotel, couple small things re the room (TV very far from bed and no lights in the area of the dressing table and wardrobe). Great value for money and in a fab location. Would stay again!!!",5,2020,01,05
221,Lovely hotel,"Me and my partner stayed here for new year and first impressions it was a lovely hotel, even from the outside. The room was spotless, no request was to much. The hotel is close to everything - highly recommend. It was also very easy to get to and from the airport.. around €30.00 one way. ",5,2020,01,05
221,Perfect Stay,"The location is ideal, service is spectacular, and everyone was uncommonly kind and friendly and helpful. Called me by my name, which is just unheard of with the volume of customers. Such a wonderful stay. ",5,2020,01,04
221,An amazing NYE party,"Attended the NYE party , it was amazing .. great service, band, food , and amazing decor . Highly recommend  this hotel . The location is so handy to Stephens Green for shopping and lots of clubs and bars in this area .",5,2020,01,04
221,Central location with great rooms and service,"The hotel location is very central and close to everything. Many restaurants, pubs, clubs and shops are withing walking distance.

221,A gem in the heart of Dublin,"A beautiful hotel, located in the heart of Dublin. Great for shopping eating & drinking. Bedroom are modern & tastefully decorated. Staff are friendly but not intrusive. Breakfast was delicious. Overall good value for a great service & location ",5,2020,01,03
221,Lovely stay,"Lovely hotel, easy walking distance to the city centre.  Delicious breakfasts and comfortable clean rooms.  Only recommendation would be to have much, much better lighting in the rooms.  Only gave 4* for sleep quality was because I found the bed a tad too hard.",5,2020,01,03
221,New Year’s Eve ,"Just back from a two night stay in the Iveagh Garden with my wife over New Years Eve. The hotel is excellently situated especially to the south side of the city but the Luas is literally on your doorstep. The hotel is spotlessly clean and fabulously decorated. Only slight gripe was I thought the reception staff could of been friendlier all very serious on check in and out. Special mention to Glen in the bar who was brilliant during our stay, so friendly but professional ",5,2020,01,02
221,Iveagh Garden Hotel Harcourt Street Dublin,"Had a great time here, fabulous location, great staff and all the pre-organisation superbly handled by Tristan. A great New Years Eve party as well. Good rooms, good breakfast and would definitely stay here again. Thomas Hennessy",5,2020,01,02
221,Wedding reception- perfect venue ,"We held our wedding reception in the Iveagh garden hotel on 28th December 19 and couldn’t have picked a better venue. From my initial contact Rachel and her team went above and beyond for us and made our day perfect. Nothing was too much trouble- even when we realized we forgot flowers one of the team ran out to get them for us. We had dinner upstairs in a smaller room then a party for 200 in the downstairs room. Everyone who attended has commented on how fantastic the venue is. I’d looked at a few venues around the city and The Iveagh Garden Hotel was not only the best location and facilities but also the most reasonable. Our family stayed over night and the rooms are much bigger than I’ve seen elsewhere in Dublin city, we had no noise and breakfast the next morning was delicious. ",5,2020,01,02
221,Fantastic hotel in Georgian Dublin,"My wife and I spent three nights in this fantastic hotel between Xmas and New Year. It was the first time we stayed here and we would certainly go back. It's location is excellent for shopping on Grafton street or as we did Dundrum shopping centre as the Luas (tram) stop is just 50m from hotel door and it only takes 20 mins to Dundrum. All the staff were excellent from the ""two Seans"" at the concierge desk to Yuri and David behind the bar as well as all the other table and waiting staff and receptionists. Our room was a good size with a very comfortable bed with ensuite bathroom and shower. I know that the hotel has got some poor reviews because of the noise from the Niteclubs across the street but our room was to the rear and we had no complaints.We did not have dinner in the hotel but had breakfast each morning. The breakfast was excellent quality but it was the same choice each morning which disappointed us a little. The hotel is on the next street across from the very lively Camden st with it's plethora of restaurants and bars so there's plenty of entertainment just around the corner. All in all we had a great stay and would highly recommend this well run hotel.",5,2020,01,02
221,Great hotel but very noisy at night,"Lovely hotel but on a street which is full of clubs at night , very difficult to fletp iv uly are in the front rooms , would suggest you book rooms at the back of the hotel,  location during the day is ideal as its very close to Stephen's Green and Graffton Street ",2,2020,01,01
221,Very disappointed,When On arrival there was a confusion on what we had booked... we had booked afternoon tea..obviously there was a wedding on while we were there and a mix up with our booking ...  very disappointed with How this was dealt with that we ended up choosing to  eat else were ...   booking was confirmed through email from hotel with me the previous day.. hotel had also knew this was a birthday celebration ... very disappointed!!,1,2019,12,31
221,Outstanding boutique hotel a stone’s throw from Grafton St,"Delicious food, 5 star bedrooms, extremely warm and helpful staff, exquisite surroundings...... I honestly can’t find fault with this hotel. We will definitely pay another visit very soon. Location couldn’t be more perfect for us ",5,2019,12,31
221,Classy spot,"Love this hotel. Great food, amazing cocktails and spotlessly clean. Very reasonably priced too for a city centre hotel of this quality. Easy to get to and the staff were so nice and helpful. I loved it.",5,2019,12,31
221,Iveagh Garden Hotel,It was the venue for my Daughters Wedding.  It was an absolute pleasure from start to finish.  Nothing was a problem.  They treated us all exceptionally.  We had the time of our lives.  The staff were second to none and I would recommend the hotel to anyone.  Thank you so much for making a special day even more special,5,2019,12,28
221,We had our wedding reception on December 14th and Tristan and his team could not do enough for us!!,"We recently held our wedding reception in the Iveagh garden hotel and we cannot say enough great things about them. Tristan and his team were fantastic. From the initial inquiry stage to the role out of the big day all of our requests where heard and accepted. The food was fabulous all of our guests said so and the atmosphere was beautifully festive. We are so happy we decided to hold our reception here it’s now our special place and already looking forward to regularly stopping in for some food and drinks! Thanks so much again Tristan and team not only is but all of our guests told us how happy they were with their stay and the whole day and night!

221,City centre hotel,"Fantastic hotel, location is perfect, staff so friendly, rooms are superb, recently stayed for our wedding anniversary, our room was upgraded with fruit & chocolates, which was a lovely touch, definitely highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,12,25
221,Great place to be with Friends or Family,"Breakfast and room service was perfect.
The check in and Check out was really fast with no problems.
The bar have many different kind of drinks and beers.
The room was with much space, the bad was comfortable and everything was very clean.
There is nice pubs and parties around to enjoy the night, and parks to relax and enjoy the view.",5,2019,12,24
221,Good food,"Came here , nice bar , not too busy , food was very good , shall return. Service was a little hit and miss but good people. New place so interior design is on point , but food was worth and drink was worth it",4,2019,12,23
221,"Fab hotel, great location"," Hotel was so relaxingand stylish. comfortable beds. Lovely breakfast, friendly staff, luas a few mins walk from the hotel or its a Short walk to grafton Street. I would definetely reccomended it and I would  stay  there again ",5,2019,12,23
221,Definitely recommend!,Beautiful hotel with only a short walk to the main part of dublin city. The staff were really friendly and always happy to help and the rooms have been decorated beautifully (lots of effort has been put into the Christmas decorations aswell). Upon arrival they even managed to get us a room at 10:00 in the morning so that we didn’t have to wait although  this isn’t guaranteed. Would  recommend to everyone!!! Thank you Iveagh Garden for a wonderful stay.,5,2019,12,22
221,Overnight stay,Wonderful hotel with very friendly and helpful staff.  Food excellent and good value.   Very central location with Luas nearby.  Lovely decor and very comfortable bedrooms.  Would highly recommend this hotel and hope to stay here again in the future.,5,2019,12,19
221,"Beautiful Hotel, great atmosphere","This was my third time staying in the Iveagh Hotel and defiantly wont be my last. The staff are super friendly and helpful, great atmosphere, lovely comfortable room. 
The bar is always buzzing, and cocktails are fab! 
Overall amazing hotel, we will be back (hopefully soon!) ",5,2019,12,19
221,Watch out you don't get left out in the cold!,The front door was locked when we arrived back tired at around 1am. No warning when we checked in and no entrance code given.  We were left waiting until the barman decided to come an answer the bell  despite ringing and knocking many times.   Freezing night so unpleasant and not what you expect of a first class hotel.  Make sure you ask about their entrance policy at night.  To add insult to injury when we were finally let in there were many people sitting enjoying a drink at the bar on just the other side of the door.,2,2019,12,15
221,"Lovely hotel, good food drinks and friendly staff.","Fantastic location, just off the path to bars/clubs etc that walk for 10/15 mins up to central. These are plenty of things within a few moments walk and this is a great hotel with friendly staff, good facilities and in a nice area. ",5,2019,12,15
221,The Iveagh was perfect!,"The hotel was perfect, location, price, everything. The bar staff were brilliant, and the cocktails were lovely. Wifi was very good, no issues at all. The room was warm, spacious and comfortable. There is nothing about the hotel I can doubt",5,2019,12,12
221,"Charming hotel, very good service","Enjoyed a two night stay at Iveagh Garden. The property is charming and well located. Rooms are modern with sleek European decor, and the bed was very comfortable. Staff are very helpful and professional.",4,2019,12,11
221,Avoid during holiday party season!,Hotel bar was taken over by hoards of drunk teenagers for their holiday party. Not what you’d expect for a hotel that charges upwards of €300/night. The actual guests couldn’t enjoy the amenities they paid for. ,2,2019,12,10
221,Dublin stay,"I stayed here with my family in early November for my sister graduation. Hotel is lovely and clean and breakfast is amazing. However service in the bar is slow , staff can be been standing around chatting hard to get service. Reception staff are short and abrupt.  Upon checkout there was no interaction literally just hi and bye. Would stay again as the hotel lovely and in great location. Pity about staff just not friendly.",4,2019,12,08
221,"Not a 4 star experience, avoid.","I will start with the nice bits - the lobby looks lovely, it is central, also breakfast was very nice. It is however not a 4 star experience, 3 at the very most, with some of the staff rendering it a 2. So def not getting your money's worth here, much better options in Dublin. We stayed here twice on 2 separate occasions. Once was our anniversary, although we let them know in advance it was the first time ever staying at 4 and 5 star hotels that no one bothered to acknowledge it. Deluxe room was just ok, quite dark and small... Reception staff was short, did not want to accept my debit card to pay for the room upfront as the reservation was made in my husband's name, and I nearly felt they were going to turn me away to get cash. Awkward and embarrassing. I let it go as I thought it maybe just a slip..No mint tea in room so really no choice if you don't want caffeine in the evening. 'After the experience yesterday though, we will not return. The gentleman checking me in was very nice and polite, I will say that. Same rigmarole with the debit card though. Room was nice for a change, bigger windows. Took me 5 min to realize AC wasn't working, boiling hot, AC had a big sticker on it saying HEATING ONLY, when I rang to ask for help they moved me straight away so i'm guessing they were just chancing it. I got an upgrade of a bath, i was wrecked from traveling and walking so I was quite happy with that. New room was a lot smaller than the first one, bit of a dungeon with a small window. Some upgrade. I let it go as I was looking forward to the bath. Come bath time, surprise, bath isn't working (drain faulty). Rang reception, they sent someone up who agreed and said sorry, not working, change room? seriously? Then I  ask reception if there is anywhere i could get a book from (library), she said no. Sorry.The lobby has literally 3 tall walls COVERED in books. I was so shocked i didn't know what to say....last time I checked 4 stars hotel had books guests were allowed to touch and read. Upon check out i said was not happy with the stay and the bath situation, i got a very dismissive i'm sorry do you want the manager....ah i couldn't even be bothered - so low. I felt I was in McDonald's.  Couldn't wait to get out of there but will never be back.",1,2019,12,07
221,Lovely Hotel but very noisy,I have stayed at this hotel twice now and unfortunately both times I was unable to sleep due to noise. The first time was due to external noise on Harcourt Street as my room faced directly on to Coppers. The second trip I stayed in a City Pod and could hear every single movement from the room next door and extremely loud noises through pipes in the room. The City Pods are extremely cute and practical for a visit and the hotel itself is beautiful in a great location - just make sure to bring earplugs if staying in this hotel. ,3,2019,12,05
221,Beautiful hotel but very bad service.,"Will not stay again and wouldn't recommend this hotel.
This hotel only excepts visa debit cards to pay for room if you wish to have anything charged to your room you will need a credit card.
Very disappointed. ",2,2019,12,05
221,Great location but some issues,"Great location but a few issues, booked a triple room and it was v small with a double and single, very noisy as we were facing onto Harcourt street and the Christmas party season meant the bar area was fully reserved both nights ",4,2019,12,04
221,Comfortable rooms and fabulous breakfast- 4.5 stars,"Stayed overnight at the Iveagh Garden. Its about 150m from tram stops that goes straight into town or southside. Only a short walk into Stephen's Green and the shopping district. I was about 15 minutes early for the 3pm check in and was told my room was not ready. I had traveled for 3 hours and had another appointment and was not prepared to wait. The gentleman checking me in was very polite but his manager noted my disappointment and arranged for another room on the spot which pleased me -I'm sorry I didn't catch her name but great service. The room was elegant, well-furnished with a really spacious wet room style shower. The rest of the room was on the small side and hence the 4 (actually 4.5) instead of 5 stars. Large flat screen TV and very comfortable firm double bed. I had a lovely shower, and slept very well. Morning brought a fabulous buffet breakfast - the best I have had in Dublin ever. Wide variety of cold and hot food, juices - all fresh, pastries and breads, porridge yoghurts with all the trimmings. Tea and coffee served to you at the table. I heard a waitress informing a couple that one could also order omelettes and eggs done in different styles from the kitchen. Absolutely highly recommended. I didn't book the room so I don't know if its value for money but their rooms on the whole and that breakfast puts many other better known hotels to shame.",4,2019,12,04
221,A great spot for a weekend shopping break,Lovely central hotel. Beautifully decorated this Christmas. Lots of breakfast options. If you want to eat in the bar/restaurant you'll need a reservation though. Beds very comfy & rooms clean. Would recommend.,5,2019,12,04
221,Friends Christmas shopping weekend,"The hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas. The room was really comfortable, the furniture all good quality and a really nice style. We were a short walk from the main shopping area of Grafton Street and there were lots of bars nearby. 

Breakfast was amazing, the staff being a large part of this. Naomi who looked after us made sure we had everything we needed and we thought the service was excellent from her. It's not often you get such good service. 

Love this hotel, the staff and the food is also great. 

Will visit again soon",5,2019,12,04
221,City centre hotel atay,"Great hotel in Dublin city centre within walking distance of all main attractions. Fabulous selection of bars, nightclubs and restaurants on the doorstep. Very quiet, comfortable rooms considering the location. Nice bar and restaurant in the hotel if you just want to lounge there with good food too.",5,2019,12,04
221,Not Great,"Staff are pretty unpleasant only person who was good was the doorman. He was absolutely fantastic! Otherwise, Front of House, Night Staff and Bar Staff all poor in our three days here. Also multiple power failures in our room and an extractor fan that you cannot turn off in the bathroom... Just keep the bathroom door shut to minimise the noise... Wouldn't bother with this place again as it has the potential to be a great hotel!",2,2019,12,04
221,Sleepless in Dublin!,"Beautiful hotel in a perfect location for getting out and about in Dublin but whilst it is described on its website as an ‘urban oasis’ it fails to tell you that it is surrounded by a number of clubs, which seem to run until 4am.  This combined with construction work starting outside at 7am meant for a pretty rotten night’s sleep.  Friday night was terrible and Saturday night was bad but better.

There seems to be no sound proofing or even basic noise reduction provided by the windows and we were in a room on the top floor and at the back of the hotel, which should have been the best location.

A real shame - lovely hotel, nice rooms and perfectly good breakfast.  Friendly staff and good central location.  V lively bar in reception area, which is very popular with large groups!

Parking is at a nearby car park but hotel gives you a discount - its still pricey though.  No minibar and rooms are dark but otherwise nice.  

Dublin itself is lovely - plenty to do and a pub every 10m!  People, as you’d expect, are just lovely - very friendly and upbeat.  The town had its Christmas decorations up and it was looking very pretty!",3,2019,12,04
221,City Break,"We have just returned from a one night stay at The Iveagh and could not be more impressed. The hotel is sleek and trendy in design and is a fantastic base within the city centre. We had a beautiful, spacious bedroom and balcony overlooking the Iveagh Gardens. We enjoyed a lovely meal in Elle’s Bistro and a similarly impressive breakfast the following morning. I could not recommend this hotel highly enough and am looking forward to returning again in the near future.",5,2019,12,03
221,Superb!,"Tried this hotel for the first time recently.Was very impressed.Will definitely return.Decor lovely and bar,lounge and foyer areas have a comfy,modern feel.Staff extremely helpful and location is excellent.Breakfast most impressive with a huge variety on offer to suit all palates.Tram line outside hotel so most convenient for getting around the city.Near St. Stephen's Green,shopping centres and theatre.Good value for money and prices not exorbitant unlike other Dublin city hotels!",5,2019,12,02
221,Got it all very right - make sure you ...,"Request a room at the back as much quieter and NOT a ‘pod’. The pods are for folk who just want a bed for the night. Front facing rooms will be noisy as the most popular night clubs in Dublin are on the same road ... suppose you’ll not notice if you are using the clubs!

My room was spotless, welcoming, very well supplied and restocked daily with toiletries and tea etc. Towels changed daily and bed maid. I asked to see the head housekeeper to thank her staff for such excellent service. 

Sean - hope the management keep this foreman until he is old and grey - he’s hit the customer service golden bell in my book. Absolutely nothing too much trouble.

Restaurant - it was great food and the breakfast buffet is definitely worth paying for. 

Just one thing - Sean helped reset my room heating as the symbols printed on the instruction card were reversed which meant that if you followed the card instruction - it got chilly instead of warm. Suspect it’s been remedied by now. 

I’ll be back and recommending to family and also for use on business for the company I work for - a global customer experience consultancy. 

Well done all. ",5,2019,12,02
221,Such a treat ,"WOW, My first time to stay in this truly beautiful hotel with my daughter and my sister. It was a little family catch up and some shopping in Grafton Street which is only a 3 minute walk from the hotel or take the Luas to any part of Dublin City with the Luas stop only one minute walk from the hotel. We arrived at the hotel and it is wonderfully decorated for Christmas. Beautiful big welcoming and comforting fire in the reception, loads of comfy couches and armchairs to have a coffee and a snack or go to the beautiful lighted bar. We decided on having lunch in the bar before check in and ordered three seafood chowders and they were delicious. After a catch up and gorgeous coffee lattes we checked in. We had two rooms booked, a twin and a single room. The rooms are really fabulous, Pure luxury at a great rate. Great wifi, tv, tea, coffee tray, bottles of still and fizzy water, loads of towels and plenty of shampoo, conditioner and soaps. The beds are extremely comfortable and the bathroom is beautiful with a fabulous rain shower. We went down to breakfast the following morning and it was a huge feast of everything that that you could wish for. There was overnight oats, a variety of fresh chopped fruit, cheeses, smoked salmon, meats, a honey comb, fresh yogurts, cereals, porridge, juices, teas, coffees, breads, croissants, scones, brown and white breads, and hot buffet of rashers, sausages, scrambled and fried eggs, hash browns, tomatoes, mushrooms,  beans, black and white puddings, An amazing buffet of beautiful food, And every member of staff is so friendly and helpful, Check is 12pm and greatly appreciated. Highly recommend this beautiful hotel and everyone that works there, Nsgicsl experience. I will be returning soon for another wonderful stay. ",5,2019,12,02
221,amazing hotel ,"Amazing hotel, spent 2 nights at this hotel, all the staff were amazing, the reception made a fantastic first impression. James and Glen went above and beyond to look after us and nothing was too much trouble, an absolute credit to their employers! Would definitely 100% recommend this hotel to family and friends.",5,2019,12,01
221,Great stay in Dublin,"Great location, friendly/knowledgeable staff and excellent value!  Concierge and front desk very helpful.  Room spacious enough for 3 people.  Breakfast buffet very tasty and staff in restaurant attentive and friendly.",5,2019,12,01
221,A very sad trip,"We came here as a group. Before arrival we were sent an email offering us an upgrade for £30 euros per room per night, I emailed them about this and sadly had no response. Upon arrival we checked in after a long journey, front desk lady not as welcoming as many 4 star establishments I’ve stayed at...it’s first impressions right? They are always the lasting ones! Smile at least! We checked into our rooms, or shall I say cells...the pods are just as other people say - awful, over priced and not fit for purpose. We booked 3 to enable us to have a pod each and so glad as two in a pod would not have worked as there’s no shower or toilet privacy either. My bad experience started with finding faeces on the toilet roll, I popped it in the bin, only to find the cleaner got it out the bin the following day and put it back on the holder, as you can imagine, the same happened the next day. I felt sick. My room was freezing, I asked reception to check this on several occasions throughout my stay, they did and said they think it’s fixed now...however it wasn’t and no one even bothered to ask or follow up my complaint the following day. Sadly, I froze each night and didn’t sleep, what makes it worse and the reason for my review is no one cared and it’s so sad, not one person asked if my cold room was now a warm, cosy 4 star room that I booked and paid for. My friends rooms however were warm and cosy. My stay was ruined and I’m really sad that my trip to Dublin was not how it should have been.",1,2019,11,30
221,Excellent hotel. Great value price. ,"Overnight business trip with limited experience of Dublin. 
Recommended this hotel by a colleague and selected a deluxe room. Very spacious and very well priced. Lovely comfortable big bed and welcoming walk-in shower. Very impressed.
Location was also good. Short 5 minute walk to Grafton Street and not much further to get to Temple Bar.
Highly recommend. ",5,2019,11,29
221,Great hotel!,"Great hotel, highly recommend. Excellent breakfast in the morning, tasty cocktails at night. Cosy seating in the lobby by the big windows looking out to the street. Short walk to Grafton St shopping area",5,2019,11,28
221,Lovely Hotel,"We stayed here for 2 nights over the weekend.  Lovely hotel, rooms are clean and the decor throughout is immaculate.
Staff very friendly and nothing was a problem.
We didn't have a problem with noise in our room at all",5,2019,11,27
221,Excellent!,Brilliant Hotel. Staff couldn’t be anymore helpful and friendly. Room was lovely and clean and the price was reasonable especially for the location. Highly recommend. I will definitely be coming back.,4,2019,11,27
221,"Great hotel, staff is very friendly and professional. Rooms are wonderful","Been coming here for 3 consecutive years during our annual Dublin trip. This hotel is a definite keeper.
Hotel is very clean and staff is very professional and helpful. Entrée is very warming and welcoming with a christmas tree and a fireplace always burning. Rooms are spacious and clean.",4,2019,11,26
221,Fabulous hotel but extremely noisy at night,The hotel is beautiful. drinks are fab and the food is delicious but the noise from the nightclubs on Harcourt Street is just unbelievable at night. I was travelling for business and was still awake at 2am with the sounds of Coppers and Diceys. The noise is just ridiculous and ruined the trip.,4,2019,11,25
221,Business Trip,The hotel could not have been more obliging . Superb location and easy to get to using public transport. The hotel itself is immaculate and tastefully decorated throughout. A thoroughly enjoyable stay .,5,2019,11,25
221,Luncheon review,"I do love a modern hotel to contrast with the 18th century sweep of Harcourt Street...however 
 The Lady is not for dining.. sleeping .drinking conferencing.  Unenlightened menu .mad prices   
Ceaser salad? Green curry? How 1980!",3,2019,11,20
221,Great hotel with character,"Location is great.   Easy access to everything.

Hotel was wonderful.  Staff were extremely helpful and the food was amazing.

The only slight problem I had was that the room was quite dark.  I would have like more lights.",5,2019,11,20
221,Fab place to stay,"Fab Art Deco styling, really friendly staff and super service. The food in the bar is excellent as was breakfast. They do a really good Smoked Old Fashioned (a lovely night-cap). My new favorite place to stay in Dublin city centre.",5,2019,11,19
221,"Excellent hotel, great location (second stay)","Was visiting Dublin for a long weekend and having stayed at the Iveagh Garden Hotel previously it was my first choice to stay again. 

I had a nice room at the back of the hotel on the third floor and got a room rate that included free breakfast. 

The room was great, clean and well appointed. Breakfast is excellent with a huge buffet with a fantastic selection. 

Two bits of minor feedback for improvement:

1. The room is not well suited if you want to work at a desk using a laptop. The ""desk"" is too high to work at and although there is a little table it is not really adequate. I ended up sitting on the bed to work. 

2. In one of the hotel promo pictures there is a nespresso coffee machine in the room. I did not have one of these in my room sadly. 

But these are minor details. Overall it's a great hotel and I will definitely stay here again and recommend it to others. ",5,2019,11,18
221,Fabulous ,"Excellent hotel , Fresh ,clean and the great words can go on. Rooms are great both clean and nicely laid out .We had bar food first night and it was beautiful. Staff are very helpful .Situated on Harcourt street it gives great access to shopping be it Grafton Street or temple bar area . 
Parking is a little problem as they don’t have on site parking , although parking is available just a short walk away and it’s reasonable with the hotel discount . I highly recommend this hotel and look forward to staying there again . ",5,2019,11,17
221,Iveagh is Incredible!,"The hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas. We checked in and our room was lovely. It is so central and we were within walking distance of all pubs and restaurants and the city centre! We ate our dinner in the restaurant and it was outstanding. Staff were lovely. It was £135 which is a fantastic offer as this hotel is right on the doorstep of everything Dublin has to offer. It is literally 5 minutes walk from St. Stephen's Green. The bed was so comfortable and the room was so quiet.  Nearby pubs are Cassidy's which had a lovely buzz and Flannery's. We are dancers and the music was fantastic. We rolled home at 3.30 am. The Black Door was still open it is 4 doors up from the hotel. The doorman was so lovely he explained all areas available in the Black Door and recommended local night spots. However, at 3.30 am. we decided to call it a night. Maybe next time we will boogie in the Black Door. A lovely weekend in the Iveagh! Thank you!",5,2019,11,17
221,Great last minute find!,So pleased that we managed to find a couple of rooms at this small hotel convenient for the tourist spots and especially the stadium but still in a quiet location. We had a lovely spacious room . Ticked all the boxes for a quick visit to watch the football.,4,2019,11,17
221,Good if you don't have a car and are ok with some noise,"The hotel is near St. Stephen's Green, but on Harcourt which is the same street that the trams run on. It's awkward to unload your bags be it from a taxi or from a car. There is no parking at the hotel, but they have a small discount at a lot about 10 mins away. I would not recommend the hotel if you have a vehicle with you as it just takes more effort to figure out where to unload, and then where to load your car when you leave. It's also very challenging to find a spot during rush hour (i.e check in time). The person who checked us in was not helpful  or friendly. No one helped us with our bags even though there is a flight of stairs to get into the hotel. 

The hotel is very clean and modern, the rooms are a bit small. We had one with a double bed and a twin bed, making it more cramped (we didn't need the extra bed but that's what they had). 

Not all rooms come with air conditioning, so call ahead if you need that. They provide a fan, which is good as there are several nightclubs on that street, and so it's hard to sleep with the window open. Not sure about rooms on the other side of the hotel (we faced Harcourt St).",3,2019,11,11
221,Good Location - CityPod rooms are on the small side,"Good location, close to a few bars and transport to the rest of Dublin. 
Room size of the citypods is on the small size and unfortunately the seal around the glass shower and the floor was faulty - so the shower leaked into the main room. 
Room was very clean, as was the shower. For 1 night as a solo traveller I would recommend it. ",3,2019,11,11
221,Nice hotel BUT noise is shocking,Lovely hotel but would never stay again as you wont get much sleep there. The noise levels from Copper Face Jacks nightclub is shocking and can be clearly heard in the room. The club is directly opposite the hotel.,2,2019,11,10
221,Fabulous Break,We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. We arrived an hour early for check in and received the room straight away. The room has everything you’d need and the bathroom was so nice! The staff were so friendly. The food in Elle’s was amazing- we will definitely be back!,5,2019,11,10
221,Weekend in Dublin - November,"Me and my boyfriend stayed in Iveqgh Garden Hotel for one night. 
Everything was clean, the staff was really kind and polite and the hotel is really modern. 
We stayed in a Superior room, that was very spacious and equipped with different amenities dici as iron, hairdryer, conditioner and hand cream.
Highly recommended!",5,2019,11,09
221,short stay,"I enjoyed my short stay in one of the City Pods very much. The central location of the hotel is very convenient. Public transport nearby. The breakfast was very good.
Interesting small restaurants nearby. ",5,2019,11,06
221,Experience at Iveagh Garden,The service seemed chaotic. City pods should be illegal! The hotel should state that the rooms are in a basement without much light and tiny. I had to get an upgrade to sleep in a decent room for which I had to pay. One cannot consume something in the bar or restaurant before putting down a safety deposit at the reception. Overall not a good value/money experience... ,2,2019,11,04
221,Great Time!,Thank you! We had a very nice time staying at the Iveagh Garden Hotel and would book a new stay when we come back to Dublin. Our Friends found you as they ran the Dublin marathon.  It was located in a good spot and a nice walk to Temple Bar.,5,2019,11,03
221,"Great location, fab breakfast and modern","Stayed in this hotel for three days while in town for a party. Was lucky and got an upgrade of my room. Great location, fab breakast (tried lunch as well and it was decent), modern rooms. Helpful staff and walking distance to everything.

221,Modern hotel in great location,Really enjoyed staying in this hotel. Very modern with one of the nicest bars I've ever seen. Less than 5 mins walk to city centre but still very quiet. Only downside was the heavy duvet and poor lighting in the bedroom. ,5,2019,11,03
221,Great Stay,"Had a very enjoyable stay. Room was spotless, the bar was great. Food was fantastic. Service was great. Breakfast the following morning was lovely, plenty choice and everything really fresh. Would definitely return as location is great. ",5,2019,11,02

221,Disappointing,"Our second year in this hotel. Room was small but adequate, Bath was not fit for purpose as it would not fill and this was a requirement prior to our booking. Noise from the nightclub opposite was a problem. Our booking was a party of twelve and we dined the restaurant both evenings and staff refused to give a complimentary shot post dinner for our party., this disappointed us as we felt it would have been a good will gesture. ",2,2019,10,31
221,Excellent Hotel,Best hotel I’ve stayed in Dublin excellent location first class service Cleanliness of rooms couldn’t be faulted and decor of hotel is to a high standard. Only one small draw back is if your driving to the hotel it’s a five minute walk to the nearest car park ,5,2019,10,29
221,“Family run” in the best sense,This hotel is nicely updated with dedicated and friendly/helpful staff. We had two rooms for a family of five. Both very nice and quiet (we were on the back side). We had a lunch at the restaurant and dinner room service (for the kids only) one night. Food is very good. Kids loved the gluten free brownie (even though we aren’t gluten free). ,5,2019,10,29
221,Stunningly classy boutique hotel with amazing staff,"Amazing trip away, beautiful classy hotel with a warm and friendly feel. The staff couldn’t do enough for us and made the stay memorable. The location was perfect and a short walk from the centre, walking through St Stephens Green making the walk beautiful and interesting. Would recommend this hotel to everyone. Thank you!!",5,2019,10,29
221,Service location and peace,My husband and I visited for a romantic two night stay. We were not disappointed. I had the best sleep ever.. It is situated in a central location with bags of character. The decor and styling brings the historical context into a contemporary modern feeling. I was most impressed by the friendliness of staff in particular Naomi at breakfast. Her enthusiasm for service and detail resulted in a better experience. Will be back,5,2019,10,26
221,Very good Hotel ! Everything was perfect !,"Service,Room, Location, Bathroom,Bed, Drinks,Everything was perfect ! When we visit Dublin again we booked this Hotel !We have nothing to  expose ! Guinness was very delicious. To eat was expensive but tasted good.",5,2019,10,26
221,Superb,"Stayed here as part of a group book for a conference.
Hotel has been upgraded to a high standard throughout.
Fantastic location, close to plenty of bars and restaurants but I didn’t hear any noise.
Staff were professional.
Breakfast was good with plenty of choice “.
Overall I would happily recommend to others ",5,2019,10,25
221,Great hotel,"Fabulous hotel, the food was amazing, the room was very comfortable and the staff were very helpful and friendly. Overall we had a great experience from the moment we checked in until we checked out. The staff definitely go that extra mile. ",5,2019,10,24
221,Absoutely wonderful stay,"The Iveagh Garden Hotel exceeded our expectations. The staff were kind and helpful, we even got a room upgrade and fresh fruit delivered to our room (for no reason!)
I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. The location is very central, the rooms are spotless, and the bathrooms are very large with lovely rain shower heads. I can't wait to go back again! ",5,2019,10,23
221,Lovely stay,"Lovely hotel, very well decorated.Our room as immaculate and spacious. Breakfast was lovely and good selection.
Staff were friendly and helpful.
The restaurant and bar seems very popular place for locals to go into on an evening and had a great atmosphere.
The only issues I had were with the pillows , they were very lumpy and felt cheap,so woke up with a stiff neck,invest in better pillows.
Also lots of lamps in the bedroom..great mood lighting but no central or ceiling light when needing a bit more light.
But I wouldn't let that put you off staying at all.",4,2019,10,23
221,A gem in the city,This hotel is so stylish and comfortable and such a great location on the doorstep of everything Dublin has to offer. Excellent staff who are so helpful and friendly. We had a fantastic stay and will most definitely be back again in the future.,5,2019,10,23
221,Business Lunch,Excellent service with high quality food. An ideal venue to bring clients and impress them. Have been 3 times now and it never fails to impress. Highly recommend for business or a quiet lunch . Keep doing what you are doing.,5,2019,10,22
221,Beautiful Hotel,"Stayed here for the weekend and I would definitely recommend this hotel. Everything about it. Hotel has a real warm and friendly atmosphere as soon as you enter, room was lovely, staff are fantastic. Everyone one says hello, has a smile, and offer to help when ever they can. The staff are a credit.  Especially Naomi, Yannis and Dean. Could not fault anything about it. 

Bar is really nice, breakfast was great, huge variety of food. Constantly refilling the food with fresh stuff. Really good. 

Didn't eat in the hotel but the food looked good. Plus so relaxed with the service. Enough staff on to have a nice service for food. Not rushing and throwing the food and drinks.

When I am back in Dublin I will book to stay here. 

Keep up the good work.",5,2019,10,21
221,Great location,"Clean, modern. Fair size room, free WiFi, safe, no fridge.
Good self serve breakfast selection.
Clubs in the area open late, so there may be some noise depending on which room you’re in.
Easy to walk into centre of Dublin, really close to St Stephens Green.",4,2019,10,21
221,"Beautiful hotel, keep an eye on bar measures though","We stayed here for my husbands 40th. The hotel itself and reception staff were all wonderful. The room and location was perfect.

Only gripe was we found the barman serving us tried to get away with only giving us half the measures in the cocktails we ordered. We were looking at him, because it looked like he was also giving less than full measures to other customers too. We pulled him up on it and he prepared 2 new drinks (with full measures) for us.",4,2019,10,20
221,Incredible! Decor on point 👌🏼,"A touch of class in the heart of Dublin within walking distance of everywhere worth being. Great service, lovely staff. Room was super spacious and beautifully appointed. Lobby is Instaperfect if you’re doing it for the gram! 📷",5,2019,10,20
221,Noisy but noisy,"Beyond the street facing the hotel is a nigntclub pooring into your unsonorised bedroom loud music from 9 P.M. to 2.00 in the morning.
No sleep, big headick. To avoid if you look for a relaxing stay in Dublin.",2,2019,10,18
221,Amazing hotel value.,"Excellent location just off Stephens Green near Grafton Street. Room was comfortable and clean.
The manager and staff went above the call to take care of us. 
Very nice restaurant and bar onsite. 

Great experience.
",5,2019,10,17
221,Very Good- with a few things to watch,"I always try to avoid complaining on social media about things that could have been addressed there and then. But, knowing we were on a tight schedule, we paid a little more for location and a bit of luxury,so in the short time we stayed wasn't really in the mood to be swapping rooms etc. We were attracted by the hotel's eco policy and sustainability.  So, instead of a double room we got a queenie bed and a single. Rooms are great and spotless but in this case, I would not say luxury. No extra touches I could see, suede tissue box was gorgeous, but empty. And for goodness sake, no biscuits in the room!
Most of the staff were really pleasant but some confusion with a request for a late night drink as we hadn't been asked to validate a card on arrival. Again, we should have mentioned this as it seemed odd but this is exactly the difference between ok and great. I know, first world problems. The street is busy but our front room had windows that blocked it out and it was Freshers' Week, so maybe every Monday isn't like that :) On a big positive if you can get a deal including breakfast- great selection and serving until 10.30am. I had expected more eco and more eco information and was a wee bit surprised that most of the flowers in the small but lovely outside patio area were plastic. Not totally sure how this fits in with eco claims but like many other things about this hotel fixable. Overall an enjoyable enough stay but probably not a return visit from me sadly.",4,2019,10,16
221,A nice place to stay,We would come back anytime. The staff is very nice. The rooms appealing. The breakfast was very varied. The environment of the hotel is quiet. The central location in the city center is good. The connection to the airport is very good.,5,2019,10,14
221,Beautiful Hotel,Myself and my husband stayed in this hotel on Saturday night last and it is just beautiful. Gorgeous hotel room with lots of little extras. Ideally located. The bar is so stylish and comfortable. Would definitely recommend it..,5,2019,10,09
221,Very nice hotel but noisy at night,"Very nice hotel, we had rooms on the first floor facing the street. We were there on a Wednesday and Thursday night. There was a bar across the street, on a nice evening, kids would drink outside until 2 AM  first night at 4 AM the next night .
 I’m a little surprised the city doesn’t do anything  and I guess it’s only a problem when it’s warm outside. 
Other than that, enjoyable stay.",4,2019,10,09
221,Lovely city stay hotel,"Very nice hotel, lovely lobby area. Room was pleasant and peaceful. Very nice bathroom with wet room . Great access to the city and lively spots. Very close to the park and the Luas stops right outside ",4,2019,10,08
221,Great location! Very comfortable beds! I will stay again,"I booked the Iveagh because I liked the sustainable approach to running a hotel. And yes, the location is really convenient too! If you stay over the weekend, and are in need of some deep sleep, get them to give you a room away from the night life of Harcourt Street. Or bring ear plugs.
If you arrive by car, be prepared to park the vehicle in the car park of St. Stephens Green shopping center. We will stay again. ",4,2019,10,07
221,"Very Nice, Four Star Hotel, Great Service","Really nice, four star hotels.   We had four rooms for two different visits and all were recently renovated with modern amenities and bathrooms.  Very nice bar and a GREAT breakfast.   Very helpful staff.  My wife was ill one evening and they were at my room within five minutes with some dry toast and ginger ale.  ",4,2019,10,04
221,Great Location,"550 Meters from Grafton Street is a perfect location.
Best breakfast we ever had in a hotel.
The service was great.
The rooms where clean and beautiful.
The view from the romm was not really pretty.
Because of the weather we could not use the garden.",5,2019,10,04
221,Hard to find fault here,"We stayed here for two nights last weekend, and were very impressed with the comfort and facilities. Having read reviews on here, we requested a room at the back of the hotel and didn't hear a sound all night from our room. 

Great bathroom, spacious and well equipped, with a powerful, simple to use shower. The bed and pillows were comfy and there were two armchairs (we are often surprised how there is only one chair in a room designed for two people!).

Breakfast was great - as I don't enjoy a cooked breakfast I'm always keen to see what the continental selection is like, and I was very pleased with the offering here. Lots of different fruits and yogurts, as well as nuts and seeds to top them with. There was also a 'do-it-yourself' pancake machine, which produced hot, fluffy pancakes in a minute or two. 

Obviously, being only recently opened, the fittings and furniture were all pristine, but I would hope they will be kept in this condition.  The location is great, a few minutes walk from the heart of the city. My only small gripe is that the hotel advertises that it has parking. It DOES have a concessionary rate at a city centre car park, but this is around 10 minutes walk away, so if you have a lot of luggage it's a bit of a pain. (It's also a long way to take your luggage if it's pouring with rain, as it was last weekend)

We will definitely stay here again - we visit Dublin a couple of times a year and this hotel represents very good value against other high end hotels.",5,2019,10,03
221,Superb stay,"Superb hotel with service, attention to detail and hygiene being of the highest priority. I have no hesitation in  recommending a stay in the Iveagh Garden Hotel as I know you will be looked after incredibly well. ",5,2019,10,03
221,Well appointed hotel,"Good hotel, great breakfast and very helpful staff. Communal spaces, lobby and bar nicely styled. Beds comfortable however disturbed first night due to outside noise but we were moved to a quieter room for the second night. ",4,2019,10,02
221,"Nice Hotel, Would never stay again!","Nice hotel, rooms are lovely however stayed there for 2 nights and did not sleep for 2 nights.  Our room was situated across the street from 2 busy night clubs which were heavily populated till 4:00 a.m.  Loud music, screaming and honking of taxis.  Commented to staff our displeasure and staff blew it off.  Don’t stay there if you want to sleep!",3,2019,09,28
221,it's a pity.,"a convenient location, friendly staff and an excelent breakfast buffet. the room, not so much. paying over three hundred dollars for a room the size of a thimble, with no refigerator and an ottoman for a desk chair left me cold.",2,2019,09,27
221,Great hotel ,"Our stay was short but great. Hotel staff were friendly, attentive and helpful when needed. This is a beautiful boutique hotel in a great part of town. Short walk to restaurants, pubs and shopping as well as a 10 min walk to temple bar. 
The only complaint would be the noise from the club across the street. It didn’t stop until 4am and our jet lag didn’t help with the lack of sleep. If we stay again, I’ll make sure to ask for a more quiet room across the hall.  ",4,2019,09,27
221,Great location in boutique hotel,Arrived early and staff were helpful. Lovely renovated rooms clean. Service was fast to accommodate our needs. Breakfast buffet was great. Close room window to avoid noise from clubs....we were fine. Walking distance to centre core. Lovely parks nearby.,5,2019,09,25
221,my stay at Iveagh,"I had a nice stay at this very well located hotel in downtown Dublin, close to st Stephen's Green and the Royal College of surgeons. the staff was very helpful, the bed very comfortable. I had one problem which was solved.",5,2019,09,24
221,Great place to stay in Dublin,Just stayed recently with my family and love the room and location of the hotel. Very easy walk to Grafton street and Temple's Bar area. Rooms were very clean and staff was friendly. Only improvement would be the breakfast buffet which they need to replenishment at a faster rate.,4,2019,09,23
221,Avoid the basement rooms at all costs,The main part of the hotel is very nice and is in a good location. Have stayed here before and had a good stay BUT the basement room was horrible - a bed in a wet room.  The website doesn't really explain it fully until AFTER you have booked and paid for it.   Also it was unbearably hot with no aircon. ,2,2019,09,23
221,Very disappointing,OMG when I first looked to stay at this hotel I saw no comments about the noise from the night clubs which are almost next door! As I write this I am currently staying at the hotel it is 5.30 on a Sunday afternoon at the music is blaring out or the property next door ! Last night it went on to 4am! Room ok and nice bathroom but the noise is intolerable! Would I stay again? No! Would I recommend! No last night was the worst night of lack of sleep I have ever had in a hotel! Have had to go and buy ear plugs! If you want a good nights sleep this is not the hotel for you!,2,2019,09,22
221,Excellent stay in Dublin. Highly recommended.,"A high quality, modern, comfortable hotel in an excellent location. Professional and friendly staff. The location near Stephens Green is convenient. Places of interest, shops, pubs  etc all within walking distance.",5,2019,09,22
221,"If You Don't Want Much Sleep, Stay Here!","Upon entering the hotel I asked if our room, which was at the front end of the builiding and on the first floor, would be quiet given the street noise. I was assured that our Superior Room would be quiet but we needed to close the windows. The Superior Room was nice but was on the front side of the building where the tram passes every so many minutes until the wee hours of the night.  However tram noise was mininal compared to the Night Clubs that surround the address of this hotel and play music so loud that is vibrates in the room!  Nightclubs purportedly close at 3:00 am; noise continues well beyond 4:30 am or 5:00 am. Windows closed was a joke because air conditioning is turned off at night by the hotel.  So windows open are needed for air but of course the noise was unbearable. Restaurant breakfast was passable but not excellent. Would I stay here again, no!  Nicely loated but not worth the pain of the rest of the issues.",3,2019,09,21
221,"If you are older, avoid this location","There are definitely pros and cons to this location and the hotel itself.  I will start with the good:

The rooms are very pretty, clean and big windows to look out from.  The bathroom is much better than most hotels I have stayed at, and the hotel itself was very quaint and beautifully decorated. The location is also quite nice - a few blocks south of St Stephens Green, and the shopping area.  You could also walk to the Temple Bar area.  If you chose to take a cab, it would be about 12 Euros.  I also really enjoyed the Ella restaurant - they have the best Gin & Tonics, and also Garlic fries!  Also the security was solid!

the bad:  When we arrived, we noticed that we were in a beautiful area. The hotel had mostly business people and older couples.  We saw the odd younger couple.  But at the end of the day, there is a massive line up for a dance bar that is right beside the hotel.  Starting from 9 PM onwards, the music starts to blare.  Because we were on the side of the building closest to the bar, we struggled to fall asleep.  At 3 in the morning we could hear the police telling problem kids to stop whatever they were doing, sirens, and still music pumping.  This is not a pub area, but has a bunch of dance clubs crawling with 20 year olds - not exactly what I was expecting for what I would refer to as a boutique hotel.",3,2019,09,21
221,Friendly warm hotel,The warmth Iin the title refers to the attitude of the staff throughout this well positioned  clean and efficient hotel. In a city that brims over with hospitality the Iveagh Gardens  stands out like a beacon. The lovely and frequent trams pass the front door but the 5 minute walk to historic St Stephen's Green is an easy stroll. The concierge Sean is a friendly and helpful gem.,4,2019,09,19
221,An absolute pleasure to stay here,"This hotel is one of the best we have ever stayed in. A great location, fantastic facilities which are very inviting and the best breakfast you will ever have. There is only one place to stay in Dublin if you want the best value hotel.",5,2019,09,18
221,Lovely Hotel but very noisy! ,"Very disappointed. I have stayed here before and found the road outside and surrounding areas to be very busy and noisy till the early hours of the morning so this time I called the hotel and asked for a quiet room even taking a down graded room (no refund) to get a quiet room only to find on arrival late in the evening that my quiet room was on a service area road where I could here all the noise from outside! 
The hotel it’s self is very nice but to be given a non quiet room was very poor service in my book. 
I will have to find somewhere else now when in Dublin.",3,2019,09,18
221,Great hotel in the heart of Dublin,"We came to the hotel through Hotwire and it was a fantastic choice.
The hotel is centrally located, 5 minutes walk from the city center and walking distance to all the attractions as well as the bar/restaurant area.
The hotel is very well kept, clean and gives a good feeling.
The hotel let us check in early and provided a crib for our baby without a charge.",5,2019,09,16
221,Dublin Hotel,"Beautiful property ... great location, walkable to all sites and convenient to public transportation. Well appointed rooms, comfortable beds, large bathrooms, friendly and helpful staff and extremely delicious breakfast buffet. ""Very good"" on value because the price might be a bit high for mid-range budget.",5,2019,09,16
221,"Excellent location and a lovely, clean, quiet boutique hotel","The hotel was renovated a year ago and it shows. The lobby is gorgeous and the rooms are reasonably spacious and very well appointed. The bathrooms are sparkling clean. We very much enjoyed the hotel!  The restaurant onsite is fabulous and I had one of the best lunches I've had in a long time there and received gracious helpful service.  The rooms were dead quiet at night which is not always the case in this area!

Downsides:
- no amenities - they did give me a free one day gym pass for a gym a couple blocks away which was appreciated but otherwise you'd pay daily
- not all rooms have air conditioning and if you don't ask at check in they don't mention it. Our room was 25C when we got into it and despite instructions on the wall for turning on cooling we couldn't get it working and after about 15 mins called down to ask for assistance. It was only then we were told there was no cooling and they offered to switch rooms for us. So just ask ahead!",4,2019,09,16
221,"Beautiful venue, friendly staff","Went to a wedding reception here and it was a lovely venue. Our waitress, Naomi, who served us cocktails on Friday and our breakfast on Saturday morning, was so friendly and went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. She did an excellent job, so so helpful.",5,2019,09,15
221,Close to perfect,"We really enjoyed out stay.  They still have to figure out how to handle guests with a lot of baggage, as the tram tracks running in front of the hotel make it very difficult to unload and load.  Beyond this, the location was great, the team was incredibly friendly and helpful and the hotel new and luxurious.  We would go back.",4,2019,09,15
221,Good location go for it ,"We spent a week 7 nights / we loved the location / the staff are amazing  specially ANNA at the reception and Naomi from the coffee shop , Anna for her prompt action and support . Any way we had one issue which was that some rooms do not have cold air conditions ( which is a normal issue in Europe) .
We recommend it ",4,2019,09,14

221,Super Hotel to eat or to book accommodation,"We were booked into Harcourt Hotel a few doors along from Iveagh but owned by the same group and tried to exchange our booking fro Harcourt to this hotel after havin had an evening meal here.Unfortunately it was fully booked but we had two evening meals there and in total visited three nights..Well worth it's 4 star rating.Hotel was immaculate .Dining room very comfortable,food was very good and service from Sara (a student from Brazil) and Kenny (Bar Manager)was excellent",5,2019,09,13
221,Excellence in the city,"From the moment o arrived early and was pleasantly told my room was available I know I was in for a great stay . The hotel is spotless I am thinking it was refurbed recently with a great looking foyer , the rooms are spacious and well equipped . The stand out for me is the staff they were so friendly even when I was waiting for friends in the foyer I was greeted and asked if I would like a drink. 

This is a very central and highly recommend place to stay ",5,2019,09,12
221,"Beautiful, but Loud!","Things I liked about this hotel: very stylish decor, comfortable, great bathrooms, good location (walkable to many sites, right on the light rail, easy to get a cab).  Things I didn't like about this hotel: the distant and cool staff, the fact they make you pre-charge $100 on your credit card before they'll let you charge anything to your room, the horrible parking situation (public ramp 4-5 blocks away, nothing close to the hotel at all), very tight/small rooms and, wait for it, the pulsing dance music and party chatter that is 100% audible until 5:00 a.m.  Every.  Night.  We hardly slept.  My parents were in a room at the back (much smaller with small windows, kind of claustrophobic) and they didn't hear a thing.  We were in an ""upgraded"" room with the larger window at the front of the hotel, and you hear it all.",3,2019,09,11
221,"Great room, bizarre breakfast service","The hotel and the rooms are beautiful! We loved our spacious room with a view down to the street, as well as the comfortable bed. What ruined our experience at this hotel was our breakfast experience. The food was tasty, but the service was bizarre and honestly made us feel disrespected. We were seated by a nice girl, who asked us if we wanted coffee, but we waited 15 minutes and no one came to speak with us about the breakfast options or bring coffee. Finally we just went ahead and took buffet plates, and asked a server if we could get coffee. We had to hunt down our own silverware, napkins, and salt because no one ever came to look after us, and still no one brought coffee. 45 minutes after being sat, we asked for coffee again. Finally it was brought, but no milk and sugar accompanied it. We eventually went and got a glass of milk to use from the cereal bar. 20 pounds per person is a lot to pay for a breakfast with no service! We were enjoying our experience at this hotel until this morning, but now we feel like we will just stay elsewhere next time. :(",2,2019,09,09
221,Mid week break,"Great location, the staff were friendly and courteous, our room was very comfortable. After some shopping I enjoyed a walk round St Stephen's Green and Iveagh Gardens (well worth a visit). Just up from the hotel we hopped on the Luis to visit the GPO and Henry street; this was an added bonus as I was travelling with my elderly mother. ",4,2019,09,08
221,"Meh, Only Ok.","One of the newer hotels on the Dublin hotel scene, the location is beyond ideal. Right on Harcourt Street opposite Dublin’s most famous nite club, Copperface Jacks. Now that could obviously be a good or a bad thing. If you’re not into late nights then stay away because this street doesn’t go to sleep until about 4 or 5am all week long. 

The hotel itself is impressive upon entering; stylish, modern with a luxurious feel. Pleasant reception staff but nothing out of the ordinary. 

The standard room was, well standard. Nice decor, comfy bed and again, nothing out of the ordinary. The WiFi was terrible, kept dropping and there was no air-con in our room (not sure about the rest of the rooms) which blew my mind! We stayed in the middle of July and the room was stifling. As a substitute, there was a fan on the desk which was buckled and when turned on the fans banged off the cage exterior which made the same sound as a propellor plane so that didn’t stay on too long. To get some fresh air, I had to open the window which backed on to an open air concert being held in the Iveagh Gardens. Suffice to say, that was a late night.

The bathroom was the winner in this room! Loved everything about it, proper bathroom goals that you’d want to put in your own home.

Location is the winner but given its location, hotel can charge a fortune and they will get it but it’s certainly not worth the price tag that they sometimes charge. If you get it for a good price then it’s perfect for a night or 2 but nothing longer than that.",3,2019,09,08
221,Beautiful hotel,"Stayed for one night with my mum and aunt after being at the Westlife concert! The hotel is lovely and the decor is beautiful. We had brunch in the restaurant, delicious, and the staff were all very friendly. 
Our room was excellent, very spacious considering it was 3 adults sharing, really comfortable beds. My aunt has has 2 knee replacements so the accessibility bathroom was a massive bonus for her. 
Location is excellent, it’s very central and the Luas is only a couple of minutes walk away. Even though it’s a busy area we didn’t hear any noise at night in our room which was great! 
Loved the breakfast, there was plenty of options and even though it was a buffet the food was still hot. We really enjoyed our stay and I wouldn’t hesitate to book this hotel again next time I visit Dublin.",5,2019,09,08
221,Disappointed reception,"My colleague and I booked a ""deluxe"" room at the Iveagh Garden after hiking the Beara Way. The fellow at reception made it clear that we were not welcome. Perhaps because we were in hiking gear, not in suits. (The woman seemed nice). We were assigned a tiny room without air-conditioning. After complaining we were reassigned to a large room with AC. 

I had recommended the Iveagh to my colleague because my wife and I stayed here in the spring and were treated wonderfully. This made our reception not only disappointing but humiliating. 

Bellman, restaurant staff, and housekeeping were fine so I gave one more star than I intended originally. I also waited a couple days to give a cooler review.",3,2019,09,08
221,"Beautiful, Great Location Too!","The Iveagh is a first-rate, class act hotel. The staff is helpful and the rooms are spacious. Sophie’s across the street is a rooftop restaurant, amazing. Close to everything, but not surrounded by it. ",5,2019,09,07

221,Excellent Stay at Iveagh Garden Hotel,I recently spent 6 nights at the Iveagh Garden Hotel with my family and we had a wonderful experience. Every staff member we met was very courteous and willing to do whatever was required to make our stay as comfortable as possible. The rooms were very clean and modern and the hotel is situated at the very heart of the City Centre near all of the popular and necessary places to visit.,5,2019,09,05
221,Excellent,"The Iveagh Garden Hotel is well situated in Dublin within easy walking distance to f.ex. Grafton Street pedestrian sone. Well maintained and well kept, both lobby and rooms. The attitude of staff extraordinary. 
We did not see the other rooms but the room we got (2 travelling together) was roomy and comfortable. Would have wished, though, for a small refrigerator for the drinking water bottles that we were brought fresh every day. The bed is comfortable – would have wished for softer pillows, though.
We cannot help mentioning the efficiency and friendliness of the multicultural staff of the restaurant Ella´s which is a part of the hotel. Allow me to mention Naomi the Hungarian and Lucas the Brazilian.
Would we consider staying again at Iveagh? Looking forward to it.

221,Worth a Return Visit,"The hotels location is good, close to the city centre with easy access to the tram system which is a great way of getting around the city. The staff were friendly and efficient, we particularly enjoyed the bar and restaurant.",5,2019,09,05
221,Location location,An absolutely georgous place to stay. Had the tastiest salmon and mussels in a light curried sauce for my lunch and did a few hours work in a lovely quite calm atmosphere. Rooms are even nicer than the foyer. Lovely staff. Would highly recommend. Thank you all.,5,2019,09,03
221,"Great Location, Easy to Find & Gorgeous Inside","Loved the feel of this hotel, and even though some reviews said it was in a busy area, we found it completely peaceful, restful and very easy to get everywhere on foot or tram with our 8 y-o son in tow. Not the cheapest hotel in town, but definitely get what you paid for. ",5,2019,09,02
221,Birthday weekend in Dublin,"I stayed at the Iveagh Garden Hotel with a group of friends for our 50th Birthdays. The hotel rooms were lovely, and the the whole hotel was a beautiful place. The staff were all very helpful and the breakfast was delicious. This is a great hotel !",5,2019,09,01
221,Excellent service and prime location,Clean room and helpful staff. Room size is spacious. Grafton street is 7 min walk from hotel. Prime location to Dublin shopping areas. Tram is walking distance from the hotel. Close to various restaurants and pubs. ,5,2019,08,31
221,Alexandra & tomas,"Alexandra and her team are awesome and provide excellent service,

Thomas and staff are amazing and friendly. They made my stay very enjoyable

Highly recommend the hotel and bar.

I have stayed here many times and enjoy the place",5,2019,08,31
221,Too hot to sleep ,"Stayed here for 3 nights on a break to Dublin. We arrived at the hotel at 11am hoping to leave our luggage. We were pleasantly surprised that our room was ready- fantastic. 
Hotel is stylish and new. Room was large and bed was comfortable but why was it so hot in there?? It was cool enough to need a jacket outside but in the room we were sweltering. 
For this reason I couldn’t recommend anyone stopping here. Also, the room was lacking in luxury amenities such as a fridge. The tea making facilities could have been better, the kettle took forever to boil and the water tasted so bad it made the coffee taste inedible. The bathroom although spacious, had nowhere to put toiletries whilst showering and the toilet itself didn’t seem planned for easy use. The bar area was a lovely space and we had a couple of drinks there although we didn’t eat as the food in Dublin was awesome. 
As we were in Dublin on vacation we didn’t enjoy the location of the hotel. It was in the business district and the tram was always packed with commuters. Next time we’ll stay nearer to the action. 
",3,2019,08,28
221,Great location,"Hotel staff was great, excellent food on premises. Rooms were well appointed bath was wonderful with great shower pressure and hot water.  Walking distance to St Stevens Green and shopping Grafton Street",4,2019,08,28
221,Wonderful weekend with friends at the Iveagh Garden Hotel.,Couldn't be happier with the hotel and it's location. LOVED the interior. That's what caught my attention when browsing hotels online. One important thing I found also was that the website accurately represented the real-life hotel which in some cases they do not and that always leads to disappointment when you arrive. Not so in this case. Lovely staff and superb location. The view from room 108 leaves a little to be desired but this time it didn't matter since we were out on the town most of the time.,5,2019,08,28
221,"Wonderful, beautiful small boutique hotel","Loved our stay. Great location walking distance to Grafton Street. Beautiful decor. Be careful when booking a city pod in the summer. Although it was cool outside, the pod, which we booked for out daughter (we were in an regular-sized, air-conditioned room) was unbearably hot, and the hotel kindly switched her at no additional cost to a regular room.",5,2019,08,26
221,Exceptionally clean and stylish,"Really impressed with the cleanliness of this hotel; the staff were well presented and were highly professional and courteous. 
The room had a large amount of floor space which made our stay more comfortable, and the bed/pillows were also comfortable. 
Unfortunately the room was particularly warm, but there was a desk fan provided which eventually cooled us down. Also our toilet was faulty and water seemed to run from it constantly after flushing. This was a minor downside to an otherwise pleasant stay. 
The location is within 15-20 minute walking distance to the main tourist areas (e.g., Temple Bar) and within 5 minutes of Iveagh Garden and St. Stephen’s Green which was great, and a nice quiet escape from the hustle and bustle of the bars. 
Well worth the money and would recommend for couples looking for a more luxurious and sophisticated rest space away from the noisy centre of town. 
",4,2019,08,26
221,City pods = big NO NO,"City pods are not suitable. They are too small, too hot in summer, and too noisy. They price is also too expensive for the few square meters provided.

If you are young, I guess it is fine. Otherwise it will be a big deception 

",1,2019,08,24
221,Comfortable and agreable stay,"Very good hotel, comfortable hotel, excellent location in Dublin, close to main attractions, and easy public transportation, close to the park and in a nice street. Spacious room, excellent sleep, and very good breakfast! add to that, such freindly and attentive service, what can you ask for more?",5,2019,08,24
221,Fabulous stay,This hotel is probably one of the very best Iv stayed at in Dublin! The staff are second to none. We were upgraded to a superior room and it was very well decorated and equipped with everything needed for a pleasant and relaxing stay. Shower was amazing! An immaculately clean hotel. Breakfast was delicious with a great choice of plentiful fresh foods. All staff seem very happy at what they do. See you all again in November. ,5,2019,08,24
221,A lovely hotel staff in Dublin,Iveagh Garden hotel is beautiful in a great location.  The rooms are modern and comfortable.  The restaurant is great.  The entire staff was pleasant and very accommodating. I will definitely recommend this hotel to family and friends. ,5,2019,08,23
221,Mixed,"Stayed for 2 nights. Lovely location close to Grafton St, Temple Bar and St Stephen’s Green. Room was on 4th floor - lovely and spacious but view over the back was disappointing - bin stores and office block. Only one window opened so boiling hot and noisy air conditioning kicked in by itself in the middle of the night but didn’t go lower than 22 degrees. I couldn’t wait to get out of there in the morning. 
Check in at reception was disappointing. For over £200 a night room only I would expect some offer with help with bags or even offering choice of breakfast in the morning if we decided.  Nothing.  More interested in getting pre authorisation on credit card.  Overall we found everyone in Dublin to be super friendly but not so here. Shame.  We will definitely return but will stay somewhere else.",3,2019,08,23
221,Boiling hot room,"28 degrees in our room, we were offered a vent instead of a different room. The room was ground floor, on the sun side, super small window. For 200 a night not acceptable. 

Rooms were clean.

Staff was good as well.",3,2019,08,23
221,Luxurious hotel in great location,This hotel was a real find. Plenty of nightlife locally without the rowdiness of Temple Bar. Great location with a tram stop only yards away. Hotel itself was beautifully presented. The rooms were clean and comfortable with lovely bathrooms. Breakfast was fantastic with loads of choice. Friendly and helpful staff. Would definitely stay here again,5,2019,08,22
221,Bob A.,"We selected this hotel on our intuition and we were right. The staff is friendly, the breakfast options are many and wonderful and the service along w/the internet service were better then expected. We were extremely happy w/our stay.",5,2019,08,22
221,Georgeous hotel!,We were only in Dublin for one night and wanted to stay close to Temple Bar area without being right in it.  The Iveagh was within a 10 minute easy walk which was perfect.  Loved the room - beautifully decorated with comfortable bed and great large bathroom.  Would definitely stay here again,5,2019,08,21
221,"Great location, fantastic helpful staff, just let down by the view from the room","Overall a great hotel. Location was great for city walks. Close to bars and shopping. Hotel itself had charm and great public areas including a nice bar/restaurant area.
The rooms at the front had nice views of a very characteristic street, however some rooms at the back (mine)  had a view right into an office that was very close. Not greenery just an office building where you could see the people inside. Close enough to have a conversation with them :-) ",3,2019,08,20
221,Great hotel,"Ideal base for NCH and city centre, close to St Stephen's Green, upmarket hotel with superb breakfast, spotless large rooms. Prices in bar are not cheap but reflect the surroundings of what looks like a 5 star hotel",5,2019,08,19
221,Quality hotel ,"This hotel is great.. Good location and in a safe location. Staff very friendly, rooms are clean and big.. Toilets are great size also..parking is small walk away and hotel rate is very reasonable for Dublin 
",5,2019,08,18
221,Excellent hotel for visit to Dublin,The Hotel is in a good location with easy access to the LUAS tram system.  There is a strong focus in sustainability. The staff were helpful and friendly. The rook was a good size and well equipped. We will book again in future trips to Dublin.,5,2019,08,18
221,Great hotel,"Lovely hotel, friendly, within easy walking distance to all amenities. Great location. Had nice quiet room. Only issue would be they don’t cater well for vegans. Had to go out to get vegan breakfast.
Very cosy hotel. Great ",5,2019,08,17
221,Enjoyable few days in Dublin,Great hotel in a great location rooms were clean and comfortable staff were lovely overall a great experience only a five minute walk to the centre of Grafton Street would definitely recommend this hotel ,5,2019,08,17
221,"Modern, attractive property with a few small glitches","Nicely appointed, contemporary rooms in a well located hotel. Great shower and clean rooms. 

As there is no air-conditioning we found it a bit uncomfortable (particularly for sleeping), although a window can be opened and a fan is provided which helped a little. 

One of the lifts was also out of action for some of our stay and this meant quite a long wait on the weekend when the hotel was busy. 

Appreciated that the hotel is aiming to minimise environmental impact - although we did hang our towels for re-use as requested, but they were still replaced by housekeeping each day.",3,2019,08,16
221,Fantastic hotel,"Spent 2 nights there last week for our anniversary. Fantastic staff, Thomas the manager and Alexander could not do enough for us. Thomas even made us special anniversary cocktails. Fantastic location for the hotel which is only open a year. Would highly for anybody to stay in this wonderful place. 
Sean & Geraldine",5,2019,08,16
221,Lovely,"Really lovely hotel 
Great location in a really nice Georgian fronted street
Staff very friendly and helpful
Public areas beautifully maintained and decor fab
Rooms nice proportion and lovely decor
Clean and well looked after
Bed lush

Great place for business or a break ",5,2019,08,15
221,Gerry Conway,"Recently visited the Hotel for dinner. 
I want to complement Alexandra for her courtesy and attention to detail. 
She is a big asset to your business. 
We had a great evening, lovely ambiance, good food, and very friendly staff.",5,2019,08,13
221,"Nice hotel, close to tourist attractions",The hotel is located on a street central to most things you'll want to see as a tourist.  It's fairly busy but very walkable and easy to catch taxis from.  The breakfast wad very nice and especially enjoyed the outdoor covered seating area. ,5,2019,08,13
221,"The hotel was nice, but Glenn made the stay!","We stayed here for two nights at the end of a road trip around Ireland. It was a little confusing on pulling up as there is no parking or even a bellhop out front. Once we got in and settled we found the rooms to be very nice and clean. The room was a bit warm, and we came to find out they do not have AC in half the rooms. Ours did have ""AC"" but it is more of a slightly cool air. On both nights the air never dropped more than 1 degree C and did not get close to the set temperature. 
After walking around Dublin a little my wife and I decided to take the rest of the day easy and headed to the bar inside the Iveagh. This proved to be one of our best decisions of the trip as we met Glenn, the food and beverage director. Pretty much everyone we met in Ireland was friendly, but Glenn went above and beyond to be friendly, he was extremely knowledgeable, and went the extra mile to help. He made sure our drinks were perfect and even helped book us a table at another restaurant (securing us a great table no less). The next night our group decided to eat and drink all night at the hotel because Glenn was so great. I made lots of jokes about how if you needed any kind of information about anything, you should just ask Glenn. ",5,2019,08,13
221,Really Good Hotel,It's a nice hotel in a really great location in the centre of Dublin close to St Stephens Green. They had good size rooms with generous bathroom and lovely shower. Would recommend it for anyone looking for a city centre hotel.,4,2019,08,12
221,Nice decor but hot rooms and no parking,"While this hotel was pretty and the bathrooms were fantastic, our room was an uncomfortable 26 degrees all night with no aircon and only a small table fan. No parking near the hotel was also inconvenient. ",3,2019,08,12
221,Great place in a great location in Dublin,"Had a great stay at this hotel. Anything and everything you could ever want to do is in walking distance. Also, make sure to stop in the bar and ask for Glenn. His local recommendations made our trip better than anything we could have ever tried to look up on TripAdvisor.",5,2019,08,11
221,Great Hotel,"Sean, the concierge, was lovely. The restaurant was beautiful. The room was great. The area was happening when the rest of Dublin seemed quiet. It was a short cab ride from the train. Can’t wait to go back again. ",5,2019,08,08
221,Great location great value,"Booked this hotel on Booking.com as a last minute trip for my mum and I. The hotel is located 2 minutes walk from St Stephen's Green and the Harcourt Street Luas stop. There's also a taxi rank right across the street. The hotel was great value for money and the breakfast was amazing. The staff were very friendly and extremely helpful. Rooms were lovely and furnished to a high standard. 
The only drawback was the room was very warm at night. All in all a good trip and I would go back.",4,2019,08,07
221,Great stay!,We have stayed just for 2 night but everything was perfect. Great quality of furniture and the bed really comfortable. They let us checking in at 11:30 am and received some chocolates treat in the middle of the afternoon. I would definitely come back!,5,2019,08,07
221,Work Trip,"This hotel is outstanding. The interior, and cleanliness was impeccable. The Dinner and Breakfast I had there was amazing, and my hotel room was beautiful and all the staff were very helpful, kind and friendly.  Well done to you all! ",5,2019,08,07
221,Lovely little hotel in great location,Great location and lovely breakfast in a very pretty mid size hotel.  Would recommend and would stay here again. The only issue was parking so make sure you sort it out on arrival at the hotel.  We enjoyed our stay.,4,2019,08,07
221,Gets the job done,"The selling point to me for Iveagh Garden Hotel is the location. It's within walking distance to everything we needed it to be. I don't think we had to even use public transportation while we were there. Now from a, ""would I stay there again?"" standpoint, I dunno. The hotel was fine, I wouldn't say there was anything that was particularly memorable, and that may be my problem. There were also some fundamental stuff that wasn't a good fit for our group. 

No air conditioning. Now, I know this is something that we should just get over, but I promise, I have a reason for taking issue. Our room was at the front of the business and good lord, is. it. active. out. there. at. night. Cut to me 10 years ago and I would have been right there with them, but this version of me just wants a good nights sleep. Yes, we're in the middle of a city, so noise is to be expected, but without air conditioning, the window had to come open. With the limited options of sweating, or hearing the clubbers, we went with hearing the clubbers, and frankly - I just didn't want to have to choose. Perhaps if they gave out ear plugs upon check-in for those who are at the front of the building? 

No ice machine. Again, I KNOW BIG WHOOP, but this is why it's a three and not lower. My Mom ended up taking a big fall the day we arrived in Ireland, so we needed to make sure she was keeping it iced. I have never felt more obnoxious in my life, than having to call down and request ice. The second day, I just walked down to the bar to get it myself because I really couldn't be that person. 

The food was pretty good, but their room service menu was somewhat minimal. We only knew that because we had eaten in the restaurant at one point and knew were were missing out. What can I say? FOMO is real. 

Lastly, just to touch on the rooms. It's a basic room, with an SUPER obnoxious shower. I don't know what is wrong with me, but when it takes me 15 minutes to figure out how to take a shower, I tend to get a bit annoyed. I finally got there, but along with those ear plugs, perhaps I need a mini video on how to take a shower without losing a chunk of my sightseeing time.",3,2019,08,06
221,The pictures do not represent the actual experience,"Don't be fooled by the website pictures. This is a hotel with old floor plans ( small rooms ) which has been refurbed. It is clean but too much furniture in the room so it feels cluttered and old. 

Air con didnt work - raised this on first night but was ignored by reception. It was sweltering.
Second night a portable dyson aircon unit appeared unannounced ( no doubt the more important guests had gone as this was a sunday )- which was just bizarre service.
Hotel is on a party street with three clubs opposite. So, fab for partying  but if you don't like drunks and puke on the pavement outside your  200 euro a night hotel perhaps best to avoid.
Reception staff utterly uninterested and unengaged.  When checking out and asked if I had enjoyed my stay I said 'It was okay' so as not to be impolite but to open a conversation. Surely any half decent place would question why just 'okay' ? Not a flicker.  She wasn't even listening to me.

Concierge was helpful in showing us where a car park could be found ( 10 mins walk away )..so bear that in mind if you have much in the way of luggage.

Overall a real disappointment.",2,2019,08,05
221,Review TT,"The room was very modern and clean. All equipment in the room was working well. The staff was helpful and friendly. However, the room was far too hot (25 degrees) for a good sleep. The 'eco building' is an advantage in winter, but the hotel management should look for a solution how to improve the guest comfort in summer (no aircondition, windows do not open wide to cool the room off at night). Tip: provide guests with summer ' lighter' duvets. ",3,2019,08,05
221,Wonderful service,"Stayed 2 nights,
Delightfully surprised by this lovely hotel in the heart of Dublin.
Excellent food and even better service from all the wait staff and most especially the reception team. A problem I had was efficiently and pleasantly attended to with minimum fuss. Could not praise the team there enough for their excellent attentive service. I will return again.",5,2019,08,04
221,Drinking with friends,"I came here to meet a friend, was meet by a great bartender who understood my needs (dean). I moved to the smoking area with my friend when he arrived and the great service continued with the floor staff who looked after us (Alexandra) they both had a great personality and sense of humour which helped greatly, can't wait to visit again! Great team!",5,2019,08,01
221,Nice Place ,"Here’s an exhaustive review!! It’s a great place for travelers. Quiet. But you have sleep with windows open so you can breathe and because of that you hear the city until it gets quiet and you hear the gulls early in the AM.  If there is A/C then that was the lucky room. 
The food service and bar are pricey ( for Americans) but man it was good!!
There’s no mini bar and no fridge. I’ve rarely been in a room that had neither. No ice machine on the hall. 
Room service can bring you what you need, friendly, quickly. 
Beds are comfortable, loved the shower. It’s one thing to have no A/C, but a fan, or something that stirs air would make a difference. 
Everyone on the staff was great. 
Far enough from Temple to get a good nights sleep, close enough to walk to main attractions in Dublin. 
If I come back, I stay here. ",5,2019,07,31
221,Fantastic stay!,"I organised a large group of friends to stay here last weekend and we had a fantastic stay. Staff were amazing, so helpful. Our rooms were perfect. Location is fantastic. We had brunch in Elles the next day and it was delish and again the staff couldn't do enough for us. Highly recommend this hotel!",5,2019,07,30
221,Staying in Dublin,"This was a great location!  Only a couple of blocks from St Stephen's Green.  Check-in and check-out were fast and painless.  They happily stored our bags for us when we arrived before check-in time, and then brought them to our room once it was ready so all we had to do was come back from our exploring.  We really liked the shower.  We were a little sad that the associated, discounted parking ramp was a bit of a hike, but in a busy city we know there aren't a lot of choices for parking.   Would like to stay again when the Garden wasn't full with a concert.   ",5,2019,07,30
221,Meh,Windows might as well be walls. Very hot the whole time. Location was great. Was on honeymoon and told the front desk and the could not care less. Very clean. Nice shower. Paid 200 a night for average,2,2019,07,29
221,Great Hotel,"We're very pleasure to stay this beautiful hotel. Location is very similar, center and very close to bar & night clubs. Staff is also very kindly, rooms clean. I will definitely stay at the same hotel since I came another time",5,2019,07,29
221,"Perfect Location, Perfect Stay","We wanted to stay somewhere central in Dublin, close to Grafton St. The Iveagh Garden Hotel was the perfect find. Very unassuming outside, but once you walked inside - super friendly and helpful staff, hip and contemporary lobby and our first stop was Ellie's Bar and Bistro. (The food and drinks were AMAZING!  Their breakfast is a must try.). Rooms were spacious and clean, bathroom was huge, lots of storage space, and can I say..... I fell in love with the electric kettle. Double pane windows to keep the room quiet, a 5 minute walk to St. Stephen's Green. Spectacular restaurants in the area. Great price and super find. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2019,07,27
221,Beautiful hotel!,"The design of the hotel is so beautiful and chic! The room was neat and clean.  My only complaint is the room was hot because there is not AC. We asked for an extra fan and they promptly brought it to the room.  When we came back after a day of touring Dublin, there was another fan in the room too!  A happy surprise. I normally don't suggest hotel restaurants but their restaurant especially the patio was a beautiful, quiet place to relax after a long day of traveling.",4,2019,07,27
221,"Beautiful hotel, but not the most comfortable","The interior design is stunning! However I wished that there was an AC, that I could use the gym (without a $18 fee per day), and I wish there was complimentary breakfast in the morning. However, it was a beautiful hotel and nice place to stay. ",3,2019,07,25
221,"Beautiful hotel, friendly staff, great location","The hotel is really lovely and situated in a good location. I walked from where I got off my bus and got to experience the different atmospheres throughout the various streets of Dublin. It was just a stone throw away from Grafton Street which was really handy. The hotel itself was very pretty, the staff were very friendly which I deem very important and the room was small but clean with very comfy beds. I slept like my husband!! I didn't have breakfast in the hotel or dinner so I can't comment on the food but I'd imagine it to be tasty! I'll have to check that out the next time.",5,2019,07,25
221,Iveagh Garden Hotel experience,"From the moment we arrived to our departure, everything about the hotel was excellent - room, staff, location. it was a most enjoyable stay Would find it hard to find a better experience in Dublin.  Will be back again",5,2019,07,24
221,Great choice,"Recently went to concert in iveagh gardens and booked twin room. We were very impressed with the standard if the room and also the staff..well done.

A suggestion would to install Nespresso machines in each room as tray was cumbersome and old fashioned to use.

Room was perfect otherwise.",5,2019,07,24
221,"Loud, busy and disorganised","We checked in on a Saturday at 3pm. A member of staff put our luggage on a trolley and following check in said it would reach our room shortly. After an hour or more of waiting and speaking with the staff, it turned out all of our luggage had gone missing in the hotel. We had never gotten a luggage tag as we were supposed to. Three or four members of staff went looking for our suitcases (we had flown in from overseas) and it turned up two hours after check in in someone else room meaning we were late for a wedding. I was also unaware that the hotel was across the street from Dublin's nightclub hub, the noise during the night was horrendous and although we had also gone out with friends and had drinks, we were still woken up by fights and music beneath our bedroom window at 4, 5 and 6am. My final note is that there was no aircon in our room and felt like a sauna. The windows open an inch - not enough to air the room. Overall, we felt we really wasted our money and should have stayed elsewhere. Would not recommend this hotel at all unless you are planning  a hens/stag party. Very disappointing. ",2,2019,07,24
221,Review,"Very nice, modern place to stay.  The location is amazing, and within walking distance of many attractions. All of the personnel were outstanding, and went out of !  Just their way to be as helpful as possible.  Just be aware most hotels in the area do not have A/C.  A fan was provided.",4,2019,07,23
221,Excellent ,"We had a conference here and the food and staff were all top class.
The rooms are great for City Centre.
Nothing was to much trouble for the staff.I would highly recommend.Great for couples and for business ",5,2019,07,23
221,A mixed bag,The shower and bath floors were dangerous slippery. My bed was short-sheeted.Shower controls came with a learning curve - no instructions. The instant coffee maker was a throwback to an earlier time - I ended up boiling it over onto the upholstered chair. Too many cards advertising things. The staff was nice and helpful. Parking was a nightmare - no attendant at 6:30am and the reader rejected my card the first 3 times. We nearly missed our connection. Lovely lobby. My room overlooked the trash area.,3,2019,07,19
221,Honestly aching to come back here! Such a dream,Honestly this place is heaven on earth! I want to travel all the way back to Ireland just to stay here! The staff treated me beautifully and I want to give a shoutout to Sean who gave us the best advice and always welcomed us! Also a massive shout out to Hayley Good who was so warm and lovely with her emails to provide us information and help with our booking! Couldn’t have asked for a better experience,5,2019,07,19
221,Night away,Myself and my sister in law stayed in this beautiful gem. They have a gorgeous beer garden for summer drinks outside. The staff were very friendly and accommodating.  The hotel is very nicely decorated and extremely central! Just remember to attach your credit card to your room should you like a drink in the residents bar after ,4,2019,07,18
221,Amazing quality,"We had a fantastic time at the Iveagh Garden Hotel, the staff were super friendly and helpful. The breakfast in the morning was amazing, probably the best I've ever had. I asked for a quiet room with a nice view and that is absolutely what I received. We stayed on the 5th floor in a room made out of windows with a fabulous view of the Iveagh Gardens next door and also Dublin city. All this came at an unbelievably reasonable price. Planning to return to this hotel on any future trips to Dublin from now on.",5,2019,07,18
221,Great hotel in the heart of Dublin City,"Lovely hotel, clean, comfortable and perfectly located for our visit to Dublin. City view a little disappointing but Staff were friendly and attentive. Breakfast was amazing. It's a shame we didnt get to try out the restaurant due to a private function.Overall experience was good. ",4,2019,07,16
221,Very comfortable hotel,"Stayed overnight on a Friday. Excellent location 10 minutes walk from Grafton street shops.

I was lucky to be at back of the hotel which overlooks the back of Iveagh Gardens. My room (3129) was huge and came with nice balcony and table and chairs. Only negative was the bedroom was poorly lit which I found out at 5am in morning when checking out for an early flight.

Drinks were good in the bar downstairs. Would stay here again",5,2019,07,15
221,One night stay,"Hotel is beautiful and in great location.  Staff are very friendly.  The only criticism I would give is that you cannot get breakfast to your bedroom, which is something I would have expected from a hotel this nice.  We were advised to ask for a room at the back because the road at front is busy, but we didn't and found the front room to be sound proofed and it was nice to have a view of the street below.
The barman wasn't very happy about us asking for cocktails at 8pm on a Thursday, as the bar was fairly busy with non residents, but we still got them!   ",4,2019,07,15
221,Disappointing stay! ,"I booked this hotel directly through their website a few months in advance of my stay. The disappointment started ever before I arrived and checked into the hotel. 

I phoned the hotel a few hours before check in asking if I could pay for my stay over the phone. The reason for this was because our stay was supposed to be a treat from me to my mum and as I knew she’d get to the hotel before me, I wanted to ensure that it was all paid for when she was checking in. The woman who I spoke to was incredibly rude and unhelpful. She didn’t even ask my name, my booking reference or any details at all. Instead she just cut across me and said it was not possible to pay over the phone. Which I accepted but it was her customer service I had an issue with. She didn’t even try to come up with a solution to my problem and she had no interest in being any way helpful. So of course, my treat for my mum was ruined and she ended up having to provide her credit card at check in!!! 

Furthermore on check out, we got charged the bill for the room next door! 400€ more than our room rate!! This is laughable considering that when I asked why it wasn’t possible to pay over the phone, I was told that they needed to verify that I was the cardholder hence why I needed to pay at the hotel but yet they managed to charge me for the room next door?! They clearly didn’t even check the name on the card! We didn’t realize this until the day after we checked out. When we rang and spoke to management, we were told it would take a number of days for the money to be refunded. Granted we got an apology but to be honest, this shouldn’t have happened in the first place! 

The room itself was ok but definitely not worth the price we paid. It was clean and modern which was nice but it was small and it was extremely noisy at night (even though we were at the back of the hotel). 

To sum up - a very disappointing stay and it is safe to say we won’t be staying again. The customer service just wasn’t really up to scratch! ",2,2019,07,13
221,Great location,"Great location, every place is in walking distance.

We ordered a deluxe double room, but they did put us in a disabled room for the first night with a tiny bed, and now glass around the shower so the whole bathroom got wet when we took a shower.

The receptionist wasn't able to move us to a different room until the next day!The second room was much smaller but with a bigger bed which seemed to me lover quality that in the other room.

Breakfast is okay but not sure if it's worth the price.",3,2019,07,13
221,Top class hotel,Great location only10 minutes walk to main street. Dining and bar area excellent. Friendly and helpful service from staff. Wouldn't stay any where else in Dublin. Hotel was recommended by travel agent who had stayed there earlier in the year - she was absolutely spot on,5,2019,07,12
221,A tale of contrast ....,"Stayed one night as close to a concert we attended.  Booked many months ago and as room only.  It was adequate.  Clean and comfortable beds.  Rooms small,  extremely hot - uncomfortably so.  Room not well stocked .... had to source tea bags and milk as the only 'milk' on tray was coffee creamer.  Staff at reception plain ignorant, although staff in Ellie's Bar where excellent.  This weekend finds me a Travelodge at Gatwick airport ..... Iveagh Garden Hotel may like to visit..... they MAY learn good reception manners,  you know,  smiling and helpful and not as though they are inconvenienced.  Rooms excellently stock with a really good hospitality tray and air conditioning..... a third of the cost and including breakfast. Obviously it's not a fair comparison in many ways but I couldn't help noticing the contrast and know which is the more pleasurable experience.",3,2019,07,12
221,Just an ok type of hotel,"The bedroom was ok, I’ve stayed in far superior rooms for less money but it is Dublin after all. The bed was incredibly comfortable but we seemed to have been placed at the back of a nightclub so we had dance music throughout the night and then rowdy party goers making their way home so needless to say it wasn’t a great nights sleep.  The cooked breakfast was awful, I’ve never had a full Irish minus potato bread and the bacon looked like it barely seen the pan.  Location wasn’t great, I had read it was close to the city centre, that’s about a 15 minute walk, fine on a good day but not so much if it’s miserable, also Croke Park is a 40 minute walk and the main bus station required a taxi journey. 

The staff were lovely especially the gentleman on concierge who was more than helpful.",3,2019,07,11
221,A great hotel that added to great weekend!!,A beautifully stylish hotel in a fantastic location with everything within walking distance. Rooms are small but not to cramped and staff were friendly and helpful. Staying here added to great weekend.I will definitely be back!! ,4,2019,07,10
221,Would stay again,Nice hotel. Has elevator so the only steps to climb with luggage are the front steps. Had lots of trouble with the card keys but staff very nice about issuing new ones. The room was very comfortable and clean room.,4,2019,07,07
221,"Lovely design, comfortable","The Iveagh is in a perfect place to walk in to the centre of Dublin, especially Temple Bar. Around 15 minutes to walk. The tram also passes outside.

The rooms are very nice, however they are quite small. This can be expected though in a city for sure. Other than this, the hotel was really nice. 

We were here for my girlfriends birthday, with the goal of spending the 2 nights we had here wandering in to town for food and drinks. For this reason we didn't try the hotel bar and restaurant, although it did look very nice.

Staff at reception were very helpful.",4,2019,07,05
221,Very nice hotel depending on your room,"It is a beautiful, new and modern hotel. It is extremely clean. The beds are comfortable and the bathrooms are also great. Breakfast is delicious with lots of choices. 

One thing you should know about this hotel is that the 2 most popular night clubs in Dublin are in front of the hotel. This means that if your room in front of the hotel, you will most likely be part of the middle party until 4-4:30 am (they serve the last drink at 3 am). This was our case, so we asked to be relocated. The hotel was very accommodating and offered us a room at the back of the hotel on the first floor. But in between the delivery and garbage trucks, and renovations they did during our stay, we did not sleep much at this hotel. Note to staff, if there will be renovations, like drilling in the walls starting at 8:30 am, it would be nice to inform your guests that might be affected by the noise.

If you want a nice stay at the Iveagh Hotel, ask for a room on the third floor or above not facing the street.",3,2019,07,05
221,Central hotel,"Good central hotel in Dublin , 5 minutes walk from grafton street. It was quite a warm day so I was happy to know that we had air con in the rooms. Unfortunately it doesn't actually work. And the windows only open a small bit. The guy from reception said it would start up soon but the temperature just kept going up. Reading reviews it seems to be an ongoing problem and there was a fan in the room which I have never seen with air con before.  If your relatively ok in the heat it will be fine for you but definitely my stay would have been ruined only for the window opening a bit. I feel you shouldn't advertise  something if you don't have it, or it doesn't  work . The breakfast was lovely with a very good choice in a nice big room. Staff were friendly and I even got a choice of coffee for breakfast.  Overall I wouldn't be a fan of this hotel.",3,2019,07,05
221,Check rock concert schedule,"First night lovely, second night horrendous-loud rock concert in public park behind hotel. Checked concert schedule and due to have further concerts in each of three following evenings after this. Not mentioned by hotel when we booked and same very expensive cost each night. Will not book this hotel again",1,2019,07,04
221,Business trip with pleasure,Very helpful staff particularly receptionist who printed off several documents for me to prepare for a very important meeting on Monday morning. Very comfortable bed & pillows especially for my wife who is quite peculiar about a pillow!,5,2019,07,04
221,Iveragh Garden stay,Had a very enjoyable experience. The hotel is in an excellent location. It is very clean and well maintained by friendly staff. The only downside was the lack of parking in close proximity to the hotel ,4,2019,07,03
221,Business Stay,Fabulous hotel and very friendly staff. The only negative from my stay was lack of lighting in the bedroom. This was only an issue for me becuase I was on a business trip and was working on my laptop and notes in the room and found it difficult with lack of lighting. That would prevent me staying again for a business trip but I will certainly stay again for a leisure break as the hotel really is fabulous ,4,2019,07,02
221,Extraordinary and Wonderful Property ,"If you are planning a trip to Dublin make sure you stay at this incredible hotel.From the polished railings at the entrance to the design and colors of the lobby, restaurant and rooms this is a gem. The staff is unbelieveably attentive, knowledgeable and professional. Special mention for the amazing Sean. He arranged great restaurants and a fabulous Wiklow tour. Spot on! The Icon health club around the corner was phenomenal and priced reasonably. 
Nothing was a problem here including accomodating us 6 hours earlier than check-in permits. The breakfast foods are great and the buffet is plentiful and well-stocked. Drinks are outstanding and well-priced. Tastefully appointed this was the highlight of our stay among the seven countries we visited.",5,2019,07,01
221,Nice place,Rooms were just about adequate for my needs nothing special. No spa facilities in the hotel or pool. Bar staff are very friendly and food was good. The meeting rooms are in the basement so very dark and unfriendly if you are sat there for days off on end. In the heart of the city and close to the park and nightclubs.,4,2019,06,30
221,Overpriced,"Staff seemed annoyed and bored like they did not want to be spoken to... Certain room configurations were really impractable (e.g., mirror light, location of water faucet), TV had limited channels and no channel information... Location was good, but there are hotels closer to the city center that provide at least as much comfort. Breakfast was mediocre, certain advertised things were not available without substitutions, things that run out were not resupplied, etc. Good if you only want a quick bite in the morning, but there are better food experiences in town... All in all, overpriced for what you get. I have stayed in different other hotels that were better and cheaper during my vacation.",3,2019,06,27
221,Didn't stay in hotel but wasn't impressed with brunch,"Hi, I didn't stay in the hotel so I can't comment on that except to say the location is great and near city centre, it would be a nice location to stay.

However 3 friends and I went here for a birthday brunch and were pretty disappointed. They wouldn't make us cocktails which would have been nice seeing as we were celebrating, however we did have gins which were nice. The staff were pleasant but seemed very disorganised and all over the place (maybe because place was new)?

Food was fine, nothing special and not very good value Overall, we were a little disappointed and wouldn't come here for brunch again. The surroundings were nice though.",3,2019,06,23
221,Good location,"This hotel is in a very convenient location.  

Positives:
Comfortable, modern and clean.
Good housekeeping service.
Helpful staff.
Good room size
Excellent restaurant/bar/lobby area
Very good food
Very nice breakfast
Nice bathroom, very clean, good rainshower

Negatives:
Can be noisy (nightclubs across the road) - I had a back room overlooking an office block but could still hear noise
No air conditioning in my room 
Tramline next to the hotel so no place for cars to park for offloading/onloading baggage - cars wait across the road
A very nice room but design flaws if you're on business: no workchair and appropriate workspace if you need to work on your laptop- cute chair and large dressing table but difficult to work from (I could perhaps have asked for a workchair..); internet in my room was variable
I had asked for a meeting room or quiet space for a quick meeting as the lobby was very busy and noisy, but was advised no meeting rooms 
No plug near to the kettle, so you have to move the tray to the nearest plug point

Overall, a good and comfortable stay.",4,2019,06,21
221,In the míddle of the town,"Nice hotel, it has de more important tourist visits very near  and also the best restaurants. The  has the things you need, but no bar. The temperature  is  The service was friendly. I think IS s good hotel in dublin",5,2019,06,21
221,Overnight stay. Amazing Hotel,Stayed in this fab hotel overnight. Even though the tram went past every 20 mins or so their noise reduction windows meant you did not hear it. Hotel with in easy walking distance of shopping centre and Gaiety Theatre. Would use again,5,2019,06,19
221,10/10,"My stay in the iveagh gardens hotel was nothing less than perfect. The service was amazing, the hotel itself was so beautiful and located in a wonderful part of the city, the food was great, the room was lovely aswell, very modern and overall my stay was a 10/10 experience ",5,2019,06,18
221,Great location,"This hotel is perfectly situated for access to the city centre, right on the tram line and if you are inclined adjacent to the clubs and bars on Harcourt Street. 
The staff are very efficient. The rooms exceptional in their size and fittings. Plus their breakfasts are world class.",5,2019,06,17
221,Nice hotel in great location,"Front facing rooms can be noisy due to Nightclubs opposite. Great location as it is a short walk to St Stephen's Green. Front desk staff could be a little warmer upon arrival, and check out and invoices very confusing! However hotel is very nice, very clean. Superior rooms are airy and bright with bags if room and a really nice shower. Food in the restaurant in the evening is very good, and bar/restaurant staff are very good and friendly. ",4,2019,06,17
221,Nice place!,"My wife and I joined friends at the Iveagh Gardens Hotel in Dublin for several days. The welcoming staff as well as the staff in the hotel, restaurant and bar were outstanding. Great hospitality. We found the sleeping rooms to be clean, attractive and adequate. The food was satisfactory and the restaurant’s bar was well stocked.",5,2019,06,13
221,Excellent,"Great stay, quality hotel. Very clean, great attention to detail, and wonderful staff. Breakfast was awesome - also quality and delicious. Decent location. Difficult to fault. Shame no gym facilities on site...Highly recommend.",5,2019,06,12
221,"Lovely hotel, good location .","Stayed here for a night with hubby and family in a twin and single bed room. Spacious enough room with Comfy beds and good showers! Great location!, we decided to take the room facing away from the main road as hubby knows from previous experience that the pubs across the main entrance can get noisy. Ac temperature was effective at cooling. Can’t say much about breakfast or the Bar as I personally didn’t experience it. However the Bar seemed to have a lovely outdoors extension seating which seemed pretty inviting, sadly ours was a short duration stay. Loved it overall,however having stayed in two 4/5 star hotels in Ireland, noticed the lack of mini fridge in the room and kind of hoped they would have a mini bar/ fridge in the room but am not sure if that’s just the rooms we booked. ",4,2019,06,11
221,Nice but check in staff need lessons in customer service,Nice but check in staff need lessons in customer service.  Staff at check in were unable to cope / accept a debit card and insisted on a credit card which we as a business don't use. We stay in hotels all over world and have never had this problem. in all other respects this hotel is nice but is let down by the first impression of the reception staff. Different reception staff at check out time were equally as unhelpful.,4,2019,06,09
221,Associate Board Member of the Oklahoma Restaurant Association ,At the hotel for a week and Glenn in the bar was excellent! I’ll be back and he is one of the reasons. We loved the hotel and Dublin. The location was convenient and the staff helpful and friendly. We will return. ,5,2019,06,08
221,"Very Clean, very comfortable and very professional","This is genuinely one of the best hotels in Dublin for the price.
Staff are extremely professional and I had a very positive and memorable experience.
The rooms were very comfortable and clean, the breakfast was excellent with a great range of fresh produce items to choose from and the breakfast staff could not have been more helpful. ",5,2019,06,08
221,Lovely hotel in super location,"This is a lovely hotel which I would recommend and happily stay in again.  The location is excellent in a beautiful part of town.  You're away from the hordes of tourists but close to many restaurants, cafes, and pubs, all within strolling distance. Staff were friendly and helpful, so why not five stars?  The let down was the hotel breakfast, which I would not recommend.  They just didn't seem to care--they ran out of plates and eggs for starters. Some of the other breakfast staples were very much dwindled when we arrived, which was not late, and I really didn't see anyone hustling to get them re-filled.  After that one chance we went to a local cafe for our breakfasts and had a superb, fresh breakfast alongside the locals, which was delicious and obviously half the price.  ",4,2019,06,08
221,Do not book this hotel if you want sleep ,"Beautiful hotel, nice staff, comfortable beds, but none of that matters due to club across the street. Loudest blaring music I have ever heard until 3am every morning!!!!

I booked more than 30 rooms for a group and this  was never mentioned as an issue unfortunately!",2,2019,06,07
221,40th Wedding Annivsary,"My Sons sent us on a 40th Anniversary Trip to Ireland and this is where they had us staying.  To say that we were pleased with everything would be a massive understatement.  The wait staff were excellent beyond anything I could imagine.  The restaurant had the most excellent food ever with an Irish Breakfast to die for and the room.....oh my God........the room was fantastic, very contemporary, very open and with great views of the roof top of the building next to us.........well, OK, so it wasn't perfect, but THAT was the only thing that would have made this experience any better for the 7 days that we were there.  LOVED IT and would highly recommend that anyone looking for a place to stay, close to shopping, train stations, pubs and restaurants this is the place to be and to it wasn't extremely expensive either.  So, if you are planning to go to Dublin, this would be an excellent place to stay because it is within walking distance to some of the wonderful things that make Ireland............Ireland.

221,Nice Hotel ,"Nice Hotel. Very central. 
Room was very quiet despite being in a busy location. We were checked into a room with a bathroom with disability facilities which was fine except that the water from shower could not drain away quickly leaving the floor very wet and slippery.
Staff friendly . Would definitely stay here again. ",4,2019,06,04
221,Birthday treat,We stayed in the hotel for my partners birthday. The hotel is beautiful and staff were very helpful. The room was so spacious and for what I paid i was more than happy. Number of bars around so location was perfect. Room got a bit too warm during the night but other than that our stay was perfect ,5,2019,06,01
221,Lovely High Quality Hotel in a Great Location,"This hotel is a great find for anyone who is attending events at the NCH which is literally a 5-minute walk around the corner. It has the feel of a classy boutique hotel. The service from hotel staff was excellent. We had a last-minute deal with full breakfast which was possibly the best buffet (both hot and cold) I have seen anywhere in the EU or North America. Outstanding value for money. Elle's, the restaurant, has very good high quality food and several bonafied vegan options and a brand new terrace which is fabulous. Only negatives: our room in the back (requested because of fears of street noise) was quite small and the single beds seemed quite small. It was overall quiet but the view over a huge industrial/commercial back yard was not pretty and got a bit noisy in the morning (and a few loud conversations echoed during the night). It didn't matter that much to us because we were only in the room for sleeping in any case, and that negative was overridden by the positives of the place overall.",4,2019,05,31
221,Great place to stay,The room was very comfortable and in a good location for walking to see the city center tourist attractions. Close to everything.  Friendly staff.  The parking could have been closer.  We would stay there again.,5,2019,05,31
221,Ireland Vacation,"This hotel was excellent. It was very clean, modern, and great service. The restaurant and terrace were also amazing. We loved the decor too. The location was in walking distance of all restaurants and shopping in Dublin, yet it was on a quiet street. I would definitely book again. ",5,2019,05,30
221,Fabulous stay ,"What a lovely hotel our first stay of many more we hope. Staff were amazing , helpful and friendly. Food was exceptional !  People have commented that price of breakfast 15 euros per person was excessive ... can't agree as what was on offer was plentiful high quality food .We were very happy with our deluxe double room , huge bed ,great bathroom and other facilities such as tea coffee and ironing board. Housekeeping was to an excellent standard. Location of hotel very good for walking to see the sights. I have just 1 observations that in our room the coffee/tea station could only be used when precariously placed on a stool because of access to a plug socket because of a short lead to the kettle. We requested a quiet room and we were very happy with what we received. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel",5,2019,05,28
221,Beautiful stunning interior ,I had to mention this wonderful hotel I had the pleasure of staying here on the 20/21 May 2019. This was the real deal in every way. I had a group from the USA staying in Dublin for two nights and everyone of them loved this fantastic hotel. The food was excellent both breakfast and dinner. The bar is really well stocked and you can get any type of cocktail. There is a fantastic beer garden also. This hotel was exceptional the decor was so nice in every way. The lobby was beautiful also. This hotel is in walking distance to Dublin’s most fashionable shopping district. All my travelers loves their rooms. I really loved the rain shower it was just amazing. If you want a great experience stay at this hotel. The staff were excellent and I really wanted to thank Stephen and Aideen in the bar and Ana in reception. I look forward to staying at this amazing hotel again in the future. ,5,2019,05,28
221,An average hotel,"This hotel has nice location, close to the city centre. My room was a good size but felt like furniture was missing (bed was not so big for a couple). Also no air conditioning in the room, felt very stuffy and could not open windows. No fridge or mini bar in the room, also unable to call room service as in-room phone doesn’t work. For a newish, this hotel feels dated and nothing special. Reception not so friendly. Would stay here for the location. ",3,2019,05,27
221,One night in Dublin,"Very smart and efficient hotel within walking distance to St Stephen’s Green and Shanahan’s.  Rooms are modern, well designed and efficient.  A great bar with a wide range of spirits and beers and great Guinness!",4,2019,05,27
221,Elle’s botanical brunch ,"One of my recent favourite finds is the outdoor terrace at the Iveagh Garden hotel. I was invited to the launch of Elle’s ( outdoor) previously and thought it was a great space for the hopefully lovely summer ahead. I went for brunch with some friends after a late night and it was the perfect cure, I kicked off with a Bloody Mary and it was so good I had 2, just the right amount of chilli heat, it was ice cold so overall refreshing. I ordered the vegan dish of cauliflower tempura and it was really lovely, could have eaten more of it but luckily had side order of fries , my friend ordered Caesar salad which came with a whole grilled chicken breast, great portion sizes, we also tried the French toast , lots of coffee and my friend treated me but I’d have happily paid, just means I’ll have to go back and that will be soon! I think the space is lovely and the wait staff were very nice and helpful. ",5,2019,05,26
221,"Gorgeous, central hotel ","Lovely hotel, very clean rooms and in a great location. Room had all expected amenities and en-suite was spacious. Staff were very polite & friendly. Found it expensive for the night but seems to be standard Dublin City centre prices. ",5,2019,05,26
221,Comfortable stay,"The hotel is about 5 minute walk from Stephens Green in a club district.  It is relatively new.  Our room was spacious and clean.  Bath was attractive with dark grey tile and a rainwater shower head. A few things to know.  Even though the hotel was built in 2017 there is no air conditioning.  This was not an issue for us in May, might be a consideration in August.  For some reason there was no overhead lighting in the room so it was under illuminated in the evenings.  There are a number of clubs directly across the street. We were in a room toward the back.  Even with the windows open we heard almost no noise.  The superior rooms all face the street and if windows need to be open for ventilation it is likely to be noisy.  The Irish staff were delightful and extremely helpful.  The concierge’s suggestions for dining were spot on.  When we asked directions to a market of one of the porters he offered to pick up what we wanted himself.  The non-Irish, mostly Eastern European staff were a little more hit or miss, occasionally brusk. Overall, a good experience and recommended.",4,2019,05,25
221,Great Dublin Hotel!,"We stayed at the Iveagh Garden Hotel in Dublin for one night. I really liked the location of this hotel in a busy downtown area. The rooms are nice and roomy, and very clean. The hotel staff were very helpful and friendly. The breakfast was excellent!  Hot and hearty with lots of variety. I was just very pleased with our stay at the Iveagh!  The only negative is that the toilet in our room only flushed occasionally, but a fussy toilet wasn’t enough to rate this nice hotel down. I hope I get the chance to stay here again!",5,2019,05,22
221,Will definitely come back,"Stayed here for 2 nights as a weekend break. Really impressed with decor and styling of the hotel, it has a really lovely luxury feel to it. Room was clean and good size. Staff are really friendly and helpful. Great choices for breakfast. We never had a meal at the restaurant however there's Sophies roof top bar and restaurant across the road (accessed through 'The Dean') which has excellent food and views over Dublin city. The hotel location is great with Temple bar area is only a 15 to 20 minute which takes you  past a few nice bars and restaurants along the way. There is a club across the road called 'Dicey's garden' which does seem to open quite late which initially we thought might be an issue. However we we stayed on the 1st floor facing the place and had 2 good nights sleep. In the morning there are a couple of nice parks in close proximity to the hotel to walk off any hangovers.",5,2019,05,20
221,Great Evening,"Lovely evening had, very respectful and accommodating staff, any issues were handled speedily and effectively. Room was lovely, the bar and restaurant were fantastic. Nothing to complain about. Would definitely visit again.",5,2019,05,20
221,Gorgeous Hotel!,"Stayed at Iveagh Garden Hotel with s friend last week as we were attending a concert. I have been caught out with Dublin Hotels before by paying a lot and thinking the hotel would be nice- in this case the hotel was gorgeous! So clean and modern. Staff were lovely and the location was perfect. Facilities in the room were great with a large TV, tea and coffee and even bottles of Ballygown water. The shower was definitely the best shower I have seen in a hotel in a very long time with a rain shower and hose option. We did not have breakfast included as we were leaving early. I had stayed in another hotel very close to this last year and I was awake all night as there are a number of nightclubs on the street but I did not have this problem this time- the windows seemed to be better quality and the noise was not as disturbing. I would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely be hoping I have the opportunity to stay again.",5,2019,05,18
221,"Lovely hotel, unfortunate neighbor across the street","We stayed one night pre cruise at this beautiful hotel, arriving very early morning after a transatlantic flight.  Our room was not available but the staff was happy to store our luggage for us.  Location is wonderful and we walked all over central Dublin before checking in.  Spent a very relaxing couple of hours with Irish coffees in the lovely garden.  We were pretty worn out and went to bed around 10 pm only to be rudely awakened at 1:15 am by loud thumping music from across the street (our modern, spacious room faced the street).  We thought oh well, it will likely stop at 1:30....2:00...2:30 etc.  By the time it finally stopped and the crowd had poured out onto the street at 4:30 am we were all so angry there was no way anyone was going to get ANY sleep!  I mentioned to the staff when we checked out that we had all had a very miserable night and she offered to get the manager.  He was very apologetic and told us that the club was due to close and that they had not been advised that the event was going to take place.  He offered his personal email and a 50% discount on a future booking, along with a guarantee of a room in the back of the hotel.  We would definitely consider staying here again as the staff were all lovely and rooms were very spacious with huge bathrooms.  The only reason we did not give 5 stars was due to the unfortunate noise issue.",4,2019,05,18
221,Great place to stay in Dublin,"Excellent location just a short walk to St Stephen’s Green, and a bit apart from the hurly burly of the city. It was easy to get to the HoHo bus, and plenty of taxis if you don’t want to walk. We’ll be back there again next week! ",5,2019,05,16
221,Perfect hotel in the heart of Dublin,"Superb service, tiptop comfort, lovely location.  The garden itself is adjacent, and worth a visit.  The room was extremely well laid out.  Modern bathroom features. Everyone friendly and helpful. Definitely worth a return trip.",5,2019,05,15
221,City Pod is awful,"So, I had the distinct displeasure of calling one of the City Pods home for 5 dreadful nights. 
They basically feel like a prison, are in the basement of the hotel and you have one teeny tiny window in the room which you can only partially open (guessing for safety). Also, these are terrible rooms for someone with claustrophobia.
These rooms are incredibly loud (street noise and noise from rooms above), stuffy, depressing and all around not a way of spending a night I’d wish even upon my worst of enemies. I think I slept at most 2 hours a night here.
Now, the overall hotel (the non city pod parts) are lovely. Generally the staff is nice, the location of the hotel is good as well.
Sad to say I can not recommend this hotel simply because is my horrid experience in the city pod room I suffered thru.",1,2019,05,15
221,nicest pricey,"dropped in for drink before dinner. Lovely place for a drink, nice decor, large and airy. A number of people eating at the tables and looked nice. Got some nibbles with the drinks but you would expect something at the cost of a glass of wine...very pricey. Toilets clean but was expecting a more premium feel.",4,2019,05,14
221,Very good choice,"Very nice hotel. We had a family room and it was very spacious. Good location 5 minuet walk to St Stephens Green. Very pleasantly surpassed how good the restaurant was. Not just good food but VERY good food, Good hotel choice.",4,2019,05,14
221,This hotel is a GEM!,"Two couples stayed here for 2 nights last week.  Joseph Carroll and his staff (Mario was very helpful!) made our stay wonderful!  Rooms are spotless and the bathroom is beautiful with stunning marble sink and modern shower in a beautiful grey stone bathroom.  The buffet breakfast is truly wonderful - hot dishes (eggs, pancakes, bacon, oatmeal, etc) and lovely yogurt bar, pastries, muffins, cheeses, fruit, etc!  Beautiful restaurant area and attentive staff.
Location is nice - near St. Stephens Green, Grafton Street and even local Camden Street.  Alley across the street takes you to Camden Street and lots of wonderful pubs and restaurants there.  Roof bar and restaurant also across the street at the Dean Hotel.
Local suggestions - Bailey's Bar (Grafton St) for lunch/dinner, Green 19 for healthy and delicious lunch or dinner and we LOVED Devitt's Pub for drinks and Irish music!
Most of all we loved the Iveagh Garden - a true Gem of a hotel.  Elegant and comfortable.",5,2019,05,13
221,Wonderful,"A really nice hotel, modern take on traditional luxury. The room was wonderfull, clean and spacy, friendly staff, big diversity for breakfast, good performance price/quality. I had a good stay. Definitely eccomend to stay.",4,2019,05,12
221,"Excellent hotel, great location","Was in Dublin for a couple of days for a business trip and was recommended to stay at the Iveagh Garden Hotel. As soon as I arrived I knew we'd made a great decision. 

A really nice hotel with friendly, attentive staff. 

I was allocated in room 2101 which was a room for disabled visitors (I am fully able bodied). The room was excellent (once I had figured our how to turn on the bathroom light!). Only minor criticism would be that it would be good to have a proper chair to be able to sit at the desk if you need to work. 

Breakfast was excellent and we also had dinner while we were there. 

Will definitely stay here again. Such a great location in the heart of the city and two minutes away from Grafton Street. ",5,2019,05,11
221,New comfortable hotel and good location.,"We nave had a good staying in this hotel. Just a few steps from the the centre. Clean and quiet room at the second floor. Kind staff at the reception, nice hall full of books. I'll recommend this hotel to all my friends.",5,2019,05,11
221,Afternoon tea big business event,"Amazing service when waited on constantly asked was everything okay attention to when water was low all the small details who wanted coffee tea no mix ups a good amount too there was left overs (which is a sin at afternoon tea) 🤣🤣food perfect with a twist, beautiful decor exquisite hotel",4,2019,05,10
221,Amazing spot in the heart of Dublin,"This is a great hotel in walking distance of all you could need to experience dublin. We had an amazing stay. The room was wonderful, the staff were friendly and we had a great time- I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone",5,2019,05,08
221,Deluxe rooms are not deluxe.,"Was fairly expensive for what was on offer. Very small room, no air conditioning, had to walk sideways around parts of the room as it was so small. 

Can not use a firestick on the TV as it is fixed to the wall with a wooden border. 

Apart from being very small, the room was okay, the bed was comfortable although sleep was problematic due to the temperature. There was a desk fan in the room. 

Didn’t really stay in the room much because of its size, so not as relaxing a break as I would have hoped. 

The shower  was good, although the water did not drain away properly so the cleaner obviously had to dry it on every visit. Not good standing in old cold water if you have more than one shower between housekeeping visits. 

I would say go here, but without the high expectations that the above average reception/communal areas might create. 

The staff I encountered in the hotel were exceptionally friendly without being over familiar. A big plus for this place. 

Not a bad location if you don’t mind a bit of a walk to the river. ",3,2019,05,06
221,EAM,Good city centre location although noisy after 2am. Car parking is an issue as it’s 10 mins away. The single rooms on -1 are tiny and resemble a phone box.  Nice reception area and opposite copper face jacks...,3,2019,05,05
221,"4 star hotel, 5 star experience!","Stayed here with my wife when after attending a wedding in a different hotel. The immediate impressions was of a hotel that looked great and that beautiful decor continued throughout the hotel. Staff were friendly and helpful, especially as we needed early check in in order to be on time for the wedding. Room was lovely and comfortable and clean and again, the decor was to a high standard (even the rubbish bin looked nice!). Breakfast the following morning was excellent, great selection of good food for all tastes. Fully intend staying here again as also the price was very reasonable for what you get.",5,2019,05,05
221,"Great location, very comfortable hotel with exceptional service","We chose the Iveagh Garden Hotel on the recommendation of a friend, it being close to St Stephen Square, Grafton Street and not too long a walk form the 3 Arena.
it is a lovely warm inviting property with very comfortable rooms, a very nice bar and restaurant which my wife had been to previously.
We were advised to request a rear facing room as the Hotel faces a row of very popular clubs. We had a room overlooking the restaurant conservatory which was quiet and was perfect for our stay.
On the first night we experienced a problem with guests of a company who were holding an event on the premises. We are pragmatic and understand that problems do occur and have always felt that the most important thing in a customer service environment is the way they are dealt with.
The Manager, Neil really did go way beyond our expectation in the way he dealt with our problem and he made sure his staff followed through with all the finer details. This really made our stay special and memorable.",5,2019,05,03
221,"Pretty, loud, modern","The Iveagh Garden Hotel seems like a very luxury and exclusive hotel from the outside. I came in and i was very impressed it looks very modern and beautiful. The service is very good and also fast. The rooms are small and clean so everything was fine and it seemed to be a very good hotel. Then I went to sleep and it was so loud outside from all the clubs that I couldn’t sleep it was a horrible night!! The next morning was better because I had a good shower probably one of the best of my life and the breakfast was also ok. 
I can recommend this hotel for young people who want to go out in the night but for everyone else is this not a got hotel.",3,2019,05,03
221,Just Great at Everything,"My wife and I stayed here for our one year anniversary.  From the moment we entered the extremely classy lobby, we were treated with kindness and helpful staff.  Our double bed room on the 4th floor was clean and well maintained.  The restaurant inside the bar had a nice selection for breakfast, along with very polite bartenders. We would recommend this place to anyone!",5,2019,05,02
221,I Wanted to Love this Hotel but...,"So, as you approach the hotel, it's really lovely and as you enter the lobby it's beautiful! Check in was pretty fast, we gave our credit card for incidentals and were given our room keys and headed up. We were on the 3rd floor, with a room facing the street, directly across from a bar/club.  
So far so good....however as we soon found out..that's where it ended.  There is no coffee, breakfast or to go treats offered before 6:30 am, so as we had tours scheduled at 7am, we were out of luck for any sort of anything at this self proclaimed 4 Star hotel.  We had dinner at the hotel restaurant and while the food was amazing, the staff was NOT.  Before we sat, we gave our room number for the bill to be charged to our room, to 3 DIFFERENT people...We had 4 DIFFERENT people ask me what ""what was I having again""...they gave me red zin when I asked for a cab, then when I asked about it, I was met with a rude response...finally yet another person brought my wine order... We didn't have the same server once during our meal so there was no consistency, hence the repetitive questions...Lastly as we were leaving, we were literally chased down in front of the elevators as one of the servers was confused as to why we only left 40 for the bill. We explained the 40 was for a tip and the check was to be charged to the card we submitted at check in.....and we headed upstairs.  The phone rings immediately and were told that the card we submitted at check in in NOT the same card they use for the restaurant....so...can someone come down ?  I MEAN REALLY ????????? We were asked numerous times before dinner as to the billing...then chased down at the elevators ...and then called...and they couldn't have handled this at check in or explained any of it ?????????? USUALLY there's one card requested and all charges go to it...beware this is not explained and it's NOT how they do things.  For the remaining of our 5 night stay, each day we had to call b/c well...there's only A/C in SOME rooms and well, they forgot to mention that there's no air circulation except an incredibly LOUD fan that we ran all day every day...none of the rooms have 2 doubles we were told...so one of us had the twin while the other had the double...oops forgot to mention that on the reservation as well.. housekeeping forgot...toilet..paper...soap...towels...water...and the list goes on.  

This is NOT the expectation of a 4 star hotel, I'm not sure what's going on at this hotel, but while it's lovely to look at and close to shopping, it's certainly not somewhere I would call 4 Stars, EVER.",3,2019,05,02
221,Short break in Dublin.,"A central, clean and comfortable hotel. Good food in restaurant but we had to wait nearly 45 minutes for our first meal there! Lovely choice at breakfast time including smoked salmon and herrings. Hope to stay again soon in the not too distant future.",4,2019,05,01
221,Walk to Everything!,"We stayed for four nights at the Iveagh. It is in a top location to walk all over Dublin, or catch public transportation, while backing up to the lovely St. Stephen’s Green.

The breakfast is delicious, we highly recommend their buffet, and the cappuccinos were fantastic.the waitstaff works very hard to please the caffeine-crazed populace.

Our only issue with this hotel was the loud bars across the street. The noise definitely spills out to the street, during the wee hours when I would have vastly preferred to sleep. Neil was able to move us to a room on the back of the building with no problems. Thank you Neil! We would definitely stay here again and just make sure we had a room facing the back.",5,2019,05,01
221,Should be a 5 star hotel,"Stayed here for one night and would of loved to stay another. The hotel decor is very stylish and you could be in any country in the world. The staff from start to finish were very welcoming and helpful. We arrived early and they were accommodating and allowed us to check in early. The room itself was quite large and again the interior was very attractive. The bathroom was amazing and the views from our room were just as good. The bed was super comfortable. The location is great. Close to Nightlife centre. Right beside a Luas stop too. We got a great last minute deal too so. In all, everything was great and we would highly recommend it to people wanting to stay in a nice hotel that is well located.",5,2019,04,30
221,Perfect hotel,"Amazing classy hotel with the most beautiful interiors. Based in a central location with easy access to all the main tourist parts. The staff are so accommodating, overall value for money and must when staying in Dublin :-)",5,2019,04,30
221,everything has its price,"I stayed in one of the city pods for 2 nights whilst at a conference.  In many ways the room provides minimalist functionality.  I asked for a kettle for making tea/coffee and it was provided.  If all you want is a place to rest your head for a night it might just do the job.  Unfortunately I did  not sleep at all one of the nights because the room got so hot - the window is tiny - exhaust fumes flooded the room at one point.  The city pod is a very basic accommodation so maybe expecting more is a bit of a stretch.  Staff friendly, checking in and out was efficient.",2,2019,04,29
221,Citypod,"Great hotel, enjoyed my stay in a citypod. Very nice and helpful  personnel. The bar was very beautiful. Would definitely stay in this hotel again. Clean and comfortable room. Great location if you know the city. ",5,2019,04,29
221,"Stylish, modern boutique hotel","I really liked the hotel, the staff were friendly and my room was excellent.  The only down-side for me was the location; the one-way system and slow traffic means taxis are expensive and I was kept awake the second night by loud music at a nearby pub/nightclub.",4,2019,04,29

221,Beautiful hotel in great location. ,"Beautiful hotel in a great location. Friendly and helpful staff, especially concierge Sean     
Easy walk to Grafton Street, Temple bar area, River and all the sights. Ask for rear facing room as bars opposite can be noisy at the weekends.  Check out Italian La Cucina  and Murphys Ice Cream .. The Best! ",5,2019,04,27
221,"Lovely new hotel, great location. ","The hotel is lovely, New and stylish. The rooms are well decorated, if a bit small, and the walk in showers are great. Although this means no bath. The bar area is lovely, If the weather had been better it would have been a great place to seat out, as it was its peaceful area, with lots of light and greenary. They have some great beers on draft, which I always appreciate. I'd stay again I think, although for what you pay breakfast wouldn't be out of the question, and although the staff all say hello and seem quite friendly, the dude that chased us up the stairs for our glasses needs to chill.

221,Restaurant/Bar staff unbelievably rude.,"I am absolutely shocked. I was visiting Dublin with my mum and my bridesmaid looking for a wedding dress. Myself and my mum stayed in the hotel.We had dinner and drinks and spent alot of money, the waiter Michal snatched the bill from my hand when we were deciding whether or not to have another cocktail. A waitress, Lauren made smart comment about me and was mocking what I was saying absolutely, worst experience ever in a restaurant! Disgraceful customer service.

The staff who were at the front desk were friendly and helpful and the room was lovely. 

So disappointed with how I was treated by restaurant staff. Disgraceful.",1,2019,04,25
221,A MUST STAY - FABULOUS HOTEL,"A fabulous hotel - great location, very clean, new and amazing service.  The front Porter Shaun (I think that's his name( is superb at his job. Very professional, extremely friendly and bloody awesome at his job. Thank you for A wonderful stay at your hotel. Would definitely stay again and highly recommend for others to stay. ",5,2019,04,25
221,Impressive,"My first trip to Dublin I had high expectations and I was not disappointed. I contacted Tristan Jacob at the Iveagh Garden prior arriving as our company Sojern, uses the Iveagh as our hotel of choice in Dublin. Tristan and his team did not disappoint. From the friendly first impression greeting from the doorman to the team at the front desk. Top notch service  from start to finish. Camilla and the wait staff in the hotel restaurant could not have been more friendly or kind. My room was modern and comfortable and was a warm welcome from the smaller hotel rooms I experienced in London the week prior. The genuine care for the guests and  attention to detail of this beautiful new modern hotel make this a MUST stay when in Dublin! I’m headed back to Dublin in August and look forward to my next stay at the Iveagh Garden!",5,2019,04,25
221,Very poor service,"The hotel is very beautiful, freshly decorated and very central.  I stayed in one of the rooms they call City Pods, which means that they are small lower ground floor rooms with a tiny window, and only suitable for solo travellers.  The price was quite high, but the space was very small and in the worst part of the hotel.  But I stayed for only one night, so I guess it wasn't a big problem.
  I decided to write this review because of the bad experience I had.  I was very surprised to find a party going on in the reception area just near my room on the lower ground floor, when I got back to the hotel at around 12:30am.  The party went on into the early hours of the morning.
  I could hear loud music and shouts even through the various doors and I managed to sleep only thanks to a pair of earplugs that I had brought with me completely by chance.
  I would have expected to be notified about the plan to have a loud party next to my room when I checked in.  Had I known it, I would have requested to be moved to a different floor (and I would have been happy to pay the difference in price).  When I got back at night it was definitely too late to complain and I was too tired to move rooms.
  I loved the hotel, but having loud music being played outside your door from inside the hotel itself is not acceptable.  This is definitely not what I expected when I booked into a 4-star hotel and reception staff did not even ask me how my stay was at check-out.  Customer service was absolutely not up to standard.
  I think they should advertise on all booking websites that the City Pods rooms are near a heavy-partying area and noise can be expected throughout the night.
  On top of this, the hotel is situated in one of Dublin's busiest streets for party goers, with a lot of clubs and people, so not really a very quiet area.  I suggest you avoid it if you want a peaceful stay.
  On top of all this, I made contact with the hotel to inform them of the above situation and to date I have received no response.",1,2019,04,22
221,Great hotel,Loved this hotel for its location and service. It is in a great location for the city centre and the tramline. The food in the restaurant was lovely and well presented. Highly recommend this for all sorts of trips.,5,2019,04,21
221,A great find!,We had a great 2 nights at Iveagh Gardens hotel and would highly recommend to anyone looking at Dublin for a city break. The hotel is just round the corner from st Stephen's green and 5 min walk from Grafton Street making it a fab location. We stayed mid-week but I think the noise from the clubs over the road maybe noisy at the weekend??? But this didnt affect us. Elles bar is nice for a meal and drinks and breakfast is brilliant-lots of choice. Staff were all very helpful and welcoming. We would definitely choose this hotel again.,5,2019,04,21
221,Charming Hotel,Great boutique hotel with amazing staff. Yummy food in their restaurant. They put on a lovely buffet breakfast and their dinner menu was delicious. Tristan was not only a great help but an asset to the hotel. He went above and beyond for us. I look forward to staying there on future visits. ,5,2019,04,20
221,Amazing stay!,"The hotel was amazing! Super friendly staff, very comfortable bedroom and bed. Everything was clean and ready for us when we got to the hotel. We didn't try the breakfast, dinner or even a snack but the place looked good! The location was perfect, they set our room in the back so it would be less noisyo. Would definitely  recommendand would love to go back again!",5,2019,04,19

221,Weekend Stay,"Loved the location which was just around the corner from St Stephens Green and only a short walk to Grafton Street.
The hotel itself was very decent and the rooms were spot on. The staff were also very helpful and friendly.",4,2019,04,16
221,"Good room , location and breakfast","Ticked all the boxes except parking. Good size family room, big shower in lovely modern bathroom, great breakfast spread, 10 minutes walk to key areas for restaurants and sites. If I’m picky Couldn’t get heating to work in room but warm enough and sink tap is in a stupid place for functionality. If you come with a car difficult to stop and drop off and then parking is in a nearby car park at a reduced rate.",4,2019,04,16
221,Classy and convenient,"Nice hotel with elegant furnishings, lobby, and hotel bar. Within a few blocks of numerous restaurants on Grafton Street as well as St. Stephen's Green. Several nice breakfast and coffee places are nearby, as well.",5,2019,04,15
221,Poor service and cleanliness,Arrived to find the room I had been allocated had not been cleaned properly ....so bad that the previous occupants forgotten dirty clothing had been left hanging out in the room ....when asked to collect/remove/clean had to chase twice to get the hotel staff to respond- just very poor experience all round. Will not stay again. ,2,2019,04,15
221,Weekend away.,"Booked the Iveagh for a weekend away with my partner. Great location for seeing Dublin . I booked by phone and had a very pleasant and efficient experience with Joseph I think. . The check in staff were a little less attentive I felt even though it was quiet at the time, not making eye contact and not offering to carry our bags to our room which is  normal here I think.. Nice room though with good quality linen and fittings, no expense spared here. we didn't eat here apart for a quick bite of bar food which was the normal fare and a really nice breakfast on the morning we left. Overall a really nice Hotel with great location which I would visit again and would recommend.",4,2019,04,15
221,"Stylish,Comfortable and Excellent Location","We stayed here on Saturday night as part of a mature hen party. The rooms were lovely and clean and so fresh and lovely carpets and bathrooms. The beds were really good too. I was really pleasantly surprised, I have to be honest as it has a real boutique hotel feel with lots of space downstairs to sit and have a coffee in a really gorgeous lobby area. The bar area is really cool and i peeked into the private function room in the basement and it has lots of gorgeous interior design led styling in it. I will definitely return here and its so handy only a ten minute walk to the main shopping street of Grafton Street and 5 minutes walk to the nearest Luas stop to get to the hotel The staff were lovely too, very naturally friendly. I loved the style of the hotel in every way.",5,2019,04,15
221,What a find!,"Loved this hotel, great location, very, very clean, excellent breakfast and comfortable rooms. Best sleep of our ten day trip! Large, updated modern rooms, big bathroom and plenty of room for all of our things!  Staff very pleasant. Only drawback is parking as it is a bit far from the hotel. Recommend highly",5,2019,04,14
221,Perfect trip away,"The hotel was beautifully decorated - we stayed in one of the City Pods and where amazed how modern and spacious the room was (a double and a single bed). The bed pillows were so comfortable!! There's a ironing board, iron, hairdryer and kettle within the room.

The bathroom was clean and bright, the only little thing it didn't have is a shelve in the shower for your shower gel- but not a biggy!

Location is a 10 minute walk to the shops and pubs.

We had a few cocktails in restaurant/bar - the price of the drinks was not too dissimilar to those In the pubs. 

We would definitely stay at this hotel again if we come back to Dublin!

221,Great new addition ,"It hasn’t been opened that long but it’s already a firm favourite of mine in Dublin. 
Chic, stylish with spacious rooms, my first experience of the Iveagh Garden Hotel will definitely not be my last.

221,Perfect hotel,"Had the most beautiful stay with my husband for our anniversary, the hotel is literally faultless. Perfect rooms, gorgeous bar and reception area and even the elevators were amazing.

221,Business lunch - very impressive,"Visited here in Feb for a business lunch and I was very impressed. Although a reservation was needed, the restaurant itself wasn’t too busy. The service, decor and food was delicious - I recommend the beef burger.

221,Lovely hotel,"Had a lovely stay for a long weekend at the Iveagh Garden. Our second trip to Dublin and this hotel was terrific! Centrally located, and easy walk to restaurants, pubs and attractions. The hotel is modern, room was nicely appointed and very comfortable. Got into Dublin very early and while we could not check in, they held our luggage and it was in our room when we returned to the hotel. We had drinks and dinner in the hotel one evening and enjoyed the innovative cocktail menu and the service at dinner was attentive and congenial. Food was terrific as well. 

We enjoyed our stay at Iveagh Garden and would not hesitate staying here again. ",5,2019,04,01
221,Fantastic Dublin hotel with great location,"This was my 30th trip to Dublin so I have stayed in many hotels in the centre. The Iveagh Gardens in this price range, is by far and a way the best I have stayed in. Everything about the hotel has a touch of class, lovely staff and outstanding shower room and bedrooms. We had a room at the back of the hotel so had no noise at all but not sure if you may be effected by noise at the front as there is a nightclub over the road. Great bar to meet up in also before hitting the bright lights of Dublin. Will definitely stay again.",5,2019,04,01
221,"Gorgeous hotel, but service could be better","Decor is fab is reception and bar and rooms are lovely. However, this is let down by service.  It is a bit cold and unwelcoming.  We were told breakfast would be over at 10.30 before we even sat down.  It was only 10am at this stage, so we thought we had plenty of time.  It felt like we were being told to eat up quickly and get out..not very relaxing!",4,2019,03,28

221,"Be sure to ask for assistance if you need it, because it might not be offered.","Good location. Friendly staff that could be more helpful. Beautiful building. Superbly spotless. The bar and restaurant are big with many guests.

As in Europe, many buildings were built before anyone considered wheeled or handicap access. Some of the rooms require negotiating stairs (mine did). Also the ""City Pods"", where I lodged, are very small Spartan rooms. The desk space barely accommodated my computer, and I was on a business trip. Also I am in my 60s, and I arrived with a big piece of professional luggage in addition to my clothing bag. When I checked in, I was obliged to find my room by myself and to negotiate stairs with about 100# of luggage with no offer of assistance from the staff. I did manage, but it would have been very nice of the staff to guide me to my room and to help me with my bags, like the staff did in my hotel in Poland.",4,2019,03,23

The staff were very friendly and helpful without being intrusive. We had the champagne version and it was delicious. When it was thought I had let my champagne become room temperature I was given a fresh glass.The attention to detail is what makes a pleasurable experience into a stand-out one.
We don't normally do afternoon tea in the same place twice but I will definitely make an exception in this instance.",4,2019,03,20

The bathroom is clean and looks like something from a spa and the bar downstairs is gorgeous - great for photos! Best of all was the staff who treated us like royalty and ensured we wanted for nothing, thank you so much :D",5,2019,03,20
221,Very nice hotel in a great location,"Excellent breakfast, super friendly and helpful staff, nice room, perfect location.
Unfortunately, the heating in my room was way too hot an couldn't be regulated. Staff tried several times to fix it but were unable to do so.",4,2019,03,19
221,St Patrick’s week stay,"We came to Dublin during the busiest week- St Patrick’s week/weekend. We had stayed at another hotel for the first two nights then transferred to Iveagh Gareden hotel for the last 4 nights. We arrived in the morning and were not expecting to have our room ready, but to our surprise it was! The front desk was very efficient and courteous throughout our stay and assisted us in booking cabs when we needed. One night our toilet stopped flushing, they sent someone up immediately who arrived within 5 minutes and fixed the issue in less than 10 minutes! The restaurant, Elle’s is fantastic. Wonderful cocktails and delicious bites...order the charcuterie plate, you will not be disappointed. Next door to two beautiful gardens to stroll- St Stephens and Iveagh and within walking distance to many attractions. Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,03,18
221,Weekend break ,"Lovely hotel, great location. Friendly staff and especially Carl on the door who went the extra mile to look after us. We had a meal at the 1900 restaurant and had drinks at black door next to the restaurant-live music in a chilled atmosphere with table service. If you want something more lively Devitts across the road and coppers are perfect. Everything you need for any tastes young or older is catered for nearby. Definitely stay again.",5,2019,03,17
221,"Decent location, horrible experience","The experience was awful from checking in until we left. We arrived in the morning, and as expected the room wasn't ready. So we set off to grab some lunch and upon returning back to the hotel we asked if our room was ready and it was not. After travelling nearly 24 hours, we decided just to wait in the lobby until it would be ready. Nearly two hours later, I checked in with the front desk again and they shared it had been ready for OVER AN HOUR. We were the ONLY people in the lobby and they didn't bother to let us know we could get into our room after sitting there and checking in multiple times. Then the next day, after a long 12 hour tour day we asked for new towels to shower - they NEVER arrived. We resorted to using old, wet and cold towels from that morning. The next night we ordered room service and it showed up to our room COLD, with no cover or tray and without silverware to eat with. The room was very hot our entire stay - the small window barely allowed for any cool or fresh air to come in. One of our last nights there, we decided to grab a drink in their bar. The bartenders were rude, made derogatory comments about being Americans as we walked away from the bar and chased one of us down after the other paid insinuating we hadn't paid for our drinks. Breakfast buffet was cold, empty and cleaned up before the end time. We barely were able to eat anything before we were rushed out. The only pleasant experience we had was with the front door/concierge gentleman. Overall, the whole experience was absolutely awful and we will NEVER return or recommend this to anyone! Very disappointed in our stay!!!!",1,2019,03,15
221,Modern hotel in an old city,Nice clean accommodation.  Beautiful tiled bathroom with glass walled walk-in shower. Friendly and helpful front desk staff.  Lounge area in lobby with coal burning fireplace.  Restaurant on sight.  Close to restaurants.,4,2019,03,14
221,perfect hotel for a citytrip to Dublin,"Good beds, quiet rooms (on request, we were on the 5th floor in the back of the hotel), excellent breakfast, great location and good service, ideal for a city trip! The airlink bus stop arround the corner brings you in about 40min to the airport. We'll be back for sure!",5,2019,03,11
221,Swanky Dublin Hotel,"I was very pleased with my recent stay at Iveagh Garden Hotel. The hotel itself is beautiful. I'm not a big fan of gold, and let's be honest, it's easy to go bad with too much of it, but they manage to make the place look swanky without being garish. The whole place had a Great Gatsby vibe.

- Staff was friendly and helpful
- Restaurant and bar was upscale but comfortable
- Room was smallish but comfortable with a great bed
- Bathroom was very nice and shower was excellent
- Location was very convenient

Finally, I heard some people complain about the ""club"" across the street, and yes, it's a little dodgy, but I didn't experience any problems or disruptions.

If you want a nice hotel away from Temple Bar district, The Iveagh offers a high end boutique experience, close to St. Stephens Green and all the major attractions, without the crowds.",5,2019,03,11
221,Amazing Hotel with Exceptional Staff,"I was recently involved in organizing an event at the Iveagh garden hotel. From my initial contact with the hotel, to checking out, the entire experience was excellent. The event management team were responsive, flexible and incredibly accommodating during the planning phase. During the event, management and all the ground staff were exceptionally helpful and pleasant. We were made feel so welcome. The hotel itself is in a brilliant location and is beautifully decorated. Despite the central location, the rooms are very quiet and really comfortable. The food and cocktails are top quality. Everyone who attended the event complimented the choice of location. I highly recommend the hotel to anyone for a trip, event or social outing.",5,2019,03,10
221,Fabulous stay at the Iveagh,"Incredibly warm and helpful staff who effortlessly went that extra mile. Spotlessly clean, classy, tasteful decor, brilliant location, excellent breakfast....I could go on but the outstanding element was the personal engagement made by staff with their guests. It was such a welcoming place to stay. We will definitely be returning. ",5,2019,03,07
221,"Nice hotel, but no personal touch","Stayed for two nights as a family party. Hotel is nice enough to use as a stopgap if you’re in and out exploring the city but lacks that personal touch. Staff didn’t seem to really know what they were doing in the bar and on the check in desk and needed direction. Had to ask for dressing gowns and slippers at the desk but this was sorted for us no problem once we asked. Rooms were comfy and had everything for a two night stay, but as others pointed out the hotel is opposite a bar which plays music into the night. This wasn’t an issue for us as we were out late into the night anyway but can imagine it may have been an issue for those wanting early nights. Location was a good middle ground and we were able to walk both into temple bar and to the Guinness Storehouse with no issue.",4,2019,03,05
221,"Lovely hotel,beautiful room & great breakfast","My fiancée and I stayed here for one night on 22nd Feb 19. In truth,I was a little unsure about staying in the ‘Harcourt Street’ area of Dublin as I know that there are a couple of nightclubs near by and we were conscious of being kept up until 5am. 

I requested a quieter room and we were put on the 5th floor. It was a lovely and modern room and we had complementary chocolates and Prosecco free of charge for a special occasion (which was a really nice touch). Most importantly it was quiet also:)

My only issue with the room was the pressure of the shower. The bathroom and shower was really nice just a bit more pressure would be good. 

The bar area is stunning too and I was so happy that they did one of my favourite beers on draught- ‘Paulaner’

The breakfast was great also..I’m someone who likes the finer details in life..and I was impressed that we had the choice of different coffees and teas rather than just filter coffee. I love a nice freshly made ‘americano’ in the morning and it was great to have it. I also love ‘eggs benedict’- maybe that could be available for the next time we stay?i did see it on the menu when we came in but it was an additional charge. I also loved the HP sauce and Heinz tomato ketchup in small glass jars. The selection on the breakfast was really good. 

Overall we had a great stay and thank you. Looking forward to staying again:)",5,2019,03,04
221,Over-priced,"Booked this hotel for two nights to celebrate my 64th birthday with my daughter. Found the front desk staff unfriendly and unhelpful: rang in advance to see about booking a car from the airport and was told it was not a service they offered (though their brochure says otherwise). Also rang to inform them that we had been delayed one night by fog in London; their response was similarly unfriendly. The twin room was small and dark; the breakfast was average (greasy eggs, soggy bacon and little thought for vegetarians). On a positive note, the bar staff were friendly.",1,2019,03,04
221,Absolutely perfect,"Astonishing hotel. Great rooms, beautiful decor and terrifically helpful and friendly staff. And the food and location both wonderful. The gorgeous Iveagh Gardens (the Secret Garden) just around the corner, and it's a place you must visit while in Dublin,",5,2019,03,03
221,"Beautiful hotel, great location, poor staff",Great location for getting around Dublin easily! Hotel is really nice with the style and setting. Staff on the front desk were not very well trained in conversing with customers. Unfortunately not good value for the money. ,3,2019,03,02
221,Excellent location and value for money,Could not fault this hotel for a short stay in Dublin. Great location. Spotlessly clean. Great value given surrounding hotel prices. My room didn’t have air conditioning and was slightly too hot for my liking but I might be in the minority in liking a cooler room. ,5,2019,03,02
221,3 days in Dublin,"Nice hotel with good service and kind/efficient concierge. Nearby Dublin Center and easy to walk from. Grafton street and the musicians are very close, Saint Stephen Garden as well.
Overall a very nice 3 nights stay",4,2019,03,01
221,Wouldn't recommend the Pods,"I stayed here in December with my husband for  one night. We were staying in a Pod which was located in the basement. When i asked the man at reception was the room very small (we didn't have a choice of the room at the time), he replied 'it's unique'. This didn't really answer the question so i could only assume that it was tiny............it was. Completely unsuitable for 2 people. Because it was located in the basement it was also extremely warm so we had to open the window. Once you do that you have to contend with all the noise out on the street for the entire night with people leaving clubs etc. We paid €180 for this room which is extortionate and would not recommend at all. The bathroom scenario is also not great in these rooms, you would want to know the person you are staying with very well and even then, a little privacy would be appreciated. 

Breakfast the next morning was a standard buffet which was ok.",3,2019,03,01
221,Nice hotel. Shame about the management of it!,"Just got back from the Iveagh after a one-night stay for our 25th wedding anniversary. The hotel décor is nice. Elle restaurant was brilliant. Both the food and the service. we had the set dinner and aside from a limited choice, the food was nicely presented and cooked to perfection. Breakfast the next morning was also well above par (even though we arrived 10 minutes before they stopped serving at 1000) Great selection of both healthy and full Irish. My issues were with the booking process and the rooms. I booked the 1-night high life package on 13th January for €240.20. This was B&B Dinner and late check out (3PM) on 26th Feb. I thought this was reasonably good value for a city centre hotel. A few days before I looked at another room for some friends who said they may join us. I then saw that the rate for the same package was €213.20. So, I checked the hotel terms and conditions and they have a ""best rate guaranteed"". I called the hotel and asked why I was paying €27 more than this rate and was told that this would be rectified. 2 days before travel I e-mailed the property asking for confirmation that this had indeed been done and I got the reply from Joseph [-]

****I was stopped by Tripadvisor from posting the actual text of the e-mail here but suffice to say it was a list of excuses about the best rat guarantee only applying to other booking sites. Apparently, their best rate does not apply to them. Go figure!
 So, this information from Mr Carroll greatly annoyed me, not so much for the money but for the misleading information. I asked him where it said this on the website........No answer!!! 
 For my work I mostly use Expedia for hotel bookings (around 120 room nights per year) and on this occasion did not as I wanted to book with the hotel directly, so I was assured of a nice room and the best price (not guaranteed with Expedia). So, yes, there is a best rate guarantee, but it only applies to every other company. The Iveagh doesn't have to honour it! Disgraceful 
 The room was small enough but nice. When booking I requested a room at the back of the hotel overlooking the garden. On check in I was told that the room was at the back and overlooking the garden. It was at the back but the view....see the attached photo! 
 Now, there were two of us here so I would have thought that It would have been nice to be able to BOTH have a shower before dinner and again the next day before we left. We had TWO bath towels. And the amenities which the hotel are so proud off in their room description - 1 small bottle of shampoo, one of conditioner and the smallest bar of soap I have ever seen in a hotel. We tossed a coin to see who would get the soap. See picture attached. Yes, we could have requested more from Housekeeping, but why should we have too. At the very least there should be 2 of each! I have stayed in economy hotels and would get at least one PER PERSON. 
 Then on the day of departure, at 1240, I get a call from the front desk saying I should have checked out. I said the checkout time was 3PM and he then said I would have to pay for the extra 3 hours. I asked him to check our reservation and the terms of same. 
 Overall a disappointing experience on what should have been a happy occasion.

NB. As with other guests who have posted bad reviews, I am not interested in contacting any one directly so an investigation can be carried out. Just try training your FOH staff to check a reservation before calling the guest and asking them to pay even more for an extended check out. And if you have a best rate guarantee, either stick to it or at the very least publish the terms on your website!",2,2019,03,01
221,Five stars,"Had such a lovely stay at the Iveagh Garden recently. Fab decor, spotlessly clean, friendly staff, excellent location. Couldn't have asked for any more. So competitively priced too. Can't wait to return",5,2019,02,28
221,"Cute Lobby & Bar, Great Location & Style","The decor of the Iveagh Garden Hotel and entrance/lobby was so well-designed and welcoming, particularly during the holiday season. Also loved the bar. The room was clean and modern with a nice big shower and bathroom. The location was excellent - pretty much everything you could need to explore Dublin. I found the room quiet. The view from the room wasn't anything to speak about, but we were there mostly to sleep and left to do all the great things in the city. The front desk staff was also very nice.",5,2019,02,27
221,Beautiful,"Stunning hotel in a perfect location if you are visiting the city.
Overnight stay with lunch. food was beautiful and staff are so friendly & helpful. Very modern & funky decor.
Price a bit steep, but on reflection , sadly, everything in Dublin is severely overpriced in comparison to every other county in Ireland. ",5,2019,02,27
221,Stunning Hotel In A Great Central Location,"We stayed 2 nights at the Iveagh Gardens over a weekend and had a pleasant stay. The design of the hotel is beautiful and the property is very clean too. The Deluxe Room is of a generous size with a lovely ensuite filled with the normal amenities you'd expect. Our room was located at the rear of the hotel and did have some noise from the nightclubs but nothing that prevented us from having a good nights sleep. 

The only feedback I have is regarding celebrating ocassions whilst at the hotel;  the purpose of our trip to Dublin was to celebrate my Husbands 30th birthday and by no means did I expect any added touches in the room or freebies but it would have been nice perhaps to have a welcome note acknowledging that as I had emailed the hotel twice to advise before arrival. 
",4,2019,02,26
221,Good for a long weekend stay,"I would say this was a good choice for a long weekend but would have probably expected slightly higher standards for a 4-star hotel. Unfortunately the hotel is quite close to some nightclubs and we coulf hear considerable noise on Saturday night so may be worth avoiding on the weekend. The room was fine but found the bed was a little hard for my liking. Otherwise, it is a great location and easy connection from the airport. ",3,2019,02,25

221,Overnight in Dublin,Our room was a good size and breakfast was excellent reasonable price. And there were TWO armchairs for two people! (Not always the case). We have stayed in most of the top hotels in Dublin and this compared favourably.  Great value.,5,2019,02,19

Close to nightclubs but hotel completely sound proof. 

Nice view from our room which was at the back with views over the park.",5,2019,02,16
221,Great hotel and location,"I stayed here for 2 nights for work.  Beautiful decor in the whole hotel and really stylish, comfortable lobby. The staff are really friendly and helpful.  Breakfast was lovely. I stayed on the fifth floor and had asked for a room at the back due to the nearby nightclubs. It was super quiet and really comfortable too. I booked a double room and the room had both a double and single bed in it. My view was into offices at the back of the hotel but I didn't mind. You could see across dublin as well so it's nice. The bathroom and hotel room itself is finished off to a high standard. The shower in the bathroom is the dream. A shower door would be better I think as the water goes out on the floor a bit but nothing too bad. The bathroom has beautiful marble countertop and lovely grey tiles. I really enjoyed my stay and would definitely return. I ordered the peri peri grilled chicken breast for room service after a long day and it was delicious. The location is great and I would highly recommend.",5,2019,02,15
221,Weekend break in Dublin,"Great location (central Dublin is 5-10 mins walk away), amazing service, top comfort, couldn't ask for more. Hotel bar and food is lovely too! Only downside, the room/quilt could get very hot at night even with the heating off.

Very comfortable rooms.
Great cooked breakfast.
Good restaurants nearby.

Close to the Luas tram network",4,2019,02,12
221,Good Location,NIce hotel in the centre of town and on the tram route. Clean moden rooms with great staff. Great breakfast that does not leave you hungry. Get a room at the back of the hotel as the Tram can be noisy and night lift is also loud.,4,2019,02,12
221,"Good hotel, but avoid City Pods","I stayed in the City Pods for the duration of my visit. The room was quaint, but was good for a solo traveler. These pods are located in the basement area of the hotel. The whole floor was quite loud starting at 6:00am every morning. I could hear all of the showers running and toilets flushing around me. One morning there was even construction going on at around 7:00am. Lastly, the room cleaning service started much earlier then most other hotels I've stayed at. I had a maid walk into my room when I was in the shower at 8:30am. I'm not usually the type of person who likes daily room service, but these rooms were so small that it was needed. The showers do not have doors, so the whole bathroom is usually soaking wet by the time you're done with the shower. 

I'm sure these City Pods would be fine for a traveler on a budget, but if you're a light sleeper or experiences jet lag, I wouldn't recommend it. 

The rest of the hotel, however, was great. The location was perfect for me. Walking distance to great bars and restaurants. 

I would stay in this hotel again, but would prefer to stay in a different room.",3,2019,02,11
221,Quick stopover ,"Lovely hotel. Friendly staff, great location and great breakfast. Only issue is parking but that’s to expected in city centre boutique hotel. Hotel is super clean and has a nice cocktail bar. Would recommend. ",4,2019,02,10
221,"Lovely, welcoming hotel in the heart of Dublin","Lovely hotel in a very convenient position. Welcoming reception situated in a warm and cosy lounge area, with lots of comfortable seating and a glowing fire.
Rooms are spacious, with king-size firm, but comfortable, beds, large bathrooms, tea and coffee making facilities, bottled water, large television, hair-dryer and sufficient storage.
The situation of this hotel is excellent. Many tourist attractions within walking distance, and the superb tram link has a stop situated very nearby. Plenty of places in this area are available for dining and drinking. However, the hotel itself offers excellent food and an extensive range of drinks is available. The breakfasts are superb! A huge range of offerings for the guest, from a great choice of fresh and dried fruit, cereals, porridge, yoghurt, honey, juices, and the full works for lovers of cooked breakfasts.
I can really find nothing to fault this hotel on except, maybe, the price. We did feel the cost of a long weekend stay was excessive, albeit very enjoyable!",4,2019,02,07
221,Rugby Weekend,Very busy weekend in Dublin and Iveagh was full but it never felt too hectic. I had a room on the second floor away from the front of Harcourt Street which was a relief when i saw the crowds waiting to get into the clubs across the street.Once in the Iveagh it was an oasis of clam although i wouldn't have fancied being on the front ......although some of my colleagues did have rooms on the front and didn't seem too bothered. Must have been the Guinness !! So a couple of room grumbles 1) the fan in the bathroom why so noisy and i could turn it off it just keeps going 2) the tea and coffee making .... for the cost of the rooms the refreshments are poor and the lead on the kettle doesnt reach the sockets !! other the putting the whole tray on the floor or balancing on the side of the bedside table.....its just attention to detail 3) the air - con : could i get to the right temperature... No.  4) tv just kept saying No Signal which does sort itself out but again its just attention to detail and if you want to be The Best these sort of things need to not exists. ........ Overall the bedrooms are comfortable and everything you need is there for a couple of nights stay. The public areas are very nice and although breakfast was busy it was well managed and food refreshed constantly. All in all a good experience and i would stay again.,4,2019,02,07
221,Short and sweet,"The hotel is very well located and has been decorated tastefully.  So far we have been lucky on both occasions to secure a room at the back of the hotel, away from any loud night clubs to the front.  Slept very well and the bed is comfortable.  Nice little touches in the room here and there.  Only downside was that we were offered by email an upgrade for €50 but on arrival, this wasn't noted on our booking and the receptionist didn't understand, so we weren't able to avail of the offer which was a shame.  Will be back however. ",5,2019,02,07

221,New and very pretty with a couple tiny problems,"We had initially chosen the Iveagh Garden because of the location- It's an easy walk to Grafton St and other points of interest. And It is beautifu- the pictures are spot on!  However we did encounter a few, I believe fixable, problems over our stay.

Positive Stuff First:
This hotel is brand new (when we stayed it wasn't a year old yet) so everything is new and well thought out. It is picture perfect. The beds are comfortable and the pillows are plentiful. I fell in love with the shower- Rain showers are inventions from above                 (especially when you have hot water and good  pressure) 
The staff in the restaurant/bar is very nice and each one hustles to make you comfortable. The last morning we were there the chef didn't show up and there was no hot food for the Breakfast buffet, the staff was working so hard to make the best of an awful situation. 

Bad Stuff/Good Stuff
The front desk is a bit of a mess- friendly but kinda disorganized. A member of our party accidentally left her credit card at the front desk at check out and no one ever contacted her. Once we landed in the States she called them and they said yes they had it. (Let me say again no one contacted us) However I have to give a specific shout out to Niall (I believe one of the Managers) He kept it locked up and shredded it, after putting our fears to rest and hearing our frustrations out. It meant a lot.

Not so Positive stuff:
No refrigerator in the room (unless you request it) I travel a lot and was kinda shocked to see that at this price point they were not provided. When we checked in they were out of them so we were out of luck- the front desk offered to store the snacks for our tour the next morning (but then informed us they wouldn't store anything with meat) The solution..I requested 2 trashcans full of ice to keep sandwiches cold till the next day. 
The weird wiring in the rooms. I think in an effort to conserve energy they have wired the room so that it is difficult/impossible to charge your tech and turn the lights fully off. The closest I got was my bathroom light had to remain on in order for my bedside plugs to work. Everyone in my party ran into the same issue. 
Noisy parties...Several of the reviews mention staying in rooms above the party space and how loud it gets. Sadly that's true. One person in my party was kept awake till 4am with first a private party and then with the clean-up after. Not cool. Either sound proof the rooms better or don't rent out the rooms when your book parties.

The Iveagh Garden is a beautiful hotel with spacious, comfortable rooms and nice people. I feel like right now they are a young hotel and in a year or so I would like to stay there again-when they get the kinks worked out. A hotel this beautiful deserves to do well.",4,2019,01,30
221,Grt weekend in Dublin,"Top class Hotel in a grt part of Dublin, excellent staff and comfort  rooms very spacious and hotel was spotless  we had dinner in hotel restaurant on first night and was excellent, I would highly recommend this hotel we travelled from Tipperary on train and got luas then to hotel hassle free no driving or parking ",5,2019,01,30

221,All show and no substance and not eco friendly at all,A very clean and fancy hotel but incredibly expensive and didn’t include breakfast which was massively disappointing really. I can’t see how it’s eco friendly at all either. Plastic bottles of shampoo etc imported from China and straws in the bar... ?!?!

Bar has been nicely designed and all the staff I dealt with were polite and well informed. I expect to be in Dublin regularly this year and will definitely use this hotel again. ",4,2019,01,25
221,Average,"I stayed in the Iveagh Hotel Dublin for one night. The hotel itself is ideally located in the centre of Dublin, in close proximity to numerous restaurants and pubs. Close walk to St.Stephens Green, Grafton Street, so perfect for sight seeing and shopping. The hotel itself is well laid-out, the rooms are spacious and decorated to a high standard. However, while the location and decor of the hotel was almost perfect, the staff were not. They were extremely rude to basic queries, and it soured the experience for us. This was not one specific incident with the staff, the staff were also rude to the guests I was staying with, and we only stayed for one night. The negative interaction with the staff really tinged our experience, which was very disappointing.",2,2019,01,24
221,Look forward to our return!,"This is a a lovely hotel in a great location, our room was well decorated and very comfortable, we were at the back of the hotel and despite the possibility of a lot of noise from the clubs outside the noise level was very low. Very reasonable compared to similar hotels in the immediate vicinity! ",5,2019,01,23
221,Weekend in Dublin,The Iveagh Garden is a beautiful  hotel with very friendly and helpful staff. The location is also very good. Super room size and very comfortable beds. Excellent breakfast. Really helpful concierge and porter.,5,2019,01,23
221,Unbeatable,"If you want a really nice hotel in a great location, with fantastic service that’s dishes up probably the best food I’ve ever had in Dublin then this is the place for you.  As the title says “unbeatable”.",5,2019,01,23
221,Wonderful hotel with perfect location and perfect quality of sleep !,"We had a super stay in this hotel with our friends.the hotel is walking distance from the citycenter.The quality of the services are 5 stars ! the breakfast, the quality and size of the rooms are great !Cherry on the cake, the design is worldclass !",5,2019,01,23
221,Good Stay,"Overall experience very good but would not recommend to stay in front of hotel as the noise from the party goers on the street is way too loud to sleep, staff excellent and accommodation excellent. Would come back again but request room at back of hotel",4,2019,01,23
221,Ivesgh stay,"Stunning hotel right in the heart of Dublin. Everything you need to enjoy your stay in the capital city. Rooms are lovely, staff are attentive and helpful, bar and food I had no complaints. The location is perfect and the price is very reaso",5,2019,01,22
221,City Pod ...Sufficient...,Got a very good deal on a city pod for one night only as we were really shopping all day and just needed a bed for the night as we were off again the following day.all we needed was really a bed after a full day.Had food in the city and drinks and desert menu in in the hotel lobby...a double bed shower wash hand basin and toilet in the pod it was it was ideal for our shop & go trip...,5,2019,01,21
221,Nice style,Love the style of this hotel. Location is great. Staff is very accommodating. Rooms are comfortable. Breakfast is good. I would definitely choose this hotel again. I am going there again in May 2019 :),5,2019,01,20
221,Great hotel in Dublin party central,"The location is great: close to St Stephen‘s Green in Harcourt Street, across from popular night clubs, the Dublin tram Luas passing by. If you’re planning a party weekend this is the place for you. Equally great for families, just ask for rooms away from the Main Street, and you will enjoy the spacious rooms and a good night’s sleep. Very spacious hotel bar which offers all the refreshments you can think of. Nice staff. Price overall reasonable considering the location.",5,2019,01,19
221,Fresh and modern,"Nice clean hotel. Stayed 1 night in a city pod. They are small but fine for 1 person or a couple that just want a place to sleep rather than spend time.

Location is good. Just 5 minutes walk to Stephens green and grafton street.",4,2019,01,15
221,EXCELLENT BOUTIQUE HOTEL.,"Six of us stayed here on January 13th to attend GREAT GATSBY SHOW and it was fantastic.Location was great and very pleasant staff.Room/breakfast was also great.The staff at breakfast was very nice and helpful,room had lovely comfortable beds  and pillows also very clean as was bath room.We stayed in room 2017/2018 and it was quiet. The location was great as we all went shopping next day.this Hotel to me should be 5 star hotel and we all cant wait to go back. Pretty designed Hotel.",5,2019,01,15
221,January lift!,"My friend Aileen generously gifted me a 2 night stay here for my 60th bday. We stayed from Jan 8th to 11th with a major reason being the Les Mis show at the gasboard theatre. This hotel is so beautiful! A little Art Deco oasis of luxury that makes you feel special. The staff on the whole were very nice. The reception staff were a bit crusty and self-important though! Lighten up chaps, you're there to make people feel welcome! The staff in the bistro were lovely and friendly. There was a young girl greeting on the evening of the 9th and she was gorgeous and very kind. The food was exemplarary and worth the wait. Bar staff were great. On the last day, we were aquainted with Sean Kelly, a delight of a man who could no doubt teach the male, hotel reception staff a lesson or two in gentle charm and admirable skill in putting people at ease. What a shame the senoir male satff on duty on the 8th to 10th on reception were so self-absorbed! There was a grand Irish guy with a beard on duty on the evening of the 9th who heloed log me in to print off my boarding pass; he too was vety kind, warm and helpful. This morning, we attended for breakfast, there was a really lovely and kind guy who greeted us. He was originally from Minnesota, US. Such a warm and genuine man. Overall, i would recomnend this gorgeous hotel to anyone looking for luxury with a mostly, friendly greeting

221,Great if you can sleep past the NOISE,"We reserved a room for 8 nights during the Christmas season. I called ahead to ask for a quiet room and was told that they would do their best. We were given a room in the back which overlooks the patio area off their restaurant and also some garbage trucks beyond the patio. The view was of no concern to us. We didn't plan to spend any daylight hours in our room so it didn't matter. However, the nighttime noise, starting at 9PM, was atrocious!! One night the noise went on until after 2am. It was coming from beneath our room window. Apparently party goers, in the hotel (I think there is a basement function room), go there to smoke and were extremely loud. My husband called the front desk and was told it was street noise.....NO!!! It was not street noise. It was hotel noise. Actually, it seems, and we were told by other people who we met, that Harcourt St is a party street with lots of clubs and restaurants. Even with all the noise and lost sleep, I feel that I have to give it 4 stars because it is a very lovely hotel and the room was clean, the bed and pillows were very comfortable and the rain shower in the bathroom was a treat. The bedside tables were fitted with power stations for our devices, which was a really nice amenity. The waitstaff, bar/dining staff and housekeeping staff were all very helpful, friendly and professional. The front desk was helpful and courteous depending on who was there. Almost everyone went out of their way to be helpful and it was greatly appreciated. We had breakfast a few mornings in the hotel and it was perfect. We ordered off the menu and it was very reasonably priced. The Iveagh Hotel is perfectly located for easy walks to Camden St, St Stephens Green, Grafton St and even O'Connell and Temple Bar are close enough to walk. I would have easily given this hotel 5 stars if it wasn't for the dreaded noise that kept us awake almost every night of the 7 nights we were there. I would never stay there again solely because of the noise, no other reason.",4,2019,01,05
221,Lovely hotel with great food,"We recently stayed here for a evening out in Dublin before seeing family. The room was a good size for cost and was cleaned to a high standard. The room was at the back of the hotel and annoying there were a lot of loud noises. We live in London so are used to loud noises, but this was the noises of lorries reversing and people tipping bins away. I would suggest asking to be at the front of the hotel, the road wasn’t that busy out the front. 

The staff were all lovely and very accommodating. 

The food in the hotel was great, we had the duck salad for lunch which was amazing! Would definitely recommend having.  

All in all, very good hotel and would stay again! ",4,2019,01,03
221,My Christmas gift from my wee brother Brendan,"My wee brother Brendan supersized me with a over night stay in the Iveagh Garden hotel 

with breakfast also .
I had a fabulous time from the warm grating  from the  concierge at the door to the hotel manger who booked us in to our room .
The room I stayed in was 4118 it was spotless cleaned , every thing you would need for your stay like safe iron with ironing board tea&coffee also hairdryer .
  The beds were very comfortable .
As for the bathroom it was spotless and the towels were soft and white could ask for anything better.
 Only few things I would change would be if there are 2 people staying in a room I would like to see 2 of the bathroom condoms (shampoo and con and soap) 
Also I would like if there was more coffee when I stayed we only had 2 packs .
there the only things i would change 
Breakfast - was really  great it had everything you might like to eat in the morning and as a vegetarian the had a great variety to enjoy.
The staff were warm and friendly and very helpful .
This is the place to stay if you are vising Dublin it center to everything a great place to stay in .",5,2019,01,03
221,Brilliant stay!,"Just after spending two lovely nights in the Iveagh Garden hotel. They went over and beyond in terms of service, amenities and the suites were exceptional. Ideally situated bedside St Stephen’s Green and Grafton Street.
Would really recommend this hotel to anyone looking a relaxing and comfortable trip. 
Many thanks and look forward to returning!

221,Well appointed hotel in fantastic location,"This hotel is modern and decorated with tasteful elegant beautiful charm. 
Rooms are large and well appointed.

Great location close to Grafton Street and plenty of nightlife. Stayed in room opposite the night clubs and very little noise heard which is great for a central city location. 

Elle Bar and Bistro is the perfect way to start and end a day. 

Everyone from the reception, chamber maids to bar staff are friendly and helpful.

The cocktails were some of the best We have sampled. Brandon was extremely helpful with choices of cocktails and very knowledgeable. Great customer service and manners displayed from a lovely young gentleman 🥂 all the evening bar staff were attentive and only complaint is the lunch time was less attentive and spent more time chatting and laughing together. 

Food in the bistro was excellent and please don’t let the word bistro fool you it was high quality restaurant cuisine. 

Safety and security at the hotel is great with lovely night door staff on hand and you cannot access the hotel after hours unless you have a card and you are a resident.

 We cannot wait to return.",5,2018,12,30
221,Fab afternoon tea,"We visited this hotel for the first time last weekend. We enjoyed a gorgeous afternoon tea in fabulous surroundings. The food was delicious, service was great & decor beautiful! Will be back for sure! ",5,2018,12,27
221,Nice hotel in the middle of Dublin,"We stayed at this hotel in April 2018 (I'm a little behind on my reviews). We were on a week long trip driving across Ireland. 

The hotel is in a very convenient location with lots of restaurants nearby. 

The rooms were clean and well appointed, just a bit on the small side.

The employees at the front desk were helpful and polite.

There is a restaurant on site, and we did eat breakfast there, which was fine.

Overall, we would stay there again when in Dublin. It was much nicer than any of the chain hotels,",4,2018,12,26
221,Great property in great location,"This is a wonderful hotel. Very good location - just 2 block from central Dublin and all the main sites (and the train line).  The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. Try for a room in the back to be a bit quieter. We were one the first floor in the back and it was very quiet. Breakfast buffet available and an onsite restaurant (expensive, but tasty). The bar is fully stocked and open until 11ish. Good value for the money.",5,2018,12,26
221,Perfect,"I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights just before Christmas. Exceptional location with spacious, spotlessly clean and extremely comfortable rooms. Everything was flawless from beginning to end. It felt safe, calm and cosy and I loved the fact that it was so eco-friendly. I have worked in the luxury hotel business for over 20 years and I was particularly impressed with the genuine friendliness and high levels of service from every member of staff. They were all outstanding and I will most definitely be back.",5,2018,12,26
221,Very nice hotel,"We really enjoyed our stay... the food is a little bit expensive but well worth it, 
The staff were so friendly and welcoming especially the waitress that was serving us,

Would recommend this hotel its worth the visit",4,2018,12,22
221,Great Hotel,"Just a short visit to Dublin, this Hotel ticks a lot of boxes,  it is in a good loctaion, it is decorated beautifully, the rooms are comfortable and well appointed. The reception staff were very friendly and welcoming, nothing was too much trouble for them. If I'm in Dublin again this is where I will be staying.",5,2018,12,21
221,Just a Gem in the heart of Dublin,"We stayed 2 nights in October, well located within walking distance to all the great popular attractions in the heart of the city.  The staff was very courteous and room was perfect.  The restaurant was very good as well.  The only downside is the parking is a bit inconvenient a block away.  Would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,12,21
221,"""Praise the bridge as you pass it""","I had a two hour window this morning to get the dreaded Christmas shopping done. Just as I arrived in town, I noticed I had left the lock of my bike in Terenure. I thought I was going to have to turn around until I passed your hotel. Telling my story to Daniella(spelling wrong, I'm sure) , he could not have been more helpful and took the bike to the basement while I nipped on. In fact everyone was so courteous and friendly ,a rare enough quality in todays climate especially as I imagine  some long shifts over the last week. Ps.James  enjoy your well deserved holiday in the Alps.
The hotel reception was really well decorated and the athmosphe was just lovely...I will be back !",5,2018,12,20
221,Dublin,Great hotel staff very helpful and room are comfortable and well kept. Location is perfect for getting around the city . Breakfast is good and plenty of choice and it’s not on a noisy road and if you get airport bus it a 5 mins walk from stop to hotel,5,2018,12,17
221,Christmas Afternoon Tea,"My Self and my friend went out for our Christmas afternoon / night out and we decided to start with afternoon tea in the Iveagh Garden Hotel. When we arrived it was a very warm welcoming place and was  beautiful Christmas decorated. There was a mix up with the booking but i have to say the Staff was so helpful and looked after us brilliant. When we did have our Afternoon Tea the food was fab and delightful and the Tea & Cakes was the best to die for x Great Value for money, keep up the great work and i will deffo be back again xxx",5,2018,12,17
221,Little Oasis in the perfect location,Stayed for one night to attend a concert. service was excellent - friendly and prompt! luxurious little hotel. Very happy with my room and I also slept well.

Thank you iveaghgarden hotel!!,4,2018,12,17
221,40th Anniversary trip to Ireland,"We were given a 40th anniversary trip to Ireland by our children and part of that was a room at the Iveagh Garden Hotel.   It is a relative new hotel in Dublin with close access to down town and the shopping district.  It is within walking distance of Trinity College and a several other great sites.  The restaurant is first class with great service and food and a true Irish Breakfast Buffet each morning.  The staff is great, the concierge service is second to none and the rooms are very modern and roomy.   Over all, it is a wonderful place to stay and enjoy all the things Dublin has to offer.  ",5,2018,12,11
221,Christmas Shopping,"This Hotel was excellent. Lovely new Hotel. Staff friendly and helpful. Rooms very comfy. Bar had great cocktails. Breakfast great. Very near Grafton street for shopping. All in all great value for money. 
Will define return.",5,2018,12,02
221,Yes it’s on Nightclub Street but it’s a lovely hotel,"As my title says! It’s a beautiful hotel situated in a very central location. Only a few minutes walk from Grafton St and surrounding areas for lots of independent bars and restaurants. 

Yes the street can be noisy at night. We stayed for two nights; Friday night was a noisier night than Saturday. We had a twin room (107) on the ground floor which was spotless and fab rain shower. 

As long as you can get over it’s very close proximity to 3/4 busy nightclubs you’ll be fine. 
",5,2018,11,25
221,Warm welcome - great location,"We chose this hotel based on Tripadvisor reviews and its location. Reviews helpful and location great for walking around Dublin (our preferred mode of tourist transport in cities).
Hotel was welcoming and comfortable. Good breakfast with local produce. Apart from St Stephens Green don't forget to walk around Iveagh Garden itself - a secluded spot to recharge.",5,2018,11,24
221,Really good hotel,"Had one of their city pods- it was very comfortable, quiet room although a little small. Little bit strange shower, but at the end it was ok. Wonderful breakfast (and  very attentive and nice waitress Agnes).",4,2018,11,21
221,"Wonderful hotel, would recommend","We are Dublin veterans since we go every year and this is the best hotel for decent price we've ever had. Location wise it's great for every type of visitor. It's close to the city centre and tram and busstops are very close. For the younger visitors the hotel is very close to several night clubs within 200 meters. Beds are very good and the rainshower is amazing. Staff is international and very helpful.

Tip: amazing breakfast across the street at Sophie's on the top floor of the Dean hotel.",5,2018,11,21
221,City pods!,"I booked this on last minute.com and obviously didn’t read what I was actually booking. Just assumed it was a hotel room. It was a City Pod. It’s lovely! If you are alone, it’s ideal. Plenty of room for one. The only things I would say are... 1) Don’t get changed till you have slid the wooden window covering across, as I did, only to look out and see that there’s a street right outside! It’s not a busy street but still. 2) I hope that they change the leafy window covering on the shower area. Whilst pretty, if there are 2 of you, whilst in bed if you look at the mirror, you would see your partner sitting on the toilet! Not exactly private. They just need to change it to something frosted that’s all.
Apart from that, really cosy and would definitely stay in one again. Big plus, massive tv!!
Ps the carpark is around a 5 min walk but totally worth it 👍🏼",5,2018,11,20
221,Beautiful new Hotel in Dublin,"We stayed at The Iveagh Garden Hotel last month for a week and would give it a very high recommendation.  This is a new hotel in Dublin and has made a lasting impression on us. We did have a Deluxe Double room in the back of the hotel overlooking the Iveagh Garden. Everything is very new and very clean, it also seems that staff is working to maintain the hotel constantly. Great location near(short walk) Grafton street shopping. The Restaurant and Bar are great as well.",5,2018,11,20
221,"Lovey Hotel, great location, great service","I am impressed with this lovely, understated boutique hotel. Really enjoyed the room and the common areas. The warm fire greeting you at reception is a welcome sight on a cold, blustery Dublin evening.",5,2018,11,19
221,Fantastic hotel and very helpful staff,"Had an amazing night in Dublin, this hotel is ideally situated for shopping and late bars jyst across the road if you like the night life   the hotel staff are very friendly and helpful.  Michael in bar looked after us into the early hours.",5,2018,11,17

221,Two nights Stay,"Couldn't fault this hotel. 
Room was lovely. Very comfortable with everything we needed. 
Hotel common areas are very well maintained. Service was attentive, quick, and friendly.

The hotel is ideally located and was reasonably priced.",4,2018,11,15
221,Fab Luxurious Modern Hotel Perfectly Placed!,"Stayed overnight in the new Iveagh Garden Hotel while attending a concert at the 3Arena.  The Hotel is just FAB!  So modern, fresh and stylish.  Friendly staff, fabulous big spacious bedroom.  The bar was buzzing and so fabulously decorated.  Lovely place for a cocktail or glass of bubbles to start or end your night! We had toasties at the bar after the concert! The location of the Luas which now crosses the city is right outside and couldn't be more handy, we go to the 3Arena with ease!  Leave the car at home for sure! Will definitely stay again.  Cant recommend enough.  Looking forward to my next visit already.",5,2018,11,13
221,Fabulous ,We had a lovely stay here. I did think of booking one of the City Pods but on closer inspection they seemed very small! We stayed in a deluxe room. It was very comfortable and spacious. Breakfast was lovely. The location is fabulous. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. We will be back!,5,2018,11,12

221,Good location ,"Located next to St. Stephens Green and close to the city center. Superior room was very nice. Bring earplugs, if you are sensitive to noise because of the night club across the street. Even without earplugs it was ok, with windows closed. 
Good breakfast and friendly staff! ",5,2018,11,10
221,4**** hotel with a 2** feeling,"Stayed here for 3 nights but I can honestly say that i've slept horribly  on all 3. Excellent bed and pillows, spacious and clean, but the most important part - quiteness - is definitely something not present. The windows have an horrible acoustic isolation, which basically means that having the windows open or closed is practically the same thing. Considering the daily rate of the room, this is something that management should seriously take into consideration.",3,2018,11,09
221,ONE OF THE NICEST PLACES IVE STAYED IN DUBLIN!!,"I dont often tend to stay in hotels but i was over the moon with the service, hotel room and food from this hotel. Its in a PERFECT location in dublin, not right the in the centre but so close to walk to what you need to. I loved my stay here and would HIGHLY recommend anyone to stay. The place was perfect.",5,2018,11,08
221,Nice modern hotel misses little things,"Stayed here for two nights and the first impressions are favourable. The place looks new, modern and smart. The rooms are small, but as expected for a city centre hotel. Very happy with the location and the sleep was very comfortable.

Just a couple of items that did not quite hit the spot, well below par for a hotel of this type/style. 

The in room TV uses an IPTV system. The use of which does not function correctly or easily, and the selection of available channels is very poor, some that should be there just do not work. For international travellers there is nothing. In all city centre hotels I have stayed in there is usually French, German, Spanish etc. language channels.

There is no mini bar fridge. The hotel do offer complementary bottles of water left on the table, but nowhere to keep them chilled. This is the first above 3 star hotel I have stayed in that does not have this facility, and I found this quite an inconvenience.

The light switches on each side of the bed were unfathomable. Some did not work at all, some seemed to have different functions depending on how you used them. In short I could not seem to have all the lights in the room turned off at night unless I took the keycard out of the main switch.

The location is good, but there is nothing around to get any food or drink. I arrived back to the hotel late, the limited room service had finished (the in room service menu states for me to view the out of hours room service menu, which is not actually kept in the rooms, strange) the bar has no snacks for purchase.

These are only small issues and did not make my stay unpleasant, it just could have been better. I was going to mention the little points on check out, when I was asked about my stay, but I was never asked by the duty manager how my stay was.",3,2018,11,06
221,Excellent stay,"I booked this hotel as a get away for my partners 30th birthday. I emailed ahead and asked for a quieter room given that we were travelling  for a special occasion. We were given a lovely room at the back of the building and couldn't hear any external noise apart from the event which took place at the hotel on the Saturday night. Once we checked into our room, one of the staff delivered a plate with fruit and chocolate on saying ""happy birthday"" which I thought was a nice touch. The facilities and decoration in the hotel are beautiful and our room was extremely clean. We ate at the restaurant and the food was lovely and service fantastic. I would definitely recommend a stay here!",5,2018,11,06
221,A very comfortable stay in a beautiful hotel in a great location,"I was here for 2 nights on a business trip and had a fabulous stay. The hotel is only 2 minutes walk from St Stephen's Green and 10 minutes from all the shops and central attractions so a great location for getting around. 

The hotel is absolutely beautifully designed and looks brand new. Everywhere I went around the hotel, the decor was of the same standard and style which looked very smart. I actually wanted to create a similar look in my own house as it is very tasteful. 

My room was really spacious and incredibly comfortable. The room facilities were perfect for a business traveller such as having tea making things, an iron and plenty of space. There were great bathroom products and the standard of housekeeping was exceptional. 

I didn't include breakfast in my stay but I did eat in the on site restaurant for dinner which was tasty. There isn't a huge choice on the menu and it is pricey but the food and service was very good. 

All the staff were very polite and helpful. I cannot fault my stay at all and will definitely stay in the same hotel when I am back in Dublin.",5,2018,11,06
221,Service needs major upgrade,"I wanted to like this place.  It looks great.  The location is ideal.  The garden is gorgeous - but be aware it is behind a big wall and so maybe only 6 rooms in this hotel can actually see it.  Noise is a major problem here, single glazed windows with every squeal from the nearby nightclub audible at night if you have the bad luck to be on the south side.  I stayed for 5 nights and had booked months in advance for a ""garden view"" - it took 3 tries and a sleepless night before I finally got the room I booked.  The staff were friendly and ""helpful"" but uninformed and (much worse) seemed to make up answers to info they didn't know.... my conference was ""a 45 min. walk, you'll need a taxi"" (it was 12 minutes by foot).  The marathon ""wouldn't affect us as it's only north and east of here"" (the street outside the hotel was closed).  Worst of all they missed my wakeup call .... TWICE.  No alarm clock in the room and they won't lend you an adapter if you have a NA plug for your phone, so you're dependent on them.  I was late for one of my morning meetings, and that to me is an ""automatic fail"".",2,2018,11,05
221,Fantastic!,"We stayed in a triple room for the weekend and loved it. Pretty much everything you could want to do is in 15-20 minute walking distance. As we were on our taxi back to the airport the driver told us we'd been staying on the busiest party road of Dublin - we had no idea, didn't hear a thing at night! Genuinely confused about the negative comments on customer service written here.. we found the staff to be smiley, helpful and kind. Shower was huge and powerful. All round great experience!",5,2018,11,05
221,"Beautiful hotel, very poor customer service.","Lovely hotel in a very good location. Beautiful decor and a roaring fire in reception which was really nice.
On check in we asked if the restaurant was open and were informed it was closed, that was fine, it was ten o’clock at night so we asked for room service. After some deliberation we were informed we could have cheese or ham sandwiches, hardly what you would expect from a four star hotel. After a run around on where we had to order the food, a very helpful barman made the sandwiches. Thank you. The bar staff were very helpful and the chap that made the sandwiches could certainly teach the Manager and Reception staff a thing or two about hospitality.Good sized room but hollow fibre quilt which was not comfortable. The iron and hair dryer did not work. On calling reception to ask if we could have some scissors we were informed they did not have any but that the bar staff may have a knife,again tha bar staff helped. At breakfast we asked twice for the table to be set and were only offered one tea/coffee, no one came round and offered top ups despite us trying to get their attention.My daughter ordered a bottle of wine for the room but as it took so long to arrive she cancelled it, however, it still arrived and the member of staff was rude to her when she said she had cancelled it. On leaving no one said good bye asked how our stay was, nothing, just kept doing something in the back office.The hotel it’s self is really lovely but without some serious staff training (except for the bar staff, who were really helpful)people will not return. Having looked at other reviews,clients have experienced the same issue of poor customer service so I hope this is addressed.",3,2018,11,04
221,"Decadent, clean and relaxing","This was one of the nicest hotels I’ve stayed at and I’ve stayed at some phenomenal spots. The location was perfect, the bed and room were lovely. It all felt very decadent and clean. The cleanliness piece is one of the most important aspects to me. I generally bring my own cleaning supplies to hotels, and nothing was needed in my room.",5,2018,11,04
221,Wedding Party,"We had our wedding party in Downstairs@TheIveagh last night and cannot recommend the venue and the team enough! Every team member bent over backwards to make sure everything was going as we wanted and regularly checked in to see if there was anything our guests needed. 

The hotel was so accomadating from start to finish, no request seemed too much! We booked 3 rooms to stay over, they were fabulous and so comfortable. Noise wasn’t an issue, even my dad who doesn’t drink said their room was quiet and they had a great night’s sleep. 

We ordered supper bowls and platters for the night and all our guests said how delicious they were. There was so many options to choose from, we had a couple of allergies/dietary needs to cater for and this wasn’t a problem for the kitchen. Bar service was excellent.

Anyone thinking of having any event in the Iveagh do it ... such a hidden gem not to mention the function room is stunning.

Thanks to the entire team for looking after us and making our party so memorable!! We’ll be back to celebrate our anniversary next year!!",5,2018,11,04
221,Business,"Loved this place!

Decor was just gorgeous in reception!
Had drinks at the bar and then sat for beautiful dinner. 

I had crab to start and beef for mains. Food was fabulous and service was great. The staff had ran out of the wine we had chosen and went out to the shop to get some more! 

I didn’t stay overnight but from what I saw and knowing the location I would recommend this hotel! 👌

I’ll be back for sure!! ",5,2018,11,03
221,Georgian luxury in the middle of everything Dublin has to offer!,"This is my fourth trip to beautiful Dublin and we were determined to treat ourselves to some luxury. So after a bit of research we settled on the Iveagh Garden Hotel. From the front door to the bedroom, this hotel is beautiful, clean, and spacious. We had a standard room with a massive king bed, and while the bed was huge, the mattress is very firm and could benefit from the additional of a pillow top or latex topper. The pillows are a little on the flat side also. Usually there’s a selection of different pillows but all were the same level of loft (next to none). That aside, the rest of the hotel, staff, food was wonderful. Would return. ",4,2018,11,02
221,Comfortable ,Had lunch here with some friends recently. The food was nice and came out promptly and hot. The supreme of chicken appeared to have been deep fat fried but it actually tasted ok. My friends had goats cheese starter and a sharing platter. Staff continuously checked on us to see if we needed more drinks to the point that it interfered with us eating our food. We had ample drinks. Didn’t have desert. Left after eating. ,3,2018,11,01
221,Beautiful hotel in heart of Dublin. ,"The Iveagh Garden Hotel is a beautiful hotel minutes from St. Stephens Green in the heart of Dublin. The staff are great and the room was a good large size beautifully appointed. There are only two reasons why I didn’t give it five stars. The first is that parking is a 10 min walk away in a public car park. It’s not a huge deal but can add a potential 30 mins to your journey if you have lots of luggage by the time you walk to the car, navigate Dublin traffic and back to the hotel, especially if it’s freezing cold weather. The other thing would be that the hotel does not have Air Conditioning. That didn’t bother us too much as it was October. But I would personally look elsewhere if it was the height of the summer. 

But if those two things don’t bother you then I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel and at the price point it is hard to beat for the location. ",4,2018,10,30
221,A boutique stay,"This hotel is well located within walking distance of key attractions and easy tram ride to others. Comfortable rooms,a good breakfast and other meals available as required. Rooms at the front of the hotel can be a little noisy given local clubs, so request something more towards the rear and you will enjoy your stay.",4,2018,10,30
221,If i return to Dublin... I will 100% return to the Iveagh,"the hotel is absolutely gorgeous as well as very clean. 

although it said check-in wasn't until 3pm they allowed us to have our room at 11am which was very nice due to our early morning flight - this allowed us to rest and recharge out batteries for our weekend stay. the room sizes are just right and the bathroom is stunning. with a strong clean shower.

the only problem was that our bedroom situated on the groundfloor right across from where the maid kept her cleaning trolley so at times thee was a lot of banging noises.

other than that the hotel is situated in a perfect location of Dublin that meant most places where walking distance.",4,2018,10,30
221,Great location - patio room was worth the splurge,"We stayed here for a weeklong vacation in Dublin and truly enjoyed it.  It was a convenient, comfortable place to stay with a friendly staff. 
We had a huge room with a private patio overlooking Iveagh Gardens, with pleasant sound from the park's small waterfall.  The spacious patio had a couch and cocktail table that provided a gorgeous place to enjoy our morning coffee, and enjoy a glass of champagne at night.  The suite was enormous, with tons of closet space.  The big bathroom had a jetted tub.  
We opted to include breakfast, which was a big buffet spread with many Irish breakfast items as well as yogurt, pastries, juices and more.  The menu did not vary, but was substantial and tasty.   
We loved the location.  It was an easy walk to Grafton St. and to many attractions.  We usually walked through St. Stephens Green, which is a lovely way to get around.  Although we did not use it, a streetcar passes right outsides the front door.
We were pleasantly surprised to find that although two of the big nightclubs in Dublin were directly across the street, we couldn't hear a thing when the windows were closed.",5,2018,10,28
221,Poor Customer Service Makes this Gem of a Hotel Miss the Mark,"The hotel is spectacular in every way as far as design, style, rooms, location, etc.  Only drawback is the staff (exception are the doormen who were outstanding) from the front desk, to room service to housekeeping.  They had a major negative attitude and did not make you feel welcome at all.  One night we called the front desk for a luggage stand and received major attitude as if what we were asking was such an imposition.  We had a triple room for 3 adults and one luggage stand.  In a room as nice as this you don't want to put your luggage on the furniture.  No idea where they expected us to put it.  I never keep my luggage on the floor so to me that is not an option.  Not only did they not provide what we asked for but were rude and dismissive when we called back to find out the status after one hour had passed.  Never got the stand and never received the courtesy of any follow-up.  They appeared to have zero interest in providing any customer service.  Another incident is when we called room service for 2 pots of coffee and only 1 arrived. We were told the 2nd pot would be delivered right away.  After 30 minutes I called to find out what happened and was told they were busy with a meeting which is why they didn't send up the 2nd pot (even though it was room service error that we didn't receive what we ordered).   The lack of customer service is a major flaw and one that will cost them if they do not address it.  At the end of our week in Ireland we stayed at Powerscourt Estate.  I suggest that the management take key employees there to see what world class customer service looks like.  A potential five star hotel gets only 3 from me which is generous considering how rudely we were treated during our stay.",3,2018,10,22
221,Weekend Away!,"I booked this hotel given it was relatively new (not tired like some) and I wasn't disappointed. The location is great for walking to most of places. A nice stroll through St Stephens Green is nearby as are restaurants etc. The service generally was ok, nothing more than that. The room on the rear we had was clean and spacious. I could however still hear in the distance the noise from the nightclubs which are opposite the hotel. I asked for a bath in the bathroom for health reasons but this couldn't be accommodated which was disappointing. It has a lovely bar and reception area for sitting and relaxing!",3,2018,10,22
221,Nice Hotel - Pity about the parking!,"First time at the Iveagh Garden. A great location close to the night life, shopping and Stephens Green. We came by car and sadly the hotel has no parking either within the hotel or on the street. As such it was a long trek to the Q Park Multi story at 17.50 euro a day. That said the hotel does give you a 50% discount voucher. In addition you cant actually stop your car out side the hotel as it has the LEWIS tram lines and so you have to run back and forth as we did, with bags and such in the rain then a wet walk from the car park back to the hotel. The hotel itself is fresh, modern and a top class 4 star.  The staff were welcoming and helpful. For 248 euros B+B it seemed a high (ish) price BUT that's Dublin city centre prices and is by local standards, value for money. Rooms are clean and mid sized and the bathroom was a bit small but very modern and well appointed with good free wifi. Breakfast was good but not special with the usual buffet selection. Having been ""clubbing"" to 3 am the night before, it was good to have breakfast served until 11 am! Overall a good hotel with professional helpful staff, in a good location, if you are travelling by taxi and don't have a car. We would certainly stay again if but not with a car! (NB: the staff informed us that the hotel IS planning an underground hotel car park to be built soon)",4,2018,10,22
221,Disappointing,"The look of the hotel was very appealing, then we went to our room....CORRECTION....we went to our POD! (It should be noted that the receptionist apologized for our room/pod before we even saw it!) 
We booked a double room, but were given a pod, which was basically a basement janitors closet, converted to an area, to generate more income. The bed was a slab of wood with a make-shift mattress, and 3 walls surrounding it. The bathroom was an area within the pod, with 2 plexiglass walls.  Anyone in the room had full view of those showering or using the toilet. The shower was open within the plexiglass, so when it was used the entire floor and toilet were drenched. There was  one 3 ft x 2 ft unscreened window, located at street level, which allowed the street dust and car exhaust fumes into the room. 
We did attempt to switch rooms, but the manager was unable to find anything else...since we were only staying one night!
Since this was our first night in Ireland, we weren’t sure if this was a common practice.  After traveling around Ireland for a week, I can say it definitely was not the norm, nor had any other hotel even heard of a pod.
For $200 a night, to say it was disappointing is being kind!",1,2018,10,19
221,Staff need better training ,"I stayed in this hotel for business.  The decor is gorgeous and it’s obvious a lot of money had been invested in it.  
The staff need better training.  Check in was prompt but cold although I pointed out it was my first time staying.  I was directed to the lift but not told any other details ie what time breakfast was served and where.  
The room as lovely and modern but cold, for some reason the windows were open and I had to deal with a few flies before I could settle in.

Breakfast was a let down service wise.  There was no one at the door to check me in although a sign said wait to be seated.  I got the attention of a waitress and she asked me my room number and walked off. I had to follow her to ask would I seat myself.  Then I choose porridge from the beautiful buffet.  I had to ask was there honey the waitress pointed to an area where a pancake machine.  There I found a plastic bottle of honey thrown in a basket with other syrups.  Next I had to look for the waitress again for tea.  She shouted across to another waitress that I needed tea.  The cups are way too small when you don’t have a pot of tea at your table.  The staff were too busy talking to each other and the bar man to attend to clients. 

I intended telling the receptionist on check out of my issues and not detailing it here in TA but check out was again cold and I wasn’t asked how was my stay.  I asked about the procedure with the discounted car park ticket and the receptionist said she didn’t know.  I left and wasn’t even said good bye to.

Overall opinion Iveagh Garden Hotel has  lovely decor and is in a great location with huge forward potential but staff need training and managerial presence is needed throughout.  ",3,2018,10,17
221,Too much Street Noise!,"Stayed here 3 nights while in Dublin.  We had a room on the first floor (1108).  The noise from the night club across the street came through the closed windows.  Should have asked for another room on a higher floor or in the back.  But did not expect the noise to be EVERY NIGHT!
Some of the things we had asked for (extra pillows etc) - which we had put on the online reservation, weren't there and took quite awhile and numerous calls to the front desk before they arrived much later that night.  Didn't like that when we came back from breakfast at 9am, our door was closed and the cleaning lady was in there.  
    The parking was a few blocks away and you needed a special pass from the desk, however even with that hotel pass, it is still half price on the parking (36 euro/day), and it was not made clear to us when we checked in, so we wound up paying full price.      
    The breakfast was very good, coffee strong.  Overall a nice room with comfortable bed and wonderful bathroom, however if I had seen the reviews about the noise, would have stayed somewhere else. I wouldn't stay here again because of the noise.  Many more options around for the price that we paid.",4,2018,10,17
221,Quiet Oasis on Harcourt St ,"I just needed to sit down in a quiet, warm place and think for a little bit, over a nice coffee & that’s exactly what I got from the luxury foyer of the Iveagh Garden Hotel, great for a quick business meeting or an intimate natter with a friend, and just 3euro for my Americano ...not bad ....I’ll be back.",5,2018,10,17
221,City Pod Just the essentials,"I stayed overnight in a ‘city pod’ at the Iveagh Gardens. This is a small room with bed, shower & not much else. If the bed is comfortable, tv large, the Wifi free and the shower powerful, what else do you need for a night? Perhaps this would be a bit small for a longer stay, but for one night, perfectly adequate & good value in an expensive city. Good , helpful staff.",5,2018,10,16
221,"Fantastic hotel, service second to none and rooms wonderful.","We stayed at the Iveagh Garden Hotel for 2 nights between 12th-14th October 2018.  There was a group of 13 of us staying and we were all thoroughly impressed with the hotel.  From the minute we arrived until the minute we left we received nothing but first class treatment, whether that be from the reception staff to the concierge, restaurant staff and housekeeping services.

The rooms were beautifully decorated and included a hairdryer, iron & ironing board, tea/coffee facilities, plenty of coathangers, free WIFI, tv and an excellent sized bathroom with toiletries and plenty of towels.  The beds were extremely comfortable and the black out curtains ensured we had excellent sleeps.

You can hear the bars opposite until approx 1am in the morning but it is not in any way so loud that we couldn't sleep.  We were in room 4113.  The views from our room were not great as there seemed to be a dumping ground of used items beneath our room, but understand that may not have been part of the hotel and may be out of their control.

The breakfast service is fantastic, it is a buffet service and the food was outstanding.  The choice was also excellent and we used this on both days, its just a shame it is pricey and not included in the room rate.

We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again, well done Iveagh Garden team! ",5,2018,10,16
221,Need triple glazing,The decor and ambience were fabulous. The dinner was so tasty and the breakfast was good. The only downside was the disco music until 5am. A real let down given we had requested a quiet room. Triple glazing is required if you want repeat business ,3,2018,10,15
221,Excellent 4 Star Hotel worthy of 5 star,"Myself and my husband stayed at this hotel on Saturday night, it is a beautiful hotel and would highly recommend it.  The service was excellent and staff were very helpful and extremely friendly.  The hotel is new and is finished to a high standard, very nice furnishings and lighting. Looking forward to our next stay.",5,2018,10,15
221,Top hotel great services,We had an excellent stay in the stylish hotel. Close to the Luas and walkie distantie to Grafonstreet.  Quiet  surrounding.a lot of staff very friendly. Big and clean room. We Love the stay there.the breakfast was great. English and continental.,5,2018,10,13
221,Absolutely Lovely!,"This boutique was beyond expectation. Luxury feel at reasonable rates. Trendy yet traditional with a great vibe. Rooms and bathrooms were new, sparkling, and comfortable - great bedding. We loved that the windows could be left open. Our room was ready at 1100 which was completely unexpected. Karoline and Sarah in the restaurant/lounge were personable and fun. They were a bit more serious at the front desk but friendly, professional and accommodating - including helping us solve an adaptor problem. Even our housekeeper was lovely. We visited the lobby common area each nite to relax, get a bit of work done, and enjoy evening snacks  - the cheese platters were fabulous. All menu items we tried were delicious. The hotel's location was incredible - close to most anything you'd want to walk to. It was lovely cutting through St. Stephens Green each morning to start a long day of sightseeing. I'm not sure what the noise fuss is that I've read about in other reviews. There was a slight hum of music in the distance that was barely audible on Saturday evening! None of the traffic noise or blaring sirens heard in most cities! We felt very safe, because there was always other foot traffic in the evening. Sophie's rooftop bar/restaurant was directly across the street and was a great place to mix it up. I honestly could live in this hotel - that's how wonderful it is. I will surely return!",5,2018,10,11
221,Quick drink after lunch,"My friend and I popped in for a cocktail this afternoon after lunch across the road and were met with a smile by Agustin in the bar who prepared a beautiful house variation on the classic Manhatten, which went down a treat! Thank you for your excellent service, we will be back!",5,2018,10,10
221,Tasty cocktails,"Augustine was a pleasure, he really made us feel at home and welcomed into the bar! Very tasty cocktails well worth a second or third! Highly recommended a very nice spot in Dublin for a friendly staff and a nice smoking area too!",5,2018,10,10
221,"Beautiful Hotel, But Not For People Who Need to Sleep","First, the good points. It's a beautiful hotel in an absolutely fantastic location. It was a beautiful short walk to St. Stephen's Green (hop On/Hop Off Bus stops there), shopping, and even a reasonable walk to Temple Bar area and Trinity College. Sean, the concierge, was incredibly helpful and friendly, making reservations for dinner and hooking us up with tickets for the bus. Our room was big, beautiful and even had a huge balcony. My husband enjoyed the continental breakfast and my French Toast was excellent. I found the service in the restaurant to be friendly and very accommodating.These are the reasons I gave three stars.

Now for the bad parts. We asked for a quiet room away from Harcourt Street as we were warned about the clubs all along that street where you will find young club goers lining up as early as 5 pm for cheap drinks. So, we were given room 4124 which is off the back toward Iveagh Gardens itself. As I mentioned, it was beautiful, large, and had a balcony (would have been nice to have a dresser for clothes, but I digress). Bad news is that it's also right above Club D Two which played loud music until 4:30 am for 3 out of the 5 nights we stayed. There is also a small alley alcove off Harcourt Street where young adults congregate to smoke and talk loudly which reverberated through the alleyway and into our room. We finally bought ear plugs which worked relatively well the last night, but not what I want in a vacation hotel room!

We also had requested early check in because of our overnight flight from the US.  I realize that it is not guaranteed, but the people checking in at the same time were given a room at 9 am and ours wasn't ready until 2 pm. We were told that we had requested a special room which is reasonable, but still. That's quite a difference. I also think that the front desk employees could have been much friendlier and should take a lesson in customer service from Sean. 

If you are a club goer or plan to be out at the pubs late, this is a perfect hotel for you. If you plan to go to sleep earlier than 4:30 am, bring ear plugs or stay elsewhere. I should mention that we were unable to let the front desk know how we felt because when we were trying to check out, it seemed like a bus tour was trying to check in. I would welcome any comments from them, but noise seems to be a problem in many of the reviews of this hotel which is a shame.",3,2018,10,09
221,Iveach Garden Hotel,"This hotel was a great find from Tripadvisor. The hotel staff was super friendly. Rooms were clean and fresh. Comfortable lobby with helpful staff. Restaurant on site served great breakfast and dinner. Close to attractions, many in walking distance. Would highly recommend.",5,2018,10,09
221,fantastic location.,"Very upscale, comfortable bed and superior shower. DO NOT stay in the room directly above their night club..It is the one with the balcony. After 2 sleepless nights we were moved to the 4th floor. That room was great, quiet and super comfortable bed.",4,2018,10,06
221,Really a surprise,We did not know what to expect when we arrived and where taken by surprise. Had an excellent newly renovated room with garden view. Bathroom was good. Best of all was the restaurant. What an excellent chef and good service. Will definately visit  Iveagh Garden Hotel again.,5,2018,10,05
221,Beautiful and classy in the heart of city center,"I can’t even articulate how much I loved this place. I want to live here. We drove up frazzled about parking, the doorman (I wish I could remember his name, he was AMAZING) greeted us on the road, grabbed our bags and had them in the door before I could even mention that I considered divorcing my husband over the drive around Dublin trying to find the place.  He drew up a nice map to parking for my husband. Marriage saved, the ladies at reception were also wonderfully polite and welcoming. So if there was an issue with customer service when they opened, we absolutely didn’t see it. 

This is our third time to Ireland and this is 100% the most beautiful, modern, CLEAN hotel we’ve been to. It is absolutely gorgeous. The rooms and bathrooms, just beautiful. 

Now I need to address the noise situation. On Trip advisor, people have said horrible things about the noise. Is there noise? Yes. Is there noise in every hotel in the city center? I think so. There are a few popular nightclubs across the street. Our room was on the first floor facing the nightclubs. Yes we could hear it, but I even waited until our last night to see if it got worse. I slept in the big comfortable bed amazingly! I had no issues. There were NO hallway noises, or door slamming noises, so I have to believe the hotel has done what they could to mitigate the problem. If you’re sensitive, bring earplugs! Turn on the tv! You don’t want to miss out on this place!

If the hotel reads this, thank you so much! Mitya in the restaurant was also such a great server, funny and so efficient! He’s a credit to you. Also, maybe a small white noise machine in the rooms for those light sleepers?",5,2018,10,05
221,Amazing hotel in the middle of Dublin,"We extended our layover in Dublin a bit to experience the city.  We chose Iveagh Garden for its central location and we were not disappointed.

Room was clean and brand new, with comfortable beds and generous bathroom.  Double paning on the windows meant we didn't hear the bars across the street, though we did hear the tram (which wasn't bad at all, but we live in a city so we are used to city sounds).

Staff was excellent and we really enjoyed our stay here.  We'll be back!",5,2018,10,04
221," Brand new cosy boutique hotel","We stayed here for a weekend on a business trip with a marketing delegation from Amsterdam. This boutique hotel is brand new (opened a few months ago) and has a sustainable concept. Nice and spaceous rooms with a large rain shower. Coffee and Tea machine, hairdryer, iron, bottels of water and a personal safe. Nice and convenient large bar downstairs. Really worth a visit at reasonable price quality ratio. Situated in the city centre. Worth a visit.",4,2018,10,04
221,Not the best experience ,"I will start with the positive by saying the rooms in this hotel are very nice and clean. The only thing was being there in August it was very hot in the rooms and there was no air conditioning but I do realize that most hotels don’t have AC given it’s usually not so hot for long in Dublin. The real issue I had with this place was the fact that I came with my cousin to Dublin to visit and we booked 2 separate rooms on 2 separate cards and stated when we arrived AND checked out we wanted to pay for our rooms separately. Despite that the hotel still charged my cousin for both rooms without her permission. We called hotel management after we left who did issue her a refund and then I gave them my credit card info AGAIN over phone to pay for my room. I just asked for a receipt to be emailed and to this day they just won’t send me one. While I understand mistakes happen, to me this one was a big one (charging someone’s room to another person card without their permission) and nothing was done to rectify the situation by management. And the last request I had to have a receipt of my proof of payment emailed to me couldn’t even be executed by them. I was very disappointed in the way it was handled and felt we paid good money to stay there and as customers should have been treated better. I hope this doesn’t happen again to another guest. ",2,2018,10,04
221,Well worth a visit!,"Beautiful hotel in an ideal location! 
Stayed one night with my sister in September.
Very reasonable. Continental breakfast one of the best I've had! 
If you're concerned about noise (across the road from Coppers nightclub) don't be, we both slept soundly. Hardly heard a thing!
Look forward to staying again",5,2018,10,03
221,Great hotel,"Fabulous rooms, very spacious and stylish and the bed is so comfortable.  Bathroom is beautiful and finished to a high standard with rainfall shower.  Strange seat for the desk, seems more a stool for a dressing table than a desk.    Everyone one of the staff was nice, friendly and helpful, but some of them lack direction and need further training.  At breakfast i was asked my room number and left to find a table myself.  Dinner menu seemed a little restricted and not somewhere that you could eat every day. However my steak was very nice.

 I would have given 5* but the service drop the hotel score, along with the menu.

However I would stay again.",4,2018,10,03
221,GREAT MANAGER BUT LET DOWN BY VERY DISAPPOINTING STAFF & SERVICE,"1. Decor v. nice/Stylish - cannot fault
2. Staff service @ breakfast v. poor/lots of bodies but very poor attention to detail and disinterested service 3. Breakfast was standard - no fault there. Not special but same as anyJurys Inn etc. 4. NOISE/NIGHTCLUBS - First night 3.00am.. it eventually stopped.
5. MANAGER VERY HELPFUL - moved us second night but beside airconditioning Unit on roof - so a bit better .. but overall sadly could not recommend.",2,2018,10,01
221,We were looked after royally,"After a few hiccups with our reservation,  the Duty Manager Ben and  receptionist Roxanne could not have been kinder to us.   Everyone at the hotel was so friendly from the young woman taking your name in the restaurant to the servers.  Our room was excellent as is the location of the hotel.  We have booked for additional nights on our return from our tour.   Some of  our small group talked about noises from nearby night  clubs but in our rear room, we were not affected.  ",5,2018,09,29
221,"New,modern & stylish","This hotel is brand new and pristine ,it certainly has a certain charm the minute you enter it's doors. They can come across slightly blasé at the reception but they are nice and attentive. A casual reception can add an offbeat quality to a hotel ,which I gather from some reviews is one of the main gripes but hey I'm glad they aren't phoney or conceited. Everything went well at this hotel ,restaurant staff are friendly ,room was immaculate ,definitely a welcome new addition to Dublin hotel industry",5,2018,09,29
221,Really disappointed ,"I found the service very poor, room was nice but unacceptable noise from both the plumbing and the partygoers from the adjacent niteclub all night long.

Had dinner in the restaurant and had to witness the Chef argue with the waiting staff using some very choice language while he wiped the plates with the filthiest cloth I have ever seen..... oh and seemed to forget my main course.

I don’t like leaving reviews on public platforms but I emailed the hotel three days ago but got no response.

On checkout nobody asked anybody how was their stay, didn’t want the answers I’d say!

Too expensive for what you get.

221,Mixed Review,"I have just checked out after a three night stay, 

The Good:
The location is fantastic, so close to Stephens Green and Grafton Street and everything is in walking distance.
The hotel and rooms are lovely, great showers and comfy beds.
Breakfast was included in my room rate and there was a good selection.

The Bad
The staff aren’t great. They seem uninterested at best. I’m not sure why this is, it’s not hard to greet people and say a friendly hi.

The Ugly
The noise! I’m glad I was on a business trip and didn’t take my husband with me, he would have been very grumpy (he needs his sleep!). I wasn’t even facing the nightclubs yet it was like I was in there with them. Literally if you want any sleep don’t stay here.

Unfortunately because of the noise I just couldn’t recommend this hotel. If you plan to party all night then it’s probably a good option. Such a shame as there are a lot of good points.",2,2018,09,24
221,No sleep,"What is the most important thing in a hotel? Well, for me it is getting my sleep during the night hours. This was not possible in this hotel. In front of it, there was a ""pub crawl"" in place that lasted until 4 am (and the police had to come and stop it). Unfortunatley there are two night clubs around the corner and my room was directed in the back yard of one of those clubs, people chatting, drinking and laughing all night (until the police came). Talking to the receptionist in the morning about the situation, he looked into a different direction when adressing that problem politely and asking for a solution he said ""I am afraid, we are fully booked"". The 2nd night was a bit quieter, but still a lot of noise, this time some backyard action started at 6 am in the morning and was probably caused by the hotel itself. 

The bathroom has a big shower, the bed is comfortable, the concierge and breakfast crew were friendly, but I would definitely do not come back.",2,2018,09,24
221,Centrally Located In Dublin,"The best I can tell you about this hotel is that is is centrally located in Dublin.  When you first walk in the hotel seems charming but that's where the charm ends.
If you're looking for a good night sleep this is not the place to come.  There is a bar/dance place behind the hotel that is open until 4:00 am.  The noise is unbelievable even with double windows and a fan to reduce the noise.  The beds are hard and very uncomfortable.  There is a parking lot down by St. Stephen's Green but it is a nightmare to get to.  And there is no street parking making it very difficult to drop off your luggage.  
Sean, the concierge, is the best this hotel has to offer.  He is fun and was most helpful during our stay.",3,2018,09,23
221,"Overpriced, overrated and underwhelmed","Upon arrival we found there is no place to unload luggage, no valet parking and we had to park ten minutes away!  The young woman checking us in was unfriendly and although both couples had requested king sized beds, we were told we had smaller kings which translated to queens. Our rooms were about the size of a monk’s cell with no room to move and zero ventilation. There was barely room to walk around the bed.  We asked the desk clerk for a dinner recommendation and she sent us to a terrible restaurant...we figured she must have friends working there. Facade and lobby are lovely, but this pricey hotel disappoints.",2,2018,09,23
221,A Stay in Dublin,"This is a nice, new, and modern hotel in a great location.  Rooms are terrific and we would stay here again.  Breakfasts are very nice.  However, a few issues...  there should be a concierge available from 9 to 6 everyday; doorman and baggage help could be better; desk staff is efficient, but not warm.",4,2018,09,23
221,Style Over Substance...,"It's not often that I battle with myself about a review... I so wanted to love this place... BUT!!!

A quiet Sunday pm check in... dropped off, lovely street, nice looking hotel... in I go!!!

It's all very designer... dark grey, mustard, teal... very of the moment... I like it... reception desk... here I go!!!

Tum Te Tum.... La La La... Tum Te Tum some more.... 3 members of staff... all very busy talking amongst themselves... oops, my fault... I must be wearing my cloak of invisibility!!!

How they managed it I don't know... but they did... I waited an uncomfortably long time time until I asked the question "" Is there another reception desk?"".... so check in I can!!!

No one to help with the bags... but the lift is nearby, again stylish.... to my top floor room... turn the corner... to find a floor to ceiling pile of boxes next to my door... no, not gifts... Just hotel boxes... cardboard everywhere!!! REALLY?!?!?

The room was nice enough... bathroom great.... I ""did"" Dublin then returned for dinner with friends... this is where the style over substance really shows!

To the chefs credit the food was fabulous... my Duck beyond beautiful... but our lasting memory was the awful service!!!

Our waitress took the food order 3 times... every time coming back to check... get it wrong.. and go off again.... maybe a note book!?!?!

So food ordered.... and that was it.... trying to attract attention to order wine... eventually we managed...

The starters arrived.... no wine

It came as we were all eating....

One of us finished and POUNCE.... the waitress stretched over to remove the plate... whilst the rest of us ate.... I was next to finish and POUNCE... there goes the plate!!

To cut a very long evening short this plate removal happened with every course... at the end we could not attract attention to get any desserts... nor coffee... it took for ever.

Meal great... service shocking!!!

The breakfast service was as bad as dinner... people constantly moving plates on your table... putting cups down... cups away.. all just very annoying.

I slept well... but for me I cam away annoyed with everything... that's 3 of us that will not be returning again... shame",3,2018,09,21
221,Interesting stay (not in a good way),"Stayed here whilst on a business trip to Dublin.  First impressions are reception is totally disorganised and that followed throughout the stay.

The reception, bar and restaurant all have nice ambience, service and quality of food.

Room however I was in City Pod 7 which was pretty awful - it’s in the basement which is where the public toilets are so people are up and down the corridor until the early hours and unfortunately for me pod 7 is right next to the loo which means every time someone goes to the loo the hand dryer goes on and wakes you up if the punters haven’t walking along the corridor.  Also something as simple as a kettle in the room is not provided which is poor for a room Costing £200 per night.  As the floor above must be tiled you also hear every scrape of chair and trolley being wheeled above.

I would not recommend this hotel if you can only afford a city pod - cannot comment on their other types of bed but I have hardly slept for two days so not a happy person when attending a conference you need a clear head.",2,2018,09,21
221,Flying visit to Dublin ,"Great location for the sights and can walk from hotel to St Stephen’s Green in two minutes.  We didn’t eat here but rooms a good size, very clean and ideal for what we needed.  Would recommend a stay for a weekend visit to Dublin. 

",5,2018,09,20
221,Great location,Stayed two nights. First night there was a party downstairs and the noise could be heard in our room and kept us awake until party ended.  No problem with noise the second night.   Room itself was very comfortable.  The location is fantastic.  Had dinner at hotel restaurant and food was delicious.  ,4,2018,09,19
221,Beyond Disappointing,"I checked into the Iveagh Garden Hotel today and I am extremely disappointed with the experience and service so far. I am paying $500 USD a night and this is nowhere close to being worth that price. I booked a superior room and I am facing the street so all I hear is the noise of the cars and trains. Not what I expect for booking the highest level of the room categories (with the exception of the presidential suite). The front desk was less than friendly. I’m only in Dublin for the evening and I wish I would have booked somewhere else, as this is not the experience I was hoping for on my last night in Ireland.",1,2018,09,15
221,Superb hotel,"The hotel is in a great location if visiting Dublin , just a stone throw from Graftan  street and a 10 minute stroll to temple bar .
The hotel itself has a lovely feel to it , modern plush  interior , and all the staff were so polite , helpful and friendly 
Our room was outstanding with everything to make you stay comfortable , the highlight was the walk in rainfall shower which was that good I didn’t want to get out ! 
The only downside for me was the breakfast , I just think 20 euros each is a little bit excessive for a breakfast 
I would throughly recommend this hotel and when returning to Dublin I will defiantly come back to Iveagh garden ",5,2018,09,15
221,Weekend away for myself and my daughter,"The Iveagh Garden hotel is perfectly situated in Dublin. Beautifully decorated and great atmosphere. Rooms were very clean, just make sure you put the label on your door handle, asking to have your room made up, when you go out for the day. Otherwise it might not be done until later in the afternoon, when you want to put your feet up before going out in the evening. We had buffet breakfast included and there was plenty of choice to cater for everyone’s taste, and to feel really full for the day. Drinks at the bar are near €9.00 to €10.00, but that is the same in most of the pubs around Dublin. Also I’m sure they are doubles and not singles. I would definitely go back again for another visit. ",5,2018,09,11
221,Fantastic,Absolutely fantastic so good i have booked again for November. Can not fault the place at all i loved it. From the staff to the decor to the delicious cocktails it was all AMAZING. The finishing details in the rooms are top notch. Thank you Iveagh see you in November.,5,2018,09,11
221,Loved this gem of a hotel!,"Iveagh Garden Hotel is just a five-minute walk from St Stephen Green and in my opinion provided nicer accommodations than I've had in a previous stay right on the Green. The lobby is very tastefully decorated, and the staff was very friendly and helpful. There was a hiccup when we first arrived because their key card readers were not working properly, but someone from the staff was always available to let us into our rooms, and the problem lasted less than a day. 

The room was a pretty good size for European standards, and the greens, golds and grays were very soothing. The bathroom was fantastic--a giant walk-in shower with a rain shower head. Even the towels smelled clean and fresh compared to other places I've stayed. We had a small electrical problem in our room that we noticed just after check-in, and the electrician showed up in minutes and stayed past his shift to fix it, even though we told him it wasn't necessary. Great customer service!

The location of Iveagh Garden Hotel is great for all of the major attractions in Dublin, if you don't mind doing just a little bit of walking. But even getting to the River Liffey doesn't take very long, as Dublin is a walkable city. I'd highly recommend a stay here, and if I return to Dublin, I would not hesitate to stay there again.",5,2018,09,06
221,"Lovely hotel, fantastic location ","Lovely new hotel with excellent location in Dublin city centre. Staff were courteous and helpful, room was grand (bed comfy, very quiet), with nice touches like bottled water in room, tea/coffee and a decent hairdryer! The breakfast was 5 star, absolutely worth the money! Dinner in evening was nice, although bar was quiet. That isn't a bad thing though as this hotel is on a street of nightclubs for 20 somethings!
I'd highly recommend.",4,2018,09,03
221,Nightmare,"Air conditioning, which we were assured they had, is “broken.”  However, they did not tell us this when we checked in. It wasn’t until we got to the boiling hot room and tried to turn it in that we began to wonder. A label on the wall unit says HEATING ONLY. What?? We called the desk. The reception person said it was broken, but will “probably” be fixed tomorrow. So it’s 2am, so effing hot we can’t sleep (even with a fan), and we’re supposed to go on a tour of the countryside in five hours. This place sucks & is ruining our trip. I don’t believe they’ve ever had AC,   Don’t waste your money. 

PS: our waiter at dinner was a complete jerk, fully rounding out this nightmare",1,2018,09,02
221,Gorgeous,"Wow what a lovely hotel!
We were made to feel very welcome during our weekend visit by the front of house staff, bar staff and waiting staff. They were attentive and made us feel like friends.
Our room was lovely and there was nothing I could fault. Hoping to go back soon!",5,2018,09,01
221,Modern bar and restaurant,"I was here with work colleagues. It was a Wednesday night so quite quiet but did get busier. I was not a guest of the hotel, so can't comment on that. We had a couple of drinks in the bar, where the décor and styling is very nice - modern, stylish and warm. The restaurant / food was very good. Service was also good. Overall, a really enjoyable evening helped by the surroundings and service.",4,2018,09,01
221,Beautiful new hotel with an excellent location!,"Stayed here for one night in July after a quick trip.  It was beautifully appointed and was excellent value.  The location is also superb being just off one side of St. Stephen's Green.  The staff were unfailingly helpful and the bar inside is beautiful.  The only negative thing is that since it's on a LUAS line it's hard for taxi drop off and the steps mean getting luggage into the hotel is a little tricky, although the porters were excellent.  Overall a lovely hotel, well priced in a great location - what more could you ask for!",5,2018,08,27
221,Brilliant Location,Just returned from a fantastic 3 night break at the Iveagh. The hotel is maintained to a high standard and has all the facilities you would expect of a top modern hotel. The staff are helpful and courteous and a special thanks goes to John the assistant manager who was on hand at all times to make our stay memorable. The restaurant standard is much improved. The food was delicious and presented to a high standard. A special thanks goes to our waiter (Darko) who was attentive and professional throughout. We have stayed at many hotels throughout the world and the breakfast at the Iveagh surpassed them all. The choice was wide and varied and the hot food cooked to perfection using top quality products. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone,4,2018,08,27
221,Very good hotel in a perfect location. But still a few issues.,"This is a very good hotel still in new condition. We enjoyed all aspects and would recommend this hotel to other travellers. However, there is a pub/hotel almost next door and the extremely loud music blares into the early hours of the morning. The rooms are overly hot and the hotel passageways are extremely hot. Air-conditioning does not go below 22 degrees. Hotel unable to change this heat setting. Due to the heat we would have liked to open the window for some cool fresh air. But it was a balance as to which one was worse, the heat or the noise. I awoke at 3am in a very hot room, opened the window only to find the music still going strong. Had to close the window as the noise was that loud it keep you awake. There are double glazed windows which are effective. But if the rooms are heated to such a degree, there is a massive problem for the guests - no sleep one way or the other. Hotel should investigate how they can lower the temperature of the hotel and the rooms.

The breakfast selection was good. But the food was not always replaced on a regular basis and much of the food was overcooked and unattractive. The service at breakfast was not good at all. Very inattentive and overlooked basic service requirements. Needs a manager to sharpen up the service. Staff were talking amongst themselves, when guests were sitting waiting for tea/coffee etc. It would seem appropriate to be taken to your table and asked whether you would like tea or coffee. We do not like having to track down a staff member and ask them. Very poor.

Having said all of that, I think the hotel is great. Front staff were outstanding.

But I think the hotel has teething problems.",4,2018,08,26
221,Overnight Stay,"We booked the Iveagh Garden Hotel for a night early February 2018. The staff said they had most recently opened. We were in Dublin for a day and a night, we arrived at the hotel early.  The staff were so friendly, pleasant and helpful. They kept all of our luggage and put it in the room when it was ready. Helped us with directions and suggested some sights. After a wonderful day we ate supper at the hotel restaurant. The food was amazing, best steak we have ever had. Our waiter Dragon was amazing and the service was perfect. Our stay there was amazing can’t wait to go back again. 10+++++100% ",5,2018,08,25
221,Restaurant. Lunch  for 14  people,We were a group of 14 friends getting together for our annual reunion. Absolutely delighted - the food was wonderful - huge compliments to the Chef. Big portions and great value. The staff were so helpful and patient! Highly recommended!,5,2018,08,25
221,Great stay in Dublin,"beautiful hotel in a great location in Dublin.
Rooms are clean and spacy and very comfy.
The crew is welcoming and friendly.
only downside is that there is no AC but the fans did the trick.
My room was not facing the main street so it wasn't noisy.",5,2018,08,24
221,Great Hotel in Dublin,"Looking for a grand Hotel in Dublin..? Look no further,you have found it. A few minutes walk from Grafton Street, The Temple Bar, Trinity College, St. stephens Green..
Friendly and helpfull staff, nice room, quiet surroundings. Just a short stroll across the Street too Camden St., lots of pubs,bars and cafes. My good friend, the Consignierie was a good ..... hjelp",5,2018,08,24
221,Loved it!,"The Iveagh Garden hotel was my home for one week. And the staff made me feel that way. Anything I needed was just a call away, with pleasant, rapid responses.

The room was fresh and lovely, kept neat and clean daily by a wonderful staff. I stayed on the fifth floor. I got very spoiled with the rainwater shower in the bathroom.

The food in the restaurant was delicious. I ate breakfast there every day and I highly recommend their porridge!  I miss it so much, now that I’m back home.

Kudos to Francisco and the whole staff for such great service. It’s a big accomplishment as a pretty new hotel. 

See you when I return for work. Thank you!",5,2018,08,17
221,Pod Alert,"Having seen one of your other reviewers comments I was extremely disturbed to learn, on arrival, that the two rooms I had booked through a hotel booking service, were in the basement without airconditioning. These he decsribed as City Pod Double which had not been mentioned on my confirmation. I refused to accept the rooms and requested alternative rooms. I was told that there were no other rooms I demanded a refund. The extremely patronising Customer Services Manager insisted that we wait until other people were checked in before telling us that he could try to find us rooms at another hotel but that they would have to be at the rate we had agreed with the booking website. I asked for a copy of my booking confirmation which he gave me. This was from yet another hotel booking website and showed a rate considerably lower than I had paid. I left the hotel and paid a much higher rate for another hotel in Dublin. The company I used to make the reservation acted immediately and I received an immediate refund. I have been travelling on business for over 50 years and this whole episode was really appalling.",1,2018,08,15
221,Excellent Experience ,"We recently visited Dublin to attend a concert and absolutely loved our stay at the Iveagh garden hotel. The location is fantastic and central, the amenities were great and the service from the staff was some of the best we’ve ever experienced. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone ",5,2018,08,14
221,Not Great,"Be aware of the ""City Pods"" advertised as City Rooms online.
Tiny room in the basement which is basically a bed in a shower room. I had a shower on arrival and had to put up with a wet floor for the rest of the evening so had to keep shoes on and case, laptop bag etc. off the floor which meant on the bed (there is nowhere else for them to go).
No tea and coffee facilities, no wardrobe to hang clothes, no iron (No room to put up ironing board anyway). Tiny window at pavement level which was not great for privacy. Very hard bed and very hot despite the world's noisest A/C.
The room was very clean however, just not well designed.",2,2018,08,14
221,Perfect,"I had this trip as a gi$t for my 50th. We arrived at 8.30 on the first morning the hotel took our bags so we could enjoy our first day.
When returning to the hotel our bags were in our room.
All the staff were amazing and friendly. The porter Rob could not do enough for everyone that walked into the reception he was the one that stood out but all the staff and manager we're amazing. 
Thank you for an amazing weekend",5,2018,08,14
221,Wonderful Stay at Iveagh Garden Hotel,"While traveling through Ireland with friends, we spent two nights at the Iveagh Garden Hotel and absolutely loved it. The hotel is beautiful, perfectly located for people like us who like to walk, near St. Stephen's Green and backing up to the Iveagh Gardens, a gem of a park. Our room was large and well-appointed and air-conditioned. (At first we were given a room without A/C, but requested a room change and were immediately accommodated.) The staff was friendly and very helpful.",5,2018,08,14
221,A gem in the city,"Stayed in the Iveagh Garden Hotel for a romantic break with my husband. Have to say we loved it. Staff were so friendly and the room was huge. So exciting staying in the centre of everything. The staff told us the hotel was just opened in the last year and everything was so bright and fresh. I had explained when booking it was a special night and when we arrived there was a beautiful welcome plate in our room. 
Thank you Iveagh Gardens we'll be back!",5,2018,08,12
221,Exceptional staff,"This elegant boutique hotel is quite new and the gracious lobby featuring teal and mustard velvet chairs and marble floor has a modern luxurious feel. The rooms are however a little disappointing. Firstly not all rooms have air conditioning which is contrary to the description on Expedia which is how we booked and paid. The first room was very stuffy in August and I phoned reception to query the lack of air conditioning. To cut a long story short, only 20 rooms have air conditioning and they are the front facing rooms which can potentially be the noisier rooms. The excellent staff moved us to a quiet room with air conditioning and we slept blissfully comfortably for our three night stay.
My only criticism is that there is no mini bar fridge in the room and the shelving unit is too narrow to balance suitcases on and nor does it have adequate shelving to unpack.
Despite these issues, the excellent, friendly and helpful staff especially Daniel the night manager and Sean the concierge were absolutely fabulous.
We enjoyed our stay.",4,2018,08,10
221,Don’t be fooled by the lobby and lounge! ,"I should preface this review by saying that we stayed at the Iveagh Garden Hotel this past April for two nights and enjoyed our stay very much, at a relatively new hotel that’s well-appointed, clean, and convenient to key attractions. Well, things were quite different upon our return on 6th of August, 2018. We checked in, got to our room, opened the door, and entered a “sauna”, hot air blowing out of the vent, temperature reading: 27°C (80°F), and a cheap oscillating fan. I called the front desk to ask how to adjust the thermostat, and was told our room category doesn’t include air conditioning! I went downstairs to ask for a room that did, and was told the Hotel was fulling booked. I went back upstairs and checked the Hotel’s website and 4 travel sites; all stated that rooms were still available for that evening (by the way, air conditioning was also listed as an amenity on some sites). I also attempted to open a window but it constantly slammed shut, so someone from the front desk came up and propped it open with a tissue box! Also during check-in we were asked if we wanted to put down a deposit for the mini-bar. Well, we didn’t have a mini-bar refrigerator so why bother?! On our way out to dinner I stopped at the front desk to let them know what I discovered on the web sites; I heard crickets. Needless to say being lied to just added to the frustration. Perhaps some type of compensation would have been nice; breakfast, drinks at the bar? In conclusion, it was quite an upsetting and uncomfortable stay at a supposedly 4 star hotel, without two important amenities that you even get at a budget motel. On our next trip to Dublin this Autumn, we will have to think twice of staying at Iveagh Gardens Hotel. ",2,2018,08,09
221,Little gem in Harcourt Street,"Stayed for 2 nights in June with my husband.

Ideal location as not even 5m walk from Grafton Street.
As you walk in lobby seems very luxurious and high end, really nicely done.

Our room was in the 5th floor facing the side of the building. 
Very spacious room and quite a fancy bathroom with a very nice shower.
Huge and extremely comfortable bed.

Only downfall of bedroom in my opinion is the lack of a mini fridge, even to place a bottle of water would have been nice.
Other than that great room, very very comfortable.

Although Harcourt Street is a very busy street at night and there’s a club just right across there was absolutely no noise, perfectly glazed windows.

Breakfast in my opinion didn’t match the rest of the hotel. Was only okay, nothing special about it, not a lot of variety either. No proper coffee offered which for me is a big let down. Jugs of black coffee and black tea are brought to tables my waitresses, so no choice of kind of coffee or even tea varieties.

Will most definitely stay again, but would op out of breakfast and just have it somewhere else.",4,2018,08,09
221,Nice hotel but overall poor value and caution if the weather is hot,"We stayed one night recently (2 rooms for my family). Overall a nice hotel on par with higher end hotels in the US but for the money not a great value. 
A few things I noted - it has been unusually warm there this summer, and the rooms had no air conditioning. It was 80 degrees F in our 5th floor room when we checked in by late afternoon - even with the limited ability to open a window and a  small oscillating fan, it stayed uncomfortably warm in there until late at night which made it difficult to sleep. I was happy we are rested and willing to walk around the area until late (had we been tired and needed a nap it would have been impossible to rest at that temp). This was the worst part of our stay, other patrons were also complaining, but I did not see any offer to reduce the room rate or provide anything other than a small oscillating fan. 
I agree with another reviewer that it would have been nice to have at least a mini-fridge for some cold drinks. If they continue having warmer summers something would have to be done. 
The bar was very overpriced (12+ Euros for a house gin and tonic). 
Unfortunately we tried to visit the Iveagh Garden that they advertised - it has fairly short hours (closed at 6pm the day we visited) and we were never able to visit it. 
Positives  - the decor, location (I didn't hear any of the night club noise others complained about, but our window was not on the front side), lovely showers.",3,2018,08,08
221,A nice discovery in Dublin,"Stayed in hotel last week having seen it listed on a hotel booking site and it was very reasonable value for Dublin city centre.  Location is very near stephens green and although in hartcourt street with all its various night clubs we were in a back room so didn't hear a thing, also couldn't hear anything from lobby area either even though nightclubs were heaving.  Very nicely decorated lobby and room was also lovely, do agree that there is no air con and window barely opens but I would imagine this is a common situation in most Irish hotels and they may all have to adapt if warm weather becomes the norm.  Staff were friendly and we had a nice snack in the bar, also breakfast is good.  Would stay here again.",4,2018,08,07
221,Beautiful hotel ,"Having read some recent reviews me & my husband we’re worried about the fact we had booked this hotel. We arrived for 2 nights on 3rd August. 
First impressions were excellent. The hotel is located on a very nice street with Georgian buildings, a 5 minute walk to st Stephens green & grafton Street. The lobby/ reception area is beautiful. The restoration of the building & interior design was spot on & gives a great impression. Staff upon check in were also very helpful. We booked a double room & were allocated one on the 5th floor. Room size was great & it was well designed. Plenty of lights, mirrors, sockets & we had air con too. Bathroom was excellent. We had no problem with noise & had two great nights sleep. 
I would highly recommend the buffet breakfast. Lots of choice & food was hot & of good quality. Bar prices for bottles of beer were cheaper than temple bar district too. 
Would we return to this hotel in the future? Most definitely! ",5,2018,08,07
221,Elle's bar - Avoid,"I made a lunchtime booking here. There was no record of my booking when I arrived. It was only on showing a picture of the booking they accepted I had made one. They then offered to put us in a room that had yet to be opened so we would have been sitting alone and away from other diners.

Service was very fast (waiting 5 minutes for chicken burger) so food must have been pre-prepared. Taste was average. Staff were not attentive and were all running around but no one seemed in control. Staff do not seem trained properly as we  were initially brought someone else's food and when ours did arrive the waitress just hovered at the table with 2 plates and we had to ask her if it was our order. 

This restaurant has been open long enough now for these issues to have been rectified. Unlikely to go again.",2,2018,08,07
221,Worst Hotel Ever,"No air conditioning (despite what they advertise) hot water stopped working in the early evening, elevator broke and nightclubs nearby play loud music until 2 or 3 in the morning. Would not stay there again.",1,2018,08,06
221,Left on the fence,"New hotel; is what we where expecting, though I was somewhat, saddened. The staff where very attentive, thorough and welcoming, whilst there where quibbles which we couldn’t help but notice.

The room was clear, well presented and modern, much like the remainder of the hotel, however there where little things; such as the fan which was provided; this squeaked when rotating, the air conditioning wouldn’t dispense cold air and our iron leaked water profusely (replaced promptly).

My final gripe is that there was no fridge, it was especially warm during our visit and a cold water upon returning would’ve been perfect.

I would like to add, most of the staff are helpful and provided the above points are addressed it could be a 4* hotel. ",3,2018,08,06
221,"Beware of the ""City Pod""...Ok but not what it sells itself as...","Myself and my fiance were attending the comedy festival next door so booked a double room aka a ""city pod"" for the night. At €219 For a night I expected something a lot more than we got...I understand the need to capitalise on space but for the price charged this was outrageous...you would a wardrobe, fridge, or even enough room to swing a cat...Well we got none of those...it was like spending the night in an extended coffin...the proper direction from reception staff on how to get to our room was bad enough but then the lack of simple signage to tell you were your was located was a joke!! I want to stress that the room was clean, fully functioning and of decent quality but absolutely not worth the price charged!! There are much cheaper and nicer hotels to stay in not too far from here...there is also no parking available whatsoever and you have to park in St Stephen's Green SC as a result which is just completely impractical!! Better value to be had elsewhere....",2,2018,08,03
221,Quick bite before concert.,Visited the restaurant in this hotel recently on our way to the Aslan concert in Iveagh Gardens. We only wanted a snack so ordered starters only. I had caesar salad with added chicken and my husband had salmon. Both starters were large and mine had a complete chicken fillet. Food was lovely and all the staff were so friendly and welcoming. The bar was buzzing with atmosphere and I i tend on booking this hotel for my next trip to Dublin.,5,2018,08,03
221,Great hotel and great location. ,Stayed there last Sunday as was going to a concert and decided to make a night of it. This is a lovely spacious hotel with a great location. The staff were attentive and the rooms were excellent. It a bit more expensive then others I’m sure but you pay for what you get. Lovely breakfast also. Worth a visit in my opinion. ,4,2018,08,02
221,Stay here if you are on a work trip,"The location of this hotel is great, walking distance to a lot of businesses and tech companies (WeWork is just 2 blocks away).  I recommend this hotel if you are on a work trip due to the location and value.  But I don't know if I would recommend this hotel for a romantic getaway - there are some very lively clubs and bars right across the street that are very noisy at night and kill the mood (unless you want to party hard, then it's right there for you!).",4,2018,08,01
221,Competent hotel,"Clean, well appointed hotel with one of the freshest and tastiest buffet breakfasts. Fairly sized rooms. Friendly staff, especially those working the restaurant. Fast WiFi.

Downsides: noisy pub area not too far away, with parties till early morning, not all rooms have aircon and windows can’t be fully opened for ventilation.",4,2018,07,30
221,Very nice stay,"Just returned from a weekend visit to this lovely hotel. It's in a central location near St Stephens Green and Grafton St. Staff are very helpful and the service is great. The bar area is nice for a drink but can get very busy. The room we had at the back of the hotel on the 4th floor was a good size, lovely bathroom with very nice toiletries. Air conditioning was good and we didn't have any problems with noise. However friends that came with us had an issue with air conditioning in their room and were kept awake by noise from music being played at the back of the hotel. Clearly this isn't the fault of the hotel but it is located in a very busy area with lots of lively night life. Would definitely return.",4,2018,07,29
221,"Comfortable, ask for quiet room","We purposely avoided temple bar to avoid loud music and crazy nightlife. While this area is much tamer, it is still a popluar nightlife area and on Friday and Saturday theusic from nearby clubs can be heard in our third floor room. We would like to shut the window to soften it, but no air conditioning. So...it's a tad louder than I would prefer and we are not even facing the main street. Other than that, comfortable, great service, kind people, good shower. Probably quiet during the week. ",4,2018,07,28
221,Not recommended,"Room 103 on ground floor,small room with only heating display the room very hot to stay over night only 2 windows which I manage to open only 10 cm,al night I heard  the staff members parking the cars next to the windows,you can hear the music from next door club,no iron no bath rope no flip flops no fridge,we went for a walk and we ask for umbrella “sorry we don’t do “,I complain about the heating and I got “yes is hot outside “,I couldn’t not sleep all night and very disappointed about handling the situation",1,2018,07,28
221,Disappointing-worst room,"Beware the city pod - underground, no air con or any airflow, only a tiny window at street height that has a mini barn door to close for privacy from the street to totally shut off any sort of air supply.....after walking on the bed to be able to reach it. Zero sleep in a stuffy hot room. The shower also floods the tiny bathroom. 
I enquired via email re the room and received no reply. If I had received any description of the room I would have cancelled my booking and booked another room ....hopefully with a better stay. 
The duty manager attempted to find me another room at check in, I appreciated offer of a free breakfast /glass of wine but I wasn’t complaining  for a free upgrade or food as the room is actually terrible. 
I have stayed in backpacker hostel private rooms that were of better standard for a fraction of the price. 
All I wanted was a comfortable room and room service or dinner in the restaurant before an early flight. I couldn’t stay in the room (and there is no where to eat except the bed) and after reading the reviews of the restaurant/bar I couldn’t deal with another expensive disappointment
The only saving grace for my stay was the concerierge - super friendly and helpful. 
A terrible room for a disappointing stay on what was supposed to be a fabulous last night in Dublin.",2,2018,07,26
221,Awful stay.  Hotel just doesn't care...,"Hotel gave us a room without a/c.  Note, the a/c was not broken.  The room (4th floor) just didn't have any, and yet they still rented the room to me.  The weather in Ireland was nice, but not terribly hot.  Our room, however, was like an oven.  At 2 am in the morning, as we lay there sweating, the room temp hit over 30 degrees celcius.  I had to hang my head out the tiny window for a small amount of relief.   The two tiny desk fans (which clearly indicated they knew they had a problem) helped not at all.
The next day, I requested a room change.  They gave me one with a/c this time, but at the very front of the hotel which was extremely noisy.  The noisy bars coupled with the rumbling of the tram line that runs right in front of the hotel meant sleep was elusive for our 2nd and 3rd nights as well.  So this is your choice at this hotel.  A room in which you will swelter or one in which you will lie awake listening to the street noise.
When I complained at check out, the staff weren't at all concerned, simply pushing toward me a card with the owners' contact information on it, suggesting I write to the address on it.  The staff in general were harried or disinterested and extremely poorly trained.  (I won't bother going into the details of how the bellhop left my luggage sitting on the street in the morning upon check out as his shift ended.  His replacement hadn't turned up, so it was simply left sitting there unattended.)
I wonder if the manager will come on to reply to this review with the rote/repeated phrases he has left for every dissatisfied customer to ""contact him""?   That is the style of this place -- a pretense at hospitality and the absolute lack of anything except separating you from your cash.
I'll revert to staying at the Merrion in future, where they actually value and treat their customers well.",1,2018,07,26
221,Lovely hotel near St. Stephen's Green,"Lovely, lively place within walking distance of Grafton and Temple Bar districts (10-20 minutes). We had very good customer service and a lovely room with an outdoor patio. In the summer, there may be events in Iveagh Gardens Park (concerts, etc.), so you may experience some noise, but these end before 11. Staff was helpful and friendly.",4,2018,07,25
221,Nice Hotel and bar area but beware which room you book,"My husband booked our rooms through Expedia. He booked the City Rooms for us and for 2 other couples. The only photo on the web site shows only the bed. The first couple checked in ahead of the rest of us and immediately came up from the lower level(which is half underground) and described the room. There is no privacy on the toilet the bathroom is literally part of the room with clear glass. Initially they told us they had no other rooms. After much discussion they gave 1 couple a handicap room. After 30 minutes the 2 other couples called and said how unacceptable the rooms were, they were able to move them upstairs to a regular room for a 25.00 Euro upgrade charge. 
     Beware of what you are booking is my message. They also say they have A/C, however, the A/C units are not sufficient to provide any amount of real coolness. If you are lucky enough you will have a fan in your room. Be sure to request this immediately.
On the plus side, the location is in walking distance to many tourist attractions. The staff in the bar are super friendly and provide wonderful service with a smile. The lobby staff were a bit rude while we were checking out... Cabs have to park on the opposite side of the street. While my husband was at the desk checking out, we were loading our cab with luggage and golf clubs for 6 people. We had a couple of bags in the lobby and the lobby staff got so uptight about the location of the bags near the door he took it outside and deposited it on the sidewalk in the rain. Not helpful",3,2018,07,23
221,Disappointed ,"Myself and my partner stayed in one of the ‘pods’. Although it’s insanely small, it was clean  and fresh. The biggest problem for us was the air con was broken and the heat in the room was unbearable. I called upon the staff to help and the best they could do was bring a fan which made no difference. I requested to move room but was told I would need to pay more to do so. I had 2 cold showers during the night to keep me cool. We couldn’t keep the windows or blinds open as street passers could see straight into our room. We’d had enough and left the hotel before 7am.  ",1,2018,07,23
221,Great boutique hotel but could improve on customer service ,"The hotel is new and well done up. The room was spacious ( especially compared to our London hotel ) . 

We stayed with our 5 year old and asked for a quiet room and we got one . The bathroom too is clean modern and with good water pressure. 

We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel ( found it too expensive ) . But lots of places around. Really recommend the beanhive. 

The location is central-ish. It is between 2 tram stops so have to walk a bit on either side .  But it is about 10 minutes walk to St Stephens green and Grafton Street . 

The Harcourt street is one way .. so you do end up paying slightly more on the taxis . 

I didn't have any personal rude incident with any of the staff but i just found the general demeanor a bit stiff. 

I think we paid around 30 euros for the taxi ride from the airport to the hotel.

 ",4,2018,07,23
221,"Very good, quite new, but expensive city hotel","Staff were very good the food was excellent (including breakfast which is how I rate the food anywhere) service was good, room was good, very tidy and clean (as it should be when new) wifi was excellent even in the rooms, but i dont think it justified the price  - for me.
Couple of small things for the hotel. The room was so hot and the air con hardly made a dent in it though it was unusually hot at the time. I was allocated what I would assume was a disabled room as bathroom was a wet room with rails. After a shower the whole floor was wet and it didnt drain because it was outside the draining part. The  bathroom light was difficult to find as it was in the bedhead switches. A sign would help. for a businessman the chairs were useless for trying to work on a small table. The tea/coffee making tray was nowhere near a plug socket. Bad enough for me but how would a disabled person cope carrying it round the room.",4,2018,07,23
221,2nd Annivesary - Love Iveagh Garden Hotel,"I had been looking at Iveagh Garden Hotel before it opened, I really liked the art-deco style on the picture and it was one of the most attractive hotel in Dublin for me. Still, I was slightly worried to be one of the first people to stay so it's only when I found a very good deal that I decided to book. God did I do well!!

I have been in touch with Stephen to organise a surprise for my partner for our 2nd anniversary. He was very, very helpful and offered a complimentary upgrade. I have no words to say how beautiful the room was, so spacious as well. Accommodation staff were very helpful when we found out our Smart TV had been set to a Cyrillic language by the previous occupant, they did not manage to sort it out at first but when we returned to our hotel for our second night this was sorted. 
We were staying in a front room so we could indeed hear noise from the nightclub across the street but it was only very light and that would not bother me nor my partner as we are heavy sleepers. 

We were also very impressed by the staff in the bar, they were very professional and although we did not spend much time there, the hostess remembered us and our order when we came back to the bar on day 2 (a cappuccino and a tea), which I thought was very good. Fair enough it was a midweek time but working in the industry myself I have a fair idea of how many faces a day you can see!

All in all we had a great stay just a few minutes away from Stephen's Green.
Thank you all at Iveagh Garden Hotel - we will be back!",5,2018,07,21
221,Fabulous Stay,"I’ve travelled the world and would rate this as one of my favourites, my friend and I were so delighted with our stay here. The staff are very professional and very attentive, the room was super clean, the bed was ultra comfy, bathroom top notch, the position is perfect and the decor throughout is beautiful. I can’t wait to stay here again... and I’m a fussy one to please! Thank you to all of the staff for making our staff so enjoyable x",5,2018,07,21
221,"Frankly, not worth the high price","We stayed three nights in June 2018 on our first visit to Dublin.

The upside: nicely furnished room and bathroom at the rear of the property; cheerful young staff; excellent sea food chowder until 10PM; lively, busy vibe. 

The downside: our room, with a small balcony, was located directly over the external smoking area of the bar, with loud conversations, singing and laughter until after 1AM which made sleep difficult in the smallish ""Queen"" bed (not really suitable for two adults); panoramic view of rubbish bins and builders´skips; no ""garden"" view at all, just a bunch of trees, despite the name of the hotel. High price.

Furthermore, the hotel is not really convenient for public transport. A tram stop is minutes away but who wants to bother with tickets, maps etc on a short three-day trip?; Harcourt Street is one-way, so taxis have to make a long and expensive detour to get there; it is theoretically within walking distance of the ""centre"" of town (i.e.top end of Grafton Street) but this can seem a quite long hike for an older couple on a cold windy night.

Overall, I thought the Iveagh Garden Hotel was not good value for money - almost three hundred pounds  per night. We were expecting a much better place for the outlay. I know Dubliin is expensive, but travellers prepared to pay that kind of money should consider looking for a more luxurious experience elsewhere. So, my overall rating is 3 Trip Advisor points for this mildly disappointing hotel.",3,2018,07,21
221,Nice find but a few issues!,"We came to Dublin as a surprise for my partners 30th birthday. The interior of the hotel was super. The only things I am going to fault are - 
• The room was too hot, the hotel provided us with a fan however this wasn’t enough. No air con? 
• We stayed for 2 nights and on the second day I decorated our room with confetti and hanging decorations for my partners 30th and for some reason when we came back from being out the cleaner had cleaned it all up? Even my bag of confetti that wasn’t empty was binned. Surely she would think that we aren’t leaving for another day so I will leave up the decorations? Bizarre. 
• We got back to the hotel at around 10.30pm after being in the centre and fancied a drink in the bar however because it was a Wednesday night, we couldn’t pay cash and the barman told my partner to go to reception and ask if we can add a debit card payment of £50 on the room. After doing this and rudely being told no by reception, the bar man reluctantly let us have a drink in the bar which I feel there was no need for......we are guests in the hotel if we want a drink in the bar then there should not be an issue. 
• Some of the staff are quite rude. 

It was a nice hotel for 2 nights but I wouldn’t stay there again. The above ruined it for me.",4,2018,07,21
221,Don’t go there for a drink,"I called in here after a gig for a nice drink. I firstly queried where 1 of the gins on the menu was from, they didn’t have a clue, excusable, hard to keep up. I then ordered Bathtub gin & a cocktail. They then realized they ran out of that. So I said if u don’t have any more I will just have a brockmans. That was delivered to our table after 10mins waiting. I tasted it and knew immediately it wasn’t brockmans, so I went up to the bar, Bar man tasted it and immediately agreed with me. Then realized there was nothing left in bottle so I had to choose another gin, 3rd option! No apology or any recognition of an error! Extremely bad service",1,2018,07,20
221,Boutique classy hotel by Iveagh Gardens Dublin,"Went to see Alanis Morisette play live in the Iveagh Gardens and this hotel was perfect.
It’s newly refurbished , period , boutique beautifully decorated hotel with great food, fantastic beds and well located.
Highly recommended ",5,2018,07,20
221,"Lovely hotel, wonderful staff","We really enjoyed our recent stay at the Iveagh Garden Hotel. The room was clean, the beds comfortable, the shower fabulous and the location was central and convenient to what we wanted to do and see.  What we appreciated most, however, was the friendly, helpful desk staff. They gave us a very early check in, which was a blessing after a long overnight flight. And, Sean, the concierge was extremely helpful with suggestions about tours and restaurants. Based on our experience, I would be happy to recommend this hotel.",5,2018,07,19
221,Elle's - Very poor unfortunately!,"Wouldn't be one to complain normally but hoping it might help the hotel. 

A group of us ate here recently as were were visiting a nearby business, after being seated for 10-15 minutes, I had to go and get the menus myself and hand them out to the group.

The menu is restaurant prices rather then bar prices, so we were expecting high quality food and service. 

One of the waiters, who i wont name, had an unbelievable poor attitude unfortunately, he would drop the drinks in the middle of the table without saying anything for us to get them ourselves. On ordering, someone took a second to recheck the menu and he moved onto the next person muttering under his breath. It was really really poor. I have never seen service as bad, ever. 

The other waiter who was also helping was much more pleasant to be fair. 

The main courses, there was a lot of us that got Steaks, which was very average at best for the price charged. The issue was the inconsistency, some came with no sauce, half of the plates had no salad, which was unfortunate! 

After the main course, we waited 45- 60 minutes at the table - some would have got desert but not one person came near us as the plates just sat there. Most of us were laughing at this point at how bad it was. 

The bill which was very very costly,  hardly got a thank you in exchange.

Apologies for the complaint but hoping it may improve things for you.",1,2018,07,19
221,Don't stay here,"We initially chose to stay at the Iveagh Garden because of a recommendation from a friend. While the location is great, we were disappointed with the responsiveness of the staff here along with the rooms. The majority of rooms in the hotel lack A/C, and the hotel initially gave us a room without A/C even though we booked an A/C room. The room also had an extremely weak Wi-Fi connection. The hotel manager did not acknowledge or take ownership when we raised these concerns. Overall we would not recommend staying at this place.",1,2018,07,17
221,"Modern, boutique hotel - reasonably priced","We stayed for a night in a very short break to Dublin booked a few days before leaving. Nice, modern hotel with a few retro twists (the decoration is in keeping with the era of the building). Nice spacious rooms with all desired amenities.

Reasonably priced for Dublin prices and in an OK location. A little further out than the main city but well within walking distance of all the sightseeing destinations.

Randomly, on checkout, Laura Whitmore was present in the foyer in having a photo shoot.. Slightly unusual but something to talk about, isn't it? ",4,2018,07,15
221,Bar!,"Didn't stay in the Iveagh Gardens Hotel but went in to the bar for a drink. The doorman was most unfriendly as were the bar staff. 
I ordered a pint and was ask for payment before I received the pint. Then the very rude barman left the Guinness for nearly five minutes before topping off the pint.I had to ask him to top off the  pint.  This guy had a real attitude problem. 
Staff seem very unfriendly and unprofessional so on the basis of my visit I would not return. Horrible unfriendly place. ",1,2018,07,14
221,Not worth the price.,"For the price, this hotel gets a hard pass. 

The good: It is cute. The bathrooms are well done. It’s clean. Good location.

The bad: aircon is not standard in every room. This is problematic because, no matter where you are in the hotel, you can hear the night clubs across the way. Your options are close the windows and be stuffy while listening to muffled club music, or being mildly less stuffy and listening to a bad DJ at full blast. I’m writing this at 1:30am and there appears to be no signs of slowing down. 

Ultimately this is not worth the price. I understand nothing can be done about the nightclub, but a hotel should not bill itself a luxury experience when it sounds like you’re sleeping in a hostel.",2,2018,07,13
221,A lovely experience ,"From when we arrived, the staff were friendly and the decor looked lovely. Our room had everything we needed including a smart tv, free wifi and an excellent shower. The beds themselves were very comfy and clean. We were on the highest floor so there wasn’t any loud music or sounds from outside.

The breakfast their was wonderful. Once again the staff were kind and doing their jobs well making sure everything was in abundance. The selection was varied and tasted great. One thing that surprised me was the pancake maker machine, worked rather well actually.

On the last day, we were able to leave our bags at the hotel as we were doing some more sightseeing. They were very efficient and had a good attitude in everything they did. Wished we could’ve stayed longer.

If I had to have a negative the hotel itself was really hot as well as the room. Even with the window open, the fan on and the air conditioning on it was roasting and made it hard to sleep. Overall this hotel is highly recommended.",4,2018,07,13
221,Only reasonable," I booked 3 double rooms and was generally disappointed. Great staff. Seemed like a 3 star hotel at 4/5 star prices. Non urgent maintenance, involving the use of a noisy cherry picker overlooking the bar terrace, was undertaken at busy weekend times. Why?",3,2018,07,11
221,Recent visit ,"This hotel was fabulous. The location is great because it is walking distance from most of anything. On our visit, we stayed in a superior king room with air conditioning. The room was very spacious and quiet despite being on the side of the street that faced the road. It was exceptionally hot the week of our visit so the air condition was very much appreciated. 

We booked this hotel last minute due to the fact that our originally booked hotel had no a/c and was extremely loud and we could not sleep. The staff at Iveagh Gardens were very helpful and polite when trying to book a last minute room.  If we return to Dublin, I will definitely stay here again.",5,2018,07,09
221,We loved our visit at this hotel,"This hotel was great for it's price.  There is a bus stop right around the corner so you can take the bus to the airport, it leaves every 30 minutes and will cost you 7Euro.  Breakfasts were great and door man was very helpful.",5,2018,07,09
221,Newer does not mean better,"I booked this hotel before it opened, thinking that it had to be excellent, dine it was brand spanking new. Well, I've learned my lesson. I could not be more disappointed. I have never given a hotel a rating of two before, however this hotel made misrepresentations, warranting the low rating. We booked an air conditioned room with a garden view. We did not have air conditioning and the room overlooked trash. I will try to upload the photos of our, ""view"" . When we complained to the manager we were told that we should have specifically requested an air conditioned room. When we showed the manager our booking confirmation, he ignored the fact that it confirmed that we booked a room with a garden view  and air conditioning and told us that since we requested an early check in, our initial booking was not considered. Our, early check in was at 1 pm by the way. We were not too that the room was not what was what we paid for, at the time we were given the room. Additionally, the bed was as hard as a rock. The shower was good, as was the location,which  is why I gave it a two instead of a one. There was little room for storage. I still can't believe that the manager blamed us for their lack of compliance.",2,2018,07,09
221,Disappointing and Misled,"1st nite in Dublin and we were excited to stay at a modern new hotel. We arrived early and requested an early check in. Several hours later we were checked in. So far so good.  The room was nice and had a beautiful bathroom. One major problem, the thermostat indicated that the temperature was 25 degrees Celsius.After following A/C instructions called the front desk and they claimed that our room was one of approximately 100 that did not have A/C. The manager stated that since we requested early check in we should have requested A/C. Seriously? If I arrived on a cold day would I need to request heating? The manager was very defensive with his flawed logical explanation. A 4* hotel that advertises A/C but only 50 out of 150 have A/C, hmmm. Strange and we had a miserable 1 day stay.  We had a reservation for 2 nites later in the week that I promptly cancelled after wasting my time speaking to this manager who was nice but just didn't get it. He did give us a modest credit which is better tha nothing. Lesson learned. I noticed similar complaints on other reviews on this site.",2,2018,07,09
221,Staff were very rude.,"Unfortunately my husband and I had a fairly unimpressive stay at Iveagh Garden recently. It was our first wedding anniversary and we like being out and about so booked this hotel for the location and the price wasn't too bad either. However from the moment we walked in the staff could not have been less friendly. From the hotel check in staff to the man who came to our room when we couldn't get the TV to work, the bar staff were the rudest I have ever met, not bringing over menus, looking us up and down when we asked for two espresso martini's, walking off without saying a word, we just had to leave the bar and then the man at the check out desk who didn't even say goodbye. My husband actually turned to me and said it's as if we have done something wrong to offend them (which I assure you we hadn't). Aside from the staff, our shower didn't drain properly and completely flooded the bathroom, the tap in the bathroom is labelled the wrong way around and there is no where to plug in the kettle - you have to bring out onto the floor to plug it in which I think isn't safe! It's a nice modern hotel and if they fixed a few issues could be a lovely place to stay. For us though manners cost nothing and for that reason we definitely wouldn't stay here again. I have actually never taken the time to write a review before but was so taken aback by the staff at Iveagh I am hoping that someone will take it on board.",1,2018,07,07
221,Average experience,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights on our recent trip to Dublin. Although the hotel was clean and comfortable there was no AC in our room which made it difficult to sleep during the heat wave. I would not have booked this hotel had I known there would be no AC in our room. Also, the bar staff seemed very disorganized and the food menu was over priced. I would be hesitant to stay at this hotel in the future.",3,2018,07,06
221,Be careful using their mobile site,"Booked using the hotel'sown mobile site (not the best user experience, definitely needs a review). I was looking to book for the weekend but because you have to go back and forth a lot to see the various room and rate options the site reset the arrival date to the day I was searching and didn't retain the date I had entered as an arrival and departure date. Unfortunately, I didn't notice until I went to cancel. 

Anyway ended up being charged as a no-show - nothing they can do seemingly even though its an independent hotel so they can decide what to do (but to be fair my own fault I should have double and triple checked). So I am just posting this so that others don't make the same mistake. 

Other than that I am sure its a nice hotel, people who did get to stay that I know have said they have had a pleasant stay there.",3,2018,07,06
221,Quality,Stayed 4 nights on a golf trip. Top quality hotel in an excellent location. Staff very helpful but the concierge Shaun should be highly commended for his friendliness and helpfulness. The room was big and very comfortable.,5,2018,07,04
221,Beautiful Boutique Hotel exactly as discribed,"While planning our trip of 9 to Ireland I relied heavily on reviews from Trip Advisor, and while I don't usually write reviews good or bad, I'd like to pay it forward! Iveagh is exactly as pictured and described... absolutely beautiful! Beds were comfortable and we all loved the rainfall showers!!! I'm reading other recent reviews complaining about the noise from neighborhood bars and while yes it was a little noisy it's the price you pay staying in a city, convenient to all the sites! No different from staying in NYC! We enjoyed our night there and were able to check in early, which we greatly appreciated after a long flight!",5,2018,07,04
221,Lovely hotel ,"Stayed for 1 night, rooms beautifully decorated. Hotel staff helpful. Short walk from Grafton street. 
Only Complaint,  difficult to get parked close by and bit of a walk if you’ve got luggage and a little noisy at the front of hotel as a nightclub opposite. 
Didn’t eat in the restaurant, breakfast was buffet style and fine... a little disappointing standard for the price of the hotel. ",5,2018,07,04
221,"Beautiful hotel, but some very noisy rooms","This is a new beautiful hotel with very comfortable rooms and furnishings. But, beware that the rooms facing the front onto Harcourt St. are subject to very noisy nightclubs across the street. Loud music and drunken customers awoke us in  early morning hours. Please note that the staff moved us to a very quiet wing after we complained. Not sure what, if anything, the hotel can do to address the noise problem.",4,2018,07,03
221,Lovely Hotel and Service,"Quiet neighborhood, close to Grafton, near Iveagh Gardens Park. Service was very good. Clean and hip while having a warm cozy fee. Walked everywhere.  Sean (concierge) was wonderful. He set up a really fun tour for me.
Would definitely stay here again!",4,2018,07,03
221,"Great hotel, great location","Loved the design, cleanliness and air conditioning at this stylish property. Bar areas and reception are lovely, however, the staff, with the exception of the porter Garry, are a little disinterested - a lack of knowledge of the local area was the major criticism but all in all if you want a lovely hotel in a great spot this one is for you.",4,2018,07,03
221,Family reunion,Room not available at the time of our arrival but we went to the bar for a drink awaiting the arrival of my daughter and her fiancé. Clearly the air-conditioning is completely useless and needs serious attention. Good location but Harcourt Road is very noisy and your sleep may be affected by the nightclubs opposite.,4,2018,06,27
221,Amazing new hotel,"Had a great stay here everything about it is fabulous. The
Design, the staff. Great bar and restaurant. It’s new and lovely and only 5 mins walk from St. Stephens Green and Grafton St. the street is a bit grubby and looks like it could be noisy but it’s like an Oasis inside.",5,2018,06,25
221,Great hotel for money!,"Was a little sceptical on staying here. As soon as entered the lobby was amazed. Very clean hotel, central location. Couldn't fault it in any way. Staff friendly and very helpful. Rooms nicely decorated also very clean.",5,2018,06,25
221,Good location with quiet atmosphere!,"This was a very nice hotel with a pretty spacious room.  It was located around the corner from The Iveagh Gardens and we happened to be there for the Taste of Dublin festival.  It was a lovely festival and only lasted till 10:30pm so the music stopped and allowed for a good nights sleep.  There were some in hotel phone issues. The restaurant food was very good.  We liked the location just a short walk to Grafton Street, Trinity College, and St. Stevens Greens.",4,2018,06,24
221,"Lovely hotel, be aware of the noise ","Lovely hotel, love the rooms, the bathrooms are fab and i love the decor and lighting throughout the hotel.   Having seen the other reviews about the noise, we requested a quiet room which was confirmed promptly by the hotel, and we got a lovely room towards the back.  Very glad we did, as although you could still hear the boom boom quite clearly , I can't imagine what it must be like towards the front of the hotel.  Slept fine (a few drinks probably helped!)  In the gorgeous bed, but just do be aware of it if you are anything other than a heavy sleeper. ",4,2018,06,24
221,Great new spot,"Attended a staff party here as recently as Tuesday, and it was so good that I went back to experience this cool new place on Friday.

We had a meal in the bar upstairs, before the party which was in a function room downstairs. The room catered perfectly for our needs, nice bar, lovely furnishings and what I believe was a lovely food offering ( I was too full after our meal upstairs). 

Staff seemed nice especially in the bar upstairs and to be greeted by the lovely concierge Sean on our way in was an extremely nice touch. Very nicely appointed and located in a fantastic area of town I will definitely be back and hopefully the next time to stay.

One draw back was the hotel were obviously having connection issues with their credit card machines in the function room, so we could only pay by cash (problematic if you have to go find an atm) but not remotely enough to stop me returning.

Thanks for a great evening.

221,Horrible customer service,"The location was convenient and within walking distance to most of the activities for which we had reservations. The rooms were reasonably nice but customer service was horrible because of the manager on duty. We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights in 2 rooms; we got 2 rooms because of my husband's snoring. My husband stayed in one room with our older son and I stayed in the other room with our younger son. We had two good-size rooms on the 5th floor, but one room had air-conditioning and the other didn't. We were there during the 3rd week of a ""heat wave,"" so air-conditioning was definitely a necessity and the hotel should have had plenty of time to make any necessary adjustment. I got the room without air-conditioning. The morning after we checked in, I asked to be moved to a room with air-conditioning and was promised that would happen that afternoon. After we got back from our day of touring, I found out that not only was the new room smaller but it still did NOT have the requested/promised air-conditioning. When we inquired at the front desk, the response was ""I don't know why they moved you into that room; there is only heater available."" By that time, there was no other room available. So, why did I go through the trouble of repacking only to be moved to a smaller room still without air-conditioning?!  I couldn't believe such incompetence!  Our hotel voucher promised comfort including air conditioning!  It was obvious the hotel was poorly equipped to handle any weather change. In addition, we were supposed to have breakfast included with our reservations. When we showed up for breakfast the first morning, we were told our names were not on their list. We had to go searching for a breakfast place outside of the hotel on our own in a strange city. I called my Travel Agent (Vicki at ScheckTrek Travel) very frustrated. She made our hotel reservation through a travel agent at Hotels.com. When Vicki called the hotel to speak to the hotel manager, he refused to give his name!  Can you believe that?!  A hotel manager who refuses to give his name!!  The front desk staff never apologized for the breakfast fiasco and was not helpful, so I asked to speak to the hotel manager who was on duty on June 6, 2018. The manager never introduced himself or smiled or offered an apology, but merely stated that his staff made an error when updating the breakfast list. He never apologized for the breakfast mishap or for his staff's incompetence!!  He gave me his card only after I asked for it.  He was the same manager who refused to give his name when my travel agent called; we both spoke to the same manager on the same day. He refused to compensate us for our out-of-pocket breakfast expense when the error was made by the hotel. He offered us another day of breakfast but that was ridiculous when we were scheduled to check out in 2 days. He then offered to compensate us with a voucher for free drinks.  My husband is the only one who drinks alcohol in our party.  How can he possibly consume 50 Euros worth of alcohol by himself? Hotels.com was ready to refund the out-of-pocket breakfast expense to our credit card, but the manager refused to authorize it. He did offer to take off 100 Euros from each room, but that did not even come close to paying for one night in one of the rooms, and by no means made up for all of the inconvenience and frustration we endured.  The hotel may be acceptable and the location may be convenient, but I will never recommend this hotel to anyone because of its horrible customer service and how we were treated!  The hotel staff and that manager were definitely not welcoming or accommodating and didn't seem to care about the meaning of customer service! It was a very bad start and gave us a very bad impression of our first trip to Ireland!",1,2018,06,15
221,Beautiful Quiet Hotel,"Everything about this hotel is beautiful. Plants, decor, restaurant, patio.  It’s in a great location— a block from St. Stephen’s Green.  Rooms are quiet and lux. Prices reasonable. Restaurant food delish but a little pricey. Cocktails great but expensive. Overall terrific. ",5,2018,06,13
221,Lovely Hotel,"This is so sad that this gorgeous Georgian hotel can be spoilt by the noise from the  night club across the road till the early hours of the morning - so at the price be warned. 
The staff are friendly and helpful, the food in the restaurant is lovely and the breakfast buffet is one of the best in our travels around the world. Not just filter coffee available but expresso if you wish. There is a relaxing bar and garden to drink or eat in. Breakfast lunch and dinner are available. The linen and rooms are excellent. 
Great location and easy walk into the city centre, St Stephens gardens, Trinity University, the Light Rail and the Hop On Hop Off Bus. 
But⚠️ this Hotel is opposite the famous Copper Face Jacks famous nightclub.  It was very warm in Dublin so with no AC we couldn’t shut the windows. Jet lag and no AC and loud thumping music spoilt this stay! 
Stay in the Winter and ask for a room at the back of the hotel and you will have a great stay.

",4,2018,06,12
221,Not ideal,"I travelled over from Australia to introduce friends to the city - not a warm welcome and found the staff (specifically in the bar area) to be extremely rude and argumentative. The type of service you would expect from a budget hotel. No Irish, friendly staff and doesn’t seem to be a “customer focused” business. Very disappointed",1,2018,06,10
221,Customer care first ,"We stayed at this new hotel for 2 nights.
In walking distance to the center of town is a very charming hotel.
We appreciate the courtesy and attention of Management, in particular Mr. Acquafredda and Mr. O’Sullivan for taking care of our stay. We will be back!",5,2018,06,09
221,Iveagh Garden Hotel,I have been travelling to Dublin for 50 years.  I have booked at many of the 4 star and B&B in Dublin over the years.  I stayed at the Iveagh Garden Hotel .five nights in May. My stay at t he Iveagh Garden Hotel was excellent and the service was excellent.  The room was quiet and I stayed on the Harcourt St. side of the hotel.  The triple glazed windows made my room very quiet.  The service was excellent and very helpful.  I also ate in the restaurant two nights and both meals were very good to excellent.  I had the duck and the hake dishes both were very tasty and perfectly cooked.  I enjoyed my stay at the Iveagh Garden Hotel.,5,2018,06,07
221,new hotel,"After reading the mixed reviews, we  were undecided about staying here.  It worked for us.  We requested an early check-in and quiet location and received both.  The room overlooked the mechanicals at the back of the hotel.  While not a beautiful view, it was a quiet a room.  The room was very clean and the mattress felt great to us-nice and firm.  
Several people write about a/c issues.  Our room wasn't cooling well and we reported it.  Someone came and reset something and that helped.  The room was never as cool as we wanted but it was not hot.  
We don't know that we would stay here again.  The reason being, it isn't a ""bad"" location but is isn't a ""good"" location for us.  While not a long walk to Grafton, Trinity,  etc, it was not close.  Same situation with restaurants etc, not far but not nearby.  
Lastly, breakfast was included in our rate and we thought it was good and a nice start to each day.",4,2018,06,07
221,One night in Dublin,"Great hotel for the price. Very convenient location to Grafton Street, St Stephen’s Green and a couple of nightspots across the road. Nice, clean, modern rooms and good sized bathrooms with rain shower. Breakfast was extra though. ",4,2018,06,06
221,Quick Dublin Visit,"At the beginning of May I had a group visit to Dublin and was fortunate to recieve a tip that the refurbished Iveagh Garden Hotel was worth a visit, A quick call procured rooms for all my group and it' was one of the best trips this year. The Hotel is very conveneintly place by St Steven's Square and is close to all. Food and service were a treat and everyone of the staff was making the effort to give us all that real Dublin Welcome. A must for a weekend break at a very reasonable price.",4,2018,06,06
221,Best chicken wings in Dublin,So myself and my husband stopped off for some lunch whilst in Dublin today and omg I'm so glad we did - Firstly the hotel is amazing with really funky decor and the hotel itself was unbelievably clean. The staff were extremely attentive and we didn't have to wait long for the food. I had the chicken wings and OMG they were unreal - i would even go as far in saying the best ive ever had whilst my husband had the burger which he said was delish only wish I had taken a picture of the food.,5,2018,06,04
221,Yikes,"Pros: The staff was cordial. The hotel bar was a pleasant place for a night cap.

CONS:
Cleanliness- The couple we were traveling with found 4 pairs of dirty women's underwear made in their bed. Very questionable whether or not the duvet was changed in between guests. And how could you miss 4 pairs of dirty underwear IN A BED? 

The toilet in our room leaked toilet water at the base. We had to place a towel around it to prevent us from stepping into toilet water in the bathroom.

AC- The hotel advertises there is an AC. The AC did not work (it was not user error). It was 25C in our room (over 75F degrees) for both nights we stayed. 

Noise- Our hotel rooms was on the side of the hotel where a club that runs to 4am blares loud club music. It started back at 11am with loud live music. 

Price for the experience- The hotel was 300 euros a night. I did not expect dirty underwear in a bed, a leaking toilet, very loud rooms, non-functioning AC for this price. Overall disappointed. The hotel was unable to move our room bc they were sold out. WAY overpriced for this stay. The breakfast in the morning was also terrible. We arrived at 9:30am to most of the food being depleted and nothing was refreshed.",2,2018,05,31
221,Plush hotel but reasonable price,"I really enjoyed my short stay at the Iveagh Hotel... Really nice staff, comfortable, clean and good sized rooms, easy walk to most tourist sites and good restaurants etc nearby. I've stayed in other places that are only slightly cheaper and the difference in quality is enormous, also prefer the location to the more budget accommodation area in the North.",5,2018,05,27
221,"Perfect hotel in Dublin ""just great""","Beautiful designed hotel in the heart of Dublin. Five minutes walking distance to St. Stephen's Green Park. Francesco, Ana, Sean & all the staff has been very helpful & had always a smile for us. The hotel is modern furnished & spacious rooms with huge bathrooms & cosy beds. At the breakfast you have a big choice of irish warm breakfast or fruit selections, cereals & pastries. The bar offers a big range of drinks, for special ones, is bartender Josh your man to ask. We highly recommend this place to be, thank you for your hospitality & kindness... Many regards, Melanie & Daniel ",5,2018,05,24
221,Boutique but full service hotel near St Stephen's Green,"Somewhat in the spirit of the Hoxton hotels, this place is very comfortable and stylish, with comfortable beds, and modern bathrooms with rainfall shower. My bedroom also had a nook with an armchair for reading. The varied breakfast with hot and cold options is a highlight. Buses from the airport drop off very nearby. 

It is relatively new, and should be higher up the rankings.",4,2018,05,23
221,Hotel was not worth the money we paid,"We chose the hotel due to the location and be ause it seemed to be pricey so must be worth it. How wrong we were. Yes it was beautiful and in a great location meaning near enough to town etc. but the money was not worth what we got. 
The staff were not really that friendly, the cleanliness was very poor indeed. We had to keep asking even for toilet paper! We also had to ask for sheets to be changed as after four days not even that was done. We ended up buying milk and sugar as they gave the minimum.
They never showed interest in what we were doing or how we were. When you pay over 200 pounds a night the least they can do is show interest in their clients.
We had a spacious room overlooking the road and you coukd still hear the night clubs music even with the windows closed.
The room temperature was very hot too.",3,2018,05,23
221,Beautiful Hotel,"Hotel itself is beautiful inside, very modern and lovely decor. Staff were accomadating and a pleasure to dea with. Rooms are quite small, and there is a bit of noise on the street at nighttime however its very central and close to most attractions in Dublin. Ive been in less expensive hotels with better experiences.",4,2018,05,23
221,"Great combo of quality location, staff, and accommodations","I'm guessing this hotel isn't showing up higher in the Dublin Hotels list since it's a newer addition to Dublin. Don't let that stop you! The location is really convenient - super close to St. Stephen's Green and easily accessible to down town. 

I didn't have issues with noise at all, but I could see how some might if their room faced the street. The hotel is beautiful and the staff were very friendly. I'd definitely stay here again.",4,2018,05,23
221,Perfect Location Beautiful Hotel,"We stayed here for a long weekend break, the hotel is modern and clean with great staff! 
It is about a 5min walk from St Stephens Green and the shops which was fantastic. It is also directly opposite a lot of restaurants and bars! 

Overall Perfect Stay! X",5,2018,05,23
221,Business trip ,"Hotel is located on Harcourt street so a stones throw from most areas of interest. The decor and layout of hotel is plush and rooms were spacious with all needs of a business traveller catered for . The staff were very friendly and attentive at the hotel bar , reception and breakfast.

Unfortunately given the proximity to Copper Face jacks a nights sleep was very difficult , I was woken up at 145 and there was constant noise from people outside until 430am. For business the next morning this was a major negative for me, I let me thoughts on the noise be known on check out , to which the reply was “that’s Harcourt street”, I beg to differ having stayed in other hotels in area however I appreciate having one of city’s most successful nightclubs across the road can’t help.

Again a lovely hotel , lovely staff but unfortunately not suitable for me for business stays due to lack of sleep.",3,2018,05,21
221,Terribly noisy and too expensive for what it is,"I make it short. I did not like this hotel. The access is not easy as the tram rails do not allow taxis to stop outside (1 way street). It's very expensive for what it is (I paid 300 EUR per night without breakfast). The rooms are average with the usual plastic looking wood, the same decoration as in every single hotel, soft bed.... But the worst is that you are right in front of nightclubs and the ""triple glazed"" windows don't do their name justice. I asked 3 different people at reception if I could please change the room but nobody got back to me; not by phone, not by email, not in person. Anyway it was not a good experience.",3,2018,05,19
221,An amazing hotel with friendly staff,"A stunning hotel with great rooms,excellent food,extremely friendly and helpful staff, the rooms were spotless,bathroom had all toiletries that you could need - highly recommend if you plan a stay in Dublin",5,2018,05,17
221,Visiting Daughter at Trinity College,"We loved our stay in Dublin the city was Beautiful our hotel was located just a short walk from Trinity College were our daughter is studying . The hotel was spotless the Staff was friendly and professional . the rooms were very nice the bathroom and infinity shower was a great way to start the day. after a day of sight seeing returned to hotel quick nap then a drink and appetizer in the hotel bar before heading out for dinner. Bar staff was great new our drinks after first day very friendly and full of pointers on were to go and what to see.
 Cant wait to go back and stay at the Iveagh Garden Hotel!",5,2018,05,17
221,250 Euro for room which feels like a nightclub,Title says it all.  Deafening music making sleep impossible. Scandalous price for such accommodation. You should be advised of this when booking and charged an appropriately lower fee. Will not stay here again.,1,2018,05,16
221,Too much noise... unsuitable for a hotel stay,"The noise from the nightclub across the street is deafening. It gave me temporary tinnitus! It is impossible to sleep through it. Better sound proofing is needed. 

Do not accept a room on the Harcourt Rd side, even on weeknights it is indescribably noisy due to the club and open rooftop bar directly across. The Iveagh Garden Hotel should not expect any guest to put up with such disturbance. Stop booking these rooms out until the noise issue has been resolved!

Though the hotel is well appointed and clean the noise issue is so extreme I would not recommend anyone stay here. There are more suitable locations in Dublin, which are also better priced. 

The local authorities really should be called to investigate the noise issue. It is hazardous. It feels like you are sleeping in the club itself.",1,2018,05,15
221,Beautiful hotel,"The Iveagh Garden Hotel is a lovely new hotel. The aesthetics are really quite pleasing. We definitely enjoyed our stay while there. The beds were super comfortable and the rain shower was ah-mazing! Our room had problems being too warm and the staff tried their best to remedy it, but the best trick was to open a window and have the fan run continuously. I would stay here again without hesitation (well, I might inquire about the A/C unit in the room). Great location and the staff were very accommodating.",4,2018,05,14
221,Great Location but overpriced hotel,"This is a lovely hotel, the doorman was chatty and really nice.  It’s also conveniently located as it is very close to a lot of interesting places.  However, I would say that this hotel is overpriced for what it offers.  
The room I stayed at was clean and well appointed but you have to close the window as it is right across a very busy night club however, once you close the window, the AC is not working properly and it can get really warm.  I would consider it a good hotel but for a hotel that charges €250 per night, you would expect a lot more so I’m a bit picky on the details.  I would expect that they would provide more than just the basic shampoo and soap as toiletries, they don’t even provide bathrobes or slippers in the room.  I also didn’t enjoy breakfast, options were not that great.  There were also no facilities that you can use (i.e. no gym).  
This is a good hotel but you tend to expect more considering how much they charge you.",3,2018,05,14
221,Fantastic Hotel,"Fantastic hotel, beautiful, immaculate, great location. My room looked over the street but it was quiet and very nicely decorated. Tall ceilings and comfortable bed. Safe and wonderful experience in a great city with so much to see and do. Its walking distance to many restaurants, parks and museums. Also fantastic night life at your door step. I took a taxi to the hotel from the airport but decided to take the shuttle back to the airport and it was so easy and simple and cheap. Around 7 euros. The staff were very helpful with directions and any information I needed. I would defiantly stay at the Iveagh again.",4,2018,05,12
221,"Convenient location, renovated, but slightly noisy","Visited Dublin at the end of April for a friend's wedding and stayed here for 3 nights. Check in was easy, especially as we arrived before midnight due to a delayed flight. The front desk was kind enough to order pizzas for us as well.

The hotel itself is newly renovated and the rooms were spacious and clean. The only issue was the slight hum and beat from the nightclubs on Harcourt St, even though we were towards the middle of the hotel. If you have children, do request a room towards the back where the noise is less on Friday/Saturdays. Also be careful of the footpath outside the hotel which was occasionally used as a urinal by the clubbers.

As we had a hire car, we parked it on the side street - note that you will have to pay using metered parking if you don't wish to park within the hotel. 

It's in a convenient location, walkable to St Stephen's Green, Temple Bar, shopping district. There's a tram stop close by which will take you to Imaginosity (kids museum).
For more info on 'things to do in Dublin with a toddler', Google my blog 'ABC Dad UK'.

We didn't sample the bar but it did look nice. There's no other amenities on site like a pool. For the price per night, you'd expect a little more, but nevertheless, it was a pleasant, comfortable stay and easy to get to.",4,2018,05,10
221,Not worth the price of the stay,We traveled to Dublin for 4 days. The pictures here make this hotel seem lavish and one of a kind. However to be honest it’s not. It’s rather over priced for the very few amenities it offers. While I am happy of the location we were at and the access to bikes to rent and walking distance to many things. I would look for hotels with better pricing. While the hotel may look nice it lacks many things. Let’s start with the fact it lacks AC. While it’s normally cold in Ireland the time we were here it was extremely warm. So coming back to and even warmer room was nasty. The rooms are rather small and basic. For 200 in other country’s we get pretty large rooms. There is no gym or pool. Checking in was ok and they were nice enough to allow us to check in a few hours early. However failed to call us and let us know this. But that’s not the issue. The male manager was rude as we were checking in our bags. He’s said we didn’t understand him when he asked us. Even though we stated we had checked in and just needed to drop our bags off. The room service is beyond expensive and we have stayed at numerous other top hotels such as the ritz and they didn’t charge as much. The male who dropped our food off said he was sorry it took so long cause it was a dumb American dish. He didn’t use the word dumb let’s put it that way. The food at the restaurant is way over priced. We literally walked across the street for food. The place across the street is labeled as top places to eat in Dublin. Sophia’s has amazing food so head over to the Dean. I would not recommend this hotel based on price and service. While they have WiFi it kept kicking us off over and over. Basically a high priced looking hotel with the service of a cheap one. I have stayed at hostels nicer then this with better service. Beds are fine and the bathroom is fine. But the price is they key point. It would be a great hotel based on its derives and size if it was like 120 a night. They do not offer the type of service and amenities to be charging what they do. It’s no Ritz it’s more of a nice motel six.,2,2018,05,08
221,Great location,Very easy access from the airport on the Airlink bus.  Walking distance to most of Dublin's attractions.  Beautifully decorated and very clean with a nice size room.  All hotel staff were very accommodating and helpful.  The beautiful Iveagh Gardens located behind the hotel is not to be missed.  I would highly recommend this hotel.,4,2018,05,07
221,Great Value,"Overall this is a great hotel at a steal of a price. The rooms are all new and the shower is excellent. Beds are comfortable and clean. Hotel itself is beautifully decorated and staff are friendly and helpful.

The only con, which other reviews alluded to, is there is a rooftop bar across the street which has crowds and music throughout the night. With the windows open you can hear them, but if you’re used to sleeping in a city it’s negligible. There is also a tram on rails that passes by, the noise from this is nothing beyond a car. However, if you close the windows in the room all outside sounds are blocked out 100% so I did not view it as a clear detriment to the rating.",5,2018,05,07
221,Inviting Iveagh Stay,"Had a great stay at the Iveagh Garden Hotel. 

Fantastic location-close to the beautiful Iveagh Garden Park, the pubs on Wexford Street and the shopping on Grafton St.

The art-deco furnishings and decor really impressed my wife, whilst the room was bright,airy and clean with a nice balcony.

The staff were courteous without being over bearing.

Breakfast was plentiful with a great range of options.

Negatives included a lack of chairs or tables on the balcony (had to carry a chair out), no bath (even though the rain shower was excellent) and no free car parking. 

When booking ask for a room at the back of the hotel as Harcourt St. is home to several niteclubs. 

Overall would highly recommend this hotel especially as it offers better value and service than some of the more established hotels around the Stephen’s Green area.",4,2018,05,06
221,Nice Hotel but....,"We stayed 2 nights at the hotel for a weekend away. The hotel and staff are nice but they are struggling with the basics. The hotel has been open since feb and this is the issue.  No one did a proper snag. The first room we were in looked lovely but the aircon didnt work nor some of the electrics.  The funniest thing  was the shower, it was so noisy it was like an airplane taking off.  They graciously offered us a breakfast on the house but again this fell well short. With the basics missing. After a discussion the general manager about the noise as well (we had to have the window open to keep cool) they offered a room move.  So we packed up and they moved us.  The next room was lovely and the aircon worked.  Now the next breakfast.  What a shambles. Again most of the condiments were missing and no butter.  The general manager delivered this but said it wasnt included because of regulations and we must state it when ordering.  What butter!!    They tried their best but they are far away from getting the basics right. ",2,2018,05,06
221,Beautiful modern Hotel,"My wife, daughter and myself stayed here for one night before travelling to Rome early in the morning. Great location, friendly check in and courteous staff. We would like to have had some more time here ie. for dinner/breakfast and drinks. The room itself was spacious with a great sized wet area in the bathroom although the table with chairs in the room had dirty glass marks, clearly not cleaned from previous occupant! The only other gripe I would have is the excessive noise that awoke us around 1am of music and people shouting and cheering. As we were located on the 3rd floor at the back of the hotel, and the nightclubs are facing the front, i couldn’t understand where it was coming from? Another couple we spoke to also had the same problem a few doors up from us, so this may be looked at hopefully? Aside from that it was a very pleasant stay, we just wished it could have been longer, would return again.",3,2018,05,03
221,"Great location, fantastic staff","A beautiful and elegant hotel, close to the city centre (10 minute walk). Near to St Stephens Green park which is stunning and well worth a potter around, and also very convenient for the airport shuttle bus (about a seven minute easy walk).
Our room on the first night was exceptionally noisy due to a club nearby - we spoke to the Sardinian chap who said he would relocate us the following evening. He did this the following day with no quibbles (I suspect noise ingress from nearby pubs is a big issue for them). We were moved to the 4th floor which was heavenly and quiet! This guy was in the perfect role to deal with issues - super friendly and personable. The concierge/door man was also very friendly and a thoroughly nice gent.
The hotel was spotless - a credit to the housekeeping team.
Comfortable beds.
Well appointed rooms and bathroom (shower only in out room)
Beautiful art deco style interior.
I can't comment on food as we ate elsewhere (try Sophie's opposite for fab views over Dublin frmom their rooftop bar).
Would definately stay again.",4,2018,05,03
221,Amazing Stay ,"This hotel has a stunning interior, very new and modern. Our room was gorgeous, the bed was unbelievably comfy. Bathroom was lovely with a great shower. Nice location with plenty of restaurants and café’s nearby. The staff were lovely, our check in was very quick, we’d also arrived early and they still managed to check us in which was great. Lovely man on the door who greeted us every time he saw us. The bar staff were also lovely. Would definitely stay again, one of our favorite hotels so far :)",5,2018,05,02
221,FIRST CLASS HOTEL ,We have just checked out of the nicest hotels we have ever had the pleasure to stay in . The staff are so friendly and nothing is too much trouble. Breakfast and rooms top class . Highly recommend this place . Location is great too . All in all . Brilliant. ,5,2018,05,01
221,Great location and pleasant surroundings,"I made my reservation just as the hotel was opening, which was quite lucky, it turns out. It was in a perfect location for my needs--close to the airport bus stop, a pleasant place to be in general, and it was a great place to start and end each day. I walked through St. Stephens Green each day, which was a highlight. The bed was very comfortable and most welcome after five long days out and about. Housekeeping did miss my room one day (not a huge problem--I had towels for the next morning), and the front desk was overwhelmed by checkouts on occasion. (Their system seemed slow and clunky, and should be streamlined.) One issue is that there are stairs to the front door and on the floor I stayed on, and I ended up having to hoist my suitcase up and down myself. I'm not precious about such things (after all, I took an airport shuttle bus, not a cab), but as a first and last impression--dragging a full sized bag up and down the stairs--it would have been nice to have help or a ramp available. I did eat one lunch on the restaurant patio, and it was quite pleasant. There are many other restaurants and bakeries nearby, so options abound. A more delicate topic: while I appreciate the attempt to be ""green,"" the unbleached, natural toilet and facial tissue they stock is pretty awful stuff. I've brought my own on some more rustic trips, and I would if I were to return. That said, I'd definitely stay again.",4,2018,04,29
221,Fantastic Stay in the heart of Dublin☘️.,"Myself an my partner were drawn to the Iveagh Garden hotel due to its modern appearance and proximity to all major tourist attractions. On arrival we were not disappointed. Arriving late at night it is quite apparent that it is situated on a road with many bars/nightclubs, however once stepped inside of the hotel you wouldn’t have known. Calm and Serene. The check in process was very professional and the gentleman behind the check in desk was very friendly and helpful even at 1am! The rooms have been decorated to a extremely high standard. Exactly what you need for a stay an extremely comfortable base. Amazing bed, comfortable pillows and all of your essentials at your fingertips. The only downside of our stay was that we were unable to sample the breakfast. Just like the rest of the hotel I’m sure it is served to an immaculate standard but for a cost of €19 per person we found it hard to justify. 
But overall a very pleasant experience and a hotel we would defiantly recommend if you’re going to stay in Dublin! ",5,2018,04,29
221,Great city location ,First time staying in this hotel after many years of visiting Dublin. Great location for those who want to stay central without paying huge prices like other city hotels. Rooms were nice and clean. Decor of the hotel was really nice. Hotel has a nice bar with great cocktails. All the staff were friendly and obliging. Ask for a room on the second floor or higher as there is a late bar across the street. ,4,2018,04,28
221,Satisfactory and super ,"One most convenient factor is the fact that I travelled to the hotel from the airport using a bus and disembarked at the last station which is a walking distance from the hotel. Arriving at 10am efforts were made to check me in and eventually was checked in at 12 noon. This is much earlier than the policy allows.
The hotel is also centrally located with a shopping mall nearby and a number of fine restaurants.
Sean is the gentleman that gives character to the hotel as he is the one I met first and gives excellent advice on almost anything about Dublin. Very friendly staff as exemplified by Sean. I can only fault the hotel on the lack of a proper business centre.
And its one of those hotels without umbrellas.
Otherwise its an excellent hotel very well priced. ",4,2018,04,27
221,Thursday Night Stay,"Stayed at this hotel on A Thursday night in early April. Check in went smoothly enough. The room was nicely decorated however some items were oddly laid out for example a lamp straight in front of the tv which had to be moved in order to watch the tv. Also the air conditioning would not work, no matter what was done to it it just kept getting hotter and hotter until I eventually managed to turn the unit off altogether. 
Nobody informed us where/when breakfast was so we had to call and check. We were also loudly interrupted by a fire alarm at 5am in the morning. When I mentioned it at reception they pretty much just shrugged their shoulders. Work is continuing on the hotel so expect plenty of noise from early morning until evening.
I am hoping these are mainly just teething problems but I can't see myself staying in this hotel again given the amount of alternative options nearby",3,2018,04,26
221,Luxury city location,"Let me start by saying this is an excellent luxury hotel - I thoroughly enjoyed my stay, however there are some reasons that I could only give it 4 stars rather than 5 which I will explain!

The hotel is newly opened, and in a great location, in fact, for city center you could not ask for better. It is a 5/10 minute walk from Grafton street, making pretty much everything sight-seeing wise within easy walking distance. We travelled on business, but had some free time also and even walked to Kilmainham gaol easily, which was approx 3km from the hotel. The hotel is located on Harcourt street which is a very beautiful street full of character, and constantly bustling. 
Check in was smooth, and everything on first impressions was fabulous, the doorman, the reception area, the decor. 
Our room was on the 5th floor, and although it was possibly on the small side, the decor was luxurious and impressive. 
We checked in on a Wednesday and we were extremely tired from the business travel we were doing , so I had a look at the information booklet in the room regarding breakfast. It stated that breakfast was served downstairs between 6.30-10am mon-friday, or alternatively you could have breakfast brought to the room by hanging a card showing your preferences on the door before 3am. I searched everywhere for the card to hang on the door but to no avail. So we got up early and went down for breakfast. That night I decided to ring about the card so that perhaps on thursday morning we could get breakfast to the room. When I called reception, the lady didnt seem to understand what I meant, so she sent a porter up to the room. He asked what I was looking for and once he understood he explained that they dont have those cards, but he would send breakfast up to us in the morning. However he left before asking what we wanted for breakfast! We got a call from reception asking if we both wanted full irish for breakfast, and he said perhaps it would be easier if we just went downstairs for breakfast. I agreed, as it seemed a bit of a mess to be honest and as if this was a service that isnt usually provided.
In summary, I feel all hotels Ive every stayed in provide room service, certainly for breakfast, and if this service isnt provided then the information booklet in the rooms saying so should be removed until such time as it is available.
The next issue we had is with housekeeping, there was complimentary water in the room on arrival, but after that it was never replenished, along with body cream etc, this was never replenished either.
I hope these are all teething problems as its newly opened , but I feel these issues should be resolved by now, it has been open long enough that these things shouldnt be occuring. 
My biggest concern for this hotel is noise. We specifially requested a quiet room in advance, stating the busy business trip. We were put on the 5th floor and our first night was perfect, however Thursday night was a bit of a disaster. There appears to be a nightclub right across from our room - but it still looks far enough away that you wouldnt expect noise to be an issue at all - I couldnt figure out which street it was - we  were at back of hotel so not facing onto Harcourt street where Coppers nightclub is located! The noise was incredibly loud, both of music and of people, it felt like being on a package holiday in Spain! 
Finally, parking is a slight issue that I think people should be made aware of on the website. Obviously due to the central location there is no parking, however a concession rate of 17.50 per 24 hours is available with Q Park Stephens Green - but people should be aware this is a ten minute walk. There is no set down area outside the hotel as the lane closest the entrance is a Luas tram line. Therefore, if you have large luggage this could be an issue. It wont effect most tourists as they'll probably arrive by taxi and there is taxi parking across the road.

I dont want this review to sound overly negative. Would I stay again? 100% yes, you cannot beat the location and it really is an upmarket luxury hotel at an absolute steal of a price by Dublin standards! I just feel some issues such as room service need to be addressed and people made aware of parking ten min walk away. 
I do worry about the noise issue on a thursday night from my 5th floor room.I feel bad for the hotel as this music is hardly their fault, but perhaps those rooms needed better glass...who knows. Also the fact I had specifically requested a quieter room, I got none of the badly needed sleep that night :-(
 I would love to stay again and try one of the superior rooms which face Harcourt street but boast triple glazed windows.

221,Exceptional luxury hotel,Excellent luxury hotel just south of St Stephen's Green and on the Luas line.  Stayed one night in triple room with friends.  All facilities excellent and staff very attentive and pleasant.  Would highly recommend.,5,2018,04,22
221,Bad customer care and issues with room,"My partner and I stayed for one night at this hotel and left quite disappointed. Although the hotel is decorated beautifully, there is no attention to detail and very little customer care. I had managed to book a 'romance' deal including prosecco, but on arrival to the room found both the TV remote and the prosecco missing, despite us checking in 2 hours after check in opened. Went down to reception and was told this would be fixed, with both items arriving about 5 minutes later. When booking, the hotel also boasts Netflix on all TVs, but we found there was no way to access this, and when I called to reception I was told that they knew nothing about this.

My partner went down to have a longer conversation about the above points and was met with an incredibly disinterested duty manager who seemed to imply that we had chanced our arm with the prosecco and hadn't paid for it, and also tried to say there was a way to access Netflix through screen mirroring (which only works for android phones and Netflix does not allow for screen mirroring anyway, so this was a bit silly). The manager said if my partner could show him the booking where it said prosecco was included he would give us free drinks at the bar to make up for the situation (though it still felt like he just didn't believe us). I forwarded on our booking to the manager (which clearly stated what was included) and heard nothing back, and when we were going to the bar later we were simply told he wasn't around - so much for trying to fix the situation.

We went to the bar and bistro anyway and found the service incredibly slow. To get anything we had to try multiple times to flag down waiters and then get up to go find them to order or pay. The service at breakfast the next morning was similar, I had to go over and ask for tea as no one came over and then had to go back to get the sugar and milk myself as none was offered. 

To add to things, by the time we got back to the room it was incredibly warm. Due to the location it's impossible to keep the windows open due to noise so we tried to turn on the AC unit, which in room 4112 is clearly broken. We tried every mode and it just kept blasting out hot air, increasing the temperature of the room to 28 degrees. The manager had informed another couple earlier that they could not be moved as the hotel was booked up (despite them complaining about being too close to kitchen noise), so we didn't feel there was anything that reception would be able to do. We left the window open and turned the unit off instead, hoping the noise wouldn't keep us up too long. 

Overall the hotel looks great but there is basically no customer care and many teething problems to be worked out.",2,2018,04,22
221,Very Good Option ,"Excellent location and friendly staff. Breakfast is very good and rooms are good (in terns of space) and clean. If you take a front room, you will notice the noise, but nothing that could cause a problem. Beautiful hotel in general.",5,2018,04,21
221,"Function room lovely, staff need to smile!",Attended a work party here recently in the function room down stairs. Was a lovely room for a party and great that there was a smoking area right beside the room and toilets so close too! Only problem was the Staff! They weren't very friendly seemed like they didn't want to be there at all! Finger food at the party was nice and we asked for a veg option and it was no problem! ,3,2018,04,19
221,"Location, Shower and Breakfast","The above mentioned were the high points for me. Breakfast buffet was lovely, with lots of fresh fruit and delicious granola. I loved the decor and the large bar and restaurant area. The rain shower was fabulous. ",5,2018,04,19
221,Birthday 60th.,A new hotel in Harcourt St. Dublin.A bright and large foyer.A very large bar area in a modern design.Friendly staff.Standard room with comfortable bed and the overhead shower was brilliant.Also the small light attached to the bedside light was a great idea. Housekeeping staff very attentive and helpful.A special word about Sean the concierge.As the first person you meet(provided he's not busy elsewhere!)his easy going and friendly personality is a crucial part of this hotels assets.,4,2018,04,18
221,Mediocre,"A very average hotel, surprised by 4 star rating. Expensive too. Staff don't seem to know what's going on, I was given inaccurate information on the city, and I was queried on two separate occasions whether I had paid for breakfast, I had, ten days in advance, rather embarrassing. They didn't have the ingredients for the one cocktail I wanted to try. Overall a totally mediocre hotel, but the worst aspect by a mile, was that there is no carpark, nearest available was a good ten minute walk away, my friend didn't have a bag with wheels, and the website doesn't make this clear. I certainly won't be back",3,2018,04,15
221,Great new city centre hotel. ,"This hotel is a great addition to the city. An elegant, “grown up” hotel with plush interiors. Staff were superb, and looked after me so well - always someone to help with luggage etc. Had dinner and breakfast which was also great, and was able to sit in the lobby and get work done in the evening without any interruption. Room was very spacious with an extremely comfortable bed and the shower was divine. This was a flying visit so would like to go back again for a weekend soon. ",5,2018,04,14
221,Perfect Hotel!,Trendy & cool hotel! Great location with great curb appeal! Folks were very nice and it had a nice place to eat off the lobby. Rooms were very nice and the value was about what we expected. We will be back! ,5,2018,04,14
221,Never again,"Horrible stay overall . Only person who smile was gentlemen at the door of the hotel .
When I checked in at reception no smile no hello he didn’t even bother to explain when is the lift to my room no help with my luggage no information about anything apart from WiFi passpord . Room was okay no minibar for some strange reason air con super loud  . Breakfast nothing special no tasty only had one breakfast decide to eat somewhere else even though I paid in advance for 4 days .
My third night hotel had grand opening  for the hotel lots of guest no invite for people who was already in the hotel  no warning we only had to deal with the loud music until 1 o’clock  in night . 
My check out was perfect finish for this unpleasant stay not even eye contact no thank you nothing nothing .
Overall I would not recommend this hotel to anyaneb.I also don’t wanna have typical apology from manager .",1,2018,04,12
221,Lovely hotel but not perfect ,"New & lovely hotel.  The deluxe room I had was spacious & beautifully decorated. However some tiny details could be improved.  The bed sheet felt 'rough' & bit pokey whereas the duvet cover was fine. There wasn't a convenient place to put the kettle even though the room was spacious as the plugs were not in the right place. On a positive note, they had usb sockets beside the bed & that was v useful.

Breakfast was OK but lunch was delicious. 

Overall good hotel to stay & was v convenient aa out was near the office.",4,2018,04,07
221,Lovely hotel!,"Couldn't fault the hotel. Great location. Arrived early due to flight times, staff were really helpful and friendly and let us go straight to our room. Mateo was also really helpful one night when we requested some extra tea and coffee. Couldn't hear any noise from the outside streets. Would definitely return!",5,2018,04,06
221,Easter break,"This hotel has only been opened for six weeks. We were met with a warm and  friendly concierge - Sean,  the booking in was very efficient and our room was perfect.
Very comfortable, clean and high standard. Our only slight criticism is in relation to the room cleaning service which was not made completely clear from the guidance available in our room.
There is a fabulous bar and restaurant although little information about choices of menu and prices are available. 
Over all a great experience and Sean should be recognised for the efforts he makes in promoting the local area and his enthusiasm. ",5,2018,04,05
221,Incredible new hotel in the heart of Dublin,"Everything about my stay at the hotel was excellent- the staff were polite and extremely efficient and helpful, the room was large and very clean. Great location for exploring Dublin with lots of restaurants nearby. The breakfast was delicious with a very large selection and everything you could want. I especially loved the large selection of fresh fruit! I would highly recommend this hotel for a visit to Dublin. ",5,2018,04,04
221,Bad start but then very nice stay!,"What we liked:
The hotel has a very great interiordesign and a perfect location. The Concierge - forgot the name :( - was super friendly and allways remebered us when coming back to the hotel. The Night Manager (Francesco) was a very awesome guy, he helped us a lot and it was allway a pleasure to return late to the hotel. He also really cared about our needs. And in General the Staff was nice and attentive at any time.

Problems we had:
We had to change the room twice due to super loud construction but the hotel manged the situation more or less perfect. There are huge differnces between roomsizes, our first room was more than twice as big as the last room we had to take. I understand that the hotel is not offering „Cash-Back“ but I recommend to do so in an emergency (like for paying a taxi) specially if I made a deposit of 150€. ",5,2018,04,03
221,"Stunning hotel, but not hitting the mark!","Attended a birthday party here last week in the bar. Lovely setting with great drinks menu. It came to paying our drinks bill for the last round, some drinks together and some not. The barman charged people for the wrong bills, it got very messy and he got very annoyed. Slamming the card machine on the bar etc. 

Then when walking down to the toilets, I got this awful smell of what we think was a dirty mop. For a newly opened place, that's not acceptable.

Stunning hotel, it's a shame to see it open in such a disorientated state. It will take a lot for me to return.",2,2018,04,03
221,Birthday stay in the city,"What a fantastic hotel!! My wife booked here for us & my parents for a birthday break in Dublin. The rooms we had were first class, a birthday treat was laid on upon  arrival(great touch) & the service and politeness of staff was second to none. Breakfast was first class, rooms were  clean and comfy. Great stay and will definitely be back again and again each time we go to Dublin. Others have written some ???? reviews on this hotel, we found nothing but first class all the way.",5,2018,04,02
221,Comfortable & Enjoyable Stay!,"We had the pleasure of staying 7 nights at the Iveagah Garden. Our flight arrived 6 hours before check-in, but the staff were able to arrange a room for us an hour after we arrived. The staff recommended we have breakfast at the restaurant, which was excellent. We ended up paying for breakfast the remainder of the week (15 Euros per person). 

Our room was modern, spacious and clean. The hotel bathroom was the highlight thanks to the rainfall shower. The location of the hotel is close to St. Stephan’s Green & Grafton Street. We pretty much walked everywhere around Dublin from our hotel. There is a taxi stand right outside the hotel. 

For airport transport, the Dublin express airport bus called Airlink drops you off right by the hotel (last stop). I highly recommend staying at Iveagah Garden Hotel. I visit Dublin frequently and will definitely be staying at the Iveagah Garden Hotel on our next trip.",5,2018,04,02
221,Noisy cramped room,"Having requested a ""quiet"" room following my reading of other reviews I ended up in a tiny cramped first floor room which was so exposed to the outside street that I could hear a conversation taking place on the ground floor outside (the windows were closed). I had to go to back to reception to request a quiet room and I was given another room on a higher floor which was normal size and quiet. I wrote to the hotel a couple of weeks ago before putting this review up but as I did not hear back they are obviously not interested in my experience.",3,2018,04,01
221,Great location and comfy rooms ,Just back from a two night midweek stay and have to say I’m very happy with the hotel. The rooms are spacious and extremely comfortable. Everything from the bottled water and magazine on the local cuisine showed a nice touch. The staff were nice and friendly which always helped. The location is ideal and within walking distance of Dublin centre. Will return ,4,2018,03,30
221,"Fantastic Staff, Good Location","Centrally located and well appointed, this hotel was very comfortable and pleasant. The staff are simply excellent, very helpful and very friendly. Comfortable beds and a really great shower too. I will be back again.",5,2018,03,29
221,Absolute fantastic...one of the best Hotels we've stayed at,"Booked a last minute city break to Dublin and found this little gem of a Hotel off St Stephens Green...perfect location...close to tram stop giving you  access to all of the ""touristy"" places..the staff were lovely, taking the time to get to know guests by their name...lovely touch..

Hotel was VERY clean...

Breakfast was first class...lots of variety, catering for everyone....

The airlink shuttle bus costs £6 euros return and stops 2 mins from the hotel..

Lots of places close by to eat at reasonable prices...can highly recommend the asian street food place called Neon on Camden street..beautiful food...

All in all a very positive review....would highly recommend",5,2018,03,29
221,Lovely hotel and a great location,"Myself and my partner stayed here for two nights in March. A great hotel in an excellent location. We were pleasantly surprised by the rooms, modern, fresh decor and tasteful style. The bed was huge, but a little too hard for my liking. The bathroom was very modern and clean and the shower is amazing!

We sampled the cocktails in the bar which has a great atmosphere. Try the Watermelon and Cucumber Martini - it'd delicious!

We really enjoyed the stay at this hotel, so much that we have just booked to return for two nights at the end of June and we are bring Mum too!

The only downside was an oversight from housekeeping who left a bottle of Astonish cleaning solution in the middle of the floor which was there when we returned after a day out. The room was nicely cleaned, but just not picked up the cleaning materials.",5,2018,03,28
221,"Bad Experience, Worse Customer Care.","We stayed at the Iveagh Garden Hotel on a Thursday and Friday night in February on a business trip prior to heading to a wedding on the Saturday.

The hotel itself is stunning and the location is great. This could have been an amazing stay had it not been for the events that followed.

We arrived on the Thursday and checked into our room. We immediately noticed the television didn't work and the room was freezing. We asked reception would it be possible to change but they said they were fully booked. We accepted this and headed out for the evening.

When we arrived back later that night, a pipe burst in the bathroom which caused the toilet to continuously flush with water streaming directly from the cistern and through the sanitaryware at an alarming rate. Fortunately and by chance, the porter happened to be dropping up a toothbrush to us just when this happened and told us to put towels down while they got the issue sorted. By the time they came back to the room, we were rushing to put all our belongings on the bed as there was an inch of water in the bathroom and the carpet was absolutely drenched.

Fortunately, we were able to move rooms despite the earlier confirmation that they were fully booked. However, it was late at night and with work the next morning, it was hassle we did not need. Further to this, we were disappointed to find the new room absolutely freezing too with the air conditioning just blowing cold air into the room. Again, the TV wasn't working in this room.

The next morning, the maid walked straight into to the room without knocking while we were undressed and getting ready for work. When my partner went to order a taxi from reception the next morning the woman at reception asked her for her room number. My partner did not remember what room we had been moved to and before she could explain, she was asked how she could not know her room number. This was in front of another couple who were checking in at the time and did not look too impressed at the ridicule my partner was being subjected to.

On the morning of the wedding, we realised that my partner's shoes had water damage to the toes and would not be wearable. This meant running to a cobblers and a dry cleaners that morning but neither could guarantee the shoes could be returned to their original condition. They now have been sent off to the manufacturer for re dying from ivory to black. Obviously, we had to buy new shoes on the day.

When this was all explained to the staff at reception, we were told that the room would be refunded and on account of the 'teething problems', we would be welcomed back for a free night stay with dinner to see the hotel in a better light. We were also told the shoes would be replaced.

That week I sent an email to confirm what was discussed at reception but received no response. We sent 5 emails without any response whatsoever. After multiple phonecalls in which we were assured we would be called back by the relevant staff member, we finally got an email from a gentleman called Ben confirming we would get the refund. We were asked for proof of purchase and photos of the shoes which we duly sent over. We heard no more from Ben despite further emails. 

Despite it being a beautiful hotel, it is massively let down by the management. I have never experienced such inconsiderate customer care from such a highly regarded hotel. It was a very unfortunate incident and on the night in question the night staff did the best they could to accommodate us. However, we would have appreciated an update on how things were progressing rather than having to constantly chase the hotel for responses. 

It appears that the promises made at check-out were purely to appease us without any intention of following through. This is incredibly unprofessional and I genuinely believe had we not been so persistent with the emails and phone calls, we would not have received the refund.  With regards the shoes, we will now have to pursue alternative means to get these replaced.",1,2018,03,27
221,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed here on a Saturday night, and it was truly a lovely experience. From the moment we checked in, to the moment we checked out, all our needs were catered for. Clearly new staff but all very keen to assist where possible, but this willingness to assist is very encouraging. The rooms are finished to a high standard and the shower was one of the best I have experienced. With the hotel being located on Harcourt street right in the middle of the liveliest streets in Dublin we thought noise would be a problem. However it was so quiet we weren’t sure whether we were the only people on the street!!. We had a few drinks in the bar and it had a lovely relaxed atmosphere. Overall a super hotel well located and superbly appointed. ",5,2018,03,26
221,No hot water,"At first we had trouble getting our booking, I had called and was told someone would call back the next day... This didn't happen. I emailed the hotel and a member of staff emailed me back and then rang me.. After we eventually got the booking done. I still received no confirmation this took a few days to sort out.. On arrival the hotel was beautiful and staff were very friendly. However after a long day seeing the sights we came back to have a shower and get a  good nites sleep.. We soon discovered we had no hot water. I rang reception and they quickly sent someone up to check it out. He was unable to do anything. They then rang to say they would us to another room, my partner said ""I hope we are getting an upgrade for this inconvenience"" and the porter said ""ur lucky to get this room we are moving you to"" I tried not to let this spoil our trip but we were not even offered as much as a free drink for our inconvenience, which for a hotel that's supposedly 4* this is very poor.I also didn't feel ""lucky"" to get another room as I'd paid €300 ""for a 2nute stay...  Also the TV didn't work in the room, but this is a minor matter as I wasn't there to watch television. Overall the hotel is a lovely place and I accept that there are things go wrong in any establishment but a small gesture can go along way and we certainly didn't receive any.",3,2018,03,25
221,Fantastic Staff and Great Location,"We booked at the Iveagh Garden Hotel for Friday 3/16/18 and Saturday 3/17/18, premium days for St. Patricks.   First of all, they changed our room from a King bed to a twin room, with no problem at all, and we really appreciated this.  However, in our twin room, the TV did not work, and Sean the Manager tried his best, but was unable to fix it.   There were no rooms to move us, but in a fantastic effort to make things right for us, Sean refunded 50% of our room cost for this inconvenience.  I felt this was more than fair, and I really appreciated it.  The next day, Sean relocated us to another twin room, with a working TV.

At the Iveagh, there is also Sean the Concierge, who was equally as fantastic as Sean the Manager.  Sean the Concierge, helped us book our day trips, and gave us invaluable information of where to eat and party after the St. Patrick's Day parade.  All his recommendations were spot on, and he was so helpful and kind.  Wonderful staff!

The Iveagh has a great location -- easy walking to night clubs, pubs, and plenty of restaurants.  A short walk a few blocks away is a nice shopping area.  This location was perfect for us as were able to walk to the Parade on St. Patricks Day.  The staff gave us a map with advice for the best viewing locations.  I would definitely stay at this hotel again.",5,2018,03,24

221,Best hotel in Dublin ,"Brand new hotel in Dublin city by the same owners of the Harcourt hotel but i have to say its one of the best hotel in the city. If you are here to experience Dublin night life, its the place to be. Harcourt st is the place everyone ends up on a night out (tourist head to temple bar) walking distance to St.Stephens green and Grafton. I can assure you the price is going to go up soon as its only 2 weeks since it opened its doors. 

Surprising enough for a hotel in the nightlife strip its quiet thanks to the double glazed windows. Beautiful interior and quality covers and towels. Great staff and location. 

The room i stayed had some teething problem, the airconditioning wasnt working and was attended to twice by the hotel staff and the night manager was kind enough to offer another room.

221,"Friendly staff, central location and beautiful new hotel!","The hotel is very new and has an excellent, central location, close to both St Stephens Green and Dublin city centre.

Stayed in a superiour room to the front of the property, which had a lovely high ceiling, very nice interiour and felt very unique and luxury. 

The staff are all extremely helpful and friendly.

The only thing to note is that rooms facing the main road will suffer from lots of loud music and drunk people singing and what not until the early morning (4AM in my case), as one of Dublin's most popular and apparently not very sound proof night clubs is just across the street. I recommend requesting a room to the back of the property.",4,2018,03,06
221,Snow March 2018,"Just back from a 2 night unplanned stay in Iveagh Garden Hotel after a cancelled flight to Amsterdam for a group of 12 ladies. 
Landing into Dublin city on a Red Alert weather warning was never going to be easy until we landed to Iveagh Garden Hotel. 
The care and compassion of staff was second to none from greeting at the door to bedroom staff.
Hotel decor was tasteful. Rooms were spacious and bedding to die for. Rain showers were top notch as with spacious bathroom. Lifts/stairs plentiful.
On our first night we booked in to the restaurant, it was very busy and understaffed, but unavoidable due to severe weather warning. Everyone did a fine job to serve us. Food was beautiful majority had 2-3 courses.
Breakfast was 1st class eventhough there were a few late stragglers (us) we were welcomed and served immediately. Selection galore and no pressure to leave. 
On our second night we had gained audience tickets to RTE Late Late Show which was cancelled last minute. John the manager had arranged for his son to transport us in a 4x4 due to taxi restrictions. Unfortunately we were cancelled last minute but John was quick to send his staff with a glass of bubbly to each of us to soften the blow, a warm welcomed gesture. 
Again another lovely night served in the bar, a bigger table pulled together to facilitate us.
We thank the staff that worked tirelessly to keep us guests happy particularly in the horrendous weather conditions. We appreciate the staff that had to stay overnight at the hotel to accommodate their guests.
We certainly as a group that love to travel annually will return to this beautiful hotel again.
Good luck with your venture! Keep up the hard work! ",5,2018,03,04
221,Booked here due to the snow,"We were a group of 12 ladies who were due to fly out to Amsterdam for the weekend but unfortunately our flight was cancelled. We then booked into this lovely hotel.
I must say that the staff is its greatest asset. They could not have been more friendly or professional, each one more pleasant than the next. We got last minute tickets to the Late Late show which got cancelled at the last minute. A big thank you to John, the manager, who had arranged for his son to take us as taxis were not reliable due to the weather. Where would you get this?
The hotel itself was so clean and the food was lovely. We had a lovely weekend despite our disappointment of not getting to Amsterdam. Thank you John and your staff.",5,2018,03,04
221,"Needs more attention to detail, don't expect a garden view. ","Unfortunately the name of this hotel is rather misleading as very few room have any view of the garden which is behind the hotel.
Most of the rooms appear to only have a view of the office blocks on either side.
The Deluxe rooms that we saw are very small.
The decor of the rooms needs improving, there are no pictures on the walls.
The bed was very comfortable and linen felt new as you would expect.
Having a rain water shower instead of a bath was very good. 
It's a pity they don't provide a dressing gown and slippers, at the rack rate they want to charge you would expect this.
The buffet breakfast was very good, a great selection.

Lobby area feels cluttered, no need for plastic plants these days, better to have none than plastic.
Reception area was very cluttered and messy when we arrived.

221,Great new address in Dublin,Just opened! Very graciously appointed rooms beautiful breakfast area. Sharp welcoming staff. Best wishes to this important new addition to Dublin’s vibrant hotel scene. Bar not yet sorted due to licensing. Should be as they say in Dublin « deadly »,5,2018,02,21
221,Fantastic ,"Beautiful new hotel, we had a great stay. Decor is stunning in the hotel and rooms are beautiful with lots of room (unexpected for city centre hotel). Bed extremely comfortable and no noise from street. Had Breakfast and lunch in hotel which were both delicious. Also had drinks in the bar before going out and staff were so friendly. Will definitely return to this wonderful hotel. ",5,2018,02,20
221,Fantastic stay in city centre,"Just back from a 1 night stay at hotel. Have nothing but good things to say about hotel. Check in was friendly and professional. The rooms are huge for a city centre hotel. On arrival in our room was a bag of goodies as it was the opening day of thw hotel which was very much appreciated. We had dinner in Elles restaurant, the steak is to die for and the duck fat chips are unbelievably good.
The breakfast has many great options and the staff are very helpful and friendly.
Would recommend this hotel without hesitation.",4,2018,02,18
221,Great stay,We stayed in the hotel Saturday night. The location is just ideal since it is only a five minute walk from St Stephens Green and Grafton Street. I loved the decor and the reception staff was very friendly and helpful.The room was really nice and big with a very comfortable bed and big tv.It was very well insulated so you couldnt hear the street noise at all.The bathroom was very spacious with a great rainfall shower.The breakfast buffet had a lot of choice including gluten free options.I really can't fault anything and would definitely stay in the hotel again.,5,2018,02,18
221,Last Day in Dublin,"The experience for me was not good, and possibly I will not objectively assess the hotel, when going towards the room you have to go down one floor, (I was told by mail), but when I entered my feeling was that it was a julo, and not because the bed was not good, nor the shower was not correct, but because there was only a window in the top, and I took that feeling, I had to climb in the bed to look out, there was a car stuck to the window and you could see that there was something under construction. I went to reception and told them my discomfort, and they told me that calm, that that area was not accessible by anyone, but the problem was not that, for me it was easier to look from the inside, than to see outside. I asked the receptionist to pay something else for another room, and it turns out that type of room are the only ones they have for people who go alone, “Pods”. I wonder who had the great idea to do that, besides down between the two toilets (male and female), there are the “pods”, plus I had to leave things on the floor because there was no room to leave them.I think that system is only good for people passing through, who just want to rest or in Japan that takes a lot and not for people on vacation, and who want to enjoy the light, and if it is possible to see the life of the city. At 07.00 the workers of the construction began their day, with which the rest ended. I also have to say, I slept well, that's not the problem. The room cost me 250€ for me is quite a lot, I was looking to take another room in another hotel, but it could not be. I thought this hotel was classier. The only positive part that I have left is that luckily it was only one night, because and if they had been more... I know bad because the staff that was very correct, and this obviously does not go against them, also serves as experience to ask for what I want in the future and if they can not offer it, decide what to do.",2,2024,09,07
221,On our next trip to Dublin we will stay at the Iveagh Garden Hotel,"First of all - it is a typical city hotel - that was the only drawback.

The rooms are big enough, the beds are comfortable, the service is courteous, the hotel and the rooms are clean, the location is excellent - just a few minutes' walk from Grafton Street and St. Stephens Green. The whole hotel has Irish charm with an appealing ambience, right down to the bar and the restaurant.",5,2024,05,19
221,Exceptional hotel.,"It is an exceptional hotel. I booked a triple room which turned out to be spacious and very comfortable. Very friendly staff. Full breakfast and can be taken outside. Unbeatable location, you can visit practically everything main in the city on foot. To repeat without a doubt.",5,2024,05,05
221,Holiday in Dublin,"We stayed for 8 nights and had a pretty good time. Abundant breakfast, cleanliness of the rooms quite good and friendly staff. Good price and location close to the center and clubs.",4,2024,02,22
221,What a night mare!,"The hotel is beautifully decorated, attractive, very clean and the lobby invites you to linger. Unfortunately, the location is not ideal. The tram passes right in front of the hotel and there is no way to drive up to unload your luggage. The rooms are quite small but nice. Unfortunately, we had a room facing the street and we couldn't sleep until 5 a.m. because of the bars and clubs nearby. It was a nightmare! Unfortunately, we were not informed of the precarious situation beforehand. In 40 years of traveling and visiting 35 countries, I have never experienced anything like this. Never again.",2,2023,09,30
221,schönes hotel nahe zentrum,"es hat alles gepasst. sehr reichhaltiges früstück. sauberes zimmer. freundliches personal. wir haben eine nacht hier übernachtet und waren zufrieden. wir waren mit dem auto unterwegs, geparkt habem wir in einer garage in der nähe.

221,Hotel molto carino vicinissimo a quasi tutto,"Abbiamo soggiornato una sola notte al nostro arrivo a Dublino prima di partire per un tour di 12 giorni
Personale gentilissimo la stanza  ci è stata data con largo anticipo.
Abbiamo avuto una camera basic ma con tutto l’occorrente per una sola notte . Piccola ma molto pulita con aria condizionata molto utile viste le temperature alte.
Purtroppo l‘hotel si trova in una zona molto trafficata e quindi rumorosa. 
Colazione ottima e completissima in un ambiente moderno con giardino coperto esterno .
Anche qui personale super attento .
Hotel da consigliare con ottimo rapporto prezzo/qualità offerta .",4,2023,06,17
221,Hotel encantador,Una hotel céntrico con un personal encantador. Estuvimos dos noches y nos encantó el trato que recibimos en todo momento. Reservamos dos habitaciones una con cama de matrimonio y la otra con dos camas individuales. La habitación con cama de matrimonio que nos dieron tenía tres cañas con lo cual bastante agobiante porque no son demasiado grandes. La habitación con dos camas aunque en la descripción de la habitación pone 28 m son mucho más pequeñas. Las habitaciones son acogedoras y con una bonita decoración. Los baños están fenomenal. Lo mejor del hotel aparte de la situación es la amabilidad de los recepcionistas que hicieron que pasásemos dos días muy agradables. El desayuno también está muy bien,5,2023,03,31
221,Dienstlich in Dublin,"Hotel und Service waren sehr gut, das Personal sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend, ohne aufdringlich zu sein oder zu wirken. Obwohl die Lage sehr zentral ist, wirkte die Umgebung nicht sonderlich vertrauenswürdig, dennoch ist das Hotel sehr zu empfehlen.",4,2023,03,08
221,Giorni a Dublino,"Struttura bella e accogliente. Qualità generalmente buona, attenzione verso gli ospiti standardizzata, senza nessuna reale per te colazione. Costo della colazione, usando non inclusa nel prezzo, variabile è incomprensibile. ",4,2022,12,09
221,Molto bello,"Abbiamo soggiornato in una camera tripla deluxe al secondo piano.
Camera non grandissima ma più che sufficiente per un weekend, bagno invece molto grande. Tutto pulitissimo, unico neo la mancanza di un frigobar, ma quotidianamente lasciavano in camera bottiglie di acqua nuove.
Tutto l’hotel è molto caratteristico, il personale gentile e molto attento alle esigenze dei bambini.
Colazione ottima e ottimo bar/ristornate.
Posizione perfetta, con nostro figlio (5anni) ci siamo sempre spostati a piedi.
Consigliato.",5,2022,12,07
221,Hotel bien ubicado y limpio,"El hotel esta bien ubicado. La habitación triple que reservamos era muy amplia, con tres camas individuales. La calefacción del hotel funciona muy bien, no pasamos frío en ningún momento. Igualmente el hotel estaba limpio. Lo único, que el taxi que nos gestionó el hotel para llevarnos devuelta al aeropuerto fue más caro de lo que nos indicaron. Gestionamos el taxi con el hotel porque nos dijeron que nos buscaban la opción más barata y que el coste del taxi estaría entre 21 y 30 euros, pero el taxista nos cobró 42.40 € (12 euros más que el precio máximo indicado por el hotel) ",4,2022,11,22
221,Centralissimo servizi da migliorare,"All'arrivo ci viene assegnata una camera dove l'aria condizionata era rappresentata da un condizionatore portatile tipo Pinguino posto a 30 cm. dal cuscino del letto. Problema poi risolto con cambio stanza anche se più piccola. Personale inesperto.  Camere senza frigobar.

221,Piccola delusione,"Il giudizio parzialmente negativo è riferito alla stanza. Posta al terzo piano, era caldissima è umida; il fan coil era rumorosissimo e di fatto inutilizzabile. Servizio discreto, lunga attesa per il check out. Discreta la colazione, mente molto carino è il garden dove è possibile usufruire di qualche momento di relax. Buona la posizione a mezz’ora a piedi dal centro. Prezzo elevato.",3,2022,08,27
221,"Sehr schönes, City nahes Hotel der gehobenen Klasse",Im Hotel- und Gastronomiebereich sauberes und anspruchsvolles Ambiente. Das reichlich vorhandene Servicepersonal ist super freundlich und hilfsbereit. Die Zimmer sind modern und von der Lage her ruhig. Etwas mehr Lüftungsmöglichkeit wäre wünschenswert. Insgesamt ist das Hotel sehr zu empfehlen.,5,2022,08,14

221,Una piacevole scoperta,"Preso questo hotel dopo che mi era stato consigliato. Che dire personale gentile, camere pulite e comode, bagno grande. Colazione buona, tranne un caffè un po' spento, ma nulla di imbevibile.
Che dire, altamente consigliato.

P.S. Buoni anche i cockatails!",5,2019,10,10
221,Business Trip,Perfekte Bewirtung und angenehme Bar. Service freundlich und mit irischem Charme. Das Guinness kann hier zelebriert werden. Das Preis/Leistungsverhältnis passt! Kann das Hotel weiter empfehlen hier sind Gäste gut aufgehoben.,5,2019,06,04
221,Un’ottima scelta per il nostro soggiorno a Dublino ,"Siamo stati all’iveagh garden per il nostro soggiorno a Dublino dopo una lunga ricerca. Abbiamo prenotato tre camere.
E stata la scelta giusta. 
L’hotel è situato a meno di 10’ a piedi dall’inizio del centro storico, defilato quindi dal caos che lo caratterizza, anche se comunque anche la zona non è delle più tranquilli, ma ciò la rende particolare e interessante per la sera. 
I servizi sono ottimi. La camera, in primis il bagno, è davvero confortevole, dotata di qualsiasi cosa, tra cui anche le prese usb a parete così da non aver necessità dell’adattatore. Unica mancanza è il frigo bar. 
La colazione è veramente spettacolare, sia il dolce che il salato soddisfano i palati più esigenti (come il mio). Uno spettacolo a tal riguardo sono le salsicce ed i pancakes. 
Per un soggiorno a Dublino mi sento di consigliare senza dubbio l’Iveagh!",5,2019,06,03
221,Pasqua a Dublino ,Una piacevole vacanza è fatta da tante cose e a Dublino quasi tutte eccellenti. L’hotel è una delle più importanti e Iveag Garden non pecca in nulla. Non è in pieno centro ma a piedi puoi raggiungerlo attraversando un piacevole parco. Nessuna economia sul personale per qualità e quantità. Stile moderno e accogliente in una struttura nuova e ben curata. ,5,2019,04,27
221,Schönes modernes Hotel,"Ich war drei Tage beruflich in Dublin. Das Hotel liegt zentral und ist gut zu erreichen. Parkplätze für PKW sind nicht verfügbar. 
Von außen eher unscheinbar aber die Innenausstattung sehr modern und gepflegt. 
Die Zimmer sind sauber ordentlich und ebenfalls modern eingerichtet. 
Die Zimmer zur Hauptstraße sind etwas lauter. Auch Partys auf der Straße sind hier gut hörbar (mehrere Clubs in unmittelbarer Nähe)

Das Frühstück (Buffett) ist sehr gut und für jeden Geschmack etwas dabei. Jedoch 19.50€ etwas zu teuer. ",4,2019,01,16
221,Tolles modernes Hotel im Herzen Dublins,"Das Hotel war sehr modern ausgestattet. Unser Zimmer war bereits vor 12:00 Uhr am Anreisetag für uns bezugsfertig. Zimmer war sehr sauber, das Bett sehr bequem. Das Personal war sehr freundlich und immer hilfsbereit. Das Restaurant und die Bar im Hotel sind ebenfalls hervorragend und der Preis der Qualität angemessen.
Im TV auf dem Zimmer waren nur wenige lokale Sender zu sehen. Ich hätte mir ein paar internationale oder globale Sender, vor allem ein paar News Channels gewünscht. Die Schallisolierung nach außen war quasi nicht vorhanden. Man hört viel vom Verkehr.",5,2019,01,06
221,Gutes Hotel in guter Lage ,"Lage:
5 - 10 Gehminuten vom Zentrum entfernt war für uns ideal. Alternativ wäre die Straßenbahnhaltestelle in unmittelbarer Nähe gewesen. Positiv fanden wir auch, dass die End-/Anfangshaltestelle des Flughafenbusses in 300 Meter Entfernung lag. Von den gegenüberliegenden Nachtclubs haben wir nichts mitbekommen, allerdings lagen unsere Zimmer auch nach hinten raus. Die Harcourt Street sowie die unmittelbare Parallelstrasse bietet (aus unserer Sicht noch eher als touristisch geprägte Innenstadtbereiche) Pubs und einfache kleine Imbisse, in denen das lokale Publikum unterwegs ist (was wir als positiv empfinden).

Eindruck im Allgemeinen 
Für uns eigentlich fast zu „klassisch“ (wir bevorzugen eher einen modernen Stil), gleichwohl stilvoll und in der Vorweihnachtszeit sehr opulent geschmückt.

Zimmer
Größe absolut ausreichend. Sauber und zweckmäßig. Das Badezimmer mit ebenerdiger Dusche war ausgezeichnet.

Frühstück 
Reichhaltig und qualitativ ordentlich.

Personal
Freundlich und hilfsbereit.",4,2018,12,10
221,Potential vorhanden,"Zentral gelegenes Hotel in Dublin nahe des Stephen‘s green mit direkter Anbindung an die Staßenbahn und 5 Gehminuten von einer hop on hop of Station sowie einer bekannten Einkaufstraße. Mehrere Nachclubs befinden sich in direkter Umgebung deshalb lieber Zimmer nach „hinten“ als zur Straße vorreservieren. 
Die Einrichtung ist modern und verbreitet ein angenehmes Ambiente. Das Personal (bis auf die sehr kühle und distanzierte gar genervte Rezeptionistin) sind freundlich. Das Zimmer ist komfortabel, modern und sauber. Die Betten bequem. Nur hatten wir Probleme mit der Zimmertemperatur welche sich nicht regeln ließ. 25 Grad sind zu warm und an Lüften war nicht zu denken (trotz 4 Stock) da das Zimmer über den Küchenentlüftung lag. Auf Nachfrage wurde die Lüftung ausgeschaltet. Die Temperatur blieb und die stickige Luft ebenfalls. Das Frühstück war gut leider muss für einen Espresso zusätzlich bezahlt werden und der Service ist zu langsam (abräumen und servieren)
Hotel mit ausbaufähigen Qualitäten",3,2018,11,06
221,Hotel muy bien situado,"Me gustó el hotel porque lo acababan de reformar, está nuevo. Muy amables y limpio
Muy céntrico, al lado de St. Stephen Green. En la zona hay muchos pubs y discotecas , pero realmente no se oía nada. Repetiría.

221,Finger Weg! Lärm ohne ende...,"Wenn Ihr Party machen wollt und das Geld aus dem Fenster schmeißen wollt, ist es super und könnt Ihr in dieses Hotel gehen. Wenn, Ihr aber mal eine Nacht Ruhe haben wollt vergesst es. Man hört die Musik von min 2 Nachtclubs in Zimmer. Es ist so laut das man nicht schlafen kann,. Ich störe mich nicht leicht an Lärm, da ich in vielen Ländern schon war, aber das war zu viel. Als ich angerufen habe um ein neues Zimmer zu bekommen, da man nicht schlafen konnte(Fenster waren alle zu), meinten die an der Rezeption ich hätte Pech sie sind ausgebucht. Ich habe meine Sachen gepackt und wollte auschecken, da ich an nächsten Tag ein wichtiges Meeting gehabt habe. Auf einmal ging es doch und einer von dieses Personal kam mit hoch. Er meinte auch das er gar nicht geht und viele Leute sich beschweren würden über den Lärm. Wir gingen in das andere Zimmer und sind beide Rückwärts wieder raus. Es stank so der maßen das mir die Galle hoch kam. Es war wohl das Klo kaputt (warum hat es keiner gemerkt?) im dritten Zimmer ging es dann. Man hörte zwar die Tram und am Tag kann man das Fenster nicht offen lassen, da es nach billig Frittierten essen stinkt. Neben diesem Zimmer ist auch eine Bar, die aber nicht so laut ist wie die Nachtclubs. Die Zimmer sind hellhörig man hört, alles. Das Geld ist es nicht wert. Ich würde nie wieder kommen und es ist eine Frechheit wie die Leute mit einem Umgehen. Selbst das Personal lästern in Flur über das Hotel. Es gibt in Dublin bessere Hotels, die günstiger sind und Professioneller. Einen Rabatt oder eine Entschuldigung gab es bis heute nicht.",1,2018,10,06
221,Muy cálido hotel boutique,"Nos tocó estar aquí en el último del tour en Irlanda.
El hotel se encuentra muy bien ubicado, en medio de la zona más refinada de la ciudad; a una cuadra de St Stephens Square y cerca de la zona más comercial de la ciudad. La calle es transitada y con actividad nocturna; tratar de evitar habitaciones que den a la calle.
Es un hotel que mantiene las líneas de los edificios victorianos, muy señorial.
La habitación resultó cómoda.
Atentos en la recepción y también con el desayuno; teníamos el vuelo temprano y nos dejaron entrar a desayunar antes del horario establecido para un domingo.
El único aspecto incómodo, es que el hotel se encuentra sobre una calle sobre la que pasa el tranvía; el vehículo debe estacionar enfrente o a la vuelta de la esquina, y luego subir unos escalones con las valijas.
Estadía muy corta pero con muy buenas sensaciones.",4,2018,09,27
221,BUENA OFERTA!!!,"Hacia poco que lo habian abierto y cogimos la oferta de la web del hotel. El mismo precio que booking.com pero con desayuno buffet incluido. El desayuno estaba bastante bien. El hotel muy bien decorado pero se notaban algunos fallos de acabados. Por ejemplo, un ruido continuo del cuarto de baño. El extractor no se paraba. Dimos parte a la recepción pero durante los 4 dias que estuvimos nadie lo arregló. He visto los precios en el mes de agosto y me he quedado horrorizado de lo caros que eran. Esta claro que la oferta que cogimos era por la nueva apertura. La zona era bastante tranquila porque tuvimos una habitacin que daba a la parte de atras, imagino que las de delante debian de sufrir los ruidos del Pub irlandes que habia delante y que cada noche veiamos lleno de gente esperando en la calle. A unos 10 minutos a pie llegabas al TEMPLE BAR, ojo no confundir con un BAR. Es el nombre del barrio donde tambien hay un pub que se llama así. Me llevé una muy grata impresion de Dublin, la gente super amable y cortes. Como nota graciosa cuando un autobus estaba circulando fuera de servicio en el letrero luminoso rezaba ""SORRY. OUT OF SERVICE""  ja ja ja ja. Me encantó ese detalle. He estado en Roma, Paris, Amsterdam y otras ciudades Europeas. Sin duda, a la que me iria a vivir es Dublin. ",4,2018,08,17
221,Soddisfatti,"La posizione centrale dell’albergo - vicino al Trinity College - è senza dubbio un buon motivo per soggiornarci. Le stanze sono pulite, sono dotate di diverse prese usb per ricaricare telefoni, ferro da stiro e tavola, fazzoletti di carta in camera da letto, Phon e la presa a tre buchi (nel caso non ce l’avestw). Lo staff è molto cordiale e disponibile. All’arrivo ci ha accolto un ragazzo italiano ( non ricordo il nome, ma ricordo che ci ha detto di essere sardo) che ci ha spiegato un po’ come muoverci, fornendoci la mappa della città e suggerendo le principali attrattive.  L’albergo dispone di Wi-Fi gratuita. 
Unica nota dolente l’aria condizionata che non funzionava bene (l’ultima notte non ha funzionato affatto) in giorni eccezionalmente caldi a Dublino. 
Inoltre, la nostra stanza si affacciava sulla via principale dove vi sono tre locali molto in voga che chiudono la mattina, quindi c’è un po’ di rumore. È preferibile prenotare stanze che si affacciano sull’altro lato. 
Nel complesso, comunque, un buon hotel!",3,2018,07,10
221,molto buono,"ho soggiornato 1 sola notte. l'albergo è stato ristrutturato recentemente. Le camere sono molto grandi e il bagno è bellissimo con una grande doccia. Sul lavandino c'era il miscelatore cosa rarissima nei paesi anglosassoni. Nel bagno rimaneva sempre accesa una leggera luce diffusa che ti permetteva di notte di non accendere l'interruttore. Nella camera oltre le tradizionali spine c'erano molte prese USB per caricare telefonini tabletr e power bank, Il personale era gentilissimo e qualcuno parlava italiano. La colazione era ottima e abbondante. E' in una posizione centrale. Forse l'unico difetto solo gli scalini da fare per entrare che con le valigie non è il massimo.",5,2018,06,29

221,Very friendly staff,"Wunderschönes Hotel mitten im Zentrum und doch hatte ich ein ruhiges Zimmer. Bei der Hinreise hatte ich meinen Aufenthalt im Westbury Hotel und wollte auf meiner Rückreise dieses neue Hotel ausprobieren. Weniger Sterne, aber das Iveagh Garden Hotel hat mir deutlich besser gefallen. Vor allem die Freundlichkeit des Personals hat mich positiv überzeugt. Dazu kommt eine wunderschöne Lobby, schöne Zimmer und ein wirklich gutes Frühstück bei dem es wirklich eine gute Auswahl gibt. 
Das Restaurant hat mich ebenfalls überzeugt. Das Essen war sehr gut.
Bemängeln kann ich wirklich nur, dass ich beim Frühstück teilweise gar nicht nach Kaffe gefragt wurde und ebenfalls auch kein nachschenken angeboten wurde. Hier muss man aktiv die Mitarbeiter ansprechen.
Top isst auch die Lage, einfach zu erreichen. Der Airport Shuttle fährt 3 Minuten Fussweg vom Hotel.",5,2018,06,12
