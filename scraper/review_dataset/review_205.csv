205,Wonderful stay! Highly suggest stopping by the whisky bar.,The stay was as expected. Wonderful. I had drinks at the whisky bar and being from the states I went with a Woodford Reserve. My bartender Safi pointed me in the right direction with a Yellow Spot 12 year instead. It was a great selection and I appreciate his input! Both him and Paolo were great behind the bar. If you are ever in Dublin I highly recommend staying at the Intercontinental and make sure to say hello to Safi and Paolo if they are behind the bar.,5,2024,10,18
205,Excellent three day stay in Dublin,"The room and bathroom were beautiful and well-appointed. The lobby, restaurant, hallways, and even the elevators were high-end and well-designed. Every aspect of the hotel had a very luxurious feel. I have paid over $1,000 a night for similar hotels in the EU. Excellent location with ample parking. Also close to bus and train stops if you want to travel that way. The restaurant was excellent. The separate breakfast area was top-notch. One of my best stays in the EU.",5,2024,10,16

205,Una experiencia extraordinaria,"I attended a birthday breakfast with a friend, where we enjoyed the delicious food offered by the buffet and à la carte breakfast. However, what made us feel most luxurious was the attention of the entire team during the time we were there. Above all, Anna gave us a pleasant experience and was attentive to all the details and needs! Congratulations to the waiters, as each food station remained full and clean throughout the morning.

I will come back! Obviously!",5,2024,10,15
205,Just Superb,"From start to finish our stay was absolutely superb. We were warmly welcomed by Gary at Reception. Our rooms was immaculate and very well appointed and all the extras you could wish for. Dinner was a treat and both the service and quality of food was exceptional. The real event for us was breakfast the following day; the array of choices especially the fresh fruits and juices and the hot buffet. My Wife had the omelette which was prepared at the buffet by the chef. The tear drop poached eggs stole the show for sure. We certainly can recommend the Intercontinental Hotel, Dublin to anyone who is looking for something grand and special. Well done to the Management and all the Staff. David and Aine.",5,2024,10,14
205,Great hotel,"Beautiful hotel, with very friendly staff. Our room was gorgeous, very clean and spacious. Bed slightly too firm for me but would probably suit others.

Such an enjoyable experience!",5,2024,10,08
205,"Warm, atmospheric and welcoming",We are lucky enough to stay here with work at least twice a year and it is undoubtedly one of the finest hotels in Ireland. The service is always five star - from checking in with the warm hospitable people in reception to departing. The lobby is always buzzing with atmosphere and equally the people there always make sure you have everything you need. The breakfast is excellent with a huge variety to suit all tastes.  The linen in the rooms is beyond luxurious & the rooms themselves are spotless. The intercontinental in Dublin is a prime example of what a busy five star hotel should be in every way. Thank you one and all! Looking forward already to our next stay!,5,2024,10,07
205,Where the dream comes true!!!,"This hotel is the perfect place to stay in Dublin! City center is very and the sea is only 15 min walking.
Amazing meeting rooms, fine dining and very quiet area.
Staff very kind and professional, comfortable bed and a wonderful spa experience.",5,2024,10,04
205,5* personified,I couldn't fault this hotel.  It is definitely 5* personified .My 5 yr old grandaughter and I stayed for one night recently and the manner in which both she and I were treated was second to none.  I would highly recommend staying here and I cannot wait for my next stayover.,5,2024,09,23
205,Overall good,The Hotel in Dublin had the best waiter named Thomas. He was amazing and very friendly. The rest of the staff was ok. The room was great. I was most impressed by Thomas. It’s people like him who make places away from home feel like home. I would visit again,5,2024,09,20
205,beautiful modern hotel,"Beautiful hotel - modern and luxurious.  Room service impressive - with a table (not just trays).  Some views were better than others, but hotel itself is beautiful and highly recommend.  Pool is small, but nice - also had some time restrictions of when kids can swim (which is a mixed bag, but understandable).",5,2024,09,13
205,The Best Experience!,"Everything was top notch, from the accommodations to the service to the food. I couldn't have had a better experience! The staff was so knowledgeable and helpful.

Thank you Vitoria & Bransley as well as the rest of Intercontinental team for making our stay in Ireland so wonderful.",5,2024,09,12
205,Intercontinental Dublin wonderful Experience!,The rooms were large and very nice. I loved the large bathroom with a separate nice large tub and very nice shower. The customer service was amazing. One of our friends needed an adapter and a sweet lady made several trips to find the right one. They go above and beyond. It is located in a very nice party of Dublin and the Dart is just a 5 minute walk.,5,2024,09,11
205,The perfect home away from home!!,"This hotel is wonderful!! An excellent location. An 8 minute walk gets you on the DART so that you can easily travel in any direction.

All of the staff, from housekeeping, to concierge, to wait staff and front desk staff, everyone was professional, friendly and ready to help us!

The breakfast at the restaurant was absolutely wonderful.

Super comfy bed and pillows.

We loved our stay here and when we return to Ireland again, we will definitely stay here!",5,2024,09,09
205,Fantastic Dublin Stay,"We stayed at the Intercontinental for our Park Lane incentive trip and there were several hundred of us. The staff was so accommodating to our big group & took care of all of our needs. Great rooms, great service and staff and enjoyed the breakfasts. We loved the location as well. I would definitely recommend staying here.",5,2024,09,09
205,Great place for a family visit,"Fantastic stay at the InterContinental in Dublin. The team at ICD made the trip so enjoyable - nothing was too much trouble, even for our kids. Really enjoyed the rooms, the food and the swimming pool. Concierge desk was fantastic to guide us around the city and book everything from taxis to restaurants. Highly recommend a stay here!",5,2024,09,02
205,5-star quality and service lies elsewhere,"We ended our week-long trip in Ireland with two nights at the Intercontinental Dublin. We intentionally chose the hotel for its quieter neighborhood and because it seemed well-suited for families. I’m also admittedly a bit of a germaphobe and am picky about hotels. As a result, I typically carefully look at reviews for high cleanliness ratings, newer refurbishments, etc. so that I can enjoy it and relax. Generally speaking, the reviews for this hotel fit the bill. 

I also have an Amex Platinum card, which I keep (given its steep annual fee) just for its travel benefits. Intercontinental Dublin is listed as part of the Hotel Collection on Amex Travel (so gives certain perks by booking through that platform), and the hotel provides the additional benefit of a 2-person breakfast per day if booked through Amex Travel. So I booked the hotel through the Amex Travel website.  

To the point of the review—the good:
- Rooms are spacious and were (pretty) well cleaned (see notes below)
- Very comfortable beds 
- Indoor swimming pool that kids can use (specified times only; no swim caps needed [some other hole pools on our trip required them], can use the hot tub [no other hotels on our trips allowed kids in the hot tub])
- Easily accessible car park in front of hotel with plenty of spaces available 
- Nice lobby and gardens
- Very quiet and cute neighborhood, but the City Centre walkable or easily accessible by taxi, bus, etc.
- Great afternoon tea, with very good service; my daughter has a tree nut allergy and they were also incredibly accommodating and cautious, which is very appreciated (especially when traveling abroad)

The average:
- The hotel spaces and rooms are starting to show their wear and tear (particularly the bathroom in the room—the sink was chipped in several places making it look dirty, the wallpaper was peeling, tile grout was discolored; worn carpets everywhere; the pool and hot tub tiles were chipped, worn, etc.)
- The bathtub had a spout and a separate shower head/handle, but only the shower head/handle worked (so not easy to fill up the bath for the kids).
- WiFi was free but sluggish 
- TV was nice but didn’t have smart options (Netflix, Hulu, etc. — the kids used their own Firestick) and not many channels. 

The bad — the service was really poor, which is disappointing.  Examples:
- There was an issue with the Amex booking not showing up as the Hotel Collection and, while it was admittedly Amex’s fault, the front desk manager at the time was super dismissive of the issue. I called Amex myself to clear up the confusion and Amex called the hotel to ask them to honor the benefits anyway, but the hotel declined because we’d “already checked in” (which could have been avoid if the manager wasn’t so initially dismissive). 
- We also had an issue with the shower drain being  backed up so that the shower floor was a pool of  standing water with other people’s hair bubbling up through the drain. We called right after we checked in around 5pm to get it cleared and they said there may not be anyone to service the drain until the next morning. When no one came by 12pm the next day, we called again; we left an hour later and someone eventually came to fix it, but it took almost 24 hours. 
- There were shards of glass in our carpet (there must have been a broken glass before we arrived) and my daughter cut her foot while walking barefoot (so not sure if they didn’t vacuum our room before we arrived…). They sent someone up to vacuum but no one really apologized or even acknowledged why that was an issue. 
- The area around the pool had trash all around it  — there were several half eaten apples lying around (it almost seemed like someone had an apple eating contest, lol), half drunk plastic water cups, and wet napkins. 

We had several lovely stays in other great hotels in Ireland (although, in fairness, they’re not in Dublin — but check out Mount Juliet or the Killarney Park!). The hospitality and service elsewhere really highlighted how poor the Intercontinental is doing on that front. Next time, I’ll look for a smaller hotel that seems to care about the experience of its guests.  I’d recommend giving the Intercontinental a pass.",3,2024,08,26
205,A magical stay,We simply love this hotel. The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful no matter how busy the hotel is. The rooms are wonderful and large and luxurious. The food is lovely with a really varied menu and there are also so many great restaurants in Ballsbridge within minutes walk. We stayed  here for the Dublin Horse Show which is a truly magical experience.,5,2024,08,24
205,Intercontinental Dublin in the Summer,"One of the best hotels you can find, with brilliant service from all departments and the best breakfast in Dublin. Great location and easy for travel into the City. Always great to stay here and enjoy the comfy rooms and leisure experiences.",5,2024,08,19
205,Super stay,"On our first visit to the Intercontinental we were pleasantly surprised with the friendliness of the staff and the efficiency of those at reception, the stunning rooms and super breakfast. Checkout was very easy. Will definitely be back.",5,2024,08,18
205,Great will visit again!!!,We arrived very late due to our flight delay but I was able to communicate with the hotel prior to my arrival to let them know and had everything sorted out which worked out great. I was always under the impression as an Ambassador member that they would automatically upgrade the rooms but that wasn't in the case nevertheless the rooms were great with a very nice welcome fruit plate and some still water. Breakfast was fantastic with plenty of choices and overall the restaurant the bar the people really do a pretty good job of keeping that place pretty active and a pleasure to visit.,5,2024,08,18
205,The perfect stay in Dublin,"That is one of the best hotel I have ever been. I travel alot for my job. Perfectly clean fantastic bed and the staff was very professional friendly and helpful. The name that I have to Underline are Jane, Fiona, Vittoria and Isaac you can see that they make their job with a real passione.
Well done.",5,2024,08,13
205,A truly 5 star experience with a special thanks to John Lynch,"We had an excellent experience at the Intercontinental in Dublin. We were upgraded to a suite which was spacious, clean and well stocked, with a wonderful view of the Dublin Mountains.  

A special thanks to John Lynch, who really made our stay, he was attentive and charming and encapsulated the high standards of that famous Irish hospitality. Looking forward to our next visit.",5,2024,08,13
205,Exceptional,"As a regular traveller to Dublin for business I have stayed in virtually all the 5 star establishments in town but this was my first stay in the intercontinental. On this occasion I was travelling with my husband and three year old daughter on the family package rate. We were thrilled from start to finish was our two night stay at the hotel. From the moment we arrived and were greeted by Jane the duty manager at reception, I had a very good feeling about the place. Jane was very warm, friendly and welcoming. We were staying in the junior suite which was absolutely fabulous - a large and extremely comfortable bedroom, luxurious bathroom with my favourite byredo amenities and a large lounge area with sofabed, perfect for our daughter. Our bedroom experience of eating in the lounge bar on three separate occasions was also excellent - service superb and the food delicious. Flawless stay - well be back!",5,2024,08,10
205,A real treat at the intercontinental Ballsbridge,"Our expectations were matched in every way- attentive and helpful staff, room that was more than luxurious and comfortable as well as being spotless and fine food be that breakfast lunch or dinner. No hesitation in recommending the hotel as excellent.",5,2024,08,10
205,The human factor makes this great hotel even greater.,"My wife and I have recently stayed at this hotel and had a wonderful experience. As many IC hotels I’ve stayed in my travels, this one sticks out as having a crew that makes you feel welcomed and listened to. They truly go out of their way to make you feel at home. It was a pleasure to be reminded how the human factor contributes so much to enjoy your stay at hotel, no matter how good it already is. Thanks to the nice people at the Dublin ICH !!!!",5,2024,08,07
205,Fabulous hotel with outstanding service,"We could not have asked for a better stay at the intercontinental hotel Dublin, the staff and service was exceptional. A special mention to Savio, who allowed us use of the conference room for a video presentation for my fathers birthday, you really did make our trip.",5,2024,08,06
205,An upscale retreat in Dublin!,"When was the last time you stepped into a hotel and they welcomed you by name.... before you even checked in?? That was our greeting when we rolled in exhausted and looking a fright after a long train ride at 10:30pm.  We had let them know we would be arriving late and they immediately made us feel welcome.

We had toured all over Ireland and then only planned to stay one night and then fly out the next day... but alas our flights to US were canceled and we had to extend by 2 more nights... They were more than accomidating and helpful in making sure we were cared for during our stay! Please book using the IHG website for points and other discounts. You would pay much more to stay in a comparable hotel in the states. About 12 minutes outside the city center, but easy in and out... about a 15 euro cab from Temple Bar. Don't sleep on the breakfast buffet! Will have you set for the day. Beds were super comfortable, thick warm down comforters/ duvets, thick and huge bath sheet towels, good pressure in the shower... with a door that covers the whole opening ( not those wild half doors in the shower stalls that are popular all over Europe) (How do they use them and not get the whole bathroom wet?) Our room had double sinks and a private toilet room! (bonus for keeping couples married!)
The grounds are lovely and the staff eager and willing to help solve any issue! 
We will absolutely stay here again. 

If you have a choice between staying at here and The Clayton -Ballsbridge... this is the clear winner.... (we stayed at both the same week on our tour).

Thanks to the front desk staff who recommended the Vintage Cocktail Club. (not to miss in town!)",5,2024,08,05
205,Unexpected luxury,"We had a superb experience at this lovely hotel. Although I had booked a family room (2 queen beds), we were surprised at check-in with a free upgrade to a massive 1-bedroom suite.  The suite was exceptional.  I was surprised again that the hotel staff had taken the time before we arrived to open the sofa bed, bring in a roll-away bed, and have both of these beds already made up with pillows, sheets, and comforters for immediate use.  There was a walk-in closet with plenty of space for dressing, as well as our 4 suitcases.  The marble bathroom had a lovely soaking tub as well as a shower, and the kids were giddy with all the free toiletries left for our use.  In fact, the kids enjoyed the suite so much, they didn't really want to go sightseeing in Dublin!  We also tried the Lobby Lounge restaurant and had a lovely meal.  I have stayed at IC's in numerous cities in the continental US, and although I have always had nice rooms, I was pretty much blown-away by this luxurious experience, and very much appreciated the extra care and pampering we received.  Would recommend with 5 stars.",5,2024,08,05
205,Luxury!,"Bed and pillows soft and comfy. Daniele Orlinsa at front desk went out of her way to make our stay a true holiday. Breakfast was delicious and dining staff / room service were also attentive and friendly, as was concierge and bellhops! Will definitely return!",5,2024,08,03
205,Surprisingly good!,"In my recent trip to Dublin, I stayed in the Intercontinental Dublin. I have to say when I look at the facade of the building, I thought this was actually built more than 100 years ago, as it looks classic British old buildings, but I was wrong, it was actually built in 2001 and was originally four seasons hotel’s property. IHG has since taken over the property in 2015 and had rebranded this hotel as Intercontinental. 

The moment that I stepped into this hotel, I was really impressed by the opulence of the lobby. Although the lobby does not have a high ceiling, the design has successfully created elegance in a subtle and dignified way, And the lobby lounge continues to exude such kind of elegance. Not only was it a cosy and spacious, the Garden Terrace allowed lots of sunlight into the lounge, and is also a very good place to have some afternoon tea. This is one of the best afternoon tea that I had since I stayed at the Langham Hotel last year, and the highlight of this afternoon tea is the original and raisin scone, both of which are baked fluffy and warm. Even better are their homemade clotted cream and strawberry and apple spread, the former of which is creamy and tasty, while the latter are made from fresh fruit and is a winner both in the texture and taste department. As for the rest of the set, while the sandwich is typical British afternoon tea and the desserts standard affair, I do think their taste is better than an average five star hotel, although not as creative as the one that I have at Langham. For tea, I have ordered the house blend Assam tea, interestingly it was a little bit fruity and tastes more like earl grey tea, but otherwise it is quite good.

For the room, I have to say it is one of the best that I have stayed in years. I am actually quite disappointed in the design of Bulgari London when I stayed there in Feb, as the abundance of wood used in the room had actually made it looked dated. This room, although still had a few wood furniture, successfully created a sense of opulence that matched the ambience of its lobby.  It is also spacious with workstation and mini sofa included. During my stay in this hotel, I had in-room dining on a few days, and I have to say sometimes I prefer dining in my room than in the lobby lounge, as the relatively low ceiling of the lounge means that it’s quite noisy when there were kids running around. 

As for the bathroom, it’s equally impressive. While they don’t use as much white marble stones as the ones like Langham and Park Hyatt, It is still elegant without being too over the top. It is also well equipped with both shower and bathroom. As for bathroom amenities, Byredo was used across every Intercontinental hotel, and needless to say it is one of the best branded toiletries used by international hotels.

For gym and swimming pool, the gym in this hotel is spacious, well equipped with weight training machines, dumbbell and treadmill. All the equipment is new and well maintained. As for the swimming pool, it is beautifully designed with cues similar to hotels such as Park Hyatt Melbourne and Bulgari London. It is heated and you can also soaked in the jacuzzi attached to it. 

For breakfast, it is a buffet style one and there is plenty of food choice such as cold cut, fruit, eggs and sausage and pastry. All of them taste good and reminds of the ones that I had at St Regis Singapore. You can also order a la carte like egg Benedict at an extra cost. Also the coffee they served is quite impressive, unlike many major five star hotels that are made with mediocre coffee machines. The lunch and dinner that I had at the lobby lounge was nevertheless not as impressive. Mind you, I didn’t say it was not good, but none of them are as good as the ones that I had at Intercontinental O2 hotel in London. Also in terms of variety, choices are relatively limited. For example, this lamb rumb and pan seared Atlantic Cod looks quite similar to the ones that I have at Fairmont Monte Carlo, which I think is a bit overcooked and sauce a bit too thick. For the Cod fish, I think it’s a bit dry. The only exception is this pasta of the day, which is Rigatoni in Green sauce. It tastes fresh and green sauce is well cooked.  Surprisingly their in room dining is much better at serving comfort food like this club sandwich, this caesar salad and soup of the day, and with price just half of the ones served at the lobby lounge, I would recommend this to anyone.

Overall, my stay at Intercontinental Dublin is really impressive, whether it’s the overall service, or the quality of the rooms, it has lived up to Intercontinental hotels’ standard. Coupled with the fact that it is located in the posh area of embassies its proximity to CBD and it’s easy access to public transport like Dart train and Buses, I would recommend this hotel to anyone in a heartbeat.",5,2024,08,02
205,Gem of a hotel in Dublin,"We had an excellent experience at Intercontinental Dublin hotel. The property is beautiful, the building and grounds are gorgeous and the rooms are spacious and elegant. The customer service is amazing. The breakfast buffet is delicious and the food overall is great. It’s located very close to the metro station so it’s easy to get everywhere walking or by metro and there are always taxis available at the front. And the hotel was able to book a tour for us too! The neighbourhood is very nice and peaceful.  Overall was a wonderful experience, will definitely stay here again on my next trip to this beautiful city.",5,2024,07,31
205,Great stay in Dublin,One of the nicest hotels I’ve stayed in in Dublin. The front porter was simply charming. A real credit to the place. Amazing!!! Couldn’t do enough .

205,Very Pleasant Stay,"The intercontinental Dublin is a great hotel lovely decor, the staff were very welcoming and the food was great. The only thing that slightly let me down was the change in room where we couldn't get two beds as originally booked. Upon arrival we were told that we had a room upgrade, which was great. However, it didn't have the two double beds as we originally booked. They did offer to put another bed in the room however, it was a very small single bed.   I wish they would have mentioned that the upgrade was one bed and not two beds we originally booked. There was also chocolate left on the floor in the room and hair in the shower. Other than that the stay was very pleasant and I would  stay here again.",4,2024,07,21
205,Wonderful hotel,"Wonderful hotel! Junior suite was perfect for my family of four - spacious and well-appointed, with super comfortable beds. Highly recommend this hotel and can't wait to return. Breakfast was delightful and the gym was great. We didn't want to leave!",5,2024,07,15

Staff are so professional. It just oozes class. Well done. We’ll be back.",5,2024,07,12
205,Another fantastic stay with the family.,"As always another fantastic stay at the Intercontinental.

It was a busy weekend and as always the staff could not be better everyone is so friendly, helpful and accommodating even when things are at full capacity any request is met with a smile nothing is a problem.

It was great to see and catch up with Maria in the lounge. Maria makes things look so easy, she is always smiling. Maria brings such a calming presence and nothing is ever a problem. Thank you Maria.

Danielle who coordinated everyone at breakfast. Danielle made allocating guests and getting tables ready look so straightforward (even when the hotel is a full capacity) and she never stopped. Thank you Danielle for the conversation and all the help you are a very talented young lady and great at your job.

Alex who we have met a number of times briefly he he such a pleasant young man and so professional. Alex is yet another member of the staff who is always, always smiling and he looked after us so well when we came back from the concert on Thursday night and dinner on Friday night.
Thank you Alex.

I was also delighted to hear that Alex has recently been promoted to assistant manager so clearly his talent, approach and handwork has not gone unnoticed. Well done Alex!

Additionally it was a delight to speak with some of the new staff that we met in the lounge, we met Paul who was first class and again nothing was a problem to Paul yet another member of the team that clearly takes pride in his work and is happy at his work. Thank you Paul for looking after us and checking in to make sure everything was right.

We also met Ines for the first time who again was fantastic and made such a fuss of the children. Ines was a delight to speak with her energy and how she goes about her work and takes time to speak with everyone was great to watch. Thank you Ines.

A special thanks to Sinead Doherty for arranging our booking and providing a very slick and professional service. Thank you Sinead.

And last but not least to Carla Kennedy you as always all the proactive work you do and attention to every detail. Your team are a credit to you and the hotel.

Thanks again from all the Clarke Family.",5,2024,07,07

205,5 Star pluss,I am not going to do a big review here but I will say once again that this is the best Hotel in Ireland. I have stayed in a lot of Hotels in Dublin but believe me the Intercontinental is on another level in every way.  The only issue I have with the Intercontinental Dublin is that it is regularly booked out but that again is down to the level of service and accommodation here,5,2024,06,28

205,Beautiful hotel,"This hotel is so fancy, we kinda felt like we didn’t belong. Haha. Everything about it was immaculate! We had a larger “family” room and it was gorgeous! Their breakfast buffet was 10/10 and the staff were always helpful and kind. There was nothing they could have done better.",5,2024,06,19
205,"Elegant hotel, but not pretentious","The Intercontinental Dublin was our final hotel before returning to the States after a long 7 day road trip throughout Ireland.  All staff were very friendly and accommodating.  Our room was ready for check-in earlier than expected, which was a huge plus since we just wanted to unwind prior to visiting the sites of Dublin.  Although the hotel is not in the main thoroughfare of Dublin, we actually enjoyed it since it was much quieter than staying in a city center area.  15 min cab, and you are in the hustle and bustle of Dublin if you choose to be.  All around, great stay, and I look forward to returning in the future.",5,2024,06,17
205,Exceptional Service and Unforgettable Stay at The Intercontinental Dublin,"We recently concluded our vacation with a stay at The Intercontinental Dublin, and it was truly the perfect ending to a fantastic trip. From the moment we arrived, we were welcomed with warmth and genuine hospitality, setting the tone for an exceptional experience.

Special recognition must go to Gary, John, and Valerie, whose outstanding customer service made our stay truly unforgettable. Gary's attentive and personalized approach ensured that all our needs were met, making us feel incredibly valued. Enhancing our Dublin experience with his local knowledge and friendly demeanor. His service at the front desk was both efficient and welcoming, making check-in and check-out a breeze. John and Valerie went above and beyond to provide assistance with me losing my glasses. The hotel itself is stunning, with beautifully appointed rooms that offer a perfect blend of luxury and comfort. The amenities are top-notch, and the dining options are exquisite, offering a culinary experience that is not to be missed.

The Intercontinental Dublin's attention to detail and commitment to guest satisfaction is evident in every aspect of the stay. The lush surroundings, elegant decor, and impeccable service make it a haven of tranquility and luxury.

Thank you, Gary, John, and Valerie, for making our stay at The Intercontinental Dublin an extraordinary experience. We highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin and look forward to returning in the future.",5,2024,06,17
205,Everyone Welcome and treated as a valuable guest,"It was another fantastic stay at the Intercontinental Dublin. Every need was catered for, even with two little grandchildren, who were treated as valued guests. We have been guests at the hotel previously and now have two grandchildren, and the staff and hotel made them welcome and comfortable, which meant we felt so relaxed and enjoyed every minute in the hotel. The food was first-class, and the staff, no matter how busy they were, always took the time to chat with us and ensure everything was okay. We enjoyed the swimming pool and treatments. Everything in the same venue meant we did not have to leave if we did not want to, yet we were only minutes from the centre of Dublin and could take a bus if we did not want to drive; the bus stop left us right outside the door. 
 Thank you all for making this such a relaxing break in such a friendly environment",5,2024,06,06

205,Lovely hotel but bed too hard!,"My wife and I had 4 nights at the Intercontinental. It’s a lovely hotel with the classic old charm feel about it. It’s warm and welcoming, the rooms large (we had a junior suite), and the restaurants inviting. 

We loved our room except the bed was rock hard and the pillows too soft. Seasons restaurant was where breakfast was held each morning. Service was efficient and warm, the food was excellent with lots of choice. 

The hotel is a 15 minute bus ride from the city centre.  Bus stop is a 2 minute stroll from the front door of the hotel. Grab a Leap card from the Spar convenience store, a 7 minute walk away, for the bus or pay with coins (no credit cards on the bus). In addition,,there are a variety of pubs and a good Thai restaurant a short stroll away. 

The gym was very good. Good selection of weights and cardio machines. 

We were disappointed we couldn’t get a booking for a spa treatment. We arrived on the Sunday to be told they were fully booked through the Friday. So book a treatment before you arrive or else you may not get in like us. 

Overall, we were very pleased with our stay and would happily return in the future.",4,2024,05,31
205,Passed the Tempur-Pedic Test!!,"The bed was outstanding.  I have a Tempur-Pedic at home and I did not miss a beat sleeping!!  The room service was great.  I had an American Bacon Cheeseburger with Fries, and I thought I was at home. Also, the price was more than fair.  The doorman was also great.  They helped me several times with a Uber, Taxi, and when I one to tryout the Bus and Train.",5,2024,05,31

Rooms were impeccable.
Food was delicious.
There was not a time in my stay that I did not feel like I was treated like royalty.
What more can you ask for?",5,2024,05,17
205,So friendly,"This is a beautiful hotel and property. It was so quiet and the staff was super friendly and smiled with each passing! Also, had great food in the hotel and within walking distance! I would recommend this to everyone! The views from our room were amazing!",5,2024,05,16

Faultless experience that takes me back to opulence of the Celtic Tiger.  Devastated that the Ice Bar wasn’t open but within walking distance of sunny Sandymount for a pleasant stroll and a pint. We’ll be back.",5,2024,05,15

My wife and I ordered room service and that food was great also. A big thank you to the hotel staff.,5,2024,05,14
205,A must stay location if you want a treat in Dublin.,Beautiful hotel with excellent amenities. The cleanliness and service were top class. Fantastic ambiance in the bar with a cocktail service to die for. Couldn’t rate it high enough and only a short ride from most local attractions. All staff members are very friendly and make you feel at home.,5,2024,05,10
205,Perfect Experience for First Trip to Europe!,"We stayed here on our first ever trip to Europe, and the bar has now been set quite high for future European travels! This hotel is stunning, with wonderful & attentive staff, and a nice quiet location. The bed is very comfortable, the pillows are perhaps a bit too soft (but that's likely just personal preference), and the bath towels are so huge, soft, and luxurious! The room is very large and has everything you could need or may have forgotten - a comb, hand soap, lotion, toothbrush, mouthwash, shaving kit, cotton swabs, etc., plus fresh (complimentary) bottles of water each day and Nespresso coffee machines. The room was at times a bit stuffy, but I do understand air conditioning in Europe isn't quite the same as air conditioning in the States. I also really appreciated that housekeeping was around all day, so if you weren't ready for a housekeeping visit early in the morning, they would come around later in the afternoon instead. 

The Whiskey Bar near the lobby has the best old fashioned I've ever had, and the courtyard is a perfect place to sit and relax on a nice afternoon. We took a stroll down the street to the heart of Ballsbridge neighborhood, and it was a nice short walk with a couple of pubs and restaurants. We also  walked around to explore the nearby Sandymount Beach & Aviva Stadium -- really beautiful, vibrant, safe neighborhoods! 

Not directly near the heart of Dublin city center, but the cabs seemed to be plentiful around the hotel for an easy mode of transportation throughout the city. Buses were in the area as well, but we didn't utilize those. 

All in all, a wonderful and memorable experience!",5,2024,05,09
205,Disappointed,"We have stayed in this hotel a few times over the years and I was disappointed with our stay on May 24.
Standards have slipped in my opinion. Nobody to take bags or car on arrival. Carried everything myself. Room service was expensive with moderate quality. Steam room in spa was out of action. No papers at Breakfast and hot food was not hot with poor quality coffee.
We were disappointed.
It still has comfortable beds and linen, if it wasn't for some show off starting his/her loud car at 8am on Sunday morning, we would have slept well.",3,2024,05,06
205,Outstanding service provided by Inis @ Lounge and Gary @ Reception,"Dear TripAdvisor,

I would like to commend the exceptional service I received at the Intercontinental Hotel during my stay on 02 May 2024. 

I would like to highlight the outstanding service provided by Inis, a waitress in the lounge, who hails from Argentina and has been working at the Intercontinental Hotel for two weeks. Her professionalism and warm hospitality added to the pleasant experience during my visit.

Additionally, I would like to express my gratitude to Gary at the reception for his exceptional customer service. His attentive nature was evident when he remembered me and even brought the room keys to our table as we arrived early and couldn't check in yet. Such personalized service truly made our stay memorable.

However, I would like to provide a small observation regarding the pricing of the smoked salmon for lunch, which I found to be quite expensive for the portion size.

Overall, my stay at the Intercontinental Hotel was delightful, thanks to the exceptional staff members like Inis and Gary who went above and beyond to ensure a wonderful experience.

Thank you for maintaining such high standards of service. 

Warm regards,",5,2024,05,05

 It was Easter so the decor reflected with great displays of Easter Bunnies etc. Adding to the Easter cheer!

The rooms are beautifully appointed and the InterContinental beds best we experience worldwide.

Dinner in the lobby lounge was delighful and we enjoyed playing guess the song with the piano player.
The beds and pillows we extraordinarily comfortable and being to regulate the room temperature was really helpful. 
The bathroom was glamorous and the kids delighted in the phone in the WC, to order room service whilst on the throne LOL!

Dinner in the lounge is first class a great place to relax.

Breakfast is fantastic and the service from Andre is exceptional again yet another member of staff that clearly enjoys and takes pride in his work.  Andre delivers exceptional customer service. 
I was impressed as we were leaving Andre took the time to make sure the girls had drinks for the journey, a genuinly nice person. 

Delightful to again see Maria in the restaurant taking the time to stop and chat and give recommendations from the menu she is a wonderful young lady. 

Maria is yet another employee at the hotel who clearly takes pride in her work and delivers a customer focused professional, and friendly service. Nothing is ever a problem for Maria she goes out of her way to make sure things are right. 

And finally when Carla Kennedy the assistant food and beverage director is working she is a delight to watch. 

I would sum Carla up by saying she is the best customer service focused person I have ever come across. 

Carla leaves nothing to chance. Nothing is ever a problem, she goes out of her way to make sure everything is perfect! Carla is approachable, friendly and fun and a real genuine young lady. 

We travel with young children and any requests we have Carla always makes sure that things are sorted for us. For this we are truly grateful! Thank you Carla. 

As a manager and leader I have a personal interest in Leadership. As I watched Carla taking the time to chat to all the customers and making the time to sit and have a conversation with an elderly man who was in dining alone it struck me how authentic a Leader Carla is. 
I see great things for Carla in her Career she is a real gem. 

My wife summed it up when she seen Carla was working by saying
 ""you know everything will be perfect when you see Carla working"". 

Because of the effort all of the staff make from the people planning our room that we never see but who do such a great job! to the people mentioned above this is why we come back to the hotel.

205,Awesome stay in Dublin!,"We had a wonderful stay!! We arrived late and “G” made sure we were happy with our room and assisted us with every detail for the week. 

Andre in the restaurant took very good care of us every morning. He is amazing!!

Valerie coordinated our tour to Cliffs of Moher and assisted with anything we needed. 

Definitely recommend this property.",5,2024,03,31
205,5 stars in every sense!,"A wonderful experience from booking to checkout — the Intercontinental is 5 star in every aspect. From the overall atmosphere, the delicious food and the cozy bar to the beautiful  rooms (the beds are incredibly comfortable!) to the ample amenities, we had another great stay. One thing that makes this hotel stand head and shoulders above others is the staff. Every single interaction was a positive one, kind, helpful and genuine. On this occasion two that really stood out for us were Gary — who checked us in and out and gave us lots of help in choosing somewhere for dinner; and Michael — kept the place secure overnight and was generous with his time. Both real exemplars of 5 star service!",5,2024,03,30
205,Top notch!,"Stayed there with friends before an engagement party in the city.  Fantastic hotel,  brilliant staff, amazing high quality experience. 
You get what you pay for, it was definitely worth the expense. 
Top notch!

205,Experience,"Very nice experience from beginning to end that is beautifully created by the team here at the Intercontinental. 

Upon check in, recognised as an IHG member with benefits upheld. Beautiful centre piece within the lobby by Orla Larkin made of chocolate captivating the spirit of Easter. 

Rooms very spacious and clean with all amenities readily available. Dental kit requested and a gentleman went the extra mile and took us shoe care kit, grooming kit and comb just incase we needed it. I did not get his name but lovely gentleman. Try the chocolate peanuts from mini fridge👌

Spa and leisure facilities are top notch and very easy to access. Robes are comfortable and very soft on skin.  

Upon checkout, Jane asked how everything was which as you can see from the above we both thoroughly enjoyed. Will be back again very soon!",5,2024,03,27
205,Wonderful Weekend in Dublin's fair city!,"Excellent hotel, friendly staff, very quick check-in.  The room was spotless, comfortable and we had lots of space.

205,Great breakfast and dining options!,"I had a very good stay. Very clean rooms & hotel. I loved the dining options at the hotel. Breakfast was great, I even got a recommendation from jazmyn for the blueberry pancakes which were super yummy. I also had lunch in the lobby lounge, and all staff were very attentive. Very nice to not have to leave the hotel for every meal.",5,2024,03,26
205,5 star with the warmest Irish welcome,"5star experience as usual. By far one of Dublins top hotels in terms of luxury & service. So lovely to see the same team year on year - this speaks volumes. We are very lucky to stay here with work & after a long day there is nothing quite like the beds here! Absolute luxury- we often say it’s like sleeping on a cloud. Breakfast is delicious, Danielle always looks after us - dinner was superb & can’t wait to return! Thank you once again.",5,2024,03,26
205,Excellent hotel in quiet area yet with easy access to the city centre,"Fantastic hotel and staff! The amazing Isaac and the other bellmen greeted us with smiles and laughter each time we returned from our outings. And they always made sure we had good guidance as we navigated in and out of the city. Rooms were lovely and comfortable and exceptionally clean. Restaurant staff were joyful and attentive, and the food was wonderful. We will for sure choose this hotel when we return to Dublin!",5,2024,03,25
205,Beautiful hotel.,"Myself and my boyfriend stayed for two nights in the hotel. The bedroom was spacious and very comfortable. We had breakfast both mornings and although there was plenty to choose from, we did notice the hot food (ie- sausages, bacon) was not overly hot. However the front door man Isaac was so welcoming, we came across him a number of times during our stay and he was always so friendly and took the time to chat to us and advise us of different hotel facilities. He really is a credit to the hotel. We will be back again.",4,2024,03,24
205,Old fashioned luxury and very relaxing,"Lovely hotel. Staff helpful, rooms are huge , bathroom has bath and shower and the food was amazing. Not keen on carpet in bedroom
 And was disappointed pool was closed . Little out of city centre but it was a haven of peace. Large car park and nice grounds",5,2024,03,23
205,First Class - Five Stars,"Emma, Pierce, Constantine, Jaqueline, front desk and bellman were fabulous. Our room was spruced up well each day and resupplied.

205,Beautiful finish to our stay in Ireland,"The hotel and rooms are beautifully appointed and the staff is amazing.  Gary was amazing checking us in and Davide superb taking care of us for drinks and snacks throughout our stay.   If you want to be a short distance from the city centre, this is the perfect location.",5,2024,03,18
205,Intercontinental Dublin Excellence,"This hotel is one of the nicest hotels in Dublin, if not the nicest. In fact, it is one of the best hotels  I have ever stayed in and I travel worldwide! 

The facilities are beautiful, very high end. Large bedrooms with roomy luxurious  baths, complete with robes and slippers! Talk about feeling pampered!!! No detail is forgotten! 
 
The beds  are so comfy and the linens and  pillows are the softest I have ever experienced. 

There are a good number and variety of great pubs and restaurants close by, within walking distance. The hotel restaurants are also very good and the breakfast buffet is delightful! 

 If that’s not enough, the Spa and indoor pool are just wonderful!  

In the nice weather, there’s a beautiful courtyard to relax  in with friends or a good book. 

Who could ask for more in an hotel!!! 

All that said, none of that begins to compare to the  staff.  One nicer than the next,  all greet me with smiles and kind words. Irish hospitality truly at its finest!!! 

Orlinsa, at the front desk is one who I feel I must recognize by name, she couldn’t be nicer, so genuinely kind and caring. She always greets me by name and makes sure I am comfortable with the room I am given.  A true welcome! A lovely person indeed. 

I highly recommend this hotel for a very relaxing and restorative stay the next time you are in Dublin.  You will not want to leave!",5,2024,03,17
205,Breakfast experience,"Our breakfast experience at Seasons Restaurant was nothing short of exceptional. The ambiance was inviting, the food was delicious and the service of the staff was excellent. The buffet had a lot of options, and the blueberry pancakes was our favorite. Highly recommended for anyone visiting Dublin",5,2024,03,15
205,Welcoming and restful stay,"Great stay and hotel including staff! B/fast was great and staff very welcoming. Always had a great night sleep. 
only one small blemish - ordered a toasted sandwich from room service and it was too toasted could hardly eat it. Should have sent it back but it was late, and rest was the priority. Having said that, my wife meal was perfect. 
Highly recommend and would go back!",4,2024,03,13
205,Lovely hotel but spas treatments are only average,"The hotel is lovely, food is excellent however on three occasions lately I've had very poor quality spa treatments from therapists who just seemed tired or did not have the strength to provide a decent massage. They give you a card beforehand to select the firmness level you want but don't ask at any stage if it's okay, presumably because they realise it's just not strong enough if you've chosen firm or moderate. The standard is far behind the likes of Druid's Glen or Powerscourt, I know they don't market themselves as a spa hotel per se but they certainly know how to charge and the treatments just aren't worth it. Such a pity given everything else about the hotel is great. Use the facilities here, the sauna is a proper sauna temperature (often not the case in hotels) but don't bother with the treatments.",3,2024,03,12
205,Afternoon Tea Perfection,"Went for Mother's day for afternoon tea and everything was absolutely outstanding.

My daughter has a dairy allergy and most places you have to not only remind them upon arrival, but check the items individually. Well, all I can say is the staff went above and beyond. They stated about the dairy allergy before I could, and went through all the items on the cake stand for my daughter specifically in her kids afternoon tea.

The traditional afternoon tea was fresh and tasty, with a huge range of teas to choose from and try as many as you wanted (be aware they give you a full teapot though!)

Although some might deem it a little expensive, for the standard of service and quality of food. I would highly recommend. 
I also want to give additional thanks to our server Paul,who provided amazing service while being friendly and taking care of us.",5,2024,03,10
205,Great family stay,"Great stay with my young family. Staff were very accommodating and friendly. Special mention to Gary on reception for his tips on getting into the city by train and his restaurant recommendations for the kids. Rooms were clean and very spacious, will be back!",4,2024,03,09
205,Luxurious hotel with outstanding staff.,"Stayed for 2 nights with friends & also tied in a work event in the RDS. Conveniently located next to the RDS. Dined in the restaurant on one evening which was superb, the cocktail menu is impressive! The staff at this hotel are always so friendly & extremely professional. Breakfast here is definitely a treat, a wide variety of options & the service staff are exemplary. 
The rooms are luxurious & absolutely immaculate. 
Looking forward to visiting this hotel again soon.",5,2024,03,08
205,Great hotel experience ,"My wife and I stayed 2 nights and had a wonderful experience at the Intercontinental Dublin. Our friends had recommended the hotel from their stay last year. From the time we checked in til check out, the service, food, and our room were all fabulous. Issac and Gary gave us excellent recommendations for things to do in the area. I do have to say the attention to detail at the hotel was second to none. We couldn't have asked for a better stay. Looking forward to coming back soon!",5,2024,03,08
205,"Exceptional hotel, faultless service and facilities","It is rare for me to visit an hotel (I spend upwards of 25 weeks a year traveling) and not find some fault. This was an exception. From the exceptionally helpful arrival (late evening - yet still immediately offered to help with my transport needs in the morning), the wonderfully clean and spacious room, discrete and unhurried service for dinner, a wonderful breakfast, and an efficient check-out. Everything was of the highest quality, the room products, the towels (I am very fussy about my towels!), the food, the knowledge of the barman in the Whisky Bar. It is simply the best hotel I have stayed in for many months.",5,2024,03,04
205,Second to none,"Wonderful recent stay. Every aspect of this hotel is of the highest standard. Couldn’t mention anything that needs improving. 
 
Staff very helpful and attentive and always a smile for everyone

The room was beautiful with 2 double beds. Bathroom was spacious with great shower.
The room had kettle, coffee machine. Safe TV mini bar. 
We went out for the day and on our return a bottle of champagne was waiting for us along with cookies and treats for the kids.
Breakfast was excellent with a great choice.

205,Romantic weekends don’t get any better than this 👍,"I am blessed to have stayed in very many fine hotels around the world and also here in Ireland . I rate this brief stay right up there among the finest if not the very very best . It was superb . From the moment we were greeted by the valet parking to the checkin experience to the food and ambience, it was super . The room itself was excellent , the bed gigantic and comfortable and the facilities exemplary.  The staff were trained so well but also had that lovely familiar feeling and were happy to chat and engage .   And the breakfast experience! Wow !   If nothing else , go for breakfast ! And then stay for the cocktails 🍸.     It’s a cracking hotel 🏨 well done to all the staff for making our weekend",5,2024,02,23
205,Amazing. Try this hotel !,"This is possibly my favorite hotel in the world. Definitely my favorite in Ireland. I always feel so relaxed here and comfortable. 

The staff here are wonderful. And customer service is always great. 

The beds comfy. I feel like I’m floating in a cloud. The spa is tranquil. And the room service food fresh. 

After a lovely sleep, the best part - breakfast…. Whatever I fancy, they have… I can’t complain at all. 

After a visit many years ago. I can’t help coming back for my Ireland trips. 

Sam at the spa , John on front desk. And Issac on concierge are always fantastic. As are most of the staff. 

Can’t wait to be back.

205,"Disgraceful, self-absorbed staff, way overpriced!!","Having paid 650 Euro for a one night stay to celebrate my engagement the whole evening was ruined by an incident which was managed so terribly by the staff. My fiancé and I ended getting stuck in the lift for circa 20 minutes. There was no way to communicate with staff from the lift. In the end, the lift was opened. The manager was amazingly unsympathetic with us, and we received no compensation. Disgraceful!!",1,2024,02,21
205,Friendly & Helpful,Wonderful hotel with very friendly and helpful staff. Rooms were clean and luxurious (if a little bit dated). The location is a bit removed from the madness of Temple Barr but still has some great things to see/eat/do within walking distance and public transport nearby.,4,2024,02,20
205,Amazing afternoon  tea,"Just had a beautiful afternoon tea experience the food was tasty with huge generous portions and the staff were amazing, so attentive and couldn’t do enough for us. Was special afternoon with family perfect girls day out!",5,2024,02,17
205,Wonderful hotel.,"Dublin Intercontinental is just a top hotel. Great location. Fabulous professional staff. All so well trained, welcoming and so willing to help. Lovely rooms. Well furnished and spotlessly clean.  Lovely breakfast. A lovely pool and leisure centre. I can’t recommend it enough. Great location close to central Dublin.",5,2024,02,13
205,Exceptional Hospitality Experience with Apple Jing Shen,"From the moment we met Apple, it was evident that she takes great pride in her role. Her dedication to providing a comprehensive and informative tour of the hotel was truly commendable. Apple went above and beyond to ensure that we not only understood the layout of the venue but also grasped the finer details that make it a standout choice for our corporate gathering.

What struck me most about Apple was her genuine passion. It was clear that she not only knew the ins and outs of the hotel but also had a deep understanding of the needs and expectations of her clients. 

Beyond her professional competence, Apple's friendly and approachable demeanor made the entire experience enjoyable. She took the time to connect with us on a personal level, making us feel not just like potential clients but valued guests. Her positive attitude and willingness to accommodate our specific requirements were truly appreciated. 10/10",5,2024,02,12
205,Lovely Dublin getaway,"When we visit Dublin we usually stay in town at a specific hotel. The Intercontinental was recommended so we decided to try it & it didn't disappoint. Our room was spacious, clean & well appointed; the common areas of the hotel beautiful. Staff were friendly & helpful. The nightly rate was exceptional & we loved Ballsbridge. We'll be back!",5,2024,02,09
205,1st Class,I really enjoyed my stay. Staff were 1st class as always. Attention to detail was second to none. The only place I would stay in Dublin. Breakfast was excellent and we dined in the lobby bar and again it was amazing as usual. I can’t wait to get back.,5,2024,02,07
205,Excellent hotel,"I arrived at 11am and was offered early checkin without even asking 
All the staff i encountered throughout my stay were excellent in every way. So helpful and pleasant. We also had dinner in lounge that evening. Service was top class and the food was delicious",5,2024,02,06
205,"Gorgeous hotel, and incredibly friendly staff","Our experience at the hotel was wonderful from start to finish. We’d taken a ridiculously early flight to Dublin so were exhausted when we arrived, and were able to check in early which was exactly what we needed, and so kind of the concierge. The bed was huge and ridiculously comfortable, and the bathroom was so luxurious. I had mentioned that we were celebrating our engagement and were surprised by a knock on the door and a delivery of some chocolates to celebrate. There was truly nothing we could have found fault with.",5,2024,02,05
205,A bit of luxury in Dublin,"This is a lovely hotel. Right next door to the RDS. A great place to explore the whole of Dublin and with relatively easy access to Dún Laoire. Expensive. But a great treat. Had dinner in the lounge. Five of us. Food was mixed if we are very honest. Two of our group loved it while one was non-plussed. And too many supplemental prices on the menu, for my liking, given the accommodation prices. They cater very well for allergies.  The room we stayed in was excellent and spacious. One of the most comfortable beds I have ever enjoyed in any hotel. Most of the staff were very engaging, attentive, courteous and friendly. One or two were more than a little cold. 
Parking cost €20 for the night.",4,2024,02,04
205,One of the best stays I have ever experienced!,"An incredible hotel, a very warm welcome on arrival, Gary on reception was amazing and gave us lots of options of what to look out for in Dublin ( amazing Pizza tip mate thank you!)

205,High end luxury hotel which treats guest like really valued customers/ people in a superb location. An oasis of peace,"Beautiful room, fabulous breakfast, relaxing bar with professional, friendly service. Wonderfully friendly, courteous helpful staff throughout the hotel. Superb location close to city. A really oasis of peace offering top quality facilities for both business and private visitors. Business guests can have productive surroundings geared to impress both clients and colleagues alike. Private guests can start the day with a sumptuous breakfast, relax in the reading room, be pampered in the spa, enjoy a pre dinner drink in the calming environs of the excellently stocked bar before enjoying the gastronomical delights of the dining room. 
After a long day in Dublin experience a well deserved night’s sleep in a beautiful appointed, spacious, comfortable bed room. One of my favourite hotels in the world.",5,2024,01,22
205,Nice room disappointing breakfast,"We stay in the hotel on Friday night. 
The room was lovely and we had a couple of great spa treatments. We also had a very nice lunch on Friday however on Saturday morning we went to breakfast and it was very disappointing. We arrived at breakfast a little after 9am and it looked like the food had been out for several hours. It was dry and had no tasted. Very poor from a 5 star hotel.",3,2024,01,22
205,Great weekend experience,"My wife and I enjoyed a relaxing experience last weekend at the InterContinental Dublin. The hotel was luxurious without the feeling of being over extravagant. The combination of great food, charming staff and comfortable surroundings made for a superb weekend. One we hope to repeat again soon.",5,2024,01,20
205,Excellence in Every Department,"I am a regular at the ICD so maybe my viewpoint may be slightly biased but in all my travels this is consistently the best IC hotel that I stay. My ambassador membership is always recognised at check-in with Gary always eager to assist with any requests. A true gent. My room was upgraded to a room with a balcony. A standard room here measures 42sq. metres, bigger than most other hotel's junior suites. The decor and comfort of the hotel is second to none with a wonderful warm glow of superb customer service shown in every department. My favourite event of the day is the not to be missed breakfast served in the Seasons dining room. With the ever excellent Andre at your side, the start of your day becomes a memorable occasion in itself. Andre is a marvellous ambassador for the IHG brand. 
Take my advice, stay here and you will really experience a proper five star IC hotel stay.",5,2024,01,13
205,Christmas Break with family,"Amazing stay as ever in the Intercontinental, Gary was fantastic at check in, so welcoming.  We didn’t leave the hotel for our stay, had a beautiful lunch in the ambience of the lobby lounge and had friends in that night there again for dinner.  Fantastic service and quality food.  The hotel was beautifully decorated and a beautiful place to spend some of the Christmas holiday time.  Our room was fabulous, beautiful linen, comfortable beds and lots of little extras.

205,Our favorite hotel in Dublin!!,"Best hotel in Dublin - staff are always friendly, and welcoming (particularly Jacqueline in restaurant). 
Bedrooms are very spacious, and bathrooms completely refurbished (since my last visit).
Spa, pool, and gym is a great area to relax and unwind and as my kids are older now they can avail - and my son loves the gym, and my daughter the pool.
Breakfast buffet is wonderful - selection is varied, and locally sourced, dining room is bright and spacious, with nice view to the courtyard. Lobby cafe/bar area is a great place to have a drink, coffee, lunch, and simply ‘people watch’!!
My Ambassador status was recognized with a great room upgrade and complimentary drinks.
We cannot wait for our return visits …….. Thank You Intercontinental Dublin Team (all of you!!)",5,2024,01,09

205,A superb Christmas sojourn.,"I recently stayed at The InterContinental Hotel Ballsbridge and was highly impressed by the fabulous service, which started with a genuinely warm welcome on arrival.
The guest bedrooms were cosy and spacious, the food was superb, and the professionalism of the entire team led by Nicky Logue all made for a delightfully memorable stay.  ",5,2024,01,07
205,Wonderful post-Christmas family stay,"We have stayed as a family at this hotel before and once again had a superb stay here. The interior, staff, room and food were all excellent and worthy of the 5* rating. The Christmas decorations were beautiful. 

From the moment we were greeted by concierge on arrival, to check in with the wonderful, friendly Gary, to each and every member of staff encountered, they were all professional yet friendly and superbly trained. Our room was well appointed and very clean, I really appreciated the amenities provided. 

We had breakfast each morning and meals/drinks in the lobby area. Everything was lovely and menu varied. 

I also visited the hair salon Blow during our stay and this was also a great, professional experience. 

We really enjoyed our family stay and hope to return  again soon.",5,2024,01,05
205,Overpriced and disappointing ,From the moment we arrived our experience was extremely disappointing. The lifts would not stop on our floor and no member of staff seemed to know where the stairs were. We were left standing at the bar for an hour waiting on a table despite having a reservation. The restaurant had run out of a number of options on the menu and the whole atmosphere was of chaos ,1,2024,01,04
205,"Beautiful, luxury hotel.","Beautiful, luxury hotel, located a short cab ride away from the city center. The room was spacious and well appointed.  Breakfast was good, as was the bar. There are a few restaurants within walking distance, but for everything else you want to see in the city, you will have to rely on cabs or mass transit. If you’re looking for a quiet location, this is it.",5,2024,01,03
205,Great Experience at the Intercontinental ,"Our favourite Dublin hotel. Our room was gorgeous with the comfiest bed, we ordered room service which absolutely incredible, better then most restaurants. The staff are always so o  and helpful. The pool is so relaxing.

205,A Christmas Cracker,"We just returned from another wonderful afternoon at this amazing 5 Star hotel.
Its the staff that make this hotel, all so professional, polite but most of all, they are all so switched on! The atmosphere you could bottle and sell, the food was gorgeous, as we decided to dine in the Lobby lounge - too lazy to leave our cozy comfy sofa... A cracking Christmas day out.",5,2023,12,29
205,5 star all the way,"We have just spent Christmas at the Intercontinental Hotel Dublin. We had a wonderful time  - the hotel is beautifully decorated, the rooms are large and extremely comfortable. Beds felt like we were sleeping on a cloud. The staff are so helpful and friendly. Breakfast was delicious and great selection of food.  We are looking forward to a return visit soon and also looking at staying at other IHG hotels as a result.  ",5,2023,12,28
205,A nice stay but needed a little attention to detail,"The staff team at this hotel are really great. Especially the restaurant and room teams who took care of the rooms daily. Check in was a bit chaotic though. We went for Christmas and though the rooms were lovely the hotel could make an effort to have some festive aspect reflected in the suites/ rooms not just the public areas. It was a bit disappointing not to be able to extend the celebratory athmosphere in one's room. Also, having to advise the restaurant on two iccasions why seating was unsuitable did cause unecessary distress given our circumstances. This was ammended as asked twice but caused us as a family to be upset twice when we were trying so hard to be our best despite our loss. None of this will stop us enjoying this lovely hotel again. Thank you",4,2023,12,28
205,Great hotel with lots of Dublin atmosphere! ,"Super staff, room was spotless, we had 2 junior suites for our family of 8, we didn't want for anything in our rooms.  Breakfast was buffet style with pancakes and omelettes fresh to order. We used the pool both days, plenty of vanity supplies to hand. Time restrictions in the pool for kids but suited us fine. 
We had a gorgeous stay at this hotel and would love to have the opportunity to visit again! ",5,2023,12,26
205,Delightful overnight stay,"I had an incredible overnight stay at the Intercontinental Hotel in Dublin. The ambiance, impeccable and friendly service, and attention to detail exceeded my expectations.The room was both stylish and comfortable and the bathroom a heaven of relaxation.

205,Fantastic stay - excellent staff ,5 star service from the moment I picked up the phone to make the reservation- Maryam and Sean were particularly excellent and went above and beyond - it’s the staff that make the luxury stay experience … 5 star ! ,5,2023,12,22
205,Disappointed,"Our annual Christmas trip to the hotel was very disappointing this year.

One staff member in particular was very rude which upset my wife.

We cannot understand why such a change has occurred at this hotel which in previous years was a joy to visit.",1,2023,12,20
205,Chic hotel with impeccable five star service ,"A wonderful chic hotel with elegant spacious rooms, large pool, cutting edge gym and outstanding Christmas decorations.
I’d like to thank the reception and cleaning teams in particular for shipping the AirPods that I forgetfully left in the bathrobe pockets back to my home address. Wow, what a service! A truly five star experience. Thank you so, so much for resolving even such almost impossible cases!   ",5,2023,12,17

205,It's all about the people,"We got married here and now return with our young children. The team watched over our kids like their own - Julia and Jackie in the dining room became their best friends, finding missing checker pieces and looking after us all with great attention . Out front Gary & Isaac manage the comings and goings with expertise and warmth.  The rooms and facilities are 5 stars, the team 6 stars.  ",5,2023,12,12
205,Couldn't fault it - special experience ,"Stayed for one night for a special occasion.  Car park was full so a gem of a doorman held my keys and parked it later for me and dropped my keys back later to the room. Such service. 
Got a suite and it was huge - much bigger than city centre offerings as its just outside the city . Room had just recently been (mostly) refurbed so was spotless and luxurious. Pool is great for kids as they can use the large jacuzzi. 
Special mention to Ruben in the bar. Best waiter we've had in ages - so effortlessly competent and a great asset to the hotel. 

Usually go to the Shelbourne every December but this will be the first port of call now providing they can keep providing attractive offers.",5,2023,12,07
205,Congratulations to the whole team of Intercontinental Dublin,"Congratulations to the whole team of Intercontinental Dublin, especially their Director of food and beverage, for their high  professionalism, attention and kindness.

205,Fantastic food and service in a hotel that inspires that Christmas spirit,"The team at the hotel are outstanding and I was made to very extremely welcome and can't fault my experience throughout my 2 day stay.
You have to make the time to enjoy the breakfast on offer here as it's a real highlight with so many food choices on offer! The huge gingerbread house in the lobby which took 3 weeks to build is only a small part of the decorations the hotel have put up and if you want to get into that Christmas vibe it's definitely the place to be",5,2023,12,04
205,Wonderful Hotel,"We had a wonderful stay and I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again. Service was excellent, and the rooms and bathrooms are very large and luxurious. While not directly in city center, the hotel is a quick Uber ride to everything and is in a nice, quiet neighborhood with some good restaurants nearby.",5,2023,12,02
205,Intercontinental Dublin is amazing!,"We traveled from the US to Ireland for a wedding and return plans changed at the last minute and we needed to stay in Dublin for a night before flying out the next day.  I booked four rooms for my family and the Intercontinental Dublin was amazing.  Everyone we encountered was super friendly and helpful.  The check in process and valet was simple and quick.  The rooms were beautiful, and the chocolates were a nice touch and much appreciated. Not sure when I will be returning to Dublin, hopefully soon, but when I do, I most definitely will be staying at the Intercontinental Dublin.  ",5,2023,12,02
205,"Beautiful hotel, delicious dining, tremendous service","First off, I never write online reviews but I felt compelled after the fantastic experience I had while at the Intercontinental Dublin. I stayed the last 2 nights of my 8 day solo trip to Ireland and I’m so glad I did. Of course, as Dublin’s only 5-star hotel, the suite and amenities were delightful, and it felt luxurious while still unpretentious. Breakfast and drinks at the Whiskey Bar were delicious, and the location is conveniently located to a row of some great restaurants and pubs.

But the reason I’m writing this review is because of the service. Every single one of the staff with whom I interacted was not only professional, but genuinely friendly and very helpful when it came to any questions or needs I had.

To give you an example, I mistakenly put the wrong room number on my in-room breakfast order form the morning of my departure. When I inquired at check-out, not only was the missing breakfast investigated and cause revealed, but they then apologized to ME for MY error- which was completely unnecessary, and then offered to pack up coffee, scones etc. to take with me to the airport.

I have to also call out Gary for his exceptional service and kindness at reception, who spent so much time with me at check-in and each morning, asking me how my travels throughout Ireland had been so far (prior to my arrival at the Intercontinental I had driven over 1300km throughout the country) and what my plans for Dublin were each day, as well as providing insider tips and recommendations that honestly improved my plans- all with the charm and friendliness of a friend. 

To Gary and the rest of the amazing staff at the Intercontinental, that’s class- thank you!!",5,2023,11,30
205,Above and Beyond,"It felt great to be back in Dublin city even if it was just for a short overnight.  After a late arrival I was greeted as always with a smile and a warm welcome.  Check in was easy and i because it wasn't too busy on a Sunday night, I was upgraded to a nice room on the third floor in a quiet area with balcony doors. I had enough time for a swim, sauna and workout before dinner.  Dinner was relaxing with live holiday piano music. Breakfast was ready and available before 7 which worked well with my flight schedule. It is a wonderful benefit to get the delicious breakfast as a Diamond IHG member.  Above all the staff here is pleasant and accommodating which is always consistent here at the Dublin Intercontinental.  On arrival I discovered a small tear in my sport bag and at 9 PM Patrick at the front desk found a roll of duct tape (it was a brand new roll, did someone go out and buy it that evening?)  that worked perfectly to repair the bag and make it suitable for traveling again!  A million thanks for going above and beyond what was needed to make your guests feel at home.  Hoping to be back soon. ",5,2023,11,29
205,An amazing hotel and experience,"The entire experience was 5* from arriving at the hotel, Isaac greeted us so warmly, really a huge credit to the hotel!! The hotel is beautiful, well kept and exceptionally clean. All staff that we encountered were pleasant, helpful and professional. The rooms and bathrooms were stunning, best baths i have ever encountered!! I cannot wait to visit Dublin again, and i will definitely be coming back to your beautiful hotel. Thank you",5,2023,11,28
205,Great experience at the Lobby Lounge,"I had drinks with a friend at the whiskey bar in the Lobby Lounge, such a great atmosphere around with the all the Christmas decorations. We had a lovely bartender serving us, Diana recommended us some cocktails and they definitely didn’t disappoint. Very kind and pleasant girl, will definitely be returning for some drinks and lunch next time.",5,2023,11,22
205,Home from home,"The overall feeling is one of being at home, very comfortable and relaxed. We slept well the bedding is soft and a lovely soft scent- fresh and crisp.I used the pool, sauna and steam room- all amenties were there. I have eaten the  nicest omelette ever in this hotel. All the staff we met were very helpful and friendly in a very natural way.",5,2023,11,16
205,This Hotel is a GEM,"This hotel is beyond lovely! An elegant, sophisticated property, but also a charming hotel, that does not skimp on customer service! A fantastic location, just outside the City Centre of Dublin. If you are looking for total comfort, this is the place. The rooms are big for Europe, super comfortable, large bathrooms, great shower and tub. 
The most AMAZING STAFF!!! It all starts with the Bellmen who greet you, then on to the BEST front desk, they are always friendly and helpful. The service is top notch throughout the hotel. The dining room, great service yet again, wonderful European breakfast, tea in the lobby or the cozy bar for a cocktail. The spa adds a whole other level to the travel experience, I have had a great massage, they are geared for you to have the most enjoyable relaxing experience, you can also enjoy the pool, hot tub and sauna, even if you do not book a massage.
A hotel that is a FLAWLESS beauty!  
They also do an incredible job decorating for ALL holidays, and seasons.  
I have stayed here many times, a little late writing a review. Keeping this GEM a secret...no longer.
Every time, I walk into Intercontinental Dublin l it makes me smile. :)         ",5,2023,11,15
205,Amazing Hotel ,"Enjoyed another stay in the Intercontinental Hotel, Dublin under their Suite Retreat package.  We as usual had a beautiful room to include open plan Living Room, separate dressing room and hallway.  All the staff were so friendly and attentive from concierge, receptionist, bar staff, restaurant staff & housekeeping staff. I also have to mention Blow Hair Salon on site (well worth a visit) together with the Spa.  Great place for a relaxing weekend. ",5,2023,11,13
205,Absolutely Fantastic Hotel ,"The most fabulous hotel. Rooms are beautiful, staff are awesome - stay and you won’t regret it! An absolute haven in the midst of Dublin. 

From arrival, nothing is too much trouble and the staff are genuinely keen to help in any way they can to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. ",5,2023,11,11

205,5 Star in name only …,"Stayed for 2 nights with my family - a Classic room and Junior Suite . We used to stay twice a year when it was the Four Seasons and stayed once before when it changed to the InterContinental ( not a pleasant stay ) Rooms are very tired , breakfast quality is similar to a motorway service cafe ( with the exception of great service by Jacqueline ) . Pool and spa used to great now dirty and  closes early . 4 Star at a push , better idea to stay at the Clayton Hotel next door .  Very much living of past history.",1,2023,10,31
205,This hotel is well worth a visit!,"The staff were exceptionally professional and helpful but this was exceeded by their friendliness. We got a real Irish welcome. The bedroom oozed classic elegance, was a very good size and the temperature was perfect. The bed and pillows were exceptionally comfortable and the bathroom was luxurious. The food was five star quality.",5,2023,10,30
205,Conference at hotel,The intercontinental hotel is located in Ballsbridge just a short journey from central Dublin. It was opened about 20’years ago as a Four Seasons Hotel. It’s a five star hotel. The conference facilities were excellent and the Ice Bar and the food was great.,5,2023,10,27
205,Hospitality and service at its best !,"WOW is the word here !  how we were looked after , allocated a fabulous room by John , thank you John - lovely quiet room with a fabulous balcony overlooking the front of the hotel - so so nice .  Fion looked after our luggage , thank you Fion , We had dinner in Season's Restaurant and was looked after by Kostiantyn and Alexandra , the service and food was exceptional . We just can't wait to come back there again for dinner and to the hotel for its outstanding hospitality and food.  We also like to mention the other porter a young tall  guy with black hair - can't remember his name but he organised the taxi's for us on the match day and  was so helpful ,  will get his name on our next stay as he seems always to be there .   Also would like to thank Monika in reception - friendly and bubbly and so very helful .  Thank you all and we look forward to a return visit in 2024 .",5,2023,10,25
205,Perfect stay from start to finish,"Stayed here for two nights with some friends and as a hospitality man myself, you almost inadvertently look for tips/ideas on how to improve your own hotel's service and I believe I was given a service masterclass. 

Absolutely fantastic stay from the minute I arrived, the reception staff on check-in were brilliant. They were very informative about the hotel's facilities and where I could go to find everything that I needed. 

Was great to get to my room and see some lovely amenities and a welcome letter from Nicky Logue, the GM. 

Breakfast was very well laid out and everyone there was so attentive and friendly. 

Lastly, on check-out, I had the pleasure of meeting of meeting Gary on the front desk and we had a little chat about our work and his marathon exploits. So from start to finish, my stay was perfect. 

I'll be back in February.",5,2023,10,24

Everything we wanted and more . Cant wait to return. Highly recommend.",5,2023,10,23

205,Wedding Anniversary ,"Stayed on Saturday night of the Ruby simi final and as you would expect the hotel was very busy ,  but still the service was excellent and the staff where friendly and efficient as always. On Sunday mornings after our swim we ordered room service Breakfast  , which we had never done before in this hotel , but will again when we stay at Christmas which we have already booked.",5,2023,10,17
205,"DEFINITELY DESERVING ""DUBLIN's ONLY 5 STAR HOTEL""","The Intercontinental Dublin is often advertised at Dubin's only ""5 Star"" hotel and I can confirm that the Intercontinental has definitely earned the right to be declared a ""5 Star"" hotel.
This is likely one of the most luxurious yet comfortable hotels I have ever had the pleasure to stay in.
From the minute you arrive all of the staff from the Doorman to Reception are extremely welcoming.
The hotel is immaculate, in the elevators the brass plated doors are gleaming as is every detail within this hotel.
Everything throughout the hotel is ""First Class"" so welcoming and comfortable it has to be experienced to fully appreciate the Intercontinental's superior standard.
Our suite was luxurious, functional and comfortable even for an extended stay. The suite and bathroom were spotless with everything cleaned to perfection.
We had a full size deep bathtub and a full glass walk-in shower. Both were beautiful and very much appreciated after a long day walking around Dublin.
The food at the hotel is delicious, the breakfast buffet is extensive and of superior quality. Additionally you can order whatever you may like for breakfast and it will be prepared to perfection and guaranteed to satisfy.
The Intercontinental is located in a high end residential area with numerous embassies located nearby. For transport the DART commuter train is a short two minute walk away delivering you in about ten minutes to the core of Dublin.One of the Front Office members ``Gary"" really stood out with his welcoming professional attitude and generosity of his time to ensure we enjoyed everything we could in Dublin.
If I were to pick anything I couldn't rave about, it would be the daily parking at 20 euros which is in line with other major hotels within the Dublin area.
It would be without reservation or hesitation that I would highly recommend the Intercontinental Dublin to anyone looking for a truly relaxing and luxurious stay in Dublin's Only Five Star Hotel.",5,2023,10,16
205,"Nice enough, barely, but not well located unless you're headed to the RDS","Unless you're going to an event at the Royal Dublin Society, I'd not stay here.  The location is non-descript.  There is no local life -- e.g., pubs or restaurants -- so if you stay here you are somewhat trapped here.  Trapped in a pretty building with an attractive Lobby Bar that serves only barely-good-enough food.  Fish and chips with white vinegar (no malt), lukewarm fries, and what seemed like canned and microwaved mushy peas.   Also, they desperately need a cellphone policy in the lobby bar.

Compared to the the bustling vibe of downtown Dublin -- about 15-20m away by cab -- there is seemingly nothing out here.  

I'm told this place used to be a Four Seasons and that makes sense.  The carpet is worn, the building generally nice but tired.  As if Four Seasons was wearing it out and, rather than refurbishing it, they pawned it off on Intercontinental who has yet to do the work to fix it up.  

The bedroom was large, the bed comfortable, and the HVAC was controlled not by a thermostat but a +/- dial off a baseline temperature that I did not like.

For my next trip, I'll bite the taxi/Uber bullet and stay downtown.",3,2023,10,16
205,Honeymoon getaway in Dublin - Intercontinental Dublin,"My wife and I went to Dublin as part of part 1 of our honeymoon trip, and absolutely loved staying at the Intercontinental Dublin. All of the staff was very kind, from the bellmen welcoming you to the hotel, to the very clear and warm spoken front desk staff, to the restaurant staff that always made sure you had what you needed - quintessential Irish hospitality. The hotel grounds are also beautiful, a getaway from the city, tranquil and well adorned, every detail in the hotel is carefully picked out, giving it a plush and upscale feel, with tasteful art on the walls and elegant tableware. 

The rooms, we stayed in a beautifully adorned Premium Room, are extremely comfortable with a generous mattress, soft duvet cover, and every amenity you can think of. I also forgot my toothbrush and within 2 minutes of my wife calling down, somebody was at the room with the dental set. And our view - wow, we got a small terrace area and enjoyed looking out to the city (and you can also see the ocean) every morning before heading into town.

The hotel is also extremely conveniently located to the Dart (part of the Irish railway system and very easy to use with a leapfrog card), and 2 bus stops, all which take you in/out of downtown within a matter of minutes.

The breakfast serves a la carted, continental or full Irish breakfast. Highly recommend the full Irish breakfast as it has expertly made scrambled eggs (not too dry, not too runny), sausages that were to die for, breakfast potatoes, mushrooms, tomatoes, white & black pudding. And this is just the warm side, there are also assortments of fruit, pastries, yogurt, cold cuts and smoked salmon. Honestly, an excellent way to start your day with plenty of food to give you energy to explore Dublin. And the tea - we wish we could have brought home the tea, just perfect.

Overall, would encourage anybody looking for an elegant, comfortable and quiet hotel with excellent service to stay at the Intercontinental Dublin. 5 out of 5 and looking forward to staying there again.",5,2023,10,16
205,Excellent,"Lovely stay at the intercontinental in ballsbridge. 
All the staff that we encountered from the concierge,  reception staff , spa and bar /restaurants were very friendly and attentive. 
We had a balcony room which was very spacious and  tastefully decorated , very comfortable .Complimentary fruit bowl and bottled water which I thought was a nice touch.
The bathroom was great, large powerful shower and separate bath , nice selection of toiletries .
The pool and spa area is very good with great changing rooms, sauna and steam rooms . 
Overall a very pleasant stay and would highly recommend.",5,2023,10,15
205,A fantastic IC hotel. Definitely coming back.,"This was my first time in Ireland. Absolutely amazing. I especially enjoyed the IC. Wonderful breakfast, and exceptional service. The large suite had a sitting area, seperste room for sleeping, and and additional room for a shower, water pool, and separete room for the toilet.",5,2023,10,13
205,Not to be missed,"This hotel is five star from start to finish, it begins with the warm welcome from the staff from the door, reception, lounge etc it is one of the few places left that have staff that have the time and interest to actually converse, the room are extremely comfortable and the beds are again five star, the lounge area is a lovely warm and tranquil location for a nice glass of wine or pint of Guinness with a menu that covers all options, Seasons serves a fabulous breakfast again in unique surroundings, it’s situated in a beautiful part of Dublin with lovely walks and nearby bars and restaurants! It’s really a must try can’t wait to return",5,2023,10,10
205,Lived up to expectations,"Rated as a five star, this hotel lived up to expectations. We had a one night stay including breakfast and reception was very welcoming and we got upgraded to a junior suite. Having a sleep difficulty because of cancer medication for a long time, this hotel provided the best nights sleep for ages. Whether it was the bed, pillows or temperature of the room, it certainly worked for us. The only slight issues we had where the hotel dropped below expected  standard was at breakfast where we had to wait for cereal bowls to come from the kitchen and had to wait for butter also. While we ordered tea at the table, we had breakfast nearly finished when the tea arrived with a genuine apology from the waiter. These issues wouldn't stop me from staying again. thank you for the wonderful experience.    ",5,2023,10,09
205,"Wonderful, comfortable, customer centric hotel","What a lovely hotel.  From the moment you step out of the taxi you are warmly greeted by a member of staff.  From reception to the bar and waiting staff, everyone we met were great at their jobs.  Our room was spacious and very comfortable.  The bathroom was amazing as were all the complimentary essentials.  We used the spa and Blow the hairdresser, both were fabulous.  We stayed longer in the bar just to listen to the amazing pianist.  A great long weekend in Dublin made even better by staying at this lovely hotel.  Breakfast was simply the best ever.  I put on weight but it was worth it.  ",5,2023,10,09

205,Exceptional!,"From the moment you drive through the gates, the welcome is warm and inviting. From there it only got better.  Each member of staff I had contact with were courteous, warm and efficient. The room exceeded all my expectations, it was the epitome of luxury and I didn't want to leave! ",5,2023,10,04
205,“Cead mile failte” at its finest!,This hotel of which I have stayed in many times never disappoints. It exudes the “traditional card mile failte” from the moment you enter. The warm reception we received upon checking in is so rare these days. Where do I start with the staff members- it’s clear that they are passionate about what they do as it’s  so evident in their delivery. It’s obviously coming from the top down so congratulations whoever is running this fine establishment!! Home away from home as we all call it & these people have nailed it!,5,2023,10,03
205,Daycation spa package,Went for the daycation spa package. The spa facilities were excellent and the treatment was one of the best I’ve ever had!  It was amazing value for all that was included. Staff were very attentive and the nail and hair blow dry was a lovely add on to the spa! The afternoon tea was also excellent and the complimentary parking was the cherry on top. Will absolutely return for this amazing spa package,5,2023,10,02
205,5 star but 10 star price,"Lovely stay. Beautiful bedroom, warm, and beds very cosy. Wonderful Barman, think his name is Sam. Food is amazing. 
I definitely think this is - 5 star, but probably not worth the amount charged per night. 
Insufficient staff at breakfast to clear tables. 
Having paid €350 per night and having to clear my own table at breakfast to make room for more plates is not good enough. 
Also additional car park charge is unnecessary. Overall I would recommend this hotel,however some things need to be resolved before I would pay the rate again.",5,2023,09,29
205,Good but could be better,"Stayed here last week. Staff are excellent in the hotel. Room was a nice size bed facilities let it down. 
One side of the bed didn’t have a locker which was a nuisance having to put your water and phone down on the floor and then lean out of bed during the night if you need to a drink of water etc…. Really miss the ice bar. No atmosphere in the lobby bar.
Amazing breakfast",3,2023,09,26
205,Dublin wonderful stay,"The Best Hotel in Dublin and its wonderful to enjoy a holiday
I have enjoyed my time and the staff are so helpful.  services in all aspects exceed the usual hotel service. my advice for whoever wish to visit Dublin to stay at The Intercontental ",5,2023,09,25
205,Great hotel total quality and a great place to stay with the family.,"This is our hotel of choice when we visit Dublin. Rooms are large and very comfortable. Breakfast is amazing such great variety and staff that are so helpful and Daniele was so helpful to us. 

Eating in the hotel is fantastic we ate in the evenings in the lobby lounge. The surroundings and food are excellent. 

It gets even more special on a Sunday evening when Catherine plays on the piano, as I heard one gust say what an amazing talent!
Catherine took the time to speak to our Children and play a song of their choice. That was such a kind thing to do and the girls were mesmerised. 

A word of thanks is to to Vanessa, Alex and Alexandra who were excellent and who always had time to check how were were doing. 
It was our daughters birthday while we were down and everyone made the girls feel very special with candles and a lovely desert with a birthday message on this delivered on one the evenings when we were dining in the lobby lounge. Thanks folks.  

A Special word of thanks to Carla one of the managers who worked in the lobby lounge. Carla always took the time out to ask how things were going and was so attentive and professional. Nothing was a bother to Carla and she always had a smile. 

The star of the show was Maria who worked in the lobby lounge. Maria is an absolute delight she always had a smile on her face and always made time to say hello and speak to the children. 

Maria clearly loves her job, she is very professional and efficient at her job. Maria really represents the hotel really well by displaying the highest standards and also being approachable. 

Again like the previous staff mentioned above anything that we needed it was no problem at all for Maria. Maria was customer focused, professional, and not to mention a really lovely young lady and future manager I am sure!

Thanks to everyone for making the trip so special. ",5,2023,09,23

205,Good Example of a Well-Run InterContinental Brand Hotel,"As an InterContinental Platinum Ambassador I've been to probably about a couple dozen InterContinental hotels and the Dublin hotel is one of the best that I've experienced overall in terms of its plushness and comfort. The hotel was formerly a Four Seasons and maybe that's why it looks a bit ""nicer"" than your average InterContinental. Staff is friendly for the most part--I really liked Alex the nice French employee in the central lobby bar/seating area--excellent service and a great personality. Rooms were surprisingly large and very clean. I really liked the bathroom! Towels were high quality, too. 

Dinner at the restaurant wasn't anything out of of this world but wasn't bad--same goes for breakfast. 

Main reason why the hotel doesn't really seem like its meeting its full potential as a self-proclaimed ""five star"" hotel is that it doesn't offer turn down service which is really something that is expected at a hotel of this caliber. (Otherwise it makes it more of a four or four and a half star hotel.) Seems like a small detail, and it generally is, but again, if you're charging five star prices then you really ought to go all out with five star service--and that would include nightly, thorough, turn down service. 

Nonetheless, would certainly return and would definitely recommend the hotel to others. (Just keep in mind it's not in ""central"" Dublin so you'll need to take a taxi/Uber or walk a bit.)",4,2023,09,21
205,Excellent Hotel,The hotel is located in a quiet and beautiful area just outside the Dublin city center.  It was easy to get into the city from the hotel using Dublin’s public transit (there is a train station a couple of blocks from the hotel). The room was very nice and quiet at night.  The restaurant on the property has a nice patio that is great for dinner and drinks.  Gary at the front desk was very helpful and friendly.  It was our first time in Dublin and he helped us with directions and suggestions and he helped get my I-phone back after I left it in cab.  We highly recommend this hotel!,5,2023,09,20
205,Best hotel I've stayed at on a work trip!,"I arrived jet lagged after an international flight and was immediately able to check in to the spa to use the hot tub, steam room, sauna and have a treatment - it felt like the perfect escape! The room was beautiful with everything I could need including a very large, comfortable and clean tub. The sheets, pillows and duvet were absolute heaven - the softest I have slept in! I didn't want to leave. ",5,2023,09,19
205,You will not be disappointed!,"Very good stay. 
You need taxi to go out to the Centre. 
Dinner was very good as was the breakfast except the staff didn’t distinguish between mint tea and peppermint tea except on one occasion. No lactose free  yogurt available. 
Spa excellent. Would strongly recommend.",5,2023,09,19
205,One of the best ,"Awesome. Just an awesome hotel. 

The rooms are very comfortable, the bed is comfortable. 

The breakfast is superb. The staff in the dining room are some of the best. Very attentive, knowledgeable, and helpful.  Valerie, the concierge, should be given a huge raise. She’s one of the best.

The staff was great - we especially wanted to thank Gary & Pable - they were so friendly & gave great recommendations from everything to shopping to restaurants!  We definitely wouldn't have had such a fantastic experience without them!  The restaurant Rossi had the best pasta we've ever had & the chef even came out to talk to us!  We can't recommend the Intercontinental in Dublin enough!  We can't wait to return ;),5,2023,09,17

Upon arrival we were warmly welcomed by the friendly reception staff, she made us feel welcome and upgraded our room. She gave us suggestions to make our stay more comfortable.

We had wonderful breakfasts in the hotel made more special by Konstantine and his wonderful supervisor!  Valerie the concierge is a wealth of information and made our trip more interesting with her advices & tips about the city, shops, and restaurants. Would definitely recommend this hotel to everybody!

205,Been here for three nights,"Really fantastic place, quite, luxurious and worth the money.
Lovely friendly staff, a very nice food with reasonable prices (I enjoyed the FISH AND CHIPS)
Adding to that, the room was very clean and comfortable and large enough and it has literally everything you need.",5,2023,09,04
205,Fantastic,"Just had a 1 night stay and it was fantastic, especially the staff who couldn't do enough (David Earl in particular made our evening).  Will definitely return need to spend more time in the wonderful city of Dublin.",5,2023,09,04
205,A 5-star hotel from top to bottom!!," Our stay at the Intercontinental Hotel, Dublin was absolutely amazing.  The staff was so welcoming, warm and helpful.  We especially enjoyed talking to Mosie (? spelling).  He offered directions and help, always with a smile!  The rooms were exquisite.  We had more than enough space.  Everything was clean and bright.  The only suggestion would be to keep the spa open a little later.  Highly recommend!!",5,2023,08,30
205,Dublin Horse Show 2023,"Stay regularly at the Intercontinental Hotel and always maintains a high standard.
Hotel was very busy but didn’t take away from the experience.
The food was excellent and didn’t feel the need to eat anywhere else.",5,2023,08,28
205,The best hotel in Dublin.,"Our stay at the intercontinental Dublin was simply sublime. Comfortable beds, delicious food and wonderful, courteous and helpful staff made our stay here amazing. They were so kind to help us with recommendations while traveling the city and we are grateful for their advice and help!",5,2023,08,24
205,Overwhelmingly excellent with the odd area for improvement,"Overwhelmingly an excellent stay at the Intercontinental Dublin. The greeting on arrival was very friendly and helpful, the room was very nicely decorated and clean, and the spa was also great (we tried the pool and had an excellent massage). The staff were generally great and we had some excellent cocktails in the bar. The only slight negatives were the prices of all extras which were reassuringly expensive (definitely worth getting a rate with breakfast thrown in) and the general chaos at breakfast, which was the only time that service was lacking. (Getting anyone to serve us was a challenge on more than one occasion and we also had some incorrect drinks orders and distinctly second rate cappuccino). That said these experiences didn’t blunt a very nice stay and we would definitely visit the hotel again.",5,2023,08,21
205,Evening Tea with family,"Carla looked after the reservation and was extremely informative and helpful with explaining what to expect and answering our queries. Afternoon tea did not only meet our expectation but surpassed them. The hotel is stunning and the service is 5 star +. On entering the hotel, we were warmly greeted by reception and directed where to go. We were led in to a magnificent drawing room and seated straight away. We had a fantastic afternoon which was all due to the superior service and attention to detail which makes this hotel a standout from others. I highly recommend and look forward to returning in the near furture",5,2023,08,21
205,Perfect from start to finish! ,"Last time we stayed here the hotel was run by a different brand, we had been living overseas so hadn’t visited Dublin in about 12 years and were a little concerned if the Intercontinental would live up to our memories. 
But it did, and more! 
We were impressed from the moment we arrived, despite it being the week of the Dublin Horse Show when the hotel was very busy, every member of staff made us feel like we were the only guests. 
The rooms are beautiful, spacious, elegant and relaxing, with incredibly comfy beds. All of the common areas of the hotel feel classy and opulent and the staff are always on hand for anything needed. Always professional but engaging and chatty when you want them to be. 
Great wine selection and the best breakfast I’ve had in years! 
We’ll definitely be back! ",5,2023,08,20
205,Staff are amazing!,We stay at the Intercontinental whenever to come to Dublin and the main reason is the staff who make us welcome but also do a fantastic job. The rooms are immaculate and the waiting staff are attentive. Breakfast is our favourite and we appreciate the excellent food choice as well as the non-rushed atmosphere.,5,2023,08,20
205,A must stay…,"A must stay if you’re in or near Dublin.  Stunning, not one thing we could fault.  Staff were friendly but very professional.  Very clean, well equipped rooms, great food selection.  Great location, 15-mins from Dublin centre. We’ll be back very soon.  ",5,2023,08,20

",5,2023,08,15
205,Nice but not the experience I was expecting,"We stayed here at the end of July for a celebration of our anniversary and also our engagement. We had 2 interconnecting rooms. The rooms were very big, The TV was basic with no frills you'd expect from a hotel this day and age.

We arrived and we were greeted, our membership status was barely recognised. We weren't told of any of the amenities of the hotel, we had to basically ask every question. With nobody else in the lobby, we would have expected a bit better customer service.

My partner went for a trip to the Spa where the girls who did her massage and facial were absolutely amazing, they even remembered me the following day when I went o the pool.

We went for dinner in the lobby, and due to unforeseen circumstances their fryer was broken so a lot of the menu was off the cards. These things happen and it was completely our of the control of the staff and hotel. But the man that 'greeted' us and waited on our table either hated us, or hated his job because he seemed miserable, everything seemed as if it was chore when we asked for something. The saving grace of that meal was a nice man from India whose name I've forgotten. He was amazing, with all of us so Thank you to that man!

The following morning breakfast was decent, what you'd expect from a hotel in Dublin, nothing too extravagant. I had read reviews that there was a chef making omelettes, I didn't see it so I can't pass judgement on it.

One of the lights was missing from the room, it was no big deal, but when I mentioned it on check out I was given 'Thanks for that' no apology, nothing.

I would love to give this hotel another try but at the price they charge, it is unlikely to happen anytime soon.

I expected so much more from a hotel of such prestige",2,2023,08,14
205,Excellent experience,"This is the most comfortable hotels I have stayed at in a very long time. The rooms are amazing, the staff went above and beyond, the only downside is that I was forced to do room service for a few sodas that cost me almost 30 euros for 5 sodas just because they force a 7.50 tray service to my room even though I went downstairs to get it myself, very disappointing at this only option 😥
",5,2023,08,10
205,Highly recommend,The hotel was very posh and had great wait staff. We had an upgraded room and felt like royalty. The meals we had there were fantastic. The bar was equally spectacular!!  My friend and I used the spa facility for makeup and hair as we attended a wedding later that day. They opened an hour early for us and did a great job. thank you Lucas and Marcus!,5,2023,08,09
205,Great place to start and end the day.,"We had an awesome experience. We were greeted warmly by the frontdesk staff. Check in was easy. We received several great recommendations throughout our stay for restaurants, pubs and attractions. The room was larger than expected, clean and well kept with daily service. Breakfast in the morning was an added bonus. We traveled by Uber in Dublin. We never waited more than a few minutes and all of the driver's knew exactly where the hotel was on our return. Highly recommend. ",5,2023,08,09
205,Outstanding from start to finish!,Absolutely outstanding in every possible way! This hotel is the best in Dublin…the rooms are bigger than the city center 5-star hotels. Staff are all exceptional. A classy and luxurious place to stay. Highly recommend! ,5,2023,08,06
205,Excellent Hotel! Elegance Personified!,"We could not have been more pleased with this lovely hotel. It is elegance personified from our lovely suite with balcony, all appointments and amenities to the lovely décor wherever you turn in public and dining areas. 

Everyone goes out of their way to be helpful.  The standouts were John, one of the hotel’s Directors, who went above and beyond to please, and Isaac Macias who should be officially promoted to Guest Ambassador and Vice President of Guest Happiness. He conveys serious professional support for the guest, along with unpretentiously pure joy. We miss seeing him and when we return, it will be in part because of how Isaac makes people feel. Bravo to him and to the entire staff at ICH! 
",5,2023,08,05
205,A Dublin gem,"This is my go to hotel in Dublin. With both family & business in the city, I am always guaranteed excellent service and great facilities.
The staff are welcoming and always on hand to offer that extra special recommendation.

The Seasons restaurant is a must and a nightcap in the fabulous Whisky bar the best way to round up an evening!
",5,2023,08,03
205,Fantastic stay!,The most amazing experience for myself and my partner on our first trip away from the baby in months. Staff were unbelievable and the room was second to none. Will most definitely be staying again and would recommend to anyone.,5,2023,08,01
205,Luxury stay in Dublin. ,"A luxury stay in Dublin! The hotel is lovely, staff friendly and helpful. It is very formal and perhaps a little stuffy for your more casual guest, but for a touch of luxury for the weekend it can’t be beat. The rooms are big, beds huge and the bathroom was great! ",5,2023,07,31
205,They spoilt us with stunning luxurious room and best services!,"We were stayed here to celebrate birthday party and visiting Tayto Park. The room is stunning, very clean and luxurious. Thanks to Brenda, the housekeeper who made my room. We also got upgraded to Junior Suites and complimentary birthday plate. The heated pool is class, we really enjoyed! The food in the Lounge taste good. We had ordered dinner and lunch in the Lounge, the things that I don’t like is the way how they served cod fish and chips in the small bowl, which is very uncomfortable. Maybe better serving in the plate. Overall, the hotel facilites and the services from the checked in until we checked out is stunning! We definitely will come back to stay here! 
Thanks so much to gave us best experience stay while we were in Dublin 🙂👍",5,2023,07,30
205,Great location to visit Dublin,"We have been welcomed by Gary, he's kind, efficient and gave us a lot of precious information. The room was perfect, the common areas too. Elegant setting, comfortable beds. We are a family of 4 and the hotel is close to a Dart station, so easy to reach Dublin centre in a few minutes. ",5,2023,07,29
205,Luxury  - Great service !  Friendly staff which make a hotel !,"A wonderful stay and what a lovely welcome by Fion , looked after our luggage while we checked in at reception with John who was made for this job !  such a nice welcome also ,  thanks John and Fion.  We are already looking forward to checking in later today.    Overall we  highly recommend this hotel - five star all the way !",5,2023,07,28
205,All you need for a great Dublin stay.,"Great location and very friendly staff.
Rooms especially beds are extremely comfortable and hotel amenities are great.
The best part was the restaurant, lounge, and bar at the hotel.
Will stay here again.",5,2023,07,26
205,Great stay!,"It is a fantastic hotel! Loved the swimming pool and ambience there! 10/10 for cleanliness. Their shampoo/ conditioners and soaps smell so good. I actually would have to buy some from the same brand. Also, the hotel bar offers great selection of cocktails and other beverages.",5,2023,07,26
205,A Great Stay for a Weekend,"What can one say about this absolutely divine hotel other than having a great stay. Arriving on a Friday night for a weekend stay, we were greeted by Fion, one of their bellman. He was very polite and welcoming and took on all of our luggage for both of our rooms. 

Check in was an easy process, both agents were quite friendly and welcoming as well.  Our room was a King room with a balcony that overlooked the courtyard garden. 

The room was quite spacious and accommodating and the closet was quite large. The feature we’ve grown to look forward to with all InterContinental properties is the bathrooms. Large and always an amazing shower. 

The bed did not disappoint either. Comfortable and much anticipated after a previous week in an AirBnB. 

We loved the location, close enough and far enough away from City Centre. With plenty of dining options with a short walk from the hotel. And a short walk to catch the local train to get around. 

We also opted to have Room Service for breakfast. We ordered one Irish Breakdast, the Salmon Eggs Benedict and a Pastry basket. The food was delivered and setup  nicely. The food all around was quite good. 

All in all we were quite pleased with the entire experience and will hopefully return when we visit Dublin again.",5,2023,07,23
205,Who Could Ask For Anything More,"
Hi all, I wanted to drop a line to say what a wonderful time we had at your hotel! The front desk personnel were outstanding, the meals and drinks were top-notch, the entire hotel gleams with opulence. A special shoutout to those who breakfast a treat, Andre, Fabio and Jackie. They were tremendous, cordial and a delight to speak with every morning at breakfast. You hire the best people because you are the best hotel. Thanks for making our stay grand!",5,2023,07,11
205,Lovely stay,"Peaceful location, attentive staff, lovely rooms. The spa was nice. The options served at breakfast could've been better (Innocent smoothies offered à la carte as though they were fresh smoothies were a slightly hilarious touch) and the reception/concierge was occasionally unavailable or unable to meet some of our requests but overall it was an extremely pleasant stay! ",4,2023,07,06
205,Highly Recommend InterContinental Dublin,"The InterContinental Dublin was by far the best hotel I have ever experienced. As a U.S. citizen, traveling abroad for the first time, I did not know what to expect. I enjoyed Dublin and I know that it was due in large part to our hotel stay. The room was clean and spacious. The restaurants and lounges were magnificent. The menu had a variety of items from which to choose. The piano lounge and courtyard view was lovely. I'd like to give a special nod to the Concierge. She went above and beyond to assist us before, during, and after our stay.",5,2023,07,04
205,Real 5* Star Luxury in the Heart of Dublin,"Just returned from a fabulous stay at the Intercontinental Dublin. We received a warm welcome from Luca, one of the receptionists on duty, who definitely was very efficient and knew her facts about the hotel. We were shown up to our beautiful room, definitely one of the nicest rooms in any 5* properties in Dublin. The room was immaculate, thank you to the housekeeping team and the beds were one of the most comfortable  I have ever experienced in any hotel I have stayed in. Big special thank you to John Lynch, nothing was too much trouble, he directed us to the nearest dart station (5 min walk to the hotel) and recommended a lovely Teddy's ice cream at Dún Laoghaire - it was the best ice cream we ever had, which we never would have known about, only John gave us the time and inside scoop! Breakfast was so calm and relaxing, beautiful fresh food on offer. Thank you so much to the team at the Intercontinental Dublin and well done to all. Our stay exceeded any expectations we had, thank you John and Luca. ",5,2023,07,03
205,Memorable lunchtime reunion ,"On arrival to the hotel, we were welcomed by senior management and staff. 
Our lunch was served in a beautiful and spacious dining room.  The quality of the food was excellent.
The lunch and wine menus were fully explained, giving us several options.
The service was delivered by a very professional and extremely well-groomed team. Having spent
 most of my career in the hospitality 
 sector, I was extremely impressed as were the rest of my party. This was truly  a five-star experience so much so we have booked our Christmas
 party. 
We wish to thank everyone for the service and wonderful hospitality extended to us .

205,Exceptional  stay at Intercontinental hotel Dublin,"Fantastic stay at intercontinental hotel in Dublin. At checkin the receptionist was very professional and friendly… hard to beat a big smile from someone who is interested in you. Our room was spotlessly clean like it was new and never used.  The swimming pool was lovely and quiet… perhaps the gym might benefit from some better equipment but it is adequate. My wife has used the spa on a previous stay here and loved it. She did have a small problem with a locker but staff stepped in immediately and addressed the issue. The food was very high quality and good value for a 5 star hotel. In the lobby lounge we asked to share a meal. This was no problem but what a surprise when it was served on separate plates in a quantity that was pleasantly unexpected. The breakfast is the best I have ever experienced as it always is here…it’s  not our first stay and won’t be our last. Exceptional staff great food, world class service and facilities …  well done Intercontinental!",5,2023,07,02
205,Oasis in Dublin,"I travel to Dublin at least once a year to visit family. This visit was the first time I decided to stay at the IHG.  What an excellent choice it turned out to be. Right from the moment we arrived you knew it was somewhere special. It has a very similar vide to that of the Paris Le Grand which we loved. We were met by Luca on reception who was excellent. The ambiance of the hotel was beautiful, and the staff very friendly. Our room was stunning with excellent amenities and very clean.  Breakfast was delightful with plenty of choice either from the buffet or menu and was served in a beautiful room looking out to a lovely courtyard. Unfortunately, we did not have enough time to use the pool and spa so cannot comment on these. However, next time we are in Dublin we will definitely be staying again, and would highly recommend this property. ",5,2023,07,02
205,IHG Intercontinental - Dublin - A 10!,"Excellent staff. Terrific check in process. Much care and attention were taken to ensure we would be very welcome and happy while on the property. Very nice room, fantastic indoor lap pool, first class workout room, and most outstanding bar and restaurant. The morning breakfast buffet is the topnotch. Other guests that were on the property while we were there were equally satisfied the hotel and its amenities. On my return visit to Dublin, I would not consider staying at any Hotel, but this IHG Intercontinental - Dublin.",5,2023,07,02
205,Thank you so much for an unforgettable stay,"We spent our 3-day-mini-honeymoon at the InterContinental Dublin and from the very first to the very last second of our stay everything was just perfect and 5 star at its very very best. Never before, in no other hotel have we experienced such an extraordinary level of perfection, passion and service-orientation. It was just amazing.

The location and the interior design of the hotel, its facilities and the rooms are beautiful, of highest quality and every little detail is just perfectly arranged and creates such a warm, elegant, welcoming atmosphere.

The food is delicious and the selection of Whiskeys impressive. 

We were most impressed though by the people working at the InterContinental Dublin. What a great team! Everyone we met or spoke to was so friendly, so committed and so well-trained and treated us with such an overwhelming hospitality.

We will definitely come back. Thank you everyone at the InterContinental Dublin for an unforgettable stay!

205,Awesome Customer Service!!,"I was very impressed with Gary Wills at the Front Desk.  He was very helpful, patient and wonderful.  Assisted me with a couple reservations.   And, Valerie at the concierge was very knowledgeable and helpful as well.  Definitely made my stay memorable and looking forward to staying here again.",5,2023,06,28
205,Dublin city stay,"Very friendly, welcoming staff. We arrived early as we had a concert to travel to. Our room wasn't ready but we left our bags. On return to the hotel we collected our key card from the front desk. The room was lovely and our bags had been left in our room waiting for us which was lovely after a long day. Next morning had a nice breakfast and went for a walk to the a nearby beach. There is a dart station a short walk from the hotel.",5,2023,06,25
205,A Few Days In Dublin,"The Intercontinental in Dublin is not just a luxury hotel-there are many of those-it is a home away from home.  The staff embody a very special style of Irish hospitality (whatever their actual nationality) and welcome the guest with the warm reception one might receive on a visit to the home of a long time friend.  Added to the warmth of the welcome is the outstanding nature of the service, which is prompt and personal.  The spa is fantastic, a resort in the center of the city, and the bar makes a great Negroni, a wonderful martini and an acceptable pint of Guiness.  There is no other hotel in Dublin where I would stay.",5,2023,06,20
205,Not going back,"At a glance, the hotel appears to be beautiful and extravagant and could possibly be a 5 star hotel. 

We stayed here with my elderly in laws for 4 nights. Upon arrival my mother in law spoke to a male receptionist and he was very rude to her. 

FOOD: 
After a long travel we were hungry so I went to the restaurant to ask for a menu. There were empty tables and i saw two male individual’s on the side. They kept looking back at me but never approached me. I tried to ask for a menu but they would look at me and walk away. This happened for about 15-20 minutes. I then went to the front desk and asked a female receptionist if i could get a menu and she just looked at me and said no, my colleague can get it for you. He never did. I then went inside the restaurant and asked them that i wanted a menu to look at. They then gave me a menu for us to look at. The food was not 5 star…let alone 4 star. It tasted bland and looked like a frozen meal. The portion was also small. The staff also did not come to our table to refill drinks/coffee. 

ACCOMMODATIONS: 
My mother in law is a breast cancer survivor and underwent chemotherapy so she is not able to handle heat very well. The staff stated that they do not have air conditioning and that the reason why the lobby was so cool was because they left the door open. They did not provide any other alternatives for my mother in law such as a fan. They were very rude about it. 

LOCATION:
The location is not the best location. You have to walk to the subway in order to get anywhere. And the nearest store or place to get food is also far. 

I am very disappointed with the customer service, food and location. 

We actually ended up going to have some breakfast and lunch in the hotel next door the Clayton Hotel. The staff and environment were more friendly and the next time we come back to Dublin we will stay there. ",2,2023,06,18
205,A memorable experience,"Thank you so much to the whole team for the excellent service and hospitality. Reception, Concierge, Breakfast service, bar, room... Everything is synonymous with Perfection. We had an amazing stay that will live long in our memories!",5,2023,06,15
205,Fantastic staff service,"Restaurant experience was excellent for a family gathering after a graduation at UCD. Surroundings are lovely, of course; food and drink was good, but it was the service that made it. Staff couldn't have treated us better. Would recommend highly. ",5,2023,06,13
205,A wonderful stay with Top knotch bar dervice," I have created this account specifically for this review and it is well worth the time. My stay at the Intercontinental Dublin was the greatest Hotel stay I have ever experienced in my time abroad. The Accommodations were beautifully decorated and maintained with great care and attention. 

The staff is especially kind and courteous. The bar tenders are some of the best in the world but one member of the bar staff was particularly outstanding and that is Safi. Not only does Safi make the perfect whiskey sour, he treats you as If you are his only customer in his bar. If Artifical intelligence were to create the perfect bar tender, it would render a digital version of Safi. I can't say enough about him. He will remember what you and your entire party like to drink and have it ready for you 5 minutes after you walk in the bar. Truly, a gentleman and scholar. I hope to return sometime soon for a great drink and even better conversation. 

Cheers,
Mike",5,2023,06,07
205,"Old world class service with modern luxury, just perfect","We stayed two nights in a beautiful one bedroom suite, it was spotless and had everything we needed, beds were so comfortable and the hotel kindly suggested a second bed for one of my kids which we didn’t even request but it made our stay even more comfortable. 
We ate dinner in the hotel and had breakfast twice and the food was top class. The staff were so profession but not uptight and always took time to have a chat with us. 
On arrival I was greeted with “welcome back” even though it is a long time since I’ve been, that greeting instantly made me feel welcome, such a simple thing makes a very big difference to a hotel stay. 
I stay in 4 and 5 star hotels very regularly and I have to say this is one of the best stays we’ve had anywhere, while the hotel is beautiful and comfortable, the real difference is the staff, staff members that take a minute to chat and remember you when you come back makes for a wonderful experience.
We cannot wait to return",5,2023,06,07
205,Fantastic ,We stayed at the Intercontinental for 10 days. We have had a wonderful time everything was perfect. The beds were so comfortable! The food was really good. But there were 2 standouts during our stay. Andre’ was so incredibly attentive every morning at breakfast. He remembered what we liked and brought it to our table the moment we were sat. Always had a smile and a minute for a chat. I have never had better service. He is a true Gem. Then there’s Safi at the bar. Very attentive and really friendly. He was a fantastic bartender. By the time we left we felt as though we were leaving real friends behind. Our visit to Dublin at the intercontinental has been one of the best vacations of my life. We had a lovely time and look forward to visiting again. Thank you for such wonderful service and comfortable stay.,5,2023,06,06
205,First Class first visit to Dublin,We enjoyed a very comfortable 3 days at the InterContinental. This was our first visit to Dublin and we found the location of the Hotel ideal for visiting sites all over the City and along the Coast. Our room was enormous and beautifully appointed and the we enjoyed dining in the hotel as well as visiting excellent local restaurants. Above all the staff were friendly and their service exemplary. We will certainly be back.,5,2023,06,05
205,Wonderful stay,"An amazing hotel in a great location away from the hubbub of the city but close enough by.  The room was beautiful and immaculate with one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've slept in.  I used the spa and had a great treatment at a really reasonable price.  Room service was fast, well presented and the sticky toffee pudding was delectable.  What makes this hotel stand out is the staff.  Every single person I encountered was friendly, helpful, beautifully turned out and so welcoming.

205,Truly a 5 Star Service,"Just returned from another outstanding experience at The Intercontinental Dublin Spa.  From the moment I arrived I was treated like I was the only person there.  Conor was so welcoming on reception and Suzanne (who carried out my treatment) was absolutely superb.  Her attention to detail, the treatment itself (which was incredible) but also her warmth was just in a different league. I cannot wait to return. Thank you Nicky Logue and the wonderful team at Intercontinental Dublin.",5,2023,05,29
205,Wish I’d chosen a different hotel.,"The facilities are beautiful. However, it is not close to the city center and requires a taxi or train to see the sites of Dublin. Our room had no air conditioning and required windows to be left open in order to make it bearable. Difficult to sleep because of the heat. The hotel restaurant was over priced and none of the five dinners we ordered were good. None of us finished our meals. The staff were friendly and helpful, but I’ll choose a different hotel if I ever make it back to Dublin.",3,2023,05,28
205,Loved it - returning this year!,"Gorgeous premises, lovely room. Friendly staff. The Irish Cream Tea was excellent! Tourist locations are taxiable - maybe a 15-20 minute cab ride away. A 20-30 minute ride from the airport. Located very conveniently to the venue of my event. Returning this year!!",5,2023,05,26
205,AMAZING ,"What a fantastic hotel made all the netter by the intentive staff who were always on hand and made our stay even better than we could have expected.
Clemance and Gary on reception were a joy to speak with and made my girlfriend and I feel relaxed and welcome.
We also met Carlos who helped us with our espresso machine upon arrival.
We loom forward to our next trip to Dublin where we no doubt will use this hotel and it's wonderful spa",5,2023,05,25
205,Lovely and charming property at Dublin with spacious rooms and great service!,"We felt welcomed when we arrived at Intercontinental Dublin. The bell boys (special mention for Isaac here 😊) were very efficient, friendly and jovial. The staff at the reception were very warm and quickly provided us the keys for the stay. The suite rooms we booked were very large, stately, well lit and beautifully appointed. The lovely balcony in the bedroom overlooking the property was a nice touch 😊. The bathrooms were large, with a terrific shower and superb bath amenities! We did miss a powder room though. Room service was fantastic - we really appreciate the speed at which your staff responds! A special mention for Mr Nadarajan (room service) who took care of most of our orders every evening of our stay 😊. The greenery in the property is so well maintained, with nice fountains & courtyards - made it all the more calming! Overall, we had a most memorable stay and would definitely come back again!",5,2023,05,23
205,Very nice hotel,Excellent hotel. Great staff and impeccable service. Stayed for a week for business.

205,A dream visit,"An amazing staff at a wonderful hotel. We stayed here for our wedding anniversary and we had the best night. 

On arrival, we were upgraded to a suite and met with welcome drinks. The room was huge!! 

We had cocktails in the bar and a wonderful meal in the lounge.

This is when an  extra step made by the staff here turns the stress moment into a pleasant experience. Kostiantyn is an exceptional young man who made my day while he went an extra mile to help me when I missed my breakfast just before departure. Thank you. ,5,2023,04,28
205,Excellent Hotel / restrictive pool hours,"The hotel is great. The rooms are super spacious, well-appointed, and impeccably clean. The bed was incredibly comfortable.
The service was good, and I felt very well taken care of during my stay. The drinks at the hotel bar were also excellent, with a fantastic selection of cocktails, wine, and beer

However, I do have an important complaint: one of the reasons I pick the Intercontinental and not the other hotels,  is the pool. They have a lap swimming pool. At the end, I could not used it as the opening hours are simply not conveniently.

The pool doesn't open until 7am and closes at 7pm, which I found to be super frustrating. Anyone who has appointments early in the morning and returns to the hotel after 6:30pm won’t be able to use the pool! I found the hours to be quite restrictive. 

I would suggest that the hotel reviews the pool opening hours to better accommodate guests that are working or doing sightseeing during the day. ",4,2023,04,28
205,Spacious and decent,"Very spacious room. Was quite impressed by the space. Well decorated. Not the best location in town for business purposes. But a few steps away is a nice residential area. As traffic in morning rush hour could be bad, need to leave some buffer on the road.",4,2023,04,25
205,Konstantin's very useful advice about silver spoons and eggs.,Excellent service overall.

Would have liked an alternative pillow option as the standard ones were a bit too soft, but still a very good sleep and in a very quiet location.   Staff very welcoming and helpful, and I felt at home.",5,2023,04,20
205,Fabulous week in Dublin,We had the most amazing experience! The hotel staff was very knowledgeable & helpful! Jane & Clemence we’re very accommodating. The breakfast was superb and staff was excellent! We especially loved Muzzy! He was wonderful with my daughter & she loved helping him with the doors! We will certainly be back!!,5,2023,04,14
205,Discriminatory - avoid,"Disgraceful if I could give this hotel less than one star I would.

I am autistic - that means NOTHING to this hotel far from it.
They have no policy, no facilities, no quiet space and absolutely no understanding.

On my last day of holiday with my small children there was a conference in the hotel - at breakfast it was very loud and busy so I told the manager I was autistic. Not only did he do nothing he went and fawned over the conference staff while my children waited over 20 minutes for boiled eggs and soldiers and I proceeded to meltdown.

I recahed the point where I was rocking and tearful and just before screaming. My wife intervened with my headphones and I moved MYSELF to a quieter space with my calm app and my WIFE  brought me in my breakfast and had to go ask for the music in that room to be shut down.

When I complained at reception I was met with “he didn’t mean to upset you.” That is it that is all.

I had been sitting in a crowded lobby 20 minutes at this stage and was pretty upset.

I asked to speak to a higher up manager - begrudgingly he came out and the first thing he said was “lower your voice” while gesturing downwards with his hands. To an already upset AUTISTIC person.

I am floored by the diacrimination I encountered at this hotel. I have had better treatment in a greggs. 

Shocking and I welcome a response from your LEGAL TEAM when you read this",1,2023,04,14

205,Great hotel outside of the tourist area,"The hotel and staff were great. The breakfast was delicious.

It's a beautifully made building with the finest of fittings. Best sleep imaginable ( most important thing of all for us)
The absolutely friendliest staff, desk, concierges, dining and housekeeping, everyone cares about your comfort. The most wonderful lobby ever to dine in, especially when solo to people watch. The pool and spa area are total luxury so much that you will wish for rain as an excuse to spend the day there.
The location is beyond amazing too. Literally across the road from the Dart train... one day we went 2 stops to Blackrock,  another night just a few stops to the  Grand canal theatre. Daughters took it to town and loved walking through Trinity. We've stayed here several times and each time can't wait to return.

205,Kind & Attentive Staff Elevate this 5-star Hotel,"There's a reason celebrities flock to this hotel - personal and private service without any intrusion. I had not stayed in the Intercontinental Dublin in a few years and I was welcomed back with open arms by Gary at reception and Isaac escorting me to my room. Gary called my room to make sure I was happy with everything just five mins after arriving, which I thought was a lovely detail. I found him kind and highly professional with small requests acted on immediately which was greatly appreciated. Antonio in the Lobby Lounge made my sister and I feel like superstars, even though she was not a guest of the hotel and she herself can not wait to book a stay for herself and her family. The next morning I was greeted by Isaac who inquired if I needed any assistance getting to and from the city. I really enjoyed the kind, staff who were trained to a high level, as having previously worked in hospitality - I really appreciated their attention to detail in all departments from food and bar service to accommodation. I could not have asked for a better welcome and I look forward to returning for a truly relaxing stay again.",5,2023,02,13

205,Worst hotel experience of my life,"My family and I recently stayed at the Intercontinental Hotel on NYE. Having worked in the  retail industry throughout the festive period, we were looking forward to a well deserved weekend of R & R. However, our experience was far from that, and so bad in fact that we were compelled to check out and move to the Westbury for the second night of our stay. 
From arrival at the hotel when the staff couldn’t honour a dinner reservation we had previously made , to being accused of booking our stay through a bogus website,  the quality of service we received,  in particular from the manager on duty , was rude, abrupt and substandard to say the least. Having travelled all over Europe for business I can safely say it was the worst hotel experience I’ve ever had. 
The manager was abrupt and dismissive and at one point suggested that we take out complaint to ‘our room or the Gardai ! ‘
We will certainly not be returning to the Intercontinental in the future .",1,2023,01,24
205,Best hotel ever,I went to Ireland to celebrate my brother's retirement. He is a captain for Delta Airlines and was flying his last flights to and from Dublin.

I felt completely recharged, refreshed, relaxed and genuinely felt at home in the Intercontinental. 

The atmosphere within the hotel was so soothing. The music, the views and the service from the waiting staff made everything seem smooth and easy. 

Can’t wait for my next stay! I’m literally counting down the days. 

Thank you",5,2023,01,13
205,Irish Luxury at its finest - The Intercontinental exceeded expectations and refined what 5 Star Means.,"Whatever I write will not do the Intercontinental justice; it is a place you HAVE to experience for yourself. 

From the moment we arrived, you could feel the luxury, class and heritage of this iconic establishment. 

I booked the Intercontinental for my partners birthday and whilst I reviewed other hotels I can honestly say that this was the best decision. 

Bags were taken to the room, doors were opened and check in was seamless. No stress. No Waiting. Holiday mode was turned on instantly. 

THE ROOM - WOW! The room was immaculate, spacious, temperature, lighting etc. Felt tailored made to make sure we could continue having the easy transition of settling in and enjoying our stay. 

The Intercontinental provided services I didn't even know I needed. As someone who loves to exercise. I found a manual on the desk where there was a paragraph on ""Running"". I was able to get a list of Routes available to run and enjoy the scenery around the hotel which I thoroughly enjoyed.

THE SPA CENTER -  was a breath of fresh air, my partner (who works in the health & wellness industry) LOVED her massage and felt completely relaxed for the remainder of her stay.

THE GYM -  had EVERYTHING you would need to get consistently solid workouts in. This combined with the prestige locker rooms, SAUNA, Pool and Showers made me regret not staying longer. 

FOOD - Breakfast - I devoured a Full Irish. It was sensational.
Dinner  - I originally booked two restaurants outside of the Hotel but with the weather we decided to eat in the Hotel Restaurant. The Menu is short, informative and delicious. 
I went with the Burger and subbed the Chips for Sweet Potato Fries! 
I don't drink alcohol, but I did see some Irish Coffees being escorted through and they looked very appealing. 

** I would also like to mention in a passing comment to Eric (Food Manager I believe) that it was my Partners Birthday. He arranged a ""Happy Birthday"" Plate with Chocolates at the end of the meal. That level of care was simply astonishing.

CHECK OUT - This is always the most important part for me, as I have had experience of when you pay the care ends. This was not the case at the Intercontinental. 
When I had finished paying, I was offered Coffee, Tea, Transport and if I needed information on where I was going. Bags were taken and carefully placed in my Taxi. 

OVERALL - I was simply blown away. The attention to detail, the care, the atmosphere, the facilities was 10/10. I'm currently thinking about when I can next book! 

The Intercontinental is something you NEED TO EXPERIENCE FOR YOURSELF. 

",5,2023,01,12
205,Absolutely lovely,"While it's not an achingly modern hotel, it is in very good repair, and a nice place to be.  The restaurant and lounge/bar area are clean, tidy, and pleasant places to be.  The bedroom(s) (we moved after the first night as I could hear the lifts in the first room) are huge, spacious, and have very comfortable beds.  The bathrooms are similarly large and perfectly fine.  The spa/jacuzzi/gym is well-maintained, although the pool (14m) is just a little short.  It's still usable though.  Food is delicious, with breakfast a real treat (GET THE PANCAKES!), and the lounge menu more than adequate.  We didn't try the restuarant.

What I have to draw special attention to is the staff.  From the Concierge, all the way through the Reception staff, lounge, breakfast, and even the housekeeping staff, everyone was absolutely wonderful and bent over backwards to accommodate all of our requests (no matter how odd: we had wet running shoes and they took them and put them in the boiler room overnight) and engage us in conversation about our daily activities, etc.  Even if the hotel hadn't been as lovely as it was, we'd still have given the place 5/5 for the staff alone.  It's not a cheap place to stay, but the five stars on the door tell you that.",5,2023,01,07
205,Birthday Celebrations,"Myself and a family member stayed at the Intercontinental Dublin over the Christmas holidays and from the moment we arrived at the beautifully decorated reception, the atmosphere was so festive with the stunning Christmas trees. I was checked in by a lovely young man with dark hair and an Irish accent who was more than friendly and helpful. The hotel went above and beyond to accommodate us as we had arrived slightly early due to an early bus. When we arrived in our room we were delighted to explore it as it was beautiful and so spacious. The bathroom and shower were the height of luxury and I was so happy with our room. As the hotel was aware I was celebrating my birthday, they had provided me with a plate wishing me happy birthday and with 4 little mince pies. This was such a thoughtful touch and very much appreciated.

The room had ample wardrobe space, and everything we could possibly need (and more) for our stay.

We ate dinner in the lobby longue restaurant and as a vegan, it was so nice to have options outside of the norm to choose from. The food was very tasty, and the atmosphere was very chilled.

Every member of staff we encountered was very helpful with special mentions to Antonio, Michael the barman, and Issac in reception.

Thank you so much for a fantastic stay. I very much look forward to my next stay.",5,2023,01,06

205,Fabulous Stay,"Just back from a fabulous stay at the Intercontinental Dublin.  The absolute highlight for on this occasion for me was the Spa.  I had a personalised facial with Suzanne Downey and Suzanne was quiet simply the best therapist I have ever had.  Her attention to detail, how she explained the products as well as how she carried out the facial itself was superb.  I had a wonderful relaxing time using all the facilities at the hotel. A special mention re Nicky Logue – the General Manager, he was fabulous as always.  On hand, giving great attention to guests as well as supporting his team – a true gentleman and a true professional.  Thank you, Nicky, and your team.",5,2023,01,03
205,"Great hotel, but “Hello Guys!”","This hotel is great and it is not too far from the center. Our room was  beautiful and specious, clean and the housekeeping did a great job. Also the night service did a marvelous job. Thank you.
But if you don’t want to hear the traffic you do not want a room facing the front of the hotel. 
And now there is a BUT. I am not used to hear immediately when I arrive a new hotel that the waiter says in the morning Hello Guys. And she was not the only one who used this sentence. I am not old fashioned but in a five star hotel?  One expects like Good Morning.
Breakfast was super BUT, the waiters just did not care to take the used plates away although they passed the table several times. And although they brought coffee and saw the used plates, they just left them on the table. They didn’t care, this was my feeling.
And sometimes the message from the front desk did not reach the housekeeping.
There were few great people; John at the front desk, waiter David Earl is a gem that will have a great future in hotel business, he respects the customer and treated us with a honest respect, in the lobby lounge head waiters were super friendly and nice, the  waiters were ok and the food like the fish and the oysters were delicious.
The spa was great as well as the massage, but in the gym the equipments are out-dated. 
In overall great stay but in some places/services the final touch was missing.",5,2022,12,27
205,Wonderful stay,"Our family recently stayed in Intercontinental Dublin  as our son was getting married near by.
From the moment we first made contact with Sinead Doherty in reservations, to our wonderful welcome at reception, to our delicious breakfasts …we couldn’t have been treated better.
I hope we have a reason to stay there again soon!

205,Service like no other,"Enjoyed a lovely relaxing week at the Intercontinental Dublin. Exceptional service as always which is a dream after a long flight. We have stayed here a few times and is our go to hotel mostly due to the great hospitality we receive from all members of staff.
Special mention to Jane the duty manager for going over and beyond our expectations and to lovely Julia at breakfast who was so attentive to our needs and ensuring our young boys had the best breakfast ever! Great work guys!",5,2022,12,17
205,Most memorable stay at InterContinental Dublin,"After an unexpected flight diversion to Belfast due to dense fog, we travelled by taxi arrived almost midnight at this Dublin hotel exhausted. We were delighted with Orlinsa and her team who upgraded us to a family room. The room was spaious, spotlessly clean and luxurious. The buffet breakfast was fantastic and oozing with very fine quality selection.  A standout was its top notch service in the most professional manner in every respect that I have never experienced before in other similar star rated hotel. Our booked  dinner experience was just equally fantastic. This hotel is probably the most underrated 5 star hotel delivering top notch SERVICE and EXPERIENCE in every aspect in our period of stay. I must express special THANKS to Ms Orlinsa at the Reception to have enabled us a wonderful and memorable stay at InterContinental Dublin. I certainly would recommend this hotel anytime.
May I wish you all a Merry Christmas !

The hotel is decorated beautifully, with Christmas trees and ornaments in every corner. The staff made our stay extra welcoming as they were very keen on making everything comfortable for us and suggesting things to do in Dublin!

The suite was beyond compare with the most beautiful decor, duvet and pillows are sublimely comfortable. It’s the extra touches which make it so special, from a fruit bowl delivery from the general manger to the lovely chat on arrival. Barman mixing drinks to order that were not in the menu.  Easily the best experience I have ever had a hotel. Well done and thank you to all the team. ",5,2022,12,06
205,Comfy and Friendly,We stayed here for a weekend and found it to be a great base for a visit to Dublin. Really nice rooms and public areas with extremely friendly and attentive staff.

205,Amazing hotel property with the best service,"IH Dublin is one of my favorite hotels in the world.  Located in the beautiful suburb of Ballsbridge, it is an easy walk into the city (but around 40 minutes, beautiful safe route) and also has quick bus and DART service.  The area has some terrific restaurants and pubs.  

The hotel itself is the star, though.  Huge rooms, and bathrooms that look like and are big enough to be spas. Lovely bathtubs and great separate showers. The beds are extremely comfortable.  The bedding is lush. You might not want to leave your room. 

Add to all that the most welcoming, professional and efficient staff, and I think it would be a favorite hotel for you, too.",5,2022,11,29
205,So many fabulous memories!,"We stayed at IC for Marathon weekend - 4 nights with our two children.  Our room was perfect for our family with two queen beds. The staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and so much special touches for the kiddos (cute halloween cupcakes and two tiny robes in the room - so sweet!). The daily breakfast was super. We enjoyed the pool - the children's hours are perfect as well and a nice touch so others can't enjoy the pool sans children splashing in they choose. 
If you're here for Marathon weekend, the packet picket up was next door as was mile 24-25. It's a perfect location! Additionally, car parking was so easy and convenient. We can't stop talking about our amazing, but quick, trip to Dublin and  hope to come back soon!!",5,2022,11,29
205,So nice to be taken care of!!,"First, the hotel is the best in Dublin.  The room sizes are exceptionally large.  The amenities are well above average.  But the service is where this hotel absolutely shines!   I’ve stayed in dozens of 4 & 5-star hotels where the staff can’t be bothered to even do their jobs.  Not the case with the Intercontinental!  Excellent service from everyone!",5,2022,11,29
205,Superb ,"I am a member of the IHG group. I stay in many IC hotels around the globe. This hotel is the best for customer service that you could imagine anywhere. From check-in you experience warmth with a real expression of gratitude for choosing to stay here in Dublin.
Isaac and Jacqueline behind the front desk set the tone of your stay and in minutes you are tucked up in a beautiful room. I was upgraded to a junior suite, perfect.
Breakfast should not be missed. The super efficient Danielle looks after any requests with the minimum of fuss which is much appreciated in such a fine dining room.
I also visited the spa and booked an eighty minute massage under the care of Angelee. If you have time make sure to visit this spa. It should not be missed.",5,2022,11,29

205,"A lovely relaxing, if quick, visit to the Intercontinental Dublin.","I felt welcome from the moment I arrived. Although my stay was short the hotel felt like home for the 20 hours or so I was there. I was greeted in such a friendly manner by Mariam at reception who got me booked in very quickly but also explained all the services that were open to me. When leaving the next day, she even asked if my internet connection issue had been resolved, which it had been very quickly. The rooms were very spacious, clean and comfortable with ample towels and a lovely warm stand alone shower (vital in my opinion).
We had a fantastic evening in the function room and the food was excellent as was the service. Breakfast the following morning was top notch, with so many choices of food on the menu. Parking was easy and my car was only a few metres from the hotel entrance. I topped it all off with a morning swim in the pool and I must say it was a lovely relaxing time spent in the Intercontinental for me.",5,2022,11,27
205,The most elegant hotel on the Island of Ireland.," My partner surprised us with a stay at The Intercontinental recently, it had been on my bucket- list for years & i had stored some expectations over the years and im so happy to say that they were utterly exceeded, every aspect of our stay was out of this world, from the moment we turned the curb into the hotel grand entrance our minds were blown, the giddy feeling i had harboured for weeks in the lead up to our trip stayed with me and will remain until i get the chance to return, The warmest heartfelt welcome from Jacqueline set the tone of our stay, 
each and every staff member were so warm, friendly & we felt like friends rather than guests. 
I felt compelled to meet the GM to congratulate him & his team on the outstanding customer service, quality of food, attention to detail & stunning decor throughout the Intercontinental. Our bedroom so elegantly presented, the bed i could have stayed in  for a decade. The linen & towels again exceeded all my expectations, linen is my thing. 
We work hard and we felt we had deserved some Luxury what we experienced was sheer opulence. 
Counting the minutes until our next visit

205,Wonderful stay at Intercontinental Hotel,"My wife and I stayed at the hotel last week. We have been coming to the hotel every year since 2010.
It is a beautiful hotel in a lovely location in South Dublin.
At this time of year the hotel looks wonderful with all its Christmas decorations up. We had a fantastic room and the staff spoiled us and our son who joined us to mark his birthday with a lovely dinner in the Lobby Lounge.
I used the gym and the sauna which are great- on previous stays I have used the swimming pool, jacuzzi and steam room as well. The hotel has great leisure facilities.
We had a lovely breakfast the next morning before we left the hotel- we are already looking forward to our next trip in 2023",5,2022,11,21

205,Weekend stay,I stayed here for the 1st time the weekend just gone for a 2 night stay and I have to say I really enjoyed it. I was staying here with my fiancé to celebrate her birthday. This is a fantastic hotel with excellent service. All the staff are so friendly and so helpful. A really nice touch was as the hotel knew we were staying here for a birthday they left a little treat in the hotel room for my fiancé on arrival. We are already planning on staying here again in December but this time for a family trip away with our 2 children. I would highly recommend it to anyone to stay here. Well worth the money,5,2022,11,15
205,Impressive,"We came from Bangkok, Thailand to Dublin for our daughter’s graduation from Trinity College.
     We had good and memorable time during our stay here and in Dublin.
     Room is beautiful, comfortable and spacious. Breakfast is very good, nutritious. Dinner is impressive too. 
     All staffs we met are well trained and service minded, especially Ms Jackie , the lady at the front office.
      We will surely stay here again for our next visit to Dublin.",5,2022,11,14
205,Exceptional,"We stayed for one night as we went to a rugby match in the Aviva. The hotel is in an ideal location for this.

We had fabulous time and would highly recommend. It is such a beautiful hotel. Our room was stunning. It was luxurious, spotless and the bed was so comfortable. 

Both the receptionists we dealt with at check in and check out (Niamh) were super friendly and really helpful. They made the check in and out experiences seemless. 

We ordered dinner to the room which was quick and delicious. 

We had breakfast the next morning in The Seasons Restaurant which was top class. The buffet had so many options to choose from and everything was so tasty. The staff were so attentive and friendly. 

Massive thank you to Doiran and all the wonderful staff at the Intercontinental! 

We look forward to returning.",5,2022,11,13
205,Superb dining experience,"my family and i had booked afternoon tea for my daughters graduation. From the minute that we walked in we were greeted immediately and brought to our table by a lovely gentleman called Antonio. Our waiter Alex couldn't of done enough for us. He explained everything about the afternoon tea experience and made us feel very welcome. The tea selection was out of this world and the staff very quite happy to talk us through anything on the menu.
My daughter is Lactose and intolerant and she had the option to go for the vegan afternoon tea, She even said it herself that she couldn't believe that it was all vegan. She had mentioned the options were amazing and delicious. All of the afternoon tea's were beautifully presented and everything was so fresh. Compliments to the kitchen and the lobby staff. They couldn't of done enough for us and it really made my daughters day so special. The mocktails were very tasty and fresh and what we all really loved was the atmosphere and how attentive everyone was. 
We will definitely be back again.",5,2022,11,07
205,Outstanding,"Stayed one night in the Intercontinental as we were attending the rugby match in the Aviva stadium. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, everything was just perfect. The doormen helped us with our car, we were efficiently checked in by the warm and welcoming front desk team. We took the bus into the city centre which only took a few minutes and it was really convenient being able to walk back to the hotel when the match was over.
We opted for room service dinner which had some great choices on the menu, we really enjoyed everything.
The really standout thing was breakfast which was probably one of the nicest hotel breakfasts I have ever had. Not to mention the staff who were exceptional and who couldn't do enough for us. 

Overall an outstanding visit and we look forward to returning in the future.",5,2022,11,07
205,Wonderful time,"Catching with friends from overseas, we all thoroughly enjoyed our three nights here. The staff are the absolute icing on the cake here - thank you to the lovely ladies in Seasons for our breakfast service each morning, the friendly bar staff and the brilliant Jacqueline on Reception. See you soon again, Elaine Horan",5,2022,11,06
205,Memorable time in lobby lounge,"We had an amazing experience in Lobby lounge, staff were very friendly and professional. We were greeted at the doors by the hostess and brought to our table. The food was delicious and there was a good selection of wine to choose from. We really enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere (the lovely piano playing really added to the great ambiance). Last but not least, should be mentioned that Antonio (manager) was very attentive and handled his team very well. Looking forward to returning again soon!",5,2022,11,01
205,Gold standard !,"From the moment of my first contact when booking the room with Niamh Kemmy I knew  we were going to be looked after as if we were the only guests staying . She sure is the right person to have your first contact with - first impressions always last !

205,Excellent Hotel,"Excellent. 

Very friendly staff throughout. 

The location was excellent (25 minute walk to centre or 20 minute walk to beach). The area itself was very picturesque and had lots of local bars, eating venues and parks.

The pool / spa area was very good (the best of all the IC we have stayed in). 

The food (breakfast and lunch) was good. 

The rooms were very well sized, clean and very well equipped. 

There is no executive lounge, but I did walk past a business lounge. 

There was a children’s treasure hunt (with prizes), which I thought was a great touch. There were no IC children teddy’s, which you get at: Park Lane, Miami, San Fran… but the treasure hunt was a great alternative.

Overall, probably the best IC we have stayed in. Based on this stay, I would highly recommend.",5,2022,10,31
205,Great stay,"Thank you for an enjoyable stay with the family. Staff and service were impeccable, nothing was too much trouble. Thank you Niamh on the front desk for all your assistance. The hotel is very clean and the food excellent.",5,2022,10,30
205,Amazing,"5 stars will not do it justice! May be 7!
Was amazing!
People are beyond nice!
So classy, they will drop everything’s d get out of their way to help you from the doorbell to the front desk to the restaurant!
Can’t say enough 
I will come back millions time if I can.",5,2022,10,29
205,The BEST Dublin has to offer.  PERIOD,"I have been fortunate to stay at The Intercontinental Dublin many, many times, mostly for business, but also for pleasure.  I have ALWAYS had 5-Star service from every single employee.  From the front desk, to the bar, to the spa, to security, management, restaurant, housekeeping, door/luggage staff, concierge, etc...  Every single staff member is kind, friendly, professional, eager to please in any way they can.
I am always greeted by name with a warm, since smile.  I can honestly say, it feels like home to me and I always look forward to my next stay, and am sad when it has been too long!
It is in a quaint, quiet suburb of Dublin.  Just far enough to be authentically Irish, but close enough to get into the city.  There are some great shops, restaurant, and pubs nearby as well.  The DART train is just about 5-10 minute walk from the hotel.
The rooms are stunning and exceptionally clean.  The beds are probably the most comfortable I have ever slept in.  With big, beautiful bathrooms and large rooms, you never feel like you are in a hotel room, but a luxury resort.
The spa is wonderful!  Soaking in the hot tub or relaxing in the steam room is a must, especially to combat jet-lag.  The staff at the bar make excellent cocktails and are very friendly.  The breakfast buffet is extensive and delicious served by attentive and friendly staff.
I have rarely had any issue, but on the rare occasion I have, it has been handled immediately and exceeds my expectations.  The team here is second to none.
I travel all over the world for business and have stayed in many high end hotels.  The Intercontinental Dublin is at the top of my list.  So much so that when I travel to Dublin for pleasure, I always chose to stay here.  ",5,2022,10,23
205,Super experience,"Amazing hotel. Super professional staff and unique spaces to visit. First class experience, some of the best rooms I’ve ever seen in a five star hotel and the spa and wellness options are really amazing!",5,2022,10,23
205,Staff are the best in Dublin.,"Kostia (Konstantyn) from the Ukraine was our waiter each and every morning at the breakfast at Seasons.  He was the sweetest, most gentle young man and was so friendly!!!  His service was what we looked forward to each and every morning of our stay.  He was a real stand out among staff we encountered anywhere through out Dublin.

The front desk was great,  The concierge helped us get tickets to the local LEINSTER Rugby match!  Each staff member from Valet to Manager was kind and made us feel special and welcomed!

Even our cabby told us the staff at Intercontinental were the best in the city from thier perspective as well.

The hotel itself is in a great location and we walked everywhere.  It's just enough out of the city center to make it feel peaceful and quiet.  The place has an elegance that isn't stuffy or pretentious - just classy and clean!

The only area we felt was slightly less than very good was housekeeping.  They repeatedly forgot to leave us face cloths.  On one occasion, they  forgot to clear away dirty coffee cups and replace with clean.

We had room service many times as well and each time the service and food were great and very timely.

I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to friends and family.",5,2022,10,23
205,The best of Dublin!,"The InterContinental Dublin has been absolutely wonderful. We were here for a mix of business and pleasure. There was a snafu with our room checking in, and the staff was apologetic and gracious. For the rest of our four days here in Dublin, every staff member we met and whom we asked for recommendations was so helpful and made us feel special. They opened up Dublin for us as first time visitors. The neighborhood is also wonderful, only blocks away from a high-speed tram that goes across the city. Dubliners are the best! Everything here is ""lovely."" You must come to this extraordinary place!",5,2022,10,21
205,best of the best,"This is probably the best Intercontinental hotel in the world. 
(I've been to about 32 different countries)
Beautifully decorated, spacious rooms and very friendly and helpful staff, staying at this hotel is like staying in a castle.  Tucked in a quiet neighborhood of Dublin, you'll enjoy the serenity of the area.",5,2022,10,20
205,Highly recommend this Fantastic Hotel,"We had a fantastic night in your beautiful hotel with the warmest welcome from the Concierge and the friendly receptionists. We received an upgrade to a spacious comfortable and immaculate suite with everything you might need on hand to make your stay feel welcoming, we especially liked the Espresso Coffee machine and well-stocked mini bar. Our bed was so comfortable and fresh with the very soft duvet and comfy pillows. Dinner in the Lobby Lounge was top class and the pianist entertained us for the evening. In the morning Breakfast was served in the Seasons Restaurant, it was faultless with a wide selection of food to choose from. The service in this Hotel throughout our stay was excellent. We would definitely recommend a stay in this fantastic hotel to our family and friends.",5,2022,10,18
205,"Four Seasons, Five Stars. Lovely surroundings and beautifully decorated for Halloween. I dined alone on my first night  the food","I arrived on my own and was running a little late for the spa, I was not put under any pressure and was given my full two hours of really excellent treatments. 
The bread at breakfast is amazing!
Great dinner alone on my first evening, piano being played both nights. 
Really comfortable bed, most important the pillows and quilt we soft and welcoming. ",5,2022,10,18

They will get out of their way to do anything to make your stay pleasant I would say this hotel is not even five-star the minimum you should get it Seven Star I will stay there every single time I will go to Europe .",5,2022,10,16
205,Fair visit made better by staff,"Stayed overnight this weekend. Highs and lows. 

Highs: 
The room was spectacular. Outrageously huge and comfortable bed. Nespresso machine with good coffee selection. Well stocked mini bar. Beautiful spacious room and bathroom. Fantastic deep bath. Top class. Couldn’t fault a thing here. 

The hotel decor is Beautiful. 

The staff are fabulous. Huge shout out to Danielle in the season’s restaurant for both dinner and breakfast. She is a star! She was so nice and couldn’t be more helpful. She honestly made our stay so much better. 

The food is delicious. Seasons restaurant was lovely and the sea bass to die for. 

The cocktails are the best I’ve ever had and although crazy price at €16 each I can’t fault them they were delicious. 

Lows:
The shower gels etc we’re empty, had not been refilled. Only realised when I was in the shower. Annoying. 

The shower overflows, the shore hole is not fast enough for the fast running water. 

The lift got stuck and we were trapped for about five minutes which seemed like an eternity due to my absolute terror. Ringing the buzzer didn’t work. Nobody came. Nobody answered the bell bell. We eventually got out by chance when it moved by itself. Awful experience. 

It is way overpriced. And unjustifiable in its prices. A bottle of wine for dinner that retails at 12€ was €50!!!! Extortion. 

The swimming pool and wellness area was extremely disappointing for a five star hotel. 

We were unlucky in that we stayed on a night there was a black tie function and the bar is very small so early in the evening the bar was overrun with these guests. There is v little areas to sit around the foyer, lobby area.",4,2022,10,16
205,Simply the best.,"Stepping through the lobby I was immediately struck by the beautiful reception area.  Beautiful fresh flowers greet you as you enter.  Interrcontinental Dublin is  in a great location, beautiful neighborhood with great running spots.  The bedrooms are pleasant and spacious.  The bed is second to none, I felt like I was sleeping on a cloud.  The breakfast is amazing,  the restaurant staff always greeting us with a smile, it’s a great way to start your day. 
The spa area was a great escape, I really enjoyed relaxing in the hot tub. 
Be sure to stop by the lobby bar for an expertly prepared cocktail. 
The  thing that makes this such a great place to stay are the staff they are incredibly helpful and generous with their time and advice. The level of customer service is second to none.
If you want to be pampered and treated well, this is the hotel for you.",5,2022,10,16
205,Elegant Hotel in Dublin,"My family and I travelled to Dublin for a long weekend. While my husband and I have been to Dublin numerous times, it was my two son's first time visiting the country's capital. From the moment we arrived on site, we were greeted by friendly staff who were more than happy to be helpful. Check in was quick and efficient. The room was on the third floor and the moment we stepped in, it was by far the most elegant and spacious room we had seen in Dublin. The hotel has an on site spa which includes a pool, gym, steam rooms and saunas. The hotel also has 3 restaurants and 2 bars. The location is in a quiet, leafy neighborhood in Dublin and we loved it. Next time we are in Dublin, we will not hesitate to stay here again.",5,2022,10,15
205,Excellent all round! A luxurious home for 2 nights! ,"What a trip. Stayed for two nights, warm and welcoming service. Breakfast was incredible. Spa excellent. Great bar service.

We had an evening meal and breakfast and neither dissappointed. Enjoyed a few drinks in the cosy atmosphere of the bar. The staff are so friendly and efficient from reception to hosptality. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and what surprised me was  even though the hotel is so big the atmosphere is one of welcoming,relaxation, cosiness and   friendliness.",5,2022,10,12
205,FIRST CLASS EXPERIENCE!,"Beautiful hotel with 1st class charm, people, amenities and service.  The room was spacious, comfortable and immaculate.  The staff was delightful and friendly.  We were a short cab ride from the Grafton Street area, museums, churches and Trinity College.  We will be back.",5,2022,10,11
205,5 Star experience,"5 Star experience. Great facilities for business and some down time. Excellent attentive service by the staff, particularly the receptionist. Would highly recommend staying for business and for pleasure. Ideally located in Dublin 4 and only a short trip via taxi to city Center",5,2022,10,10
205,One of the nicest hotels I have stayed in,Hotel + staff are incredibly nice. Rooms/beds are very comfortable. The large bathtubs are nice to relax after a long day. The spa is very clean and massage treatments are well worth it . Each time I’ve gone I have never been disappointed. Love that  adult swim is separate from child swim times. This is one of my favorite hotels and I travel quite often.,5,2022,10,09
205,Business visit to Dublin,"For a short business trip to Dublin I chose to stay at my favourite hotel, the Intercontinental Hotel in Ballsbridge. After working from home for some time it was a delight to be welcomed back by the staff at the front desk. My room was elegant, as usual, and was perfectly sanitized. Due to time restrictions my dining experience was limited but very enjoyable. I would definitely recommend the Intercontinental Hotel to anyone who enjoys an elegant hotel with outstanding staff, located in a quiet suburb of Dublin but with easy access to the City Centre.",5,2022,10,07
205,Outstanding,"We stayed in this hotel for the first time this weekend! Amazing is an understatement! Before we walked through the front door we felt completely welcome. All staff members were so polite, friendly and efficient. The hotel itself is absolutely gorgeous and is in a perfect location. Our room was perfect and the breakfast delicious. Thanks to you all for such a wonderful stay. We'll absolutely be back again!",5,2022,10,05
205,My happy place!,"I’ve had the pleasure of staying at this hotel many times and every time is as special as the last. This is by far my favorite hotel in Dublin where you will always receive a warm welcome and everyone makes you feel at home. The rooms are superb, beds are luxurious and breakfast is delicious. Thank you again and looking forward to my next stay!",5,2022,10,04
205,Exceptional hotel!!,"I stayed here this weekend just gone & could not have been looked after any more. Wonderful staff, breakfast was scrumptious & overall a lovely experience. The beds are so comfortable & my room was fabulous. I would definitely recommend without a doubt!!",5,2022,10,04
205,Simply Perfect!,"From start to finish we had the most wonderful stay, as always! Upon entering we received the warmest of welcomes and were made to feel so comfortable and relaxed. The hotel itself is beautiful and immaculate with everything you need for a luxury stay.  Would highly recommend this wonderful hotel,  thank you for making our stay so memorable x",5,2022,10,04
205,Very relaxing and enjoyable stay.,"Very relaxing and enjoyable stay on Friday night. Had dinner in the lounge and our son and his girlfriend joined us  , and the food and drinks and service where excellent. 
Went for a swim on Saturday morning and used the Spa which was also excellent. 
Thanks to all the staff and we will definitely be back.",5,2022,10,03
205,Weekend getaway,"Worth every visit, as always! You can never fault in every details specially a relaxing ambiance in dining area.
Feeling being away from busy life of Dublin and treating yourself with a great respect of your body just to relax and leave the worries behind.
Such a pleasure and how I appreciate the hard work of the crew and professionalism.",5,2022,10,02
205,Classic hotel in excellent location,"Classic hotel with top class service. Located in a beautiful area of Sooth Dublin. We dated to celebrate a graduation in our family. Access to the city centre is very easy, with options of bus, train or taxi. We all really enjoyed the experience and certainly will be back again very soon",5,2022,10,02
205,The ultimate in hospitality,"The Intercontinental has been my choice in Dublin for several years. While the fixtures and furnishings are beautiful and comfortable and meet your every need, it is the people that make your stay wonderful. Everyone, from the front desk and dining staff to housekeeping and the bell staff, makes each guest feel welcome and very well cared for.  It is a treat to stay here.",5,2022,10,01
205,"Lovely Hotel, hard to fault","The hotel is very traditionally styled and looks amazing. The rooms are very spacious and the bathroom is very nice with marble and glass. The breakfast is as you would expect with lots of choice and looks and tastes great. The pool area is ok, it’s not very big but for a one or two night stay it’s fine for a dip. Annoyingly the steam and sauna rooms are in the changing rooms so if you are away with your partner/friend of a different sex then you can use these areas together. They charge extra for parking to  it car so be aware, it’s not a huge charge but I personally think is a bit of a low blow given the cost of the room, parking should be included. The staff in this 5 star hotel are very professional but lack a little in warmth/character. It’s not a criticism but personally I like to chat to staff but it didn’t feel like they were allowed to have chit-chat with guests or even have a laugh",4,2022,09,29
205,Great for families!,"My wife, three kids and I had a lovely stay at the Intercontinental Dublin. From the porter's welcome, to the incredibly helpful concierge who put together a phenomenal weekend, to the valets --- a great team and property! Lap pool and gym are very nice, as is the breakfast buffet.",5,2022,09,26
205,Fantastic Service,"Stayed here with family for the Garth Brooks concert and had 2 rooms. Reception staff were friendly and helpful as were the concierge who whisked away our bags to be taken to our rooms. 
Rooms were spacious and clean. Breakfast was fantastic with tea and juice served at the table where you could also order non buffet items. Sausages were of good quality and I had the best scrambled egg ever from a buffet. 
The lobby lounge was very relaxing and the food was good and again the wait staff were fantastic.
The Spa was also good and had designated swim times for children. 
Reception  gave us a late checkout after my son had been up all night with an earache so he could have a sleep in.
We will definitely be booking again.",5,2022,09,19
205,My happy place,"I visited the Intercontinental again this weekend as I was attending the Garth Brooks concert... Once I parked the car I felt I was home.  The welcoming smile from the concierge and the reception staff right through to lunch on the sun terrace was so lovely. I had a friend with me who had not stayed here before and it was great to watch her delight - attentive servers with big smiles and friendly chat, to our beautiful room, she like I was smitten.  Nicky and his team have hospitality down to a fine art- 5 star service with a smile and a kind word, never stuffy. I love this hotel and all who work there, if you get the opportunity to visit, grab it!  You will love every moment ..... and if you like whiskey you will love the bar, so many varieties, so little time!",5,2022,09,18
205,Ireland,Konstantine did a wonderful job taking care of us at breakfast. He is an asset to the InterContinental Dublin. The service was wonderful throughout our stay. Karina was so helpful at breakfast. David at the bar was exceptional. Very knowledgeable about the gin from Ireland. We'll be back.,5,2022,09,17
205,Dublin tour.,We chose this hotel and could be happier.  The rooms are fabulous but the best thing is the staff. We were treated like the most important guests there were as well as everyone we saw. 5 stars are not enough.,5,2022,09,15
205,Irelands Luxury League,"This is a fantastic 5 Star hotel, with staff providing the highest level in high end, luxury service. From the warm, welcoming front desk staff, to the service provided by every member of staff in the Lobby, or anytime we dined in the gorgeous Season's Restaurant. The suite was amazing, with the most comfortable of beds. They have thought of all amenities, so we never need to ask for anything. The Spa / Pool is an oasis in the city. Ideal after a days shopping! We cant wait to return.",5,2022,09,12
205,My go-to Dublin hotel!,"As always, an absolutely faultless stay.  From check-in with Niamh to breakfast with Danielle this is my go to hotel any time I stay over in Dublin.
We were wined and dined to the highest standard in the Lobby Lounge with a beautiful and calming atmosphere - I'm just sorry I didn't catch the name of the maitre de at dinner.",5,2022,09,06
205,Could not be better,"Celebrated my birthday in the Lobby Lounge (table was  in the courtyard), from the start everything was absolutely brilliant! Staff, service, food quality and presentation - I thank  all the team ! Lana, Erick, Osama, all kitchen team, you guys just made my day! Really appreciated!",5,2022,09,05
205,"Dawn to dusk, Dublin at its best.","Every moment at the Intercontinental Dublin was a joy. The staff members were friendly and helpful, food delicious, and grounds and facilities beautiful to enjoy. Breakfast buffet was exceptional with so many choices! Workout facility and spa enjoyed every day of our stay. Thank you for starting off our Ireland adventure in the best possible way.",5,2022,09,03
205,Lovely Hotel,"We love this hotel - spacious room, good location and most importantly, wonderful staff.  A word of appreciation to Jane for her helpfulness and professionalism which made our stay so enjoyable. 

The breakfast buffet is impressive - served in a beautiful room and attended by competent staff.

We look forward to returning soon. 🇮🇪",5,2022,08,30
205,Awesome hotel!,"We traveled to Dublin for the Nebraska/Northwestern football game. I researched all of the 5 star Dublin hotels before our trip. I was a bit worried about the location of the Intercontinental being a bit of a drive from the City Centre. It was never an issue...always a car available and a very quick drive to anywhere in the City Centre. Beautiful quiet neighborhood and within walking distance to Aviva Stadium. The hotel is amazing, staff was always helpful and pleasant. The lobby bar has a perfect, elegant vibe. Everything was beyond perfect!",5,2022,08,29
205,Exceptional service in a great location,"My kids and I finished up our summer vacation at the Intercontinental . From the minute we walked in, service has been exceptional. My kids were in a king room and I had a suite. Beds are very comfortable. Top of the range toiletries and immaculately cleaned facilities. We especially loved all of the common areas including the bar and restaurant. We love the pool! Despite a full hotel, there was no compromise on service. We are already planning our trip back next year as the location is also perfect. Close to the city and super quiet.",5,2022,08,28
205,Repeatedly Our Favorite Hotel in Dublin,"We have been to Dublin several times and the InterContinental has become our go-to favorite.  The only downside is that it’s located away from city center, but it’s still walkable (for us) and in a quiet part of town.  The staff, food, and drink are all of the highest quality and even the standard rooms are very generous in size compared to most other hotels.  It’s very well maintained and spotlessly clean.",5,2022,08,28
205,Amazing hospitality in an amazing setting,"The welcome on arrival to the hotel was second to none. The team all stopped their tasks to welcome me as I walked through the hotel. My room was spotlessly clean and the bed gave me my best nights sleep in a long time. The food we had in the restaurant was stunning and the team were attentive during service. You can definitely fill up on breakfast, as the breakfast team put out a generous array of foods to chose from with the addition of a la carte should you wish. Even though the environment at this hotel is amazing it is the team that truly make it sing, setting the standard for luxury service.",5,2022,08,26
205,Absolutely perfect!,"We had a fantastic time here, staying two nights. Lovely room with a great breakfast. The hotel is spotlessly clean and very helpful staff especially Jane at the front desk. Pool temperature was perfect and the hotel is very clean. Would highly recommend!",5,2022,08,25
205,Setting the 5 star standard for hotel service in Dublin.,"Having tried most of the top hotels in Dublin over the years, we have firmly settled on the Intercontinental for our return trips to Ireland. The deciding factor has become the great welcome and fantastic Irish hospitality you receive here, coupled with the exceptionally spacious rooms.  

Whilst Intercontinental is around 20-30 minutes walk into the centre of the city, we spent a lot of our latest visits exploring its surrounding neighbourhoods which were incredibly interesting - The Mayfair of Ireland, without the Attitude.  

The highlight of our trip was the great Irish Breakfast offered by Intercontinental each morning, served by Konstantine (I hope that is right spelling), an exceptional young Ukrainian waiter who offered the most professional and genuine welcoming service I have seen in any hotel for a very long time.   Konstantine will no doubt end up running a hotel somewhere at some time, but for now the Intercontinental and their guests have the pleasure of his service. 

The front of house staff are all great, and we always use the pool and spa on each visit which is very good for a city hotel.  

We will look forward to our next visit.",5,2022,08,25
205,Best Service And Luxurious Hotel,"The staff are so friendly and helpful, I really enjoyed my stay at this wonderful hotel. I would rate everything a 10/10. Whether it was breakfast, lunch or dinner the food was impeccable. The pool and spa area was very relaxing and peaceful. Overall all my needs were met and my expectations were exceeded.  I would completely recommend that you stay at this hotel!",5,2022,08,25
205,Dublin Horse Show,"Lovely Hotel with FABOLOUS STAFF. We stayed there while attending the horse show on Sunday. Every member of staff we met were so nice...genuinely friendly,attentive and helpfull. Possibly the busiest weekend of the year and we had excellent service  We will definitely be back.",5,2022,08,23
205,Superb hotel in excellent location,Stayed here for the horse show and it couldn’t have been more convenient. Right next to the RDS and a short walk to many bars and restaurants. Food was quite good. The bar service was very slow but it was very busy. The rooms were beautifully decorated and very comfortable. Efficient and friendly staff.,5,2022,08,21
205,Underwhelming,"Started our stay with a lengthy discussion about our rate in spite of the fact that our rate had been confirmed by email and also on the app.
Our room was not ready at 3pm, which is the check in time.
My wife was served a dish with bacon in spite of the fact, we made it clear, when ordering, that she is vegetarian; we send the dish back, and the waiter returned after less than 1 minute meaning the chef had just removed the bacon and returned the same dish. Also, we were served a salad, which was for sharing and which contained prawns. Again, the chef just removed the prawns and served the same salad to us; fast but so disappointing.
Overall, the food in this hotel is substandard for a 5 star hotel.",3,2022,08,09
205,Anniversary,"We had a beautiful stay. Everything was fabulous from the sangria in the bar before dinner, to the customized omlette at breakfast. I didn't want to get out of bed because it was so comfy and luxurious. The team in Seasons and at breakfast were particularly charming. My only suggestion is for some more ambient music in the bar. Thanks so much for an incredible time.",5,2022,08,02
205,Excellent Hotel,We had an excellent experience with this hotel.  The hotel and its amenities were first-class.  The hospitality provided by the hotel staff was top-notch.  The location is great because it is slightly removed (and quieter) from the hustle and bustle of downtown but still quite accessible.  We will definitely be staying in this hotel the next time we are in Dublin.,5,2022,07,12
205,Disappointed and unimpressed,"The old saying you can put lipstick on a pig but its still  pig runs very true with this establishment, upon arrival the ambience rang true for  5 star establishment but unfortunatley the same couldnt be said for the rest, and the floor managers can take the blame.
No shortage of staff but left waiting for 20 minutes for  menu, breakfast was a joke €23 for a bowl of rice crispies and a cup of coffee.
Room was nice and bed was comfortable, managment would learn a few tips from some 4star hotels in regard to customer care and where breakfast is included in the package.
I was shocked to be told no food available in the bar as the kitchen was closed but turned to my left as another group was tucking into cocktail sausages, chicken gougons the works, further insulted when i realised that the group included a hotel manager.
Wont be back as value for money is most certainly not something you could say about this hotel.
A wedding anniversary i wont forget for the wrong reasons.....",1,2022,07,10
205,Ms,"The room is clean and spacious. Bathroom really nice and has nice brand of shampoo etc. most important is the all the staff from Conceirge, bell boys, front desk and spa r really friendly and helpful! You feel very welcome in the hotel. They helped us check in early and check out late because of schedule. The room is fantastic and hotel the same. Neighborhood is so cute as well. Definitely will come back.",5,2022,07,09
205,Best hotel experience!!,"One of the best hotel experiences I’ve had. It was my first time to Dublin and we chose the Intercontinental as I’ve stayed there in LA. 
Beautiful hotel and top of class experience! 
Isaac at the Bell hop desk made the experience that much better. I hope to get back there!! 
Highly recommend this hotel!",5,2022,07,04
205,Good help must be hard to find,"The Dublin Intercontinental Hotel was originally a Four Season’ s hotel. The property is exquisite, the rooms lovely.  My stay was perfect until I encountered the breakfast staff. The breakfast buffet was beautifully displayed; unfortunately the breakfast staff was unprofessional and uncaring. I was not furnished with an alternative menu when seated. The experience went downhill . I had to leave my table to find a staff member to ask for coffee . Was ignored when I tried to find someone to take an omelette order . I had to search a staff member out to collect my check , leaving my table after trying to make eye contact with a staff member for 15 minutes . I was told “no problem “by a woman  over 50 when I requested items after getting her attention; in other words the service was not attentive. My table piled up with dishes as I proceeded to dine in an elegant room. The staff probably would best be suited waiting tables at the Waffle House ….. not an elegant hotel.",3,2022,06,30
205,"Yeah, this really happened...","Imagine you check into the IC Dublin for your first ever 5 nights in Ireland, you're travel weary, go put your head on the pillow at 1pm for a much needed power nap and then...BANG BANG of hammering and the shrill of power tools courses through your brain. That's right, the IC put us smack in the middle of a construction zone! I do not mean in next building...I mean on my floor and across the hall!

Yep, 700 Euros per night for a suite, on a floor with construction. And the disappointment did not end there...the shower floor marble was embarrassingly mildewy, shower head barely worked (twice requested maintenance to swap it out...nope) and the room would never cool properly (sweaty nights). And returning hungry to the IC after a concert at 10:15pm we learned ""no food served after 10pm except room service""...wait, what?!?!? at the IC, nothing opened after 10pm?  Unreal.

Dublin and Ireland in general are everything you've heard. Amazing. But next visit we will be staying across the street.

I gave the IC a second star owing the the staff, which was entirely friendly and helpful...our issues are solely with management. The team is genuinely top shelf.",2,2022,06,29
205,Fantastic,"We had to leave a review and thank the staff for such excellent service.  In particular, Javier at the front desk anticipated out requests in advance and was absolutely wonderful.  Yuming who was out waiter at breakfast had the coffee waiting when we arrived and faultlessly served us perfectly.  And as always Isaac at the front door is one in a million- love seeing his friendly face when we arrive and he is always ready to help however he can.  Intercontinetal  Dublin - you hire very well!!   Your staff is incredible!",5,2022,06,26
205,Great Experience! From beginning to End!,"Staying at this hotel made a difference.  From the moment we arrived until we departed ALL employees were extremely nice!  They took the time to help us with our needs and we received great service.  The spa was a plus, clean and a great variety of machines to exercise! Breakfast is so vast and the meals of high quality!  Front desk employees were very attentive at all times, they helped us book tours around the city and took the time to give us variety of options, this was added value.... last but not least the room was great! clean, more than good size!  They really made us feel important and cared! Keep up the good work!",5,2022,06,22
205,Sisters night away,"From check in to check out and everything in-between, the Intercontinental is one of the best if not the best hotel I have ever stayed in. We were in Dublin to attend a concert and decided that we needed a touch of luxury.  We requested an early check in so when we arrived at midday,  our room was ready for us. Spotlessly clean, fabulous beds, divine pillows and the most comfortable bed linen ever. All the facilities are of the highest standard.  We went to the Garden Lounge for lunch and a cheeky cocktail and it was both reasonably priced and delicious! Breakfast the next morning was fabulous,  anything and everything that you could imagine was there to chose from. The things we were most impressed with were the staff, every single one  was superb,  a credit to the management. I look forward to returning with my husband later in the year for another wonderful stay.",5,2022,06,16
205,"Disappointing, experience from booking in to Dining …","Arrived at the intercontinental Dublin full of expectations as people had told us how amazing it is …met with disappointment .. the pool area and changing rooms are tired and full of other guests worn spa garments which in a 5 star hotel and covid you expect more ! In the interest of hygiene please clean up !! 

Pool bottom near steps requires cleaning …

Drunk guests ruining everyone’s outside dining experience not asked to keep it down by waiting on staff even though they could see us all feeling uncomfortable.. which was very unfair for all of us trying to have a nice eating … 

Why give them three  because our suite is comfortable clean and has everything we need … the staff trying to serve on are polite and smiley .. 

Fish was overdone and steak bland … no Pinot Grigio which is unusual for a high class hotel but the alternative offered was good ! 

So at the end of day one I’m yet to be impressed .. crossing my fingers say two is better !!",3,2022,06,16
205,Not a service oriented Hotel,"Money making focused property with a rude front desk not paying attention / focusing in remedying any inconveniences. They only hear the complain and think that bay saying ""sorry"" all problems are fixed and the customer gest satisfied. Terrible housekeeping service making you beg for soap in the shower and leaving your room dirty while even not making your bed. Charging ungiven services for transfers without any considerations. Very bad location (outside city center) very inflexible with room rates. Very limited F&B options at bars with very high prices.
In summary: DO NOT GO THERE...",3,2022,06,14
205,"Exceptional, as always.","Back again for another exceptional weekend. Intercontinental have it to a tee. Kids and parents going home happy. Location, food, service etc all perfect. Hotel was busy and yet staff were attentive to everyone’s needs. Thanks again for a another great memory.",5,2022,06,12
205,Worth every penny,"We stayed for 3 nights in June in a junior suite with 2 young children.  As a former Four Seasons hotel the quality and style of the hotel is at a very high standard and very tasteful in a traditional classic way. The standard of upkeep with cleanliness and maintenance surpassed our expectations, the cleanest hotel we have ever stayed in. The junior suite included a walk in wardrobe with space to store luggage, spacious entrance hall, large bathroom with separate bath and shower (interestingly the separate toilet cubicle had a lock on the outside) and a large bedroom with separate seating area, sofa bed which converted to a bed. A separate kettle and Nespresso machine were provided as were fluffy robes and slippers, even 2 x child size ones. There was an ipod docking station which we didn't use.  All the usual products, shower cap, razor etc but as publicised, Intercontinental now only provide large products for dispensing shower gel, shampoo etc rather than the small plastic disposable versions. This served us absolutely fine and we loved the l'occitane hand soap. The Byredo products seemed a little more masculine in scent but still good. 

The quality of the food and service was generally excellent. Breakfast very civilised with smaller buffet than e.g. a Hilton but all key things there. Much mire civilised than other hotel brands though as many items available to order so no need to stand around waiting for your toast or in the queue for juice as it's brought to your table on request. The Seasons restaurant where breakfast is served is very elegant with beautiful chandeliers and spaced out plush seating/tables so you have some privacy. A little confusion on one morning with an item missing from the plate when a cooked breakfast was ordered but this was quickly resolved with an appropriate level of contrition from the waiting staff.  The lounges were also very pleasant, providing high quality dining options with a live pianist at the grand piano and a lovely ambience. The Irish cheese plate was a highlight.  Only comment for improvement would be that the kids' menu although having multiple choices could benefit from at least one or two simpler options, we ordered several of the kids' meals and they were a little too adult oriented and more sophisticated than most children (at least those we know!) are used to. This actually prevented us from dining there again as although the adult meals were delicious and beautifully presented, we knew our children wouldn't eat much of what was on offer. We dined out locally but also ordered deliveroo one evening. The front desk called us when it had arrived but we had to go downstairs ourselves to collect from outside as the driver wasn't permitted in the building. 

The indoor pool and spa were not large but perfectly sufficient for us especially as we were largely only sharing with one or two other groups at a time. Adult oriented and very relaxing ambience but with dedicated kids/family hours (a slot  in the morning and again in the afternoon) we didn't feel worried about disturbing adult guests without young kids.  The gym looked very well equipped and though we didn't use it, saw what appeared to be personal trainers rotating around guests offering guidance on equipment.  

The location is in the middle of probably the most 
upmarket part of Dublin with embassies and impressive looking townhouses nearby. A 15-20 EUR taxi into the centre of Dublin or a long-ish walk. Within 10mins walk are restaurants and bars.  There is a Dart (railway) station within 5mins walk, Sandymount. We took this one day directly to Howth, a lovely coastal town with a small harbour and stunning cliff top walks, a castle and small market, excellent seafood. Lots of Irish celebrities apparently own property in the town. 

The exterior grounds of the hotel are somewhat limited, apparently 2 acres but we only really saw a courtyard area, v well designed with beautiful shrubs, lawn areas, fountains and mirrors. There are no extensive grounds to walk in but the hotel provides a mapof Dublin including suggested running routes through the local area. The hotel opposite the Intercontinental does look much more grand from outside but the reviews here on TripAdvisor confirmed that it was not at all to the standard of our hotel. 

Overall we had an excellent time at the Intercontinental Dublin. We even overheard locals in a restaurant discussing how nice the Intercontinental is, having arranged afternoon tea as a treat for a friend. The hotel offers a luxurious, relaxing stay with very professional staff dedicated to upholding the high standards. The other guests were all very civilised and respectful and it felt we were in good company. Everyone is extremely friendly and willing to help but that can be said for every local Irish person we encountered throughout Dublin!",5,2022,06,09
205,Relaxing and luxurious 2 night stay,"Really enjoyed our 2 night stay! It was my first time here and we will be back! Stayed with our 1 year old and my parents and sister in a second room!

Reception staff helpful and courteous, especially Jane!
Rooms extremely spacious, clean and comfortable, unlike some other 5 star hotels in city centre. 

Area is calm and peaceful, and ideal if you are looking for a relaxing stay away from the bustle of the city centre! A short walk to Herbert park! We accessed the hotel via the air coach which dropped us a couple of minutes walk away! My parents found access easy by car and plentiful parking!

Lovely cafes, restaurants and bars near by! We really enjoyed Rolys bistro and Baan Thai! Had drinks at Horse Show House and Mary macs! Pharmacy and Spar a couple of mins walk. 

Nice breakfast! Pool was a little small but quiet when we were there! Lobby area bar is lovely with pianist in evening! Spa seems lovely but we didn’t go this time!! 

Will be back again for longer hopefully and plan to have some spa treatments! 

A great stay!! Would highly recommend!",5,2022,06,05
205,Faultless service,"The Intercontinental has everything you could want from a five * hotel: great room, beautiful spa and swimming pool, excellent food and extremely family friendly atmosphere. 

What put it over and above for us during our stay was how the hotel responded to things not going well: my 6 year old came down with some kind of vomiting bug - making quite a mess. The night staff - I can remember the name Alan and another lovely colleague - were amazing. Calm, sympathetic and very good humoured - efficiently cleaning our room and changing bedding. In the morning the concierge desk were also very accommodating in helping us order stomach-soothing off-menu food. 

Really brilliant service and we will definitely go back - hopefully this time with no one getting sick!",5,2022,06,05
205,Excellent 5 +++,"Excellent  experience all round

205,Most relaxing and beautiful Hotel,"Our room was spacious, with beautiful decor and a comfy bed and lounge seating.  The huge windows let in plenty of natural light into the bedroom and  downstairs in the casual eating/bar area you overlook the amazing garden with water features and outdoor seating.  The food and service is impeccable and the staff are friendly and very helpful.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and would highly recommend.",5,2022,06,03
205,Great Hotel on the Emerald Isle,"I’ve stayed here for on a number of occasions and it is a real 5 stay hotel situated in a 5 star area. This is not a budget hotel by any stretch of the imagination but what it does offer in abundance is quality and style. Dublin is simply a very expensive city which can give London, Paris and New York a run for their money but it is simply a fantastic place and this is an equally fantastic hotel",5,2022,06,02
205,Short but sweet!,"We stayed in the Intercontinental Dublin for one night recently to attend a rugby match in the Aviva Stadium. Arriving early did not present a problem as we were welcomed at the front desk, checked in and bag taken in a very short time. The room wasn't ready as it was late morning but our bag was in the room when we returned - late!

We had a very comfortable room, parking and lovely breakfast and were impressed by the friendly efficient staff throughout! Altogether an excellent 5* experience.",5,2022,05,18
205,"Great stay, will be back!!🍀","This is my 2nd time to this great country and it won't be the last! Ireland is a great place to visit!! The intercontinental was perfect! Located in the swanky neighborhood of Ballsbridge, it was posh, modern mixed with vintage decor, and had a friendly staff!! Rooms are roomy, clean, and the hotel is in a great location for walking . You have to take a taxi to the city center but there are local shops and eateries near the hotel. The only  bad thing is if u like to eat late, most kitchens close at 930/10 but u can order delivery [pizza, fries, onion rings] to your room. Also, there is a pharmacy in walking distance,  if you need a covid test [$30],  you get results back in 30mins and they will print it out for you.",5,2022,05,03
205,Classy Dublin Couples Stay,Stayed for NYE. Great food and service. Spacious rooms. Formerly a Four Seasons built in the 00s so a good hard product. The pool/spa was quite small but only a handful of people were there so no issue. About 20 minutes walk to Dublin City Centre. Great buffet breakfast. Evening entertainment was a live cellist which was very classy in the lobby lounge.,5,2022,05,01
205,Very disappointing service,"We visited the hotel on 22-24 of April. Over the 3 days we stayed in the hotel the room was not serviced during this time, no towels, toiletries etc were provided. We asked twice for towel’s etc snd were promised the room would be serviced but were ignored. Eventually on the 3 rd time of asking 2 towels were provided at 11.40 on Saturday night, with the explanation that house keeping was not available.
We brought it to the attention of reception again on check out and were assured that this was a failing by the hotel and a member of management would contact me on that day or the next day. No contact was made. I sent a note outlining my experience a few days ago but unsurprisingly no contact was attempted by the hotel. 
The poor service when we stayed and the worse follow up service was very disappointing and not what is expected from a 5 star hotel but perhaps in the case of this hotel it’s the way they operate. 
In summary the experience offered is not worth the price.",2,2022,04,30
205,Very Enjoyable Stay,"Second time staying at this hotel and it was a real treat. We had booked this Hotel for a getaway to celebrate our 20th Wedding Anniversary two years but Covid prevented that so celebrated 22nd anniversary here last week. Room was spacious and comfortable , service and knowledge of Staff impeccable will be back again no doubt.",5,2022,04,18
205,Fantastic,"My friends and I stayed as part of a treat before my friend gets married. 
Upon arrival we were met by Jane and Niamh who were warm and welcoming on check in. 
In the afternoon we had spa treatments which were fantastic and all three of us couldn’t say better things about our spa therapists.
The room was very big and clean with plenty of room for the three of us.
After we went to the Lobby Lounge where the food was fantastic and the service and cocktails from David were exquisite.
After checkout we decided to have lunch where Diana looked after us with friendly service and the food couldn’t be faulted. 
We truly enjoyed our time and my friend left feeling so special with every staff member giving their best wishes before her big day. A big thank you to all the staff at the InterContinental Hotel for our stay!",5,2022,04,11
205,An outstanding hotel with a level of service to match,"This was my second stay in as many months and I look forward to returning in the next month.

You are welcomed at the property by a team, Doorman, Concierge, Reception that immediately  make you welcome and feel valued. Checking in was a swift and courteous process, the foyer absolutely meticulous and with a view directly out to the terrace.

The condition of elevators are ordinarily a good indicator of what to expect behind room doors, and this holds true here. Spotlessly clean and, for a high footfall area, not showing signs of neglect or wear. The same holds true for the room.

A king size room classically decorated, a full marble en suite, with everything in working order and spotlessly clean in a wonderfully proportioned room. The bathroom benefits from a separate walk-in shower and tub, too often these days you find an over-bath shower that entails the slip hazard of stepping over a high/deep tub side but not here - a fabulously powerful shower with instant hot water.

I’m quite sure that the restaurant offers an outstanding fine dining experience, but I had to work through dinner and so ate in the piano lounge area between foyer and cocktail bar. Service, as can by now most likely guess, was prompt, professional and attentive, the menu with something for all tastes and inclinations - this was quite the contrary to a recent experience at the Conrad in Dublin where trying to dine after 9pm was a quite unpleasant affair. The quality of food was of a high standard and very evidently freshly prepared, delightful.

Breakfast is a very nice way to set-up for the day ahead. The restaurant is huge but at the same time feels very comfortable, it’s so nice to be in a room where everything for breakfast fits on the table and with room to spare for the newspaper - compare and contrast with the absurdly small tables in either the Conrad or Westbury where the arrival of a teapot results in items being discarded to neighbouring tables. Order from the kitchen, or from the buffet, everything is fresh and nicely presented. If on business you seldom have time to dwell over breakfast, staff were courteous and highly efficient, every request taken care of promptly and without fuss or fluster - professional service and very well trained.

I don’t know what else I can say, other than it was disappointing to have to check out (I did so at 6:30 in a most efficient experience thanks to the gentleman on the desk who had also booked my taxi the night before), and I’m already looking forward to my return. A great hotel made even better by the team that cater for your every need.",5,2022,04,02
205,Average stay,"Ordered a 63€ cheese board for room service, kitchen forgot the meat, pickles, olives and apple from it. Was brought another one, was still missing the apple but was completely different from the first one, made me wonder how they forgot it in the first place. When Coming back from spa key card stopes working, had to go to receptionist in a wet robe(mortified). Mug in room was cracked, got boiling hot water all over myself. Receptionist was apologetic but didn’t really do anything about it, but offered me a Ice pack after I had already gotten down to reception. Breakfast wasn’t a great selection for a ‘full Irish’. 

Honestly the girls in the spa were a credit and probably the only thing I’d recommend about this hotel.",3,2022,03,31
205,Amazing stay in Dublin,Staff were so pleasant and really helpful. The hotel was fabulous and a really good location for the rugby game in the Aviva Stadium. Loads of parking even though it was really busy for the weekend that was in it. Highly recommended!!,5,2022,03,22
205,Fantastic visit to Dublin,"I spent 4 amazing nights at the InterContinental Dublin.  The property is gorgeous and the suite I was upgraded to as a Royal Ambassador was spacious and comfortable with a juliette balcony.  The front desk agents were very friendly and helpful.  
The breakfast buffet was really good and had a great selection of hot and cold options (plus cooked to order eggs).  The staff in the restaurant went above and beyond every morning.  
The hotel location is a little outside of the city center but is located a few minutes from Sandymount DART station.  I planned to take the DART on various day trips so this location worked out perfectly for this visit.  
Looking forward to returning!",5,2022,03,18
205,5* and worth it. Love it.,"Just spent 4  gifts here. It had been a while since we could get to Dublin but now that we can it’s so nice staying here. It’s a stunning hotel, great location and fabulous staff. 
We didn’t eat dinner at the hotel but we did have breakfast every day and it’s worth it. Huge selection of fabulous food.
Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2022,03,13
205,Unhappy with the reservation team with very straight forward policy,"Totally unhappy with the experience of the stay at this particular hotel in Dublin. That was the 1st time visiting Ireland in my life. As the highest membership level of IHG together with an ambassador tier of InterContinental, my stay experience with the hotel was being fed up by the reservation team who argued for a penalty charge of one day early check-out. The point is: Isn’t that necessary to push the implementation of the policy so hard to disappoint a Spire Elite Member with Ambassador tier.",3,2022,03,06
205,Chilled and Relaxed,"We had the most lovely and relaxing stay this weekend at the Intercontinental Dublin . From  the minute we landed to the minute we checked out , service and attention to detail was exceptional. Staff are the most polite and helpful , Rooms are spotless and flawless . We had lunch and dinner at Hotel and the food was delicious. . We also had massages and spa time which was just heaven , I can’t wait to book again  soon .

And as for the Breakfast.. Devine 
Ian",5,2022,03,06
205,Great family break,"This hotel provides a really great family break in Dublin.  The staff are very friendly and helpful, the rooms are comfortable as always and dining is both laid back and excellent quality.  It's a hotel that seems to cater for couples, groups of friends, families with kids, and business travellers all at the same time and seamlessly.  Highly recommend staying here.  In addition, the staff went the extra mile to ensure that something very important to my young son which he left behind, made its way back to us at home.",5,2022,02,28
205,Pretty mediocre,"I went here last week with my family and it was pretty mediocre ,the staff were friendly but a lot didn’t have great English and couldn’t really understand what we were saying. The pool was clean and the jacuzzi was huge. The lounge menu was quite limited I thought but all the food was very tasty! One big disappointment was that they gave my 2 teenagers plastic plates, I thought it was quite insulting. I also didn’t like how they had children’s hours for the pool and they were really bad hours as well like 9-12 and 4-7. The beds were ok but the pillows are very flat and uncomfortable! One disappointment was that there was no turn down service! All in all very ordinary nothing special don’t recommend!",3,2022,02,27
205,Great break,"Just back from a 2 night stay and can’t rate it highly enough.
The room was lovely, the service was lovely.
We’d particularly like to mention Aoife from Sligo in Seasons for her professional and friendly service.
We’re looking forward to a return visit.",5,2022,02,27
205,Our stay in Intercontinental Dublin. ,"Our flight was cancelled last Friday due to Eunice Storm. Last minute, we booked one night and two rooms in Intercontinental Hotel Dublin, to celebrate our friend's birthday. We were checked in by Maria. She is very friendly. We had few drinks in the bar and continued with dinner in the Restaurant. Everything was pleasant from service and food. After they served our dessert, one of the staff brought us a plate of chocolate with Happy birthday wishes on it, very pleasant suprise to our friend 😊. In the next morning, around 9ish, there was knocking on the door, it was room service. We bit confused, since we didn't order any breakfast after big dinner from the previous night. To our surprise.. I Ketut arrived with a surprise for the birthday girl. He is a really nice guy who was a great help to us. The reception who checked us out, he friendly as well. We had fabulous time staying in Intercontinental Hotel, thank you to made our stay very pleasant. Thank you 😊",5,2022,02,23
205,Fabulous Overnight Stay,"When we visit Dublin we always choose to stay at the wonderful Intercontinental Hotel. I am an IHG Gold Card member and am always afforded a warm welcome upon check-in.

On our most recent visit I requested an early check-in and this was honoured. We were allocated our room which was on the fourth floor. The room was overlooking the beautiful internal courtyard. The room was spacious and immaculately clean.

We had lunch on our most recent visit in the Lobby Lounge. The service was attentive and the food was of a high standard with a lot of choice on the menu.

We enjoyed breakfast the next morning in The Seasons Restaurant. We ordered off the a la carte menu but also enjoyed the offerings from the buffet. There were many different food offerings - continental meats and cheese, granola, fruit, cereals, croissants, and other various pastries.

The hot buffet also offered an array of different options, eggs, sausages, mushrooms, hash-browns etc.

All in all it was a perfect stay from check-in to check-out.",5,2022,02,23
205,Incredible Intercontinental,"Our family returned to the Intercontinental in February. 

Once again we had a wonderful time.

We had an exquisite lunch with brilliant service and clearly a huge amount of effort goes into creating a thoroughly welcoming ambience in the hotel. 

The decor thoughout the hotel is perfectly tasteful and our room was very well appointed.

Breakfast also deserves special mention with great food and wonderful  thoughtful service and kindness to our children.

As a family we feel like we are on immediate holiday once we cross the threshold of the Incredible Intercontinental.

Graham and Team take a bow on a job well done - exceptional execution.

Thank you
The Hanley Family",5,2022,02,13
205,Relaxing short stay,"My daughter and I stayed for one night in a junior suite.  Large, very comfortable room with kingsize bed and the option of converting the sofa into an additional bed if required. Very friendly and professional staff. The hotel is in a good location, short bus journey to the city center.  We had a very enjoyable dinner in the lobby lounge.  The breakfast was excellent and included a large buffet selection and a variety of cooked to order options.  We will definitely be back for another stay.",5,2022,01,26
205,Great weekend in Dublin,"The Intercontinental was an ideal location for a quick trip to Dublin last weekend, our room was very comfortable, breakfast was top class and the pool was very relaxing. The staff were very helpful and went out of their way to locate a charging point for my EV, unfortunately we couldn’t get one so hopefully that’s something the hotel can add to their extensive list of facilities.",5,2022,01,26
205,5 Stars,"Relaxing and peaceful stay from start to finish. Staff couldn’t do more to make us feel comfortable and welcomed. The sharing platter for lunch was perfect for sharing. The room and spacious, spotlessly clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. Would definitely return and can’t wait for the next visit.",5,2022,01,12
205,New year,We found this hotel excellent in everyway. I these times of restrictions we had no fear whatsoever. From the concierge to cleaning staff the whole team were amazing and could not do enough to make our stay enjoyable and treated you like a relative rather than a guest and we could not recommend this hotel more. We stayed 3 nights over new year and came back relaxed and revigorated by the break and the whole team that took care of us in such lovely  luxurious relaxing surroundings. Can't wait to return ,5,2022,01,11
205,Fabulous,"I recently stayed in the Intercon with my partner and it was truly amazing. Everything from the check in, to the service in the bar/breakfast to the spa was amazing and it was all down to the staff. Everyone we dealt with was so friendly- a special shout out to Jacki at breakfast! We will certainly be staying here again throughout 2022 :)",5,2022,01,11
205,"Lovely hotel, but too expensive for what you get","We booked a one night B&B + dinner stay, in a Junior Suite.  Lovely room, comfy bed, nice seating area, good bathroom, all you would expect from a 5* hotel. Our meal was in the 2 Rosette ""Seasons"" restaurant, at a standard price of € 60 per head for 3 courses.  The food was very average.  My Surf and Turf had a nice steak, but the promised half lobster was a rubbery, overcooked and very small lobster tail, more an oversized prawn.  Chewy and tasteless, and my steak was cold.  My wife's halibut looked like it had been dropped into her bowl from a great height.  It too was massively overcooked, to the point where it was just a fishy mush.  Veg were extra, an eye watering €12 per portion, and our wine was a bottle of middling plonk for a crazy € 45  Desserts were poor, and mis-described on the menu.  This was a € 200+ meal for two people, and it came nowhere even near the standard of recent meals in Lyrath Estate, Johnstown Estate, Kelly's in Rosslare, The Europe Killarney, and Druid's Glen.  Definitely down a couple of divisions from those hotels.

Great breakfast buffet the next morning, except that all the ""hot"" food was stone cold.  I've stayed in practically every 5 star hotel in Ireland, and this is the first time I ever encountered a whole list of supplements on the breakfast menu.  

Lovely staff, great and very personal service, including one ""going the extra mile"" item, but overall I would have to say this was a disappointment and not good value for money",4,2022,01,08
205,Another fantastic stay at Intercontinental,"Stayed once again at Intercontinental and received as always, the warmest of welcomes by the General Manager and team. We feel as though we are staying with friends with all our favourites readily catered for. Seeing the presence of the hotel manager speaking with guests every time we stay is very impressive and not something we see at every hotel. We were well looked after once again during our recent stay and service was top class - staff members were always on hand to meet our needs just at the right times. It’s always a pleasure to stay at Intercontinental and we look forward to our next visit!",5,2022,01,04
205,Exceptional,"Just back from another fabulous break at The Intercontinental Dublin.  The team were superb.  From the moment we arrived we felt pampered.  From Suzanne and her team at the Spa to the team at the Lobby lounge nothing was too much trouble.   I had a wonderful massage from Mona, one of the best I have had in years.  Plus it was so impressive to see the GM Nicky Logue so hands on, engaging with customers to ensure everything was good to helping his team at breakfast - so impressive.  We will definitely return soon again. No hesitation in awarding this hotel 5 stars.",5,2022,01,02
205,Superb as Always,"We stayed at the IC for New Year and as ever the service, friendliness of the staff, quality of the food was top drawer. 

Our suite was superb and from start to finish we had a tremendous time.

As ever, front of house, Nicky Logue ( General Manager ) was visible and hugely welcoming to us and all guests",5,2022,01,01
205,Cathy at the Ice Bar,"Absolutely brilliant stay at this hotel really enjoyed out 6 nights 

We want to highlight how lovely Cathy was who ran the ice Bar in the hotel, her lovely personality really came over and we went every night basically because of her welcoming attitude every time we went in 

Can you pass on these comments to her please as she’s a credit to intercontinental and I’m sure your glad you have her I would employ her in the morning in my business a great asset 

From the Nolan family over from
Manchester",5,2021,12,31
205,Great Christmas Stay,"Fantastic service as always, stayed 4 nights over the Christmas, hotel looked fantastic and the attention to detail was excellent.
Special mention to the concierge team who are simply excellent and extremely helpful.",5,2021,12,30
205,Christmas at the Intercontinental,"Outstanding service, food and comfort from the welcome at the front door to the front desk to the restaurant and spa. Highly recommend. Extremely high standards of cleanliness. Felt safe and secure the entire time.",5,2021,12,29
205,Amaizing weekend,"We had 3 night and it was great. it is  a super hotel. amaizing staff. willing to help you all the time with a smile. 
the breakfast was very good, rooms r big and clean .  definitely can recommend this hotel.",5,2021,12,14
205,Really poor food at dinner and breakfast,"I have given this hotel 4 stars because we love it really. It can be very expensive and we only stay as an occasional treat when we visit Dublin. The front of house staff are just simply wonderful. The house keeping staff deserve great praise as everything is always spotless. The hotel is beautifully decorated for the festive season. But oh my goodness, something needs to happen in the kitchen and the waiting staff need more training. The breakfast buffet is limited and poor. I love fruit and the offerings are abysmal. All the food is cold. They also have a breakfast menu and I thought that if we ordered, the food would be brought to us hot. Sadly not. Dinner was a complete disaster. Food cold, waited hours, wrong orders.... could say more, but this is not a standard we expect from this hotel. We had a similar experience in August, so it wasn't just a one off. The hotel needs to sort out issues in the kitchen.",4,2021,12,13
205,Food was a disaster!,"We love this hotel and stay frequently. The hotel rooms are lovely, and we just book the most basic one. We met friends this weekend and they had suites and junior suites which were far nicer than ours, but we were totally happy with out choice as the basic rooms are huge , sumptuous and very comfortable. The beds are just to die for! My wife just wants those sheets and mattress toppers etc. We had the very best night's sleep. I was disappointed there was no turn down and limited coffee and tea available. 

So why the average rating ? Well the food was shocking! We ate in the Lobby Lounge. Steaks are 44 € .Chips are extra! The fondant potato was the size of an old 50 p piece. All the food was cold and disgusting. My wife had turkey and ham and it was like leather! We were seated in a small room off the lobby and every single group seemed to complain about the food and the service. Our waitress needed more training. She told us it was impossible to bring extra caesar dressing to the table, and none arrived! Obviously impossible! We eventually got ketchup, but as we waited from 6 til 9pm, we gave up! Plum pudding should be avoided too, as it was also of the leather variety.  Breakfast in Seasons was very poor too. Food luke warm, although I asked for it to be extra hot ( last time, we decided never to go for the buffet again , as it was so cold).

The hotel is beautifully decorated  and the front desk staff are just so helpful, as always.

Our high light was that we met Westlife as they headed to the Late Late Show. Those boys are such stars and so kind to everyone they meet. 

We are planning our next visit, but until standards improve, we will dine down the road.",3,2021,12,05
205,Best InterCon.,"This is one of the best intercontinental I ever stayed in in terms of room size, cleanness, and comfort. Location is not far from the city center, thus you avoid the noise and 20 minutes walk to all the shops and restaurants at the city center. The bathroom has both tub and shower. Food is good especially the breakfast buffet.",5,2021,12,04
205,Beautiful hotel,"A really lovely, quite large hotel situated 30/45 minutes from the airport. Well staffed (quite unusual currently), with multiple nationalities offering largely impeccable service. 
The rooms are generous in size, as is the bathroom with high quality towels and amenities. 
Breakfast was excellent, but pricey. Dinner was nice but a little underwhelming - priced towards fine dining but not quite delivering. Wine list was limited but our chosen wine was lovely.",4,2021,12,01
205,"Incredible hotel, even more amazing staff","Amazing rooms, quick check-in, Safi and Ruben went out of their way to make the stay incredibly special. Fantastic hotel with gorgeous surroundings. Food in the lobby lounge was also unbelievable. Will definitely be back.",5,2021,11,23
205,Standards are slipping,"I have stayed here many times  and have always enjoyed myself but on this occasion I was disappointed to say the least . I stayed 2 nights and paid a hefty price as New Zealand were in town  .  Room was the usual high standard   but breakfast  was awful ..........in fact so bad we ate elsewhere on the second morning . I wanted a drink in the bar before we went to the game and were told that all tables were pre booked and they could not take us ,even though several tables were empty at the time .......so much for being a resident . I know Covid has changed many things and Staff issues are common  but I  also know that the price we paid was not worthy of the service we received . I think its time for a change",3,2021,11,18
205,"Excellent staff, Great Service, Mediocre Food, Awful Spa Experience","Just want to mention Erich who served us twice in the lounge. He was very professional and charming. All the staff were excellent actually, from the gentleman who checked us in, (I'm sorry I can't remember his name) to the gentleman who looked after our bags, and the concierge.

The Room was clean and comfortable, the beds extremely comfortable, curtains are truly black out.
The only negative, and I say this about every hotel, is there is nowhere well lit enough to sit and apply makeup, with a decent mirror. 

We ate dinner in the lobby area once. I'd say the food is mediocre for the price as was the wine. I know hotel prices are higher but you do expect the food to be cooked well. Mushy pasta and undercooked egg kind of jars a bit with lovely surroundings and excellent service.

Breakfast was much better. The eggs Benedict, in all it's variations was excellent as was the service. 

We witnessed a senior member of the hospitality staff manage a very rude couple, that were making unreasonable demands, with great calmness and politeness. 

The afternoon tea wasn't great. Sandwich elements were dry, stale and some barely had anything in them. Scones were also dry, Jam and compotes accompanying were tart rather than sweet. I love that they serve clotted cream with it though! 

The desserts were mostly cakey and the whole thing felt quite stodgy.

The champagne served with it was very nice, as was the jasmine tea.

It is cheaper than the Westbury and the Shelbourne Afternoon Tea, but they are both delicious!

The Spa experience wasn't great. Good luck getting a robe to fit if you're a  UK 16+. It was mortifying and then the therapist asked me if I was there with my daughter, when I walked in with my friend who was just 3 years younger than me. I am recovering from a serious illness and her careless comments really upset me along with the robe situation. I went there the try to unwind and I came away feeling really awful. The therapist talked non-stop through the treatment. It was all generally, extremely unpleasant. 

So, if you're looking for just a very comfortable room, pleasant surroundings,  truly amazing, 5 star service by a great hospitality team and a great breakfast I would highly recommend the Intercontinental. Just avoid the spa and maybe the pasta...",4,2021,11,12
205,"Amazing hotel, staff and service.","A real pleasure staying here.  The service is warm and friendly whilst being totally professional.  The room was a great size and has excellent facilities.  The bar area is very congenial and the food served was excellent.  Early ferry crossing, so had to miss breakfast.",5,2021,11,06
205,Proper 5*****,"I had the great pleasure of spending a few days in the InterContinental Hotel Dublin with my family for my birthday recently.  This really is a beautiful hotel in every way & the ambiance all around the hotel is one of calmness.  The bedrooms are extremely spacious, comfortable & so quiet.  The staff are a dream to deal with, there is very much a 'can do' attitude, as nothing is a problem.  The leisure facilities are lovely & again there is such a calmness in that area, that one can feel so relaxed.  We dined in the restaurant & in the lounge area, the food is delicious & again the staff are super friendly & professional.  This was a birthday treat & I must say it was most enjoyable from the minute we valet parked the car, until the minute we collected the car again from the valet.  I can highly recommend this hotel.  Thanks to everyone @ the InterContinental Dublin.  We will hopefully be back for my next birthday.",5,2021,11,01
205,"It was a really uplifting experience, pleasurable and relaxing.","From the moment we arrived and met Isaac we had a wonderful visit. The welcome, the cleanliness, the attitude of the marvellous staff at reception, in lounge, caring for our room and concierge was magnificent and has to be applauded . Congratulations to All for Your amazing teamwork.",5,2021,10,28
205,Lovely hotel,One of our favourite hotels in Dublin. Staff very friendly and a really lovely hotel. Breakfast is amazing although not as good as precovid. Four seasons restaurant food is good ( expensive for what you get). Would recommend this hotel albeit a bit expensive.,5,2021,10,26
205,Fabulous Experience,"Stayed at the intercontinental Hotel last weekend. For College friends reunion. Fabulous location, food and great service. We really had a very memorable weekend.
Thank you to all the staff for looking after us so well.",5,2021,10,21
205,Disappointed,"Expensive considering poor food and lack of sauna . Parking very dear .
the steak accompaniments were very small and no sauce was offered . Cheapest glass of red wine at a tenner is just too much 
Loved the comfort of the bedroom but would not return . A 5 star hotel should still serve good priced options",3,2021,10,03
205,Wonderful 1 night stay,"We have just returned from a 1 night stay in a Junior Suite, room 439. Everything about our stay was fantastic, from being accommodated with an early check in, to the delicious dinner to the wonderful spacious and comfortable room. We had our hair done in Blow hairdressers by Pedro and another male who both were so professional and did a fantastic job. A special mention to all staff, every person we dealt with where a pleasure. Special mention to Livia in the dining room who made our meal outstanding and went the extra mile. She is a credit to the hotel. We cannot wait to return.",5,2021,10,03
205,Lovely family visit,"I recently booked a 3 night stay for my family and I to celebrate graduations for 2 of my family 
The rooms/ bathrooms are wonderful and well equipped 
we enjoyed great breakfasts and lovely evening meals including a special last evening to celebrate our family occasion 
The entire staff were more than helpful and pleasant from the valet parking to waiting staff and all staff in general 
It’s a lovely place to stay and very relaxing",5,2021,09,17
205,True 5 star service,"I stayed in this hotel for one night in an executive room. Had breakfast and dinner, good quality food and excellent staff from Front Office to the Restaurant. The hotel is situated on beautiful grounds, excellent night sleep. A special thanks to the Reservations Manager, Front Office Manager, David from the bar and all of the staff I interacted with from the desk, well trained. Thank you for your service and I look forward to returning to the Intercontinental very soon.",5,2021,09,04
205,Excellent,"Stayed for 1 night, I have stayed here a few times prior but have to say this was the best stay to date. Service in all areas was absolutely brilliant. Huge difference in previous stays. All staff were so attentive, reception on check in , lounge for dinner, pool and breakfast. Special mention for Alex who looked after us so well during dinner. Lovely stay.",5,2021,08,13
205,Lovely hotel... but....,"So Hotel is lovely, staff are lovely... but the restuarant and lobby lounge food is, for want of a better word, inconsistent.  In consistent in the terms of quality and temperature.  We are creatures of habit, so ordered a toasted cheese and tomato sandwich 4 times for lunch during our stay... it was different every day, and on one day cold.... Fish and chips was had twice, first time was lovely...(although they put garlic in the mushy peas). The second time the fish came almost instantly (so obviously wasn;t freshly fried, and some of the chips were uncooked... oven chips?.  Service was also fantastic or appalling... some of the staff were amazing going above and beyond.  Beware the €18 parking fee per day, which although publicised did seem a bit cheeky.. as was adding €180 dinner charge to our bill... that was sorted once it was pointed out that the name wasn;t the same as mine, and nor was the signature,,,,",5,2021,08,10
205,Ann,"We had a wonderful birthday lunch at The InterContinental yesterday. The food, the service and overall experience was first class. It has been a very challenging time for the hospitality sector and the result of the very considerable work done behind the scenes to prepare for a safe, welcoming and seamless reopening was evident throughout the hotel. Well done and thank you to Antonio, Nicky and all the staff in the Lobby Lounge and Kitchen for the superb service, warm welcome and delicious food.",5,2021,08,05
205,Extremely disappointed returning customers,"This was our third stay at the intercontinental. This time we stayed for five days - a Suite snd an executive King. We had several serious issues and the one time they tried to compensate us, we were insulted to say the least. Firstly, the baby crib they gave us had a duvet and pillow, the duvet was tucked in under the mattress so we didn’t even notice there was a duvet in a confined baby sleeping space which is life threatening. Babies, as most people know, should be sleeping alone in a crib. When they did replace the crib with a safe sleeping space, the lady offered to put crib bumpers on it! Yes, the crib bumpers that are illegal and banned in many places throughout the world due to suffocation risk. I felt physically sick when I heard this. Secondly, our keys stopped working at least twice to three times a day. On day 3 (the 10th time he had to ask for the keys to be fixed) the manager at the desk asked was he staying at the hotel. The same man who had repeatedly served him before. Insulting, as I said. We were then dropped up a bottle of €7 wine. This would be fine if it not for that the night before we drank their most expensive red wine in the restaurant, my husband drank one of the most expensive whiskies and I drank Monkey 47. So, there was 0 thought put into the apology. That is not a five star experience. In a five star hotel, guests preferences are supposed to be noted and acted upon. Our stay is in the many, many thousands. Which would have been fine if the experience snd service were worth the price. We will never, ever stay here again.",2,2021,08,02
205,Outdoor dining in the garden,I visited the hotel for lunch in the garden. There was a lovely relaxed atmosphere there and the tables were beautifully set  in shaded areas. There was a good choice on the menu and the food was cooked to a high standard as usual. The service was excellent as usual . Coffee and desserts were particularly good.,5,2021,07,24
205,10/10,"The InterContinental Hotel Dublin is a residence of eloquence, professionalism and comfort. From the moment we arrived we received 5* star treatment. The hotel staff were reflective of high professional practice, and the hotel room was incredible. 
We would like to thank the manager Nicky who looked after us, and ensured we had a memorable experience. The InterConntential has officially become my favourite hotel and I would encourage everyone tempted to book immediately. 

An prime example of how a 5* hotel should operate. 
Many thanks
Tommy & Paudie",5,2021,07,22
205,Best hotel I’ve stayed in!,My stay at the hotel was for my birthday and it was amazing! We booked a Junior Suite and the room was huge and stunning. The beds were really comfy and the shower was really powerful and hot! Staff were lovely and professional. They made the stay extra special. We booked dinner & breakfast as part of our stay and both were amazing. We got dessert brought to our suite and I was also given a little treat plate with Happy Birthday on it. We used the swimming pool and the jacuzzi during our stay - would recommend the jacuzzi as it was fab. It is the best hotel I’ve stayed in and I will definitely be booking a return visit!,5,2021,07,19
205,A gem of a luxurious hotel In Dublin ..,"I stayed in this hotel for one night recently. I came home feeling rested and rejuvinated. The staff were honestly the nicest staff I have ever come across. Nothing was too much trouble for them. I am the most fussy person when it comes to how my coffee is made and they remade it  for me on the first day and again on the second day with no hestitation.
I am intolerant to a lot of types of breads and informed a member of staff that one of the breads was actaully agreeing with my stomach as  I have been so limited to what I can eat. The waitress went off eagerly to find out what the type of bread was for me and where I could possibley purchase it. Then came back to me with some extra bread to bring home with me. 
I was bowled over by this as it showed they went that extra mile to keep the client happy. 
Any time we got table service the staff were so polite and friendly and accomodating. 
There is an outdoor garden terrace to dine with a stunning fountain and garde we felt as though we could have been abroad.
The hotel itself is spotlessly clean and the interior is magnificent. A real pleasure to spend some time in.
I will be hoping to pay a visit again soon as we didnt get a chance to use the pool or spa area and would love to go and explore it.
I never sleep in any hotel and had taken my own pillows well turns out I did not need them I slept like  a baby!!
What a trip I savoured every moment.",5,2021,07,19
205,Amazing Experience AGAIN,"Our Family had the most amazing experience this weekend at the Intercontinental Hotel, Dublin, huge bedroom, swimming pool fab, great weather, Al Fresco dining, live music in the garden, amazing friendly staff, BEST BREAKFAST IN IRELAND- we’ll be back!!!!!",5,2021,07,18
205,"Lovely atmosphere, beautiful outdoor space","Myself and my husband stayed on Saturday night and had such a lovely relaxing time. The hotel is really beautiful and the staff look after you even before you walk in the door! There was a lovely buzz in the lobby and outdoor area with lots of people around - families, couples, people going to a match - but there was loads of space and lots of staff. Our room was beautiful. We splurged on a junior suite and it was worth it, so luxurious! We had dinner and breakfast in the restaurant and again there was lots of space, we weren't rushed and managers were constantly checking that everything was ok. We will definitely be back, hopefully for longer next time!",5,2021,07,15
205,Absolutely Disappointing,"Stayed 2 nights. The room was lovely with comfortable bed. The breakfast was cold and tasteless. The evening meals were very definitely not even 3 star standard. We arrived at 8pm for meal got our ceasar salad at 8.50pm got a very dissappointing desert at 10.20pm which was a meringue tasteless hard shell, the worst food i've ever been served. The service was so slow and one particular waiter set our plates in front of us and walked away, not a word spoke!  Definitely would not recommend this hotel no matter what deal is offered 👎",1,2021,07,13
205,Lux Dining Escape,"Booked the Luxury Dining escape. The room was fab, very tastefully decorated. The champagne was actually great - not just entry level type. Despite Covid restrictions I thought the food was very good in Seasons restaurant. Overall We really enjoyed the hotel it's looking great, very comfortable common areas & a really nice atmosphere. Very Visible mgt team and very professional staff",5,2021,07,13
205,Outstanding Hotel,"If there was a higher rating than 5 stars for this hotel I would happily give it. From the moment we entered the hotel we were graciously greeted and welcomed. The staff could simply not do enough for us and went out of there to make it a wonderful visit. We chose to dine in-house on both nights as the food was really just delicious and there was a great variety. There is such a lovely atmosphere throughout the hotel and we were lucky enough to have had the opportunity to enjoy the hotels’ outdoor facilities. A special mention to David our server on both nights for making us feel so at home and for personalising the stay.

We used the pool on both days which had a stunning indoor jacuzzi, they have a lovely sit down area where you can also just relax. The reception and reservations team were both very helpful when we had any questions and helped us to organize dinner/pool times. Kudos to the housekeeping team for the high standards of cleanliness throughout the hotel, the hotel is spotless and there is a really safe environment especially now during Covid times.

The level of customer service is really just amazing and a big thank you to Nicky Logue the General Manager for making us feel so welcomed. A hotel really is only as good as it’s staff and its great too see management so heavily involved in the success of the hotel operations. 

For anyone looking for an extremely relaxed and enjoyable getaway, I would highly recommend this hotel for so many reasons. Can’t wait to return again.",5,2021,07,09
205,Wonderful stay,"Superb hotel led by Nicky and his wonderful Team. From start to finish our stay was superb. Service top class from very friendly staff such as Safi, Estera, David, Tito, Amy and Ricardo.

Very encouraging also to see Nicky, the Hotel General Manager very much front of house and by supporting his team at busy periods - not something you see too often either",5,2021,07,09
205,Incredible InterContinental,"Myself and my girlfriend had an amazing two night stay here. Everything from the moment we arrived was perfect. Our server David in the restaurant for the two nights made us feel as if we had been coming for years, even though it was our first stay ! Definitely recommend to enjoy the new outdoor garden area for a drink. We used the leisure centre both days which includes a really nice jacuzzi. It’s very easy to reach the city centre from the hotel. It’s only a €10 taxi from the hotel to Grafton street. General Manager Nicky Logue called into us on both days to see how we getting on which made us feel very well looked after. ",5,2021,07,09
205,Warm and Welcoming Stay at the Intercontinental Dublin,We had a great stay at the Intercontinental Dublin. Very warm welcome starts from the Doorman Muzi and then the big smile from Jane at the reception. Then the following day the Manager Nutu - although he was busy still managed to assist me while I was waiting at the lobby,5,2021,07,08
205,Simply fantastic.,"Our stay at this hotel was simply fantastic. From the moment we arrived the staff and management made the whole family feel so welcome. The overall service and quality of food was also exceptional. Definitely worth a visit, and we look forward to a return visit.",5,2021,07,04
205,Special night away in the city,"We both loved our special night away in Dublin City at The very glamorous Intercontinental recently. The food was superb, the ambiance was just right and the staff  so friendly and helpful that they would go out of their way to make your evening special. Thank you Intercontinental Dublin for a special stay we will always remember and we will definitely be back soon x",5,2021,07,03
205,10/10,"Great service, excellent food and the most comfortable room! 
We were blessed with the weather and had to opportunity to sit outside in the sunshine. 
From breakfast to dinner all of our food was amazing 
Would definitely visit again.",5,2021,07,03
205,Spectacular ,"Lunch on terrace 5 star. Dinner 5 star, bedroom 5 star, amazing experience and breakfast very good. Could probably do with more staff but otherwise excellent stay. Can’t wait to come back! Well done all 
",5,2021,07,01
205,Very Disappointing,"Maybe we were unlucky but our experience differs very much from previous reviews.
From arrival things did not go how we expected.
No doorman. no offer of help with luggage, changed our dinner reservation without prior consent, no toiletries in our suite, asked did we want our room cleaned, turn down service was offered but at a time that suited the hotel not the guest, poor service in the bar no hot water in our suite and no water in the bath.
Our room was not inspected properly by housekeeping and at 600 euros a night this is just not acceptable.
Breakfast is not what one expects in a 5 star hotel.
If you want anything other than a buffet breakfast you have to pay a €5 supplement. Not everyone wants rashers and sausages .!

We were due to stay 2 nights but we decided that our money would be better spent elsewhere.

I was sorry to do this, but  guys you have had 6 months to get ready for guests and I am afraid to say in our opinion you really need to up your game especially with the rates you are charging.",3,2021,06,22
205,Beautiful room and great service,"Everyone was so helpful from the doorman who kindly walked me to my room, the lovely bar staff and Robert at the front desk. 
The  room was beautiful and spacious with a very comfortable bed  
I hope to stay again soon!",5,2021,06,21
205,Efficient and welcoming,"An excellent stay in this first class hotel. Despite Covid restrictions the standard of service food and personal care of residents has, if anything improved. Nutu at reception was above and beyond in his service as was Room Service. Full marks to all. Highly recommended for city breaks and business trips.",5,2021,06,14
205,Family weekend bliss.,"Just packing up after our bank holiday weekend in The Intercontinental. Fantastic weekend. Kids had a blast. Food was excellent, atmosphere was exceptional. Got the real holiday feel again. From the minute we arrived to when we left, we were treated like royalty. Thanks to @Nicky Louge and his  team.",5,2021,06,07
205,Work Stay,"Currently working away from home for two months and have been placed at the Intercontinental. As it is a long trip, I had asked for several adjustments to my room. Nutu, the front desk manager really went above and beyond to ensure my stay would be as comfortable as possible. Not only did he manage to give me a room with a balcony, but he showed me around three separate rooms to ensure I got the one that was just right for me. Nutu has offered nothing less than perfection when it comes to his hospitality and willingness to go above and beyond to ensure my stay is perfect. The hotel itself is calm and peaceful, with all staff ensuring service with a smile. I dare say you will find a much better place to stay here in Dublin and I for one, will make this my only port of call when returning.",5,2021,06,03
205,Saviour,"I found myself at the IC Dublin after a hotel booking had gone awry and Nutu the Front Office Manager really saved my tail.

Being there on business meant many late hours and it was such a pleasure to be faced with really friendly and helpful staff who happily fulfilled every need. 

The cleaning service was superb, the food lovely and the hotel calm and peaceful.

When next I am back for work, it is the only place I will stay. A port of calm in a very rough see indeed.",5,2021,05,23
205,Hotel is amazing,"Decided to spend my wedding night in a luxury suite and I was not disappointed.

The moment I walked in the door the staff were so helpful. My first impressions of the hotel exceeded my expectations.

The suite was exactly like what was in the photos which is rare. Due to covid, we ordered food in room which was perfectly cook and swift.

Want to thank all the staff for faultless night and the hotel and I will see everyone again very soon.",5,2021,05,15
205,Incredible property and team!,"The Intercontinental is an amazing Dublin hotel - one of the very best. The team are amazing, the room is big, and the bathroom is luxurious!! Special thanks to Jane on the front-desk, she was awesome. Really love this property.",5,2021,05,10
205,A warm 5 star welcome,The Intercontinental provided a perfect setting for meeting family for Christmas. We were made very welcome by Front Office Manager Nutu Radu and the 5 star plus welcome was matched by the food and accommodation provided in a wonderful Junior Suite.. thank you to all.,5,2021,04,18
205,Home away from Home ,I stay at the Intercontinental Dublin when I am in Dublin. I am usually there for business but I have also stayed for pleasure. It is a very comfortable environment with excellent spaces to live in. This is all backed up by friendly and helpful staff who always want to help or just smile at you. The food deserves a special mention also as it is not pretentious it is just good food prepared and served excellently. If you want a very comfortable hotel to stay when in Dublin then this is it. ,5,2021,04,16
205,Business ,"Great experience, felt very safe staying here, COVID safety measures adhered to. 
Those working at the front desk could not have been more helpful. Highly recommend this hotel . The room was very comfortable and quiet. Ordered room service which was delicious. Plan to stay there again as soon COVID restrictions lift , next time for leisure. ",5,2021,04,10
205,Much needed break,"I recently stayed at the intercontinental dublin, it was when restrictions eased and travel within your own county was permitted. It was my 1st time in a hotel during covid so was very nervous. I dealt with the most professional member of staff Nutu who arranged the reservation, his attention to detail was second to none. He put all my concerns to rest and we had a perfect stay. The hotel was beautiful and I could tell the extra efforts made to ensure comfort to all guests during this strange time. We never left the hotel the whole time we were there as the restaurant,bar and pool offered everything we needed.I would have no hesitation to recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a luxury break in the city.",5,2021,01,08
205,christmas stay,"fab J Suite, everything was 5 star all the way, just relaxing and enjoyable to the letter .  great christmas feeling to the hotel, staff could not do enough for you, food was excellent both in the bar and main restaurant , your french waiter was very good and wonderful attention and to have a laugh with us, be back very soon",5,2021,01,08
205,Outstanding experiences at every avenue of my stay,"I frequently stay at the Intercontinental Dublin. Every experience filled with the absolute joy an establishment of such expected calibre should offer; welcome and the sense of feeling welcome, subtle undoubted quality, superior service at your discretion, safety and health of staff and residents alike paramount; but at the fore the sense of feeling at home from the moment you cross the threshold of this excellent property to the moment you leave; only wanting to return.

I wouldn't offend those team members I may leave out by naming those who come to mind but, I can safely say every team member represents the brand and standard expected from a hotel of such standing and could only hope such levels are maintained well into the future to ensure this hotel remains the best Dublin, indeed Ireland, has to offer at every level.

Special thanks to management and everyone at the Intercontinental for bringing a Globally representative 5 Star Standard to Dublin. I have every faith you will achieve and maintain many accolades at this property.",5,2021,01,07
205,Beautiful hotel disappointment with service,"I stayed in this hotel with my husband for a relaxing night away which we really did enjoy, I could not fault the service we received while staying at the hotel, 
Unfortunately I left a very precious gold chain in the bedroom when we left. I realised I had forgotten it 2 days later and rang the hotel immediately but was told there was nothing in the lost and found. I rang again to double check but nothing was handed in.",3,2020,12,28
205,Great cocktails and service in the bar,"Had a great evening tonight at the Intercontinental in ballsbridge, room fab, staff made great efforts in Covid times, great service in general especially well looked after in the bar by cocktail maestro Safi",5,2020,12,23
205,Spectacular stay at your hotel!,"We recently celebrated my daughter's 21st Birthday at this wonderful hotel.  Everything about our experience exceeded expectations. The professionalism and friendliness of the staff was second to none ... particularly Nutu, who organised everything for our stay from beginning to end, including every small detail. The rooms we stayed in were absolutely gorgeous and so luxurious and the food was delicious.  The observation of the Covid-19 guidelines was meticulous from the beginning to the end of our stay. Thank you all so much for making our stay so memorable and giving my daughter special memories fo this milestone event.  Elaine, Dublin",5,2020,12,23
205,Wonderful hotel - great location,"This is a really elegant hotel with lovely common areas, great food (breakfast & evening meal)  & wonderful staff who couldn't do enough to be of service. Beautiful Christmas decorations everywhere. What's not to like!!",5,2020,12,21
205,Amazing stay - 5 stars,"Thanks for the email.

Our visit exceeded expectations and had a wonderful trip. We availed of the black Friday deal and it was excellent. The staff were amazing and went above and beyond for us which we appreciated. Both breakfast and dinner were very good.

One constructive point:

At lunch, we wanted to get some cocktails with our food but we couldn't avail of this until after 5 pm as the cocktail maker wasn't starting their shift till then.",5,2020,12,21
205,Extraordinary Service Levels,"Even though my wings have been clipped due to Covid 19 I am still very fortunate to be able to stay in the IC Dublin reasonably often. I am a Platinum member of the IHG Rewards programme so I get to stay in quite a number of different IHG hotels every year. Simply put, this is THE very best IHG hotel that I have ever stayed in. It is hard to know where to begin sharing my experiences of my last two night stay from the 18th to the 20th of December. Before you even arrive I was contacted by text, email and a call back that I requested, making sure everything is done prior to you even arriving on site. 
My check-in was flawless with the always smiling and professional Jane on duty. An earlier arrival than usual, no problem. Dinner reservation done. Spa visit appointment, done. Room upgrade, done. Visitor parking request, done. A 2pm checkout, done .Breakfast reservation , done. A warm greeting by Isaac and Musi at the front door, done. A welcome from GM Mister Logue, done. Lastly, the person that seems to make this all come together, Robert Hunt, an extraordinary manager to have access to. This all happened during  the first 15 minutes on arrival. Flawless customer service. 
This level of service continued with my visits to Seasons restaurant for breakfast ( an absolute must) where Fabien looked after me brilliantly urging me to visit his home town of Rio! The same was true with Shane in the bar, Ida in the Lounge and Reading room and of course David the manager who always has time for a quick word while keeping the ship on course throughout a very hectic time of year. For any extra small requests all you have to do is lift  the phone from your room and the amazing Natalia will make sure your wishes are carried out perfectly. It was also wonderful to get reply emails from Valerie, normally in the Concierge but in the Spa for the busy month of December, confirming my appointments while I was en-route to the hotel. I could go on but I would run out of adjectives.
All in all its a wonderful place to stay but it is the people who make any stay in the IC Dublin so unforgettable. Do yourself a favour, make a reservation and then sit back and watch it all unfold. You will not be disappointed. My favourite IHG hotel anywhere and every time.",5,2020,12,21
205,Christmas & The Intercontinental. Our new family tradition.,"Just home from the Intercontinental. After the bruising year we just had, I finally got my Christmas spirit back. The minute we arrived in the door, the decorations, the tree, the service, and the attention was truly amazing. Our family trip to Dublin was fantastic, things that memories and family traditions are made from. We ate in the first night, and got to sit back and have a nice drink in The Whiskey room. We even asked for somewhere special to eat out on the second night and the concierge got us a table at the Ivy!!!! WOW. 

A big thanks to all in The intercontinental. We will be back.

The O Connor Family",5,2020,12,20
205,5 star as always,"This hotel never fails to deliver. We just spent two nights here and it was fantastic. The hotel is beautifully decorated for Christmas and there is a wonderful atmosphere. Everyone working in this hotel really care. From Issac at the front door to housekeeping everyone is so friendly and welcoming. The food at breakfast was top notch. 
You simply cannot beat this hotel! ",5,2020,12,20
205,Our Xmas party,"Lovely place to spend one night..or more with friends or family. 
We had our Xmas party here last night,  the hotel is so nice,the en-suite rooms are very spacious, staff is very friendly,  they made everything possible for us. 
Hope to see you again soon, guys!
Thank you!",5,2020,12,18
205,Staycation ,"I used to go for food and drinks before covid with friends as well with my family. This was my first time staying overnight considering we live about 25 mins drive away. We decided to treat ourselves to the junior suite. Checkin was very professional and friendly. I can say that we did feel safe during our stay as the hotel did take all precautionary measures from sanitisation to social distancing, screens and face mask. Now, the room was a decent size and very clean. Service in the lounge was as usual with a smile behind those masks and friendly. ( the only tiny issue is that the barman does make great cocktail but need to be train on pouring a good guiness.I got a big head on my guiness). Dinner was amazing! We did use the swimming pool and it was very well manage with the time slot bookings. 
I would surely do it again in the not too distant future as it was such a relaxing experience. 
I would also suggest that management look into implementing a few car charge points within the car park. 
A massive thank you to all the staff. ",5,2020,12,16
205,Traveler,"Just a fast note about breakfast in the dinning room.
Start your day out right! 
Get the full Irish breakfast and ask for Andzej to be your waiter. He is a service professional who will make your dinning experience perfect. He took care of us 3 mornings in a row, all exceptional experiences.

Don’t miss HIGH TEA in the month of Dec. in the sun room. Alex took exceptional care of us and made the high tea the most talked about experience of the day.",5,2020,12,16
205,Excellent weekend break,"We had a weekend stay at the intercontinental mid-December and had a fantastic stay. From Dublin, but felt like we got away, with the added benefit of no long drive home after. 
This place is stunning! The rooms are spacious, tasteful and very comfortable. I had a great nights sleep, and that’s as someone whose habitually too hot in a hotel room. 
The staff were welcoming, professional and helpful at every turn. We went for a couple of cocktails, then dinner in Seasons, and enjoyed a welcome sense of normality while being safely guided through socially distanced assigned tables. The food and drinks were faultless and had some nice unique twists, and the setting is luxurious. It makes for a great atmosphere and a really nice time. 
Breakfast doesn’t disappoint either, lots to choose from, the eggs Benedict were delicious, the coffee is great and the team are attentive and friendly. 
Highly recommend the intercontinental for a nice luxury staycation as a Winter treat in these times. ",5,2020,12,15
205,Absolutely STUNNING!!,"I actually can't fault this hotel at all. Literally did not want to leave. We had an amazing stay.  Definitely 5 star all round.  Food,  service, rooms all fab.  We had champagne afternoon tea on arrival. Was so so good. Then ate in caesaers restaurant for dinner. Jackie and her team really looked after us.  Cannot wait to book again!!",5,2020,12,14
205,Impeccable service,"My husband and I had a recent overnight stay in the Intercontinental. The experience exceeded our expectations. Everything from the decor, the doorman, check in, room service, food and drinks, to the waiting staff was a 5 star experience.
Most notably, all of the staff were fantastic. Each member of the team took the time to ensure that our needs were met and we were enjoying our stay. However, a special mention must be given to Carlos. 
Carlos served us when we were in the bar. He was both professional and personal in his approach. He made us feel as though we had travelled a long distance to be at the hotel despite us being locals ourselves. He checked in graciously at well-timed intervals and ensured we had a quality experience for evening drinks. 
We will definitely be returning to the Intercontinental and hope that Carlos will be there when we do.",5,2020,12,14
205,Another First Class stay in Intercontinental,"Stayed for a one night short break in the Intercontinental with my partner on a Friday night in mid Dec.  It was first class as always.  The king size bed in the Contemporary room was absolutely fab - so comfortable.  We had drinks in the bar both before and after dinner in town.  There were no rules around having to eat a meal with your drinks as long as you are resident which suited us because we had already made a reservation in the City Centre.  So it was great to be able to have just a glass of wine.
The reception areas are really nicely decorated for Christmas - this intercontinental always makes a special effort with their floral display and decorations in Reception, no matter what the season, and this was no different.
Breakfast was first class - the pancakes with bacon on the side were superb.
Overall top class",5,2020,12,13
205,Really enjoyable weekend,"Really enjoyed our stay, the service was 10/10 staff were very accommodating. Room was spotless And very nice inside. Bar lounge could have a better selection of food as It was very limited. The Ice bar was fabulous but they didnt serve cocktails which would have been nice before dinner.",5,2020,12,13
205,Amazing Experience From Start To Finish,"Myself and my husband took an overnight stay. We had never stayed here before. From the entrance of the hotel it was a lovely atmosphere. The Christmas decorations are just amazing. The staff with whom we engaged with from check-in to check- out were courteous, helpful and very friendly. We opted for the afternoon tea instead of dinner which was absolutely delicious. Ordered room service too later in the evening, again the food was delicious and delivered very promptly to the room. Breakfast the next morning too was a very relaxed experience in the beautiful spacious dining room. As regards the Covid times we are in,the hotel was totally on top of this with sanitising stations throughout the hotel and wipes available in the bar at your individual table and in our room. At check-out too I was given a token of a gift of homemade ginger Christmas cookies which I thought was a lovely touch. All in all our entire experience was a fantastic one, very relaxing and we will definitely stay here again. Thanks to all the wonderful staff. Keep up your great work.",5,2020,12,12
205,A real oasis and a relief from covid lockdown. Beautiful at Christmas,"Fabulous Bed and very comfortable room. The social areas, bar and lobby areas have a wonderful ambience and quality food and drinks is excellent and service levels are first class. Looking forward to returning as soon as possible. Location is also fabulous for the city and ideal for Rugby weekends !!",5,2020,12,10
205,Luxurious stay in the heart of Dublin,"Myself and my boyfriend decided to treat ourselves to a night away and went for the package deal currently being offered for €290 which included an upgrade to a junior suite, three course dinner, breakfast and free parking. It was so worth it! The room was out of this world, dinner was delicious and breakfast was the real treat - you could have whatever you wanted from the menu, an unlimited amount, and stay as long as you wanted. Not to mention, we were constantly surrounded by the gorgeous furnishing and beautiful views outside and the extremely helpful and friendly staff. The only issues we had was when I was accidentally overcharged at checkout, but they rectified this immediately when I raised this and refunded me the difference. Also, we made the mistake of parking under one of the huge trees outside, and we came back to our car being an absolute mess because of the birds. Completely blocked out the windshield. The hotel very kindly called housekeeping to come down and clean it, thankfully. This was an amazing stay, highly recommend.",5,2020,12,08
205,Fantastic Stay and can’t wait to go back,"Myself and my cousin recently stayed at this hotel for a girly few nights away after an extremely tough year. 
This hotel really exceeded our expectations. 
The staff made us feel so welcome from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. 
We did not book dinner on the first night so we got room service and couldn’t fault the meal or service. 
Dinner on the Saturday night was fabulous and had something for everyone on the menu. The service from the restaurant staff was amazing especially from Enstra (so sorry if I’ve spelt their name wrong) The live music from the piano player was a lovely added touch. 
We also ordered breakfast to our room each morning. Breakfast on Saturday morning was the best breakfast we’ve had in any hotel, however, on Sunday morning we were left disappointed. The breakfast that arrived on Sunday morning was cold! We did mention this on check out and were compensated for this by getting our parking free. 

A massive thank you to all the staff for making our stay so enjoyable. 

We are really looking forward to returning. ",5,2020,12,06
205,Date Night Stay!,"Our stay at the Intercontinental in Ballsbridge was wonderful and the service we received throughout was fantastic, in particular oven dinner in the Seasons Restaurant. Our suite was on point and provided us the touch of luxury and seclusion we were hoping for. An absolute pleasure we couldn't recommend more!",5,2020,10,21
205,Perfect long weekend ,"We booked the InterContinental to have a short break for my sons 5th birthday. We stayed a total of 3 nights and got a chance to try out a lot of in house dining options.

We stayed in the executive suite which was amazing. The room was very comfortable, spacious and had a good homely feel to it. There were all the regular amenities and you could feel a strong sense of luxury in how the room was set up. 

We tried out in room dining a couple of times and found it to be very good. The menu is quite reasonably varied and if you don't find something you like on the menu, the room service staff are happy to offer other options as well which is really great.

The staff throughout our stay were exceptionally welcoming and friendly. With the COVID restrictions, they have still managed to maintain a high standard of service. 

Overall, the hotel is very well located and is close to all key central points of Dublin while being in a nice quiet spot. You are sure to have a luxurious, relaxing and enjoyable stay.",5,2020,10,19
205,Sat night stay,"Excellent hotel. Staff were so nice and very helpful right across the board. The hotel was spotlessly clean and all the safety guidelines were in place which made us feel very safe. There was a lovely atmosphere which was also so nice in these surreal times. Hope to go back again at some stage in the future.

205,Friendly Bar Staff,"I spent the weekend at the Intercontinental in Dublin. My friends and I met in the bar for a nightcap. We had the absolute pleasure of meeting Michael, he took great care of us. Michael was personable and made us feel relaxed and welcome. We enjoyed the personal approach that he takes with his job.  In a time when we are so hyper aware of staying away from people, Michael was warm and funny, he reminded us of a time past when it was all about the connection with people. 
If you book a stay at the Intercontinental, stop in to the lobby bar and ask for Michael. 
Please pass on our appreciation to him for taking the time to remind us that we can still make meaningful connections in this time of stress and uncertainty.
Well done Michael!!",5,2020,10,17
205,Exceptional customer service,"I had an exceptional experience at the Intercontinental.

I am so grateful that this hotel has taken the steps necessary to make my stay safe and secure. Their attention to detail and willingness to go above and beyond for their guests does not go unnoticed. They go the extra mile to ensure that safety procedures are being followed and that makes me feel good about staying here.
In a time where things are a bit chaotic in the world the Intercontinental staff manages to make me feel welcomed and at home.

I’d like to thank Simona for going out of her way without hesitation to make my stay special, it is employees like this that make me look forward to my return to the Intercontinental.

Thanks for the wonderful stay.",5,2020,10,15
205,Lovely hotel ,"We stayed here for one night & will return .The bedroom was large & comfortable & spotless.
The hotel was quite due to restrictions, so we had plenty of space in the public areas to eat without time limits . The Lobby menu has a good variety of dishes , nice selection of wines by glass and the service was great . 
Compliance was excellent re covid guidelines & I would feel comfortable returning . It's not easy on the staff at all , but they did a great job in all areas . ",5,2020,10,14
205,Amazing Stay - Highly Recommend!,"Stayed at the weekend and was so impressed with the fantastic service, exceptional food and gorgeous bedroom. Excellent Covid-19 protocol but in no way impacted the five star experience. We had dinner in the Season’s restaurant and the food was just delicious, with great options on the set menu. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a little staycation and some luxury in these testing times to check it out. Some really competitive deals to be had too, which made it even better. I’m planning on going back before Christmas.",5,2020,10,13
205,ANOTHER great stay at The Intercontinental Dublin.....,"As a result of Covid-19 curbing our travel plans this year, we have had some 'staycations' around Ireland in various Hotels (mainly 5 star).....all have been good as expected, but The Intercontinental Dublin staff just seem to go that little bit beyond what is expected of a 5 star and deliver exceptional service and attention every time. The hotels Covid-procedures are second to none, but in no way impinge on the enjoyment of staying here.  The fact that the hotel is so spacious helps in achieving this safe environment, whilst still giving you the luxury you expect. From the moment we arrived until checkout, EVERY member of staff we encountered went above and beyond in making us feel at home and spoiled! I can't recommend this hotel enough and we will most definitely be back in the very near future. Seriously great value for money also at present.",5,2020,10,13
205,Staff were all absolutely fantastic,"i can't overstate how welcoming & friendly all the staff were to us during our stay in challenging circumstances. 
Even little details they did for us like anniversary chocolates etc was a really nice touch. 
Keep up the good work. 
Dave",5,2020,10,13
205,John63,I just stay at the intercontinental hotel in ballsbridge in dublin and have to say it was a pleasure. Everything from arriving to the morning I left I felt so at ease . The hotel is spotless clean and staff were great to make you really feel comfortable and safe . All I can say is well done to everyone working there during these most difficult times it was a pleasure and will be returning there very shortly. Thanks again,5,2020,10,11
205,Perfect Choice for a Dublin City Staycation,"I have just returned from a 1 night stay with friends. We picked this hotel as a surprise for a friend who is due to celebrate her birthday next week, and we wanted something special to mark her special day. Our stay from start to finish was outstanding. From the helpfulness of the reservations team on booking, to arranging treatments, early check in and also pre-booking of dining times, to the welcome we received when we arrived, and the friendliness of all staff that we encountered, we were well and truly looked after. We made use of the spa facilities and enjoyed one of the best massages, and also availed of the facilities in Blow which were excellent. Our dinner in Seasons was exceptional as was the service. A particular mention to Jacqueline and Estera for making us feel very welcome and wanting for nothing.  The rooms and bed were very comfortable and to a very high standard. From the minute you walk through the door you can forget everything that is happening in the real world and well and truly relax here, rest assured that the team are taking every protocol to ensure your safety. Thank you to all the team for helping us celebrate in style, we only wished we had longer. Thank you to Nicky, the hotel General Manager also for his very warm welcome.",5,2020,10,10
205,Excellence all around,"Had a wonderful stay with my daughter. So luxurious and relaxing. Staff were amazing and could not do enough for you. Dinner in the reading room was perfect. Such a well run hotel, looking forward to returning.",5,2020,10,10
205,Really lovely.,We absolutely enjoyed our stay. I loved that the Hotel was so clean sanitisers everywhere.Hotel was quiet and I really liked it and it also made it extra safe for us.

The service was great through out. Lovey lovely lovely. Will definitely visit again.,5,2020,10,08
205,awesome,"Exceptional standards and service. the staff are very attentive and quickly get to know your name and needs. The anti Covid protocols are strictly adhered to, including an individually wrapped pen for each guest at check in. The atrium interior and exterior area in great for reading the paper, eatig a snack or having a drink, given the lack of those facilities outside the hotel due to Covid.",5,2020,10,08
205,Outstanding hotel !!,the service is really good and felt safe with covid measurements. I loved the pool and felt relaxed . Looking forward to visiting this amazing property very soon thanks to all the staff and everyone who made my stay all the more special ,5,2020,10,02
205,"Safe, Relaxed,Efficient and Very Welcoming","I had three nights in this Marvellous friendly Hotel. Met at the entrance by Issach ,offering Us every assistance while directing Us to the check in where We Were met by Valerie who was really great, no fuss and made Us relaxed and gave Us a feeling of Great Safety. Room superb and just what was required for the Staycationing!!! Ida in the dining room made sure We had a fantastic breakfast and we appreciated all the service given to Us by the Amazing staff at all times. Our stay 10/10. ",5,2020,09,24
205,Amazing service and hotel,"Just back from a girl’s staycation at the gorgeous InterContinental. Everything from start to finish was perfect. The staff were professional and helpful. We were met and checked in by the lovely Robert and Radomir, who were both great they could not have been any more helpful. No matter what we needed whether it was toothbrushes , ice , or more towels, it was no problem to Robert and he even got it delivered straight to our room even though we offered to come down for it. The bedroom was huge and beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean with hand sanitizer and anti bacterial wipes left for us to use , which was a great touch. We ate both breakfast and dinner in the hotel and the food was great. Upon arrival we were asked by Robert what time suits us for the pool and for breakfast and he booked us in for both mornings that we stayed, which was great as me and my friends did not have to worry about having to book and organize breakfast and the pool ourselves. The pool was also heated which was amazing. Over all it was an amazing hotel with amazing staff that truly gave 5 star service. Thank you to all the team for the great service, and especially to Robert and Radomir. We will definitely be back.",5,2020,09,23
205,Staycation,"Just back from a staycation at the fabulous Intercontinental. We have been staying here for 18 years and have always enjoyed our stays!
Thank you so much to the amazing staff for your professionalism and friendliness, you made our stay!!!  
The rooms were spotless, the dining experience was so relaxed in our “New” Normal, looking forward to returning very soon ",5,2020,09,13
205,Great escape,My sister and I stayed for one night at the intercontinental. It was a dinner and B&B package for a saturday night that was good value considering this is a 5 star hotel near the city centre. Prior to our check in we had tried numerous times to phone to book spa treatments and dinner but found the lines to be busy and were not successful. When we did eventually make contact there were no dinner reservation or spa appointments left available. This initial disappointment was improved by the fact that Radimir from reception made a point of organising this for us and found us a dinner reservation and one short spa treatment as well as putting us on a cancellation list. In retrospect it may have been better for us to email our request for spa as opposed to trying to arrange by phone. Radimir made every effort to accommodate our needs and gave excellent service as a part of the front desk team. Dinner and breakfast were both excellent although I found the wine list to be limited in terms of choice and various budget options.  My spa treatment was excellent Suzanne was an amazing therapist and I would highly recommend using the spa. The pool was nice but we did find there to be an off putting smell in the pool environs - perhaps due to it being the last slot of the day. Only downside of my spa experience was that a large group of ladies entered the spa for treatments as I finished mine. It would be helpful if staff reminded such groups to keep the noise down as other guests are using the spa facilities and reminded of current covid guidelines in the hotel - ie social distancing and mask wearing. I was uncomfortable with the noise of the large group and couldn't access my locker until they had left as they congregated in a large group and were not wearing masks. Other then these minor issues our overall experience of the stay was excellent and I would recommend the hotel and staff level if service. ,4,2020,09,13
205,Second trip as good as the first,Had previously stayed a couple of years ago and happy to see that same high standards applied under current extraordinary circumstances. Very comfortable rooms. Excellent breakfast. Staff anticipate what you need and deliver. Was particularly impressed with the mezze platter served up to me in the bar at 10.30pm. Kudos to the chef!,5,2020,09,13
205,Family Friendly Stay,"We Stayed for one night in August , as we are a Family of five we stayed in one of the executive suites which was perfect for us . Everything from booking to Check out was dealt with in a very professional Manner with very nice personnel touches.I would like to Thank Aleksandras personally  for organising  the treats for our kids on arrival, as it was our Daughters Birthday she was impressed with those little gifts.
The Room was spotlessly clean and comfortable, we used the pool on 2 occasions and it again was spotless and very well managed under the current restrictions.
We had dinner in the Lobby Lounge which was very tasty  and the personnel birthday wishes  for our daughter was again a very nice touch.
Breakfast was very tasty, ordering from a menu for Kids @ breakfast can be a nightmare but at the intercontinental it was managed very professionally and everything  on the menu was available to order for kids and adults..
Overall it was a perfect stay , i can't kind any faults especially under the current situation, we will return... R & Family..",5,2020,09,02
205,Perfect weekend away,Stayed here for the first time with my husband and newborn baby last weekend and my god did it exceed our expectations. From start to finish the staff went above and beyond to make our stay safe and memorable. We had fabulous food in the hotel for the entire weekend. We felt safe and secure the entire time we were there. I couldn't recommend it enough 😊,5,2020,08,24
205,Lovely lunch in the Lobby lounge,Both the service and the food were excellent in the Lobby lounge . Stopped off for a quick lunch. The soup and home made bread were delicious  as well as the fish dish and chips. The bartender made up a glorious non alcoholic cocktail for my daughter. There was a varied selection on the menu. The service was prompt and efficient and there was a lovely air of calmness in the hotel.,5,2020,08,13
205,Lovely family break ,"This was our 3rd stay at the hotel and once again it was excellent. 
From check in to check out, service was prompt, food was excellent and nothing was too much trouble. 
Staff are a credit to the hotel, will be back again. ",5,2020,08,11
205,"Superb, safe stay","My first stay at the Intercontinental, 4 nights, during which I hosted my Mum's 90th (which due to the current crisis had to be a very small affair). The hotel staff were just superb from start to finish. Aside from my own stay which was fabulous, the event they put on - thanks Pamela and David - was something my Mum will never forget. The care and attention and personal touches separate the good from the exceptional. The Intercontinental is the latter. They have also embraced all possible mitigating measures against Covid-19. It will be my stay at hotel from now on.",5,2020,08,08
205,The best Staycation Destination Hotel in Dublin,"Once again the Intercontinental did not disappoint. Arrived for a short break and once we parked the car and entered the lobby I could feel all my stress and worry disappear. 
The staff were professional and our booking was processed very quickly.
In these Covid times we felt so safe and very welcome. The bedroom was huge and was beautifully decorated. The bathroom was spotless, roomy and bright...and as for the shower.. I loved it, just the perfect amount of power. 
We ate both breakfast and dinner in the hotel and the service and food was sublime.
I am back in the real world and looking forward to my next visit.
Thank you to each and every team member for being so lovely.
Till the next time xx",5,2020,08,05
205,"Hard to fault, super-luxurious","We stayed here for a party nearby last December, and it couldn't have been nicer. Sadly we didn't have a huge amount of time in the hotel to enjoy it fully, but our room was beautifully comfortable, bathroom vast, all the staff we met were super-friendly, and the breakfast the next morning was absolutely excellent. Great hotel.",5,2020,08,05
205,Beautiful luxurious hotel with lovely staff and amazing service ,"Amazing stay in this beautiful luxurious hotel with great facilities..
I had been here few times on different occasions.The from desk most are welcoming with smiles on their faces and so helpful. Thank you Jane, Robert and Nutu.
The food at the season restaurant was delicious and great ambience! Chef Stephen and the team Livia, David, Stephan and Esthera. Thank you! 
Till next time. ",5,2020,08,03
205,Exceptional,"Stayed in the intercontinental during the week,with my husband. We were a bit apprehensive about staying in a hotel in these strange times, but i could not fault anything in this hotel. Felt so relaxed and safe,thanks to the wounderful staff and management. They could not have had anymore precautions in place to protect both us and their staff. I would not hesitate in returning. Excellent in every way.",5,2020,08,02
205,Fantastic,"In my job I do a tremendous amount of travel, which means that every time I stay in a hotel, it consciously or subconsciously gets compared to everywhere I've stayed before, or at least to a standard I am ""hoping for"" walking in the door. Moreover, accommodation during business travel is often just a bed for the night, where as this particular stay was with my partner for a weekend away. The Intercontinental far exceeded all expectations, a truly enjoyable experience. We left saying ""well we will certainly go back"". As always with a great hotel, it was the attentiveness and attitude of the staff that really stuck out and made the difference. 10/10 thank you and see you next time.",5,2020,07,29
205,5 Star Service Resumes,"I am a Platinum member of IHG Rewards Club and am very fortunate to get to stay in a variety of IHG hotels around the globe .I always look forward to staying in the IC Dublin. It is truly a traditional five star hotel that oozes excellence, wonderful customer service amid beautiful soft furnishing that you just  sink into. I was checked in by the ever reliable Robert who gave me a wonderful welcome after the recent Covid 19 close down. I was upgraded to a fantastic Executive Suite which I found hard not to stay all day in, it is so comfortable. 
There are small changes evident when staying but I was reassured by Mr. Logue that everything is fully available on request. At breakfast I was looked after by Olivia and Ida. Gone is the buffet but everything is available on the a la carte menu which both ladies made sure I was served perfectly. A slight little hiccup with non functioning keys to my room was quickly cleared up with Valerie at concierge going above and beyond in terms of looking after me. While down in the lobby lounge and bar everything was back to normal and it was marvellous to see so many ""locals"" coming in for dinner and drinks on the very first night that the hotel reopened. Always a good sign. Dave with his team were on hand to help with any request while Gary and David behind the bar were their usual dynamic selves. At checkout, Jane was as efficient and as pleasant as could be while requesting when will I return? The answer was "" as soon as I can"". A truly remarkable hotel.",5,2020,07,03
205,Top of the range IHG City hotel!,"Located next to the RDS and with views across the equestrian centre in Ballsbridge, the Intercontinental Dublin is a very good hotel but away from the city centre. The hotel offers a shuttle into the centre but on a short stay it’s not ideal for a quick visit into town. 

It is, nevertheless, a lovely, leafy neighbourhood of Dublin. The hotel itself has character and a stately home feel to it, particularly in the public areas.

The rooms are very spacious and comfortable, with the usual Intercontinental Agrarian amenities. My room had a panoramic view of the equestrian centre which I imagine could be very prized during shows and competitions.

The bar is a great place to relax and enjoy drinks, food and snacks. Breakfast is served in a grand room and features a host of cold and hot dishes, as well as a la carte service.

Across the board, hotel staff were always friendly and helpful. We thoroughly enjoyed friendly Irish hospitality from check in to table service. Although I would probably aim for something more central on a short stay, if I have a few more days at my disposal, then I would stay here again. ",4,2020,03,19
205,Amazing,"We had an amazing stay at the end of February.  The hotel is beautiful and our room was stunning.  The pool is great. 
Breakfast was absolutely delicious and we were extremely well looked after by a lovely lady called Jacqui. 
This hotel felt luxurious and we were treated like royalty by all staff.  Just fabulous.",5,2020,03,09
205,Very NIce IHG hotel.,"Very executive nice hotel with Parking.
Close to town centre by bus or car.
4 stars because they kept us waiting when they promised us early check-in.
Besides that good staff and services.
Will return again soon.",4,2020,03,06
205,The warmest service ever !,Thank you for an excellent stay. From muzaffar of turkey who welcomed me by name after checking the baggage tag to Natalia at the front desk who was friendly and have me the best room I have ever stayed in. Your breakfast is competent. Just work on your conference food please. Your lovely staff made this an excellent stay.,4,2020,02,28
205,Excellent Facilities and comfortable room,We had a very comfortable stay at the hotel. The room was a good size and a very comfortable bed. Spa facilities were of a high standard and usually very quiet. Lounge was a nice pace to sit in however the service was sometimes slow.,5,2020,02,17
205,Not quite there ....,"This was my 3rd stay at the hotel, the staff at reception, in particular Mark, were very welcoming. The rooms are lovely, bed is very comfortable. We ate in the lobby bar, food and service very good. Where the hotel us let down is breakfast, on the positives the quality and selection of hot & cold food is excellent. But when we were seated for breakfast there was a table in front of us waiting to be cleaned and reset, this remained untouched for the hour we had breakfast. It wasn’t the only dirty table in the restaurant. Also guests waited in line whilst there were dirty tables in the dining room, that just isn’t 5 star standard. We also attempted to order a decaf coffee and was told they didn’t serve decaf. We asked another waitress and she served the coffee. We also ordered poached eggs that never arrived. It was all a bit  chaotic. Every time we’ve stayed the breakfast service has not been up to scratch. Pity ...",4,2020,02,16
205,Intercontinental hotel Ballsbridge Dublin,Absolutely fabulous hotel. Such a comfortable suite with a luxurious sunken bath. There were lots of fluffy white towels. The bed was as if I was sleeping on a bed of feathers. The service was excellent! Truly recommend it!,5,2020,02,11
205,First class!,"An excellent hotel with first class service from a great team of staff. Superb room with some nice touches and the standard of furnishings and presentation of the hotel tells you it used to be a Four Seasons.
Stayed there for the rugby international and would definitely visit again.",5,2020,02,11
205,First Class stay,"Stayed at the Intercontinental Dublin for a couple of nights when visiting for the Ireland v Scotland rugby match, it's very handy for the Aviva Stadium. The room was top quality. Unfortunately, the hotel was so busy that we couldn't get a reservation for dinner, we will have to book earlier when we next stay as if the breakfast is anything to go by the food will be excellent. We made use of the pool which is a little small but was quiet and had a brilliant massage before checking out.",5,2020,02,10
205,I had a great overnight stay,"Visited overnight for a business trip. Great staff on reception. My bedroom was lovely. Lovely comfortable spacious bed. Above all this hotel had the best hairdryer I've ever had in a hotel. I've been looking for one since. The breakfast was divine. Amazing choice. Loved the white pudding. I only wish I got up earlier and has 3 or more stomachs to indulge. Great pool with spa facilities. If I go back to Dublin, I will stay here.",5,2020,01,31
205,Very Elegant.,"From the moment I drove up to the door to the checkout time the concierge could not have been more attentive! 
Check in was very smooth it was also very easy book over the phone too! 
The rooms are elegant and very spacious. 
There was a few hairs in the Bathroom but I brought it to their attention and there was a solution found immediately.
The dining area and lobby are very busy and have a buzzing atmosphere. 
Fabulous wine and whiskey selection! 
The breakfast was really good! 
Jackie the host is absolutely amazing!!!!! 
Huge spread for breakfast and they even have there own omelette chef on hand! 
Plenty of healthy options.
The tea is loose herbal tea, unfortunately this is not so practical when it gets stuck in the spout of the tea pot! (Only a small thing). 

I do look forward to returning! 
",4,2020,01,28
205,First Class in every way,I stayed here with my wife during a recent visit to Dublin. It was excellent in every way and I would highly recommend a stay here. It is quite expensive but the quality of the hotel overall and the First Class service makes the extra cost worthwhile.,5,2020,01,28
205,Conference,"The hotel is very nice - conference rooms well equipment. Staff very helpful. I really liked the hotel bar and the open space cafeteria where you can enjoy the view of the beautiful gardens.
The only one downside was the meal I had for lunch in the bar. I ordered mushroom risotto and it wasn’t cooked very well- the rise was still uncooked. Sadly I didn’t have enough time to wait for them to redo the meal. This made me to rate the hotel as 4 stars rather than a5 one. But I’m sure they will improve.",4,2020,01,26
205,Simply Perfect,"I am fortunate to be a Platinum member with IHG. I get to travel quite a bit but here is where my heart is. The IC Dublin rewrites what customer service is and in my experience there is no hotel in Dublin to match it.
Upon arrival, Isaac, Musi, Faifal at the front door extend a wonderful welcome. The FOH check in is seemless. Oliver, a trainee, was on point. Professional, polite and listening to my simple requests was excellent.
Robert, customer service director, had everything done for me. I am a low maintenance guest but he and his team are superb. My only request was fresh milk in the minibar and it's always there.
This stay, for the first time, I ate in the Seasons restaurant. Elegant, relaxed but with exemplary service levels, an amazing occasion. Stefane is so patient and knowledgeable, along with his colleagues, makes for a non-forgettable meal. I was worried about having dinner in such an idyllic dining room but my fears were unfounded due to such an excellent team with such a superb guest centred ethos. I was even allowed a slightly early start to dinner, such is their aim to please. Thanks again to Robert etc.
Breakfast is to die for. Do NOT miss out with the extraordinary Jacqueline on hand to make sure that each visit turns into a special occasion. A balancing act that herself and her team does seamlessly.
To finish up, I have a slight disability that restricts my mobility. However in the IC Dublin this is not an issue with their care and attention to facilitate my small requests. The ability for any large organisation to make a disability  become an invisibility across several departments is very rare. Yet here it happens every time I stay. What a wonderful place.",5,2020,01,25
205,Good for events ,"Went to a charity event there and it was well handled given the volume of people. Staff were attentive and all knew their role. The food was good and they addressed allergies well. Super food salad was great! Toilets clean, bar service a little slow. Good taxi service outside. ",4,2020,01,19
205,Good Overnight Stay,"On direct bus link from the airport. Five star hotel. Room was very good, lovely marble bathroom with separate  toilet. Excellent towels. easy controlled heat. 
Leisure center was excellent with plenty of little areas to sit and relax and enjoy some fruit or drinks.  Again plenty of towels.
Sunday lunch was nice but limited menu. Service was good.  We did notice that we were encouraged to select desert while selecting mains ( better chance to get extra sale when customer is hungry). Also wine menu seemed to be presented more than once. 
Overall some staff were very natural and good at their job, a few seemed to be trying just too hard.
Breakfast had choice of Al-cart or buffet and seemed to have just about everything you could imagine and service excellent.",4,2020,01,13
205,Great time,"We went for Christmas Eve dinner at the Seasons restaurant with the family.
Our booking was at 6pm but we had to wait as the restaurant wasn't ready for the evening service. The hostess Louise was really friendly and helpful, directing us towards the bar the time our table was ready.
Once we were in, we had a really good time, the food was delicious (although a bit slow), the service was great and the staff was amazing.
The entertainment was very nice too, although a bit loud from where we were.",5,2020,01,09
205,Pleasant Stay,"I stayed here with friends for one night. The room in our hotel was great...very comfortable beds, clean bathroom, perfect tempetature, etc. The hotel staff in general were all professional, helpful and friendly. We dined out that evening so cannot comment on the dinner. However, I have to say that I was disappointed with the breakfast in the morning. The food wasn't up to the standard that I'd expect from a 5 star hotel especially for the price they charge. There was also a mix up and we got a bill for our breakfast even though we'd already paid for it.",4,2020,01,08
205,Pure Class Hotel ,"Thank you again for another amazing stay. This hotel ticks all the boxes. 
Great location. Parking. First class facilities. Fantastic staff. 
Arrived really early after flight from NYC. Staff were brilliant. Early check in and I was in the room to get some rest. 
There’s no room service carts clanging about outside and they don’t keep ringing the bell for things to do or check like some hotels. Was perfectly quiet the entire stay. 
The food is first class. Both breakfast and lounge area. 
Love this hotel and will Return whenever I’m in this great city. 
Congrats InterCon Dublin!",5,2020,01,08
205,Friendly Staff,"Fantastic stay from check in with trainee Oliver. From then Val the concierge had her best interests set in the enjoyment of our stay. Also Micheal who had white hair was fantastic he was friendly, polite and everything you would expect. Night manager Fautso was always ready to help and was very welcoming. The rooms were deluxe and spacious. After a busy day wind down in the relaxing swimming pool and gym. Fantastic stay. All in all the best staff are val,Micheal,fautso and Oliver.
Keep it up.",5,2020,01,06
205,Becoming a tradition,This is the 2nd December we have stayed here & it was as good as last year.  The hotel is stunning & upon arrival the check in was seamless and very friendly but not over the top staff.  Our suite was spotless & was a lovely surprise to see an umbrella for the awful Dublin weather that had hit that day.  The bar man served the nicest espresso martinis we’ve had & we had to go for seconds they were so good.  Jackie in the dining room was so lovely again & made recommendations about what was new with the breakfast offerings.  Didn’t get a chance to use the spa again but would hopefully get their another time.  Can’t fault anything & would only highly recommend.  ,5,2020,01,04
205,Glamorous look but dated and poor quality,"We came here for a treat for two nights stay, expecting to experience fine dining and a wonderful atmosphere.  Sadly the food is average hotel quality, nothing special, high priced and lacking finesse.  The staff are willing and polite but a bit bemused when you request anything, such as a clean knife!  A real shame about the dining experience, but the beds are super comfy and the bathrooms wonderful - all in all we found this hotel did not meet the intercontinental standard we are used to",3,2020,01,03
205,Very friendly staff,"Came for breakfast in the restaurant, the buffet is amazing, the omelette chef Kyle was very accommodating and I had a lovely Belgian waitress serving me called Louise, great conversation and very helpful and service with a smile. Would definitely the hotel, great value for money and would come again next time I'm in Dublin.",5,2020,01,01
205,Nice Hotel but,"Stayed here Sunday and Monday night. It has changed since days of four Seasons. Sunday night was ruined by kids racing around the lobby and bar area making loads of noise. What happened to the law of no kids allowed in bar after 9pm. 
It was better On Monday night. Bedroom was lovely and and food was good. However standards seem to have dropped. 
There are now better run 5 stars in Dublin. 
Disappointing",3,2019,12,31
205,Not Impressed,"Where do I start? Is it with rooms that weren't ready, the supposed executive room (the only difference being the view) or the fact that when we finally got the keys to our rooms the gentlemen on reception had no record of the keys not being issued. As a Spire Elite member I have come to expect more. I feel this hotel is letting the brand down. The pictures show the only difference between a deluxe view and an executive view.",1,2019,12,28
205,Family stay ,"We were upgraded to a family room which was great and spacious, hotel staff was very nice, though even at Christmas time hotel seemed a bit short staffed. E.g. our room never got cleaned on one of the days and Concierge didn’t answer phone when we needed to get bags down.
Hotel space is great but dated - a few elements need attention: heating in the room does not get above 20’C without extra heater, phones look very old, gadgets like blow drier not working properly, espresso maker had a mind of its own and coffee/tea area is very tight and prone to accidents. Pool area is great for kids and spa kit is excellent. No complaints there! Room service food was bit of a hit and miss for us - some items were fresh and tasty and some bit stale for the similar price. Finally - Christmas decorations were beautiful!",3,2019,12,24
205,Excellent lunch,Attended private lunch with a big group. Smoked Salmon followed by beef fillet all excellent. I missed desert as I moved around table. My fault. Very good waiter . Had pre lunch drink in the bar. Always very good ,5,2019,12,23
205,Beautiful Hotel,"My husband and I along with our 2 children stayed in a double room, room 330. On arrival we were warmly greeted and check in was fast & seamless. The hotel was dressed beautifully for Christmas and had a lovely festive atmosphere. Our room was beautiful, the beds were firm but very comfortable, the bedding was so cosy. The bathroom was huge, the toiletries smelt amazing and the fluffy bathrobes for us and the children were great. The hairdryer was great too. 
We ate at Seasons, the food was amazing with service to match. We had a 3 course festive menu, the portions were hearty and the turkey was amazing. The children's menu was great too. After dinner we enjoyed champagne in the lobby bar listening to the piano. We had a lovely relaxing evening. 
Service at breakfast was a bit patchy, but the food selection was great. 

The spa area was lovely. My children enjoyed some time in the pool, and they had a great time. The pool area is small but very nice. The changing rooms are the nicest I've ever been in. 

We had a fantastic stay at the InterContinental and are already looking forward to our next stay here.",5,2019,12,23
205,Special Christmas Afternoon Tea,Ambience and afternoon ya setting was excellent. Service was fabulous and the food was tasty and fresh with a nice Christmas theme although cakes and pastries were quite sweet. One opportunity for improvement was there was  lovely choice of teas served in lovely teapots however the handles where way to hot to lift even with the paper napkin provided. I actually dropped mine and luckily managed to save it to land on the plate . Overall we enjoyed our afternoon tea and the children like their special kids tea too. Highly recommend for a special occasion afternoon tea.,5,2019,12,23
205,AMAZING 🎄🎄🎄,"We flew into Dublin for the day and planned just to have lunch at the Intercontinental (“Express 3 course Lunch” €19 - fantastic value!) and then wander around Dublin City centre itself. However the wonderful Irish weather (heavy rain and strong winds) put a stop to this. Upon entering the Intercontinental we were AMAZED at the decorations. Beautifully decorated Christmas trees everywhere you looked and two HUGE wonderfully made gingerbread structures - one a traditional house and one a church (replicating the Italian Head Chef’s one in her home town!). The staff here are friendly and extremely attentive - nothing was too much (the chef made a meal that wasn’t even on the menu!!). I urge you to pop in, even just for a drink, to take in the hotels AWE INSPIRING view and ambience. We then proceeded to spend an extremely relaxing and tranquil afternoon in the Spa. We will definitely be back.",5,2019,12,19
205,Went for lunch as non staying guest,"Beautifully set out and maintained hotel. The Christmas decorations and flowers in the foyer were lovely and pretty. The staff were very friendly.
We had lunch in the lobby area and the staff took a very long time to serve us. There were plenty of staff but they seemed to be very young and probably not very experienced. They were not looking out to be aware that customers were needing service, refilling of glass etc etc. The food , when it eventually arrived , was mediocre. The deserts were delicious. The food was not value for the money we paid but the ambiance helped to make it an enjoyable experience but one not to be repeated.",4,2019,12,18
205,A great stay. ,"The Intercontinental Dublin is a grand, modern hotel located near the Dublin RDS venue and the American embassy with lots of parking. It’s approximately a 20 minute drive from the city centre. 

It’s typical lavish style caters for the high-end of the market. We stayed for just one night in room 406, a comfortable spacious double room with views over the garden at the back and the neighbouring horse ménage of the RDS venue. 

There are leisure facilities on site with a swimming pool, but we didn’t use them on this occasion. 

Breakfast is comprehensive and appears to cater for all tastes and needs including our friend who has a gluten intolerance. 

The bar/lounge has a lovely ambience in the evening with a pianist playing. 

A lovely, enjoyable stay and we plan to return. ",5,2019,12,14
205,Great hotel with issues,"Stayed here for a conference and then two days after with my family. The stay became a tale of two halves. The business side was excellent throughout, a great comfortable room with very good meals in the hotel. However when my family arrived, I changed to a family room and the comfort from the previous night had disappeared with a lumpy bed and a dribbling shower. We asked to change rooms and were shown to another room, which was an improvement but still not as good the first one. Overall a bit of a disappointment. There are better refurbished rooms, so do take care when booking.",4,2019,12,10
205,ATTENDED AFTERNOON TEA AT THE READING ROOM...,"My wife and I attended afternoon tea at The Lobby Lounge & The Reading Room at your fabulous hotel after just touching down in Dublin.  We were very impressed as to how receptive, welcoming and friendly your staff was.  The young lady Aoife, who served us, was exceptional and was worth the long trip to your hotel.  Aoife was very friendly, attentive, and made us feel very welcomed during the entire afternoon tea event.  Furthermore, the tea, food and pastries she brought out were spot on.  We highly recommend your Intercontinental Hotel, Lobby Lounge and Reading Room to all our associates and colleagues. Thank you so much for your hospitality and we look forward to visiting again in the near future.",5,2019,12,09
205,Exceptional three nights stay in Dublin.,"Georgeous hotel area, with perfect decorations. Spacious, clean room (nr. 420) with lovely large bathroom. Comfortable bed. Hotel dining was in one word AMAZING. Very friendly and helpful hotel staff.

Only one word about all stay – exceptional.

I definitely recommend this hotel for your Dublin visit.",5,2019,12,08
205,Attending a formal ball,"My wife and I booked into the hotel on Friday afternoon to attend a ball that evening.
The hotel is beautiful and our room was lovely, we had room service and we could not fault anything
We went to the main hotel bar off the lobby area to wait for my table guests to arrive. 
We found the bar staff to be very indifferent and mortally slow. 
It was the same in the two bars outside the function room where the ball was on. 
The floor staff in the ballroom were wonderful, no trouble getting bottles of wine for our guests. 
One of my guests went to the bars just outside the ballroom to buy drinks and when returned to the table and was incensed by the treatment he received. My son went to the bar and was ignored by staff so went to bar at opposite end of room with another customer and requested some drinks, to be told by the 3 staff who were chatting and looking at mobile phones that they would be with him in a minute. 

There is obviously no manager / supervisor in this area or the staff have no respect for anyone. 

I reported this to reception at checkout. 
I have since received an email from the Guest Relations Manager that “ my comments have been forwarded to our Food and Beverages Management for their action “

This is not good enough in an establishment of this type. 
The next time I go to this function I will have our pre drinks outside the hotel.",4,2019,12,03
205,Absolute luxury,"Myself and my wife stayed for only one night and really didn't want to leave. This is so far the best hotel we have stayed at in Ireland, on all fronts. The junior suites are perfect for a luxury night away staff are superb door was delicious as was the wine and live piano in the bar was an excellent touch. The main event was the breakfast oh my god another level altogether. Thank you intercontinental, I'll be back.",5,2019,11,25
205,Amazing Hotel,"I stayed here for a business meeting.  I can only say that the hotel was amazing.  The room was spacious. I'm not sure of the size but I believe it was a junior suite - I received an upgrade from a deluxe room.  The room was well laid out and everything about it screamed luxury.  There were normal amenities in the room like a refrigerator, coffee maker, etc.  The restaurant was nice with a decent menu and a good bar.  The staff was excellent and would quickly get you a taxi (although, if you are new to Ireland, get the FreeNow app- it is the Ireland/Europe version of Uber). Overall a very nice hotel.

In addition, it was in decent walking distance to a few shops, pubs and restaurants.  If you don't mind a lot of walking, you can navigate to the waterfront, Trinity College and Grafton Quarter without much issue.  I walked from the PWC building on River Liffey North Quay and through those places above on a journey back to the hotel while out exploring.  Also, stop by Base Wood Fire Pizza - I know it is Dublin and Pizza is not super local - but, it was a really good pizza (of course, I did eat there after walking 5 miles).",5,2019,11,24
205,Wonderful Afternoon Tea Experience ,We were recently here for afternoon tea and I must say we were all delighted by the delicious treats. Staff is extremely helpful and go the extra mile to make sure everything is perfect! Great attention to detail. A big thank you to everyone who made my birthday so special! 😊,5,2019,11,23
205,Beautiful Suites,"Another Intercontinental hotel ticked off and this one is close to being up there with the best of them! We stayed for 3 nights in an Executive Suite with balcony and must say the decor, furnishings and the space was amazing! The breakfast buffet was superb! Nice pool and spa area, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Just a tad disappointed that there is no Club Lounge facility here, if they were to add this, it truly would be comparable to the best of the IC group!",5,2019,11,17
205,Fantastic Hotel,"I had the pleasure to stay at this property for a weekend break. The IC Dublin exceeded my expectations with the homely atmosphere in the hotel, beautifully decorated and spacious rooms and friendly staff. 

Upon check-in we were greeted by Mr. Nutu who gave us a warm welcome, and took the time to give us detailed recommendations & information. 

The room was spacious and elegant, with a large bathroom. We used the SPA later in the day - and it was decent with a fairly large pool and jacuzzi, as well as a Sauna and Steaming Room. 

We did not eat at the restaurant, but the breakfast buffet was excellent with a wide range of food & beverages. 

Location - it is slightly outside the city center, but only a 10-15 minute ride with Taxi or 30-40 minutes by foot. We actually enjoyed that the hotel was outside the city center, as it is nice and quiet when you want to get away from the crowds. 

However, what makes this hotel standout for me is the warm atmosphere that can be felt across the property, along with the friendly and professional staff. They clearly take good care of the hotel, and the Christmas decorations were beautiful.",5,2019,11,17
205,Beautiful Hotel,"We checked in this afternoon for a three night stay and were given a wonderful upgrade to a contemporary king.  Our room wasn't quite ready so we retired to a local hostelry until we got the phone call that the room was available (very nice touch).
All the staff we have met are warm and friendly and made us feel extremely welcome.
The hotel is decked out ready for Christmas with trees beautifully decorated.
I love the room (433) it's very spacious with a great big bathroom; seperate bath and shower and great l'Occitane toiletries which I love.
This hotel and staff  are a credit to IHG and I would whole heartedly recommend this.",5,2019,11,15
205,Birthday Weekend Celebration,The rooms and service at this hotel are fantastic. The staff were super well trained and absolutely charming. Breakfast was a delight with terrific quality and a great selection on offer. What impressed us most was how well managed the very busy breakfast servcie was. The bar staff were very knowledgable and incredibly helpful. We honestly can't wait to go back! Highly reccommended ,5,2019,11,11
205,Loved my room; good/excellent service; great location,"For this 5-night stay in Dublin, this turned out to be a great choice and a pleasant surprise. Mind you, I’m not a fan of Intercontinental hotels, but this one was much better than expected. Loved my room and if they can improve the service in the lobby lounge, it would be perfect. This property was originally built as a Four Seasons Hotel in 2001, and was taken over by InterContinental in 2015.

Check-in: Kudos to Graham at the Front Desk who provided excellent assistance. My initial room choice (an open concept king suite) was on a low floor. For some reason, in order to move to a higher floor, I had to upgrade to a 1-bedroom suite, which I did. (Of course, I’m sure there was another option, but given my experience with hotels, I wasn’t up for the extended discussion, calling a manager, etc.) Maud, at the Front Desk, also provided excellent service to my companion in regards to room choice and options.

Room: It was a 1-bedroom king suite. The living space had the obligatory couch, coffee table, a table with two chairs, a desk, and included a half bath. The desk had ample space, but the dining table as my primary work-space since it was near the window. (The view was OK – nothing exciting, but it had a large window so there was plenty of natural light.) I’m not schooled in furniture styles, but it appeared European (as in the online photos), but the couch and chairs were comfortable as was the entire living space. It was a king bed, but a bit too mushy/soft for my taste. And, I think the mattresses need to be replaced as mine had that worn, sunken appearance and when sleeping on the initial side, I would fall to the middle of the bed. The other side of the king bed was less used so I slept on that other side during the stay. My companion had the same issue with her bed. In fact, they exchanged her mattress, but the replacement had the same issue. The full bath was of sufficient size and worked out fine. The bedroom had a “balcony” of some sort, but there was barely enough space to stand and a chair wasn’t even possible. Overall, I loved my room (except for the bed). A comfortable/great place to relax and unwind, and get some work done, as well. 

Service: Overall, service was good to excellent to outstanding. Barry (I think that was his name) at the Concierge desk was friendly, knowledgeable, and quite helpful during our stay (thank you!). Service in the restaurant for breakfast was excellent. I wish I could remember the lady’s name who played the role of maître d. She would greet us in the mornings, and she (short, squarish glasses) was wonderful! At some point, she was also working in the lobby lounge and her service there was also gracious, accommodating, and attentive. The rest of the attendants in the lobby lounge were a band of mostly hit -or-miss 20-somethings who lacked focus, attention to detail, and were very poor at follow-up. They would show up, then disappear, and never to return. On several occasions, I had to get up and find someone to pay the bill. In several instances, the order was incorrect. The service in the lobby lounge was usually challenging. Excellent doormen, as well. One doorman, who was a bit overwhelmed at one point because of the flow of guests, was professional and patient as he successfully navigated some obnoxious and overbearing guests without losing his cool and, at same time, he was not rude to the guests. He was great.

Other: The gym was fine. It had enough equipment and machines for this stay and maybe because it was the off-season, but the gym was never crowded. 

Food: We had breakfast in the restaurant each morning. I can’t be objective since I get tired of traveling and breakfasts all tastes the same. It was buffet style (which I personally dislike), but they had an omelet station. Overall, the food was fine for what it was; and there was plenty of it. We also had afternoon tea in the lobby lounge. The tea service was OK, but again, service started OK, but became worse as the afternoon progressed (i.e., no refill on the tea; food items ordered, but arrived 20 minutes later; no follow up for a simple glass of water). 

Location: The location of the hotel is not near the city center so that might be an issue for others. The hotel is away from the hustle and bustle, but that was OK with me. At the end of a tourist day, I fine being away from the city center. When I walked to the city center, it took about 30-40 minutes. I like walking cities so it worked out well for me. I had my rain gear because the weather didn’t always cooperate.

Would I stay at the InterContinental Dublin, again? Absolutely.",5,2019,11,08
205,Amazing!,"This hotel is absolutely amazing. I stayed here with three of my friends we all shared a room which was adequate for our two night stay. The beds were so comfortable, we all had a very good nights sleep.
The facilities such as the sauna, swimming pool and gym was an added bonus.
Could not fault the staff everyone was so friendly, professional and very helpful. We will definitely recommend this hotel and are planning to return again soon.
Thank you for making us feel so welcome.",5,2019,11,05
205,Everything I wanted it to be.,The IC Dublin was perfect for me. Lovely location. Great service. Comfortable and luxurious rooms. I loved the bar. Perfect cocktails. Good breakfast. This hotel is ideal for business or pleasure. There is nothing I can fault. ,5,2019,11,04
205,Great hotel,Stayed here for the night and the staff and food were amazing also the rooms are gorgeous too and love the coffee machine in the room. Will defo be back and relaxed after an amazing facial. Would highly recommend this hotel. The baths are huge,5,2019,10,29
205,Adequate,"Firstly, the staff were wonderful at this hotel, especially the lounge staff and housekeeping who were friendly, professional and courteous. 

There were many things I was not too happy about, given the 5 star rating of this hotel. I did not raise these issues at the time because I'd rather not have to complain - it alters the mood. Things should just be as expected first time around. 

Firstly I requested a room with a view overlooking the Simmonscourt Arena. I did not get that. There was a delay in checking in and we were offered a refreshment in the lounge. That was nice. We were then informed ore room was ready and it had been recently refurbished, which I found hard to believe. There wasn't anything wrong with it specifically, it just felt a bit aged.  

The bed, duvet and pillows were not comfortable. I just stayed in a Hampton Hilton the night before and they were an absolute delight. The pillows in the Intercontinental are disastrous. They are not the usual hotel pillows that always plumb back to perfection. These were limp and lifeless. 

What really peeved me off was being woken at 7am by the connecting room. They were ""making love"" very loudly and it lasted 40 minutes. I could also hear them using the lavatory. 

The breakfast room was really busy but we didn't have to queue thankfully. We weren't offered pots of tea or coffee like other guests. The coffee was appalling - both the automatic machine and the ""flask coffee"", which I eventually got when I found a waiter to ask.
The food was fine, nothing special. Again, the hotel I had stayed in the previous night had an excellent breakfast buffet, which was hot, replenished often and had good variety. 

The morning of check-out, we were interrupted by various departments knocking on our door, three times! The mini bar guy and housekeeping twice. Where was the check-out rota? We had late check-out for 2pm.

Another annoying issue was the residents bar closing at around 12:30am. Of all the hotels I've stayed, this is highly unusual and unexpected for five star establishment. The solution we were offered was to order drinks from our room and then bring them back down to the lounge to enjoy them if we liked. We didn't do that of course.

Overall, there is far superior quality to be found elsewhere.",3,2019,10,23
205,Fabulous,"I arrived at the Intercontinental October 20th and I honestly have no complaints this time round. The reception staff, Jane and Mark could not have been more than welcoming when arriving. The allocation of rooms were quick and everything was explained clearly by Mark so thank you! We went for dinner at around 5:30 and we were all welcomed by a waiter named David who gave us all the specials, good recommendations of cocktails and made good chit chat with everyone. Good attention to detail was made to us throughout the meal so thanks again David! Room were beautifully cleaned and a good nights sleep was had. The next day, we went to the Lobby lounge for the express lunch and I can’t express how tasty it was for such a low price! The overall experience compared to my last visit has improved miraculously and I can’t thank all the staff enough.  ",5,2019,10,21
205,Beautiful ,This is hotel is beautiful.  The rooms are large and luxurious.  The shower is a large walk in and the bathroom is very spacious.  Hotel has limited menu but there are some pubs within a 10 minute walk.  I can’t speak to the value as we are on a group tour.,5,2019,10,20
205,Superb luxury hotel with great service and amenities,"This was our first visit to the InterContinental but it will certainly not be our last as both my wife and I rated it very highly. I had called in advance and the helpful Concierge had booked us 1st class train tickets to Belfast which we collected later in the week from Connolly station. We were warmly greeted on arrival by Reception and escorted to our room with luggage. The room was just so comfortable and beautifully furnished with a lovely King size bed. Everything we wanted, we found including Earl Grey tea and fresh milk, plenty of hangars in the vast wardrobe, warm and large white bathrobes, lots of 13-amp sockets especially by the work desk, good lighting and a large flat screen TV. However it was perhaps the bathroom which was particularly impressive with walk-in glass shower, easy to use controls, instant hot water and powerful jest if needed. The bath was similarly well designed. Towels were generous in size and good to use. Mirrors and shelving aplenty.
This was one of the most enjoyable City hotel visits we have encountered over many years. Well done IHG !!",5,2019,10,19
205,A night of luxury,"My wife and I had the pleasure of recently staying at this property.  A very warm welcome awaited us at the front door and at reception.  Our luggage was swiftly delivered to our room.  The entire hotel has a very quiet and pleasant atmosphere.  Our room was very spacious with a separate bath and shower.  The bed was extremely comfortable so a greats nights sleep was had.  

Tea making facilities were available and a Nespresso machine was also in the room along with a well stocked mini bar.  

As we were meeting friends in a nearby restaurant we did not have dinner in the hotel but we did have breakfast the following morning which was of an excellent standard with a substantial selection of continental and hot items.

All the hotel staff were very friendly and had no hesitation in attending to our needs.

Overall we found the experience of staying at this property completely faultless and would have no hesitation in returning in the future.",5,2019,10,13
205,Charm at the Intercontinental Lounge,"We spent a fantastic evening in the Lounge with my friends last night; there was a most charming atmosphere with lovely live piano music and chandellier dim lights, great service and good food. Just superb.",5,2019,10,12
205,Great hotel by all aspects,"I had the pleasure of staying at the interContinental Dublin last week and must say that it was a great experience. This is probably the best if not one of the best hotels in Dublin. Everything was perfect, the room, the pool and spa area, the hotel overall, the great Irish breakfast, and above all the friendly and most efficient staff, at the reception, in the bar or the breakast area. I specifically would like to thank doorman Isaac and concierge Valerie for their kind, friendly and reliable help throughout my stay and look forward to coming back sooner than later.",5,2019,10,10
205,Top class,"The Intercontinental is a Beautiful hotel in Ballsbridge, Dublin.  It’s a great location being so close to the city center and all the tourist attractions.  Lovely spacious reception, enjoyed drinks in the Ice Bar and the food was delicious. ",5,2019,10,07
205,Luxury!,This room was amazing. We were only here for one night but it was just beautiful. And the bathroom! Hugest Hotel bathroom I've ever had the pleasure of using. Giant soaking tub as well as a walk-in shower and marble everywhere.,5,2019,10,07
205,Tessy mac,"This is my 3rd stay at this hotel.  I cannot fault it. A great nights sleep. The rooms were plush, comfortable and spacious. To our pleasant surprise we were upgraded to a suite.  Staff very helpful. Facilities good. Spotless throughout. Very enjoyable stay. I will be back.  ",5,2019,10,06
205,Thanks Carlos,Thanks Carlos for making us feel so welcome to The Hotel and Ireland my best wishes to you please keep lighting up the Hotel wih your wercoming and friendly smile thank you Carlos you are a Super 🌟 hotel is excellente the location amazing,5,2019,10,06
205,I don't even know where to begin!!!,"I have stayed at IC all over the world and have always had a consistent and positive experience. So, upon making reservations at the IC-Dublin, I expected a solid experience. My expectations were blown away. Our flight arrived early on Sunday morning, and I know the IC drill, check-in, be told they will do their best to get you a room before three, and then you may have a room by two. Upon check-in, I was informed that a room was not ready but would be in fifteen minutes, and it was ready in less. And not just any room, since it was my husband and I's anniversary, we were placed in a one-bedroom suite. When we entered the room we found a beautiful room with a balcony, and an anniversary tray on the dining table. I couldn't believe the thoughtfulness of the hotel. I will break this down in segments:

The room was fantastic, beautiful and exceptionally clean. It even had windows that open! Anyone that travels often knows this rare. It was exceptionally quiet, and the bathroom was huge with a separate WC. The only issue for me (which is personal preference) very soft pillows and a very hard mattress.

The grounds are beautiful, the courtyard was amazing, and the fountain gives the aura of waves lapping at the shore. The location is a little ""removed"" from the hustle and bustle of downtown Dublin, which also means it is quiet and relaxing. But, the train stop is very close by, taxis are plentiful, a bus passes through often. Also, there is a hotel car service, and for a healthy individual, it is a simple walk to Grafton Street etc...

The staff: AMAZING!!!!!!!!! Every single person that assisted us, from the front desk to the concierge and bellman were the absolute best of not only any IC I have stayed in, but any hotel I have stayed in. On our anniversary night, we received chocolates, fresh fruit, cookies, and mixed nuts. It is these thoughtful touches that set this hotel apart from all others. 

I could really go on and on, but this is certainly one of the jewels in the IHG crown. Furthermore, I used IHG points to reserve my room and was treated as if I had just paid cash for an entire floor of the hotel.",5,2019,10,03
205,Taste the Island festival ,Stayed on the night of the 1st October. Check in was perfect. Room was dated but spotless. Pillows too soft but my wife thought they were perfect. We had the set 3 course meal in the Reading room as opposed to the Seasons restaurant. Service was very good and food was excellent. Next morning breakfast was superb and Jacqueline was really helpful as was the omelette chef. Check out was perfect and free car parking a bonus. Overall a very nice experience.,5,2019,10,02
205,The best 5 star hotel in Dublin ,"My family and I stayed here in September last year for the first time   It was an unplanned visit after a distressing experience on the Irish Sea and I was blown away by the kindness of the staff and their concern. I did a review on here at the time We had booked a  two night birthday celebration stay at the Shelbourne for the following month but were so impressed, we changed the reservation to the Inter Continental. Again, the comfort and service was outstanding. Our friends who stayed with us were equally impressed. We came back in December for a two night Christmas stay and although it was an international football weekend, the same high standards were delivered under pressure. The breakfasts are as good as any we have had at any 5 star hotel. Even better than Castle Leslie  in the good old days. The food in the Lobby Lounge is great value and of a high standard and the people watching is first rate. The room price may be top end but the value is exceptional. Looking forward to our birthday celebrations there again later this month. ",5,2019,10,02
205,"Great service, nice space in room","Beautiful flowers in the lobby, and a cozy piano bar greet you as you enter.  Iced tea is available free all day.  The room was spacious with good amenities including a pod coffee maker with a variety of coffee & tea, both a bath and shower, toiletry items, a mini-bar/fridge, and robe & slippers.  The windows opened wide, but not much of a view.  The A.C., T.V., & internet worked well.  This hotel is located in a nice, fairly upscale residential area about a 45 minute walk from the center of Dublin.  A bus stopped right outside the hotel and the ""Dart"" train was a short walk.",5,2019,09,22
205,The Intercontinental Experience,"After spending 5 nights at the Dublin Intercontinental, I want to report about the outstanding service we received from Isaac and staff.  Seeing Isaac or Valerie greeting us as we came and went always brought a smile to our faces and a conversation about either where we were off to or where we were returning from.  They were knowledgeable, kind, courteous, and delightful.  Their suggestions of places to eat and THE NATIONAL MUSEUM were spot on! Outstanding place to stay with the lovely outdoor green spaces and tucked away in the quiet Bolsbridge neighborhood. We’ll return here again and again........",5,2019,09,18
205,British Isles,Stayed here for one night.  Located in a peaceful area of Dublin.  Beautiful elegant hotel with beautiful gardens.  A great way to start a holiday.   We had a beautiful appointed room.  Wheelchairs friendly.  A beautiful lobby bar and lounge. Excellent customer service.,5,2019,09,14
205,The Upper Crust,"Exceptional classy hotel in a really lovely section of Dublin, about 1.5 miles or so to Dublin City Center. 

I used my premium IHG credit card to snag a free night and an upgrade to a suite. Quite impressive - the size, the linens, the bathroom (fantastic tub, separate shower, separate toilet room), walk in closet. 

Staff is top notch. The spa area has a solid gym with both free weights and machines. 

A taste of the high life - could be addicting.",5,2019,09,12
205,Disappointing to see rip off Ireland in action,"Stayed here 31st August to 1st Sept 2019. I don't mind paying for quality, I do mind rip off merchants. The bar, the food - overpriced. The room was nice. The real shocker was a carpark charge of 18 euro a night per vehicle. At the prices charged for the room, food & beverages, I think the price of staying in carpark should be waived for patrons. It's the first time a hotel I've stayed in has charged me to use their carpark. Not happy about it.",3,2019,09,05
205,"Nice hotel, good location ","Nice hotel, good location, few min walk from the train station with direct line to the center. 
The breakfast was somehow disappointing, especially the self service offer, which was quite basic. 
Dinner in the main restaurant however was very good, with nice wine selection and high quality service.
For a quick snack the bar is a good option too.

205,Excellent Dublin Hotel,"We had a wonderful stay at the InterContinental Dublin. 

The staff is superb - professional and friendly. We especially appreciate the efforts of the concierge staff to enhance our visit. Valerie was absolutely wonderful - knowledgable, thoughtful, and made our trip much more special!  

Our room was spacious, well appointed and maintained. The bed and linens were extremely comfortable and the bathroom was large and well maintained.

The pool and spa were great and we enjoyed all of the restaurants and bars.

The hotel is in beautiful Ballsbridge, which does mean a long walk, taxi or public transportation to the center of Dublin.

We highly recommend the Intercontinental Dublin!",5,2019,09,03
205,Dublin is Awesome,"My husband and I stayed 3 extra days in Dublin after a 16 day cruise. The staff at the Intercontinental Hotel is very accommodating and friendly. The Concierge was particularly helpful in suggesting places to visit and how to get around town. The rooms were nicely furnished, spacious and quiet. It was a lovely stay!",5,2019,09,03
205,Nice 5 Star Hotel for Sightseeing,"Nice Hotel with lovely Christmas deco in late November. 

Pool big enough for a City Hotel.

Suite with 4 beds for the whole family was big and with lovely furnitures.  

A bit far away from the city center.

205,Excellent Hotel,"Excellent hotel in a great location. 
The Service was very good. 
Room clean to a good standard with great view.
Food excellent and would highly recommend the Sunday Brunch with a wonderful selection of food in a very laid back and family friendly setting.",4,2019,09,02
205,Amazing,"Last minute I decided to change the reservation I had booked at a city center hotel and book at the Intercontinental instead which was actually less expensive! We were travelling with our kids and they wanted a pool and it turned out to be a good decision to stay outside the city center. 

The hotel was amazing and had such a lovely atmosphere. We booked a suite with a king and pull out couch for the kids. It was the best room we had during our whole stay in Ireland - the bathroom was huge and we even had our own walk in massive closet! The beds and pillows were heaven. The service was amazing, food great and pool/spa was very classy. The kids loved their robes too and thought everything was very fancy! The breakfast was out of this world...included so many options I cannot even begin to elaborate what was offered and I thought the honeycomb was so unique! ...the hostess was so sweet as well. I would not think of staying anywhere else!",5,2019,08,27
205,"Brilliant, top quality hotel","This is a brilliant hotel.  It ranks up there among the best for luxury and is worth the price.  The bed is like sleeping between two clouds when it comes to comforts. The room is very spacious and the shower and bath setup is excellent.  My wife recently suffered an broken arm and the design of the bath was important for keeping it dry.  And without asking for anything special.  The fitness center was large and well-equipped, and the use a very nice sauna and relaxation area made for a very good workout.",5,2019,08,26
205,What has happened to your fabulous breakfast experience?,"Hotel 5*

Breakfast 3*

My review of this hotel last year was exceptional, where we suggested it was one of our favourite stays and amongst the best breakfast experiences anywhere ever. 

So we returned this year with my sister and her husband to celebrate her 60th birthday.  The hotel was beautiful and welcoming as ever. We had 2 beautiful contemporary rooms with balconies, and all in all we had a good stay.

However my absolute problem, and in complete contrast to last year was with breakfast service and quality.  How on earth could it go so wrong so quickly.  On both mornings the proceedings were like a comedy of errors or a car crash in customer service.  Bad enough anywhere, but in a 5* Intercontinental at over €100 per day for 4, this was far from acceptable.  It is clear that their personal service with ordering tea / coffee, toast, and egg station totally which we loved last year becomes a liability when they are busy.  I can only assume they offer weekend packages with breakfast included which results in numbers of customers that they just can’t cope with.  Or indeed they need to employ many more staff to cope.  The calm and helpful manageress from last year didn’t seem to know what to do when bombarded my complaint after complaint and request after request from customers who waited 10-15 mins for coffee, then another 10 mins for toast, then another 10 mins for butter.  Waiter staff seemed to retreat behind the scenes in the hope that no one would ask for anything else.  Obviously everywhere can have a bad day, however day 2 was quieter but still as chaotic.  I felt quite embarrassed having raised the expectations of my guests who at least found the whole experience comical.  

It wasn’t just the waiting staff or manager that were to blame however.  Often, many items from the hot buffet were missing and clearly were not being refreshed quickly enough.  The egg station was a disaster.  The chef didn’t really acknowledge or engage customers, rather kept his head down and served one customer at a time, meaning that customers were hanging around for a considerable amount of time just to place an order and then waiting for a considerable time for the order resulting in lots of people hanging around and blocking the flow of the buffet - normally in a 5* breakfast you could order and they would bring it to you.  

On one occasion, I waited 10 mins to order eggs, only to be told I needed to order eggs from our table waiter, which hadn’t been conveyed to us.  However our table waiter was in one of his retreats behind the scenes so I asked the manageress to help, who in turn said she would send a waiter.  10 mins later, a waiter came, another 10 mins still no eggs, another 10 mins and another plead to manageress to intervene, another 10 mins - 40 mins in total! Of course everyone had now finished breakfast.  Each issue was minor, however 10 issues combine to make it feel like a disaster, and when staff don’t appear to take pride in their service it is a significant problem. 

What was more alarming however is when I raised this at checkout, the manager overheard me and said he was sorry, however made no attempt to take any details to try and improve the service, or to understand the depth of the problems.  If you reflect on my review from last year compared to this year as a manager I would clearly want to understand the issues and how to improve them.",4,2019,08,24
205,a premium hotel in a beautiful neighborhood,"This hotel is one of the best intercontinental hotels we have beeb - and we were in a lot.
the atmosphere is quite and peaceful, very elegant. The rooms are big and comfortable, very clean. The breakfast is rich and grate. Service in a very high degree, and the staff is wonderful. Although the hotel is a bit far from city center, it worth staying there.",5,2019,08,23
205,Top Notch,"My family stayed here from August 13 to 16.  This is a very nice place, well maintained with a friendly and helpful staff.  No complaints at all and would stay here again on next trip to Dublin.  Concierge Valerie was extremely helpful in getting us train tickets to Galway as we unsure how that processed worked. Some decent restaurants a short walk away too.",5,2019,08,23
205,Exceptional hotel,Had the pleasure of a 4 day stay in this beautiful hotel. The staff went out of their way to ensure we had the best of everything and enjoyed our stay. The rooms are spacious with fabulously comfortable beds and linens. The food was amazing and the cocktails in the lounge were out of this world. ,5,2019,08,23
205,One of the best Intercontinentals ever !!!!!!!!! The Intercontinental Experience,"As a Platinum ambassador member, IHG has been my hotel of choice for over 15 years. I have stayed in almost all in Europe and the US (oh and Israel and Australia) I must say that my favorites were Le Grand,  Avenue Marceau in Paris and Marseille as I got to know the General Directors quite well..Approaching the hotel I felt a slight rush as it looked like it was going to be a very special I experience . What a warm 'Irish Welcome'. I must say that I was overwhelmed with my whole stay. The welcome I received from the gentlemen in front of the hotel was the warmest I'd ever experienced in all my years at an IHG property. But walking into the lobby! Obviously the General Director has found the perfect blend of old world classic while instilling a feel of modern amenities that are apparent the moment you enter. In other words, stunning, cozy, elegant with a touch of the 21 C. After my experience at the front desk with Cecelia, a credit to IHG and the hotel, I already knew this was the finest staff I had ever met and again ...bravo to the General Director for instilling his staff with first class service, I wish I could remember the name of every single person at the front desk as well as the wonderful breakfast staff, My partner had written that it was a special B-Day and there were B-day wishes treats and a card in the Executive suite of which we had been upgraded.  . The room was stunning in the way it had been appointed. Again...rich looking traditional with many modern amenities that gave you total comfort.What a view. Two tropical showers.  Giant state of the art bathroom and luxe products in a generous nature.The bathroom truly was as big as an apartment in NY. The bed! That wonderful IHG bed filled with luxury linens and down duvets that just rocks you to sleep. The whole hotel including my room was shining clean, clean, clean! All hotel guests should be lucky enough to sleep in the special IHG bed that you find in all IHG hotels. I was so pleased with my accommodations that I went down to the lobby area infused with a wonderful air of energy and I settled back into a wing chair and a server with a spring in his step was at my side within 5 minutes! I ordered a flute of champagne which was accompanied by some delicious mini chocolates. Breakfast the next morning was taken in the restaurant downstairs. Usually,I take breakfast in the club lounge. As this hotel did not have one I looked forward to trying the breakfast in the restaurant as i was famished from the flight the day before and I had not really wanted dinner. Well! All I can say is anything you could possibly want for breakfast prepared with obvious best ingredients (THE SCONES! ) could be found in the buffet.Freshly made breads, jams and pastries, main dishes that were excellent, meats, cheeses, salmon, fresh juices and of course a pot of superb tea made exactly as I like with all my picky ""I need this and that for my proper breakfast tea."" (I don't drink coffee).I became known as the IHG member who could polish off more waffles than any other guest up to this point.  As a matter of fact, the chef added waffles (just superb) to my last morning even though it was not on the schedule. Again the staff was friendly and right on point! They really deserved kudos. You did not wait more than a few seconds when you looked like you wanted something. A quick workout in the well equipped gym and I was ready for my day. A cognac in the lobby that evening after my dinner downtown and I was one happy person. This is what I call the 'Intercontinental Experience'. I can't wait to return.  What more does one need to say??",5,2019,08,17
205,Attentive Staff and Amazing Property,"The InterContinental Dublin is an amazing property nestled in a less busy area.  It is an easy walk to the Sandymout Metro Station or a quick taxi ride into the city.  On arrive the staff greeted us with warm and welcoming smiles.  They were quick to ask if we needed recommendations or even directions. 

Concierge: I believe the young mans name is Steven, but he was super nice.  The gentleman opened the door to the hotel and made sure we headed in the right direction.  I think I even heard him singing a little, which was an indication he enjoys his career.

Check-In: The staff where very nice and knowledgeable.  They made the process quick and easy.  They provided us with details regarding the area and things to do.

The Room: The rooms are simply one of the best I have stayed in around the world.  The bed was super comfortable, and the shower was beyond relaxing.  If I didn't have plans a weekend in the room is how I would have enjoyed my stay.

Bar/Restaurant: Although I was not able to enjoy all of the amazing meals the hotel provides, we did enjoy a few spirits before heading out into Dublin.  There were so many items to choose from I felt comfortable ordering my favorite drink.

Overall:  The hotel by far has been one of the best hotels I have stayed in around the world.  I recommend this location as the hotel to visit for a peaceful warm hospitable stay.",5,2019,08,16
205,Family two night stay. Quality hotel.,"Fantastic two night stay with my family in this beautiful hotel. I have to commend every member of staff that I encountered at this hotel they were excellent. From the door staff that greeted us, the reception staff that checked us in, the cleaners, the bar and restaurant staff and the staff at breakfast everyone was first class and they had a small and genuinely seemed to enjoy their work. Everyone went out of their way to make our stay special nothing was ever a problem they could not do enough for us and I really appreciated their kindness. Great hotel for families to stay the rooms are beautiful, large beautifully refurbished and clean with two large queen beds. We ate in the bar restaurant both nights the food is first class. I also would like to commend the staff that I spoke to on the phone when booking the hotel they were excellent and they went out of their way to make sure everything was perfect. I look forward to staying again soon. Thanks so much. Oliver Clarke",5,2019,08,14
205,Excellent hotel,"Allthough I just stayed one night at the InterContinental I must say that it is a great experience. From Check-in to check-out everything is handled very professionally. 
As I am a spire elite member I got a very nice up-grade to a room fitting for a family. I didn´t need it but it was nice anyway. Breakfast was great too.",5,2019,08,06
205,Perfection,"This place is really good.  The rooms are very nice and everything works well.  The AC and appliances.  Never an issue. Also, they do not have hidden charges, which is a big trend in US chaina.  The staff does their best to make you feel at home.  The food is good and the service is superb.  I always get a good rest here.  Great choice",5,2019,08,05
205,DUBLIN visit ,"The hotel is located centrally enough in the city with plenty parked (not free). Grooms are excellent and staff very pleasant and helpful. Food is very tasty with great choice.  Great wines in abundance at the hotel. Not a budget stay by a real quality one.  WiFi not bad but not the greatest I’ve witnessed in Dublin.

205,Can’t wait to come back,"We came here for a family trip to celebrate my sister’s 40th birthday enjoying the Glitz and Glamour package which included a spa treatment, evening dinner and bed and breakfast. All us of thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would all return and recommend the hotel to family and friends. The hotel itself is beautiful, tastefully decorated and spacious. There was always lots of space in the lobby and in the dining room. The bedrooms were large and very comfortable. The food served for dinner and breakfast was first class for all of our three courses and the breakfast leisurely and relaxed with top quality food. However the star of the show is the hotel staff and their outstanding customer service. Particular thanks to the restaurant staff (both dinner and breakfast service and the evening restaurant manager). They are an absolute credit to the hotel and absolutely delivered five star service with a smile. We had various special requests and were perhaps more demanding than some guests but they did everything they could to accommodate us. Thank you for making our stay particularly special.",5,2019,08,04
205,Dinner in D4,"Had dinner in the Intercontinental Hotel in Ballsbridge on Wednesday evening. It was our first visit and I was really impressed.
As you pass it just looks like a nice hotel, turn into the driveway and the wow factor increases.
Going through the lobby the wow factor goes higher again. The hotel has an old world feel and charm you rarely find in a modern hotel. The fixtures and fittings are absolutely gorgeous and everything is just perfect. I think I have a new favourite Dublin Hotel.
We dined in their Seasons Restaurant, the food was excellent and presentation and service first class. The staff are superb. Everyone we interacted with were just so nice and helpful. This night out has been my best night out this year.
The management and staff deserve applause for the effort and results. An wonderful experience.
Celebrating a special event, try the Intercontinental.",5,2019,08,03
205,Almost 5 stars ...,"I know this is supposed to be a five star hotel, but we had issues that made it seemed like they were not fully there. It started with out hotel transfer. Be aware the hotel does not conduct their own transfers, they sub contract this service. We waited in the airport for over an hour, and had to deal with the operator and not the hotel. I understand if the hotel is booking the transfer and making a cut from it, they should deal and help the customer directly. The next issue we had was with the a/c in our room. The unit was not working properly. The second day in our stay it began to leak into our room and keepers us up all night. Lastly, the room cleaning was not very good. We often found the bathrooms were not completely clean. 

The property itself is very nice, and the staff is friendly and helpful. They really just need to fixed a few things to make it feel 5 stars. ",4,2019,07,30
205,Spacious luxury,I have stayed here on business a few times and have just stayed here with my wife and children for the first time.  The suites are very spacious.  The furnishings are traditional but not over the top.  The breakfast buffet is legendary.  The bar is comfortable (and the barman makes a mean rum old fashioned).   We enjoyed the fact that the hotel is a little out of town but yet close to good food (Rolys) and a super park (Herbert).  Well worth a visit if you want to avoid the crowds and be very well looked after.,5,2019,07,26
205,Not a hassle free hotel stay.,Lovely hotel with good amenities and pleasant staff. Beds are great and the food is excellent. Bit out of the city centre but nice restaurants near by. However they need to sort out there billing and booking. I booked on line and received a confirmation email that had a price higher than I got when I booked online. Sorted out by telephone but not without some hastle. Was offered an upgrade when I checked in but was mislead on the cost of this upgrade. Result was significantly higher costs that expected on the bill when I checked out. I questioned this and a new bill was produced  in line with what I thought I had agreed which I paid.  On returning home and checking my credit card statement I found that they had put through an additional charge to my account to cover the higher costs without further discussion with me. Still trying to sort this out with them but this is all major hastle which has spoiled what otherwise could have been a nice break in a lovely hotel.,2,2019,07,25
205,Special one night stay,"Myself and my husband stayed here the night after our wedding for some rest and relaxation. When the receptionist heard we had been married the previous day, he upgraded us to a junior suite and gave us complimentary prosecco. All of the staff made us feel really special and breakfast the next morning was delicious! Would anyone to stay for a special night away!",5,2019,07,24
205,Lush ,"Only stayed for one night down from Belfast but room was gorgeous, staff friendly. Ordered room service and waiter was the nicest I’ve experienced! Safe car parking. Close to city centre and easy to get a taxi just by walking out the front. 
Fab, perfect for a treat weekend! ",5,2019,07,21
205,Pricey But Good,"Really, just what I was looking for: Gracious, historical, comfortable, classy, good bar and dining, and very well located.  No good reason for it not to be pricy, especially in late May.  ABCDEFG.  ABCDEFG. ABCDEFGHI.  XYZ.  Taveled with my wife, son-in-Law and his fiancée.  Walking distance to Templar Area.  Convenient to Hop-On/Hopp-Off Bus.",4,2019,07,21
205,Fabulous Weekend Stay for Birthday,"I stayed here for two nights for my 40th birthday and the room was fabulous. The staff are so friendly and do a brilliant job. Highly recommend. The breakfast we had was so tasty and fresh, the bed very comfy. Also personal touch of Happy Birthday message and chocolates waiting for me. The General Manager is so professional and welcoming.",5,2019,07,20
205,Beautiful property with great service,"We recently travelled to Ireland from Canada with our two teenaged daughters and loved this property! We were surprised at how beautiful and upscale this hotel is, particularly for the money spent as it's on par with some of the best 5 star properties in which we've ever stayed. It's great value, service was excellent, safety and security impressive and location worked well. Breakfast was fresh and delicious, decor was lovely and, most importantly, service was friendly and efficient. We stayed in a one bedroom suite which was spacious and into which the hotel had made up the sofa bed and placed and made up a rollaway bed with luxury linens. We're so glad we decided to stay here!",5,2019,07,19
205,Intercontinental Dublin,"Outstanding hotel. From the minute we arrived and stepped out of our transport you are treated as though you are the only guests, nothing is too much trouble. The reception area, gardens, dining room and accommodation are all what you would expect, simply first class. The team is a tribute to the Intercontinental Hotel Group and in Nicky Logue they have the most exceptional manager who is unequaled in all our travels around the world....if you’re visiting Dublin, a stay at this hotel is a must .",5,2019,07,17
205,Very luxury hotel,"We stayed at many high end hotels before including park hyatt, four seasons and Ritz. This IC hotel really impressed me. Everything is perfect from the lobby bar to turndown service at night. And every staff was just so nice to guests. The location is not in city center. It's about 30 minutes walk to all the sites but Dublin is a very walkable city. We took the bus in front of the hotel once and then we just walked everyday. The SPA is great as well.",5,2019,07,16
205,Lovely Hotel,"I’m not sure why our stay was so much better than the last few reviews but we had 5 star service from start to finish! We are a family of 5- older teens. The woman who checked us in-Jane? Was professional, helpful and honestly a delight.  We were treated to a hello, good afternoon, etc every time we popped downstairs. 

We were asked if we wanted to upgrade to two corner suites which we happily did for a  much better price than online. The finishes and Decour were lovely- super comfy beds. Nice toiletries and outdoor patios for each room- which we used because it was unseasonably warm for Dublin. Loved the quieter location- ended up walking to the lobster pot which was a lovely seafood restaurant was very warm and friendly staff. 

The breakfast which was included in our stay was fantastic. Lovely sunny breakfast room with large bay windows and a nice selection of foods from croissants, oatmeal, made to order omelettes, fresh smoked salmon and cappuccinos etc.  ",5,2019,07,15
205,"Nice hotel, but not up to par with other Interconti Hotels","Stayed at the Intercontinental Dublin as platinum elite member with a family of four in a two queen bed room. First impression of the hotel and grounds was nice and very classy. Rooms despite apparently being renovated look rather dated, in particular the bathrooms. Would have expected a rain shower or bath tub in a five star hotel. Bed was very comfortable and the gym was very well equipped. 

One disappointment was the breakfast. Again the restaurant was very classy and service staff was polite, however the variety of offerings was rather poor, limited hot dishes and exactly the same items every day of our stay. Unfortunately the service was also a bit slow even though the restaurant was not busy, tables not cleared and requests for drinks not taken.

Valerie the concierge was very knowledgeable and helpful to us organizing a day excursion! Thanks!

The hotel is located in the embassy district with a limited number of restaurants within walking distance and bus connection to downtown Dublin. Not the ideal location for sightseeing.

Overall we had an ok stay, but felt it was overpriced for what we paid.",3,2019,07,14
205,Very comfortable stay - not 5* though,"We arrived very early & they happily looked after our cases so we went for breakfast, very well looked after & not felt rushed or in the way, we got our room early & I think that because we had turned up early the room cleaning was rushed, there were several small issues, dirty cotton bud left behind & a take away package left out side the room which hadn't been taken away. It was great being allowed into the room early but certainly not 5* cleanliness - I would've rather waited. It is not convenient to any shops/bars as such but the bus goes past very regularly, cab's cost approx 10-15 euros' into Grafton street & are very easy to get. The breakfast choice is huge & you are not rushed & can take as long as you like, especially as you can go into the lounge & chill. The room was very spacious with a huge bathroom, we love our showers & tend to rate the rooms by the quality of the shower & I will have to say that we were very disappointed, it was beautifully laid out in marble but the water pressure was soo bad, it got quite hot but no power to it at all, also although the toilet had a separating door the light switch for it was in the main bedroom - very strange. The other totally disappointing downside was the shear lack of USB ports in the room, there weren't any by the bed - there really needs to be more available. It was a lovely stay & the staff were very professional - it provided a relaxing stay.",4,2019,07,12
205,Fine. Not great.,"This hotel is fine. It's not great. And it's hard to believe it was a Four Seasons not that long ago. The first thing that you need to be aware of that it's off the beaten path. There are no stores within walking distance. It's a good distance via car to the downtown. This certainly isn't hotel management's fault and some people may prefer this, but I didn't like it at all. Second, the senior management leaves a lot to be desired. We showed up at 2:45 to check into a suite and a connecting room and had to wait one hour to get into our room because the people that stayed in our rooms the previous night decided to check out late !?!. How this is allowed to happen is beyond me. The manager said they went AWOL and the staff had to pack up the room for them. Two days later we returned from a day walking around Dublin and could not get into one of our rooms until 5:00 PM and the other at 5:45. The explanation? There were a lot of people checking out of the hotel that day so those rooms had to be cleaned first. I asked the manager on duty what would have happened if we had 5:30 dinner reservations and needed clean up and change but he had no answer.  We were also supposed to have access to the hotel car as a part of our package but it's only a four seater and there are 5 of us. Not sure why an SUV would be so hard to have on hand. I emailed the manager of the hotel, Robert Hunt, 48 hours ago and I still have not received a response. This was not a five star experience in my book. ",3,2019,07,08
205,Beautiful meal,"Myself, my mum and aunt had lunch in the restaurant and everything was perfect. 

The staff were attentive, welcoming and friendly. The food came quickly and tasted great. Very fresh and tasted like it was made with great quality ingredients. 

I suppose one minor thing to mention was the leg of the table fell off and landed on my foot. Not sure what happened or how but we had finished our meal and had paid and staff were very quick to get this sorted by calling maintenance. 

Overall, great service, beautiful surroundings and gorgeous food. Would definitely recommend. ",5,2019,07,07
205,Like this place,Stayed here as part of a meeting. Really like this hotel. I do stay at a number of Intercontinental hotels and this one is one of the better ones. Room was very spacious and clean. Hotel amenities very good. Hotel is very clean and well kept without being too ostentatious but retains some charm. Staff very friendly and accommodating. About 25 to 30 minutes from the airport so not too bad and around 20 minutes from Temple bar area by taxi so not too inconvenient. Good breakfast with some very good quality food. My only complaint was that I thought the lunch menu offered was a little limited on choice but in the scheme of things a very minor negative.,4,2019,07,04

We then spent 8 hours standing in line to get new tickets and vouchers. We arrived at the hotel at 10:00 pm, exhausted and hungry. They checked us in and got rooms set up in record time. We ordered room service within minutes of menu switching over to late night service and they were so nice and accommodating,The rooms were spacious, clean and air conditioned. The bed was pure luxury. The staff goes above and beyond to help you. Next time we are in Dublin we will be staying here.",5,2019,06,27

205,Exceptional,"My teenage daughter and I stayed for the weekend in The Intercontinental, Dublin and had a fabulous time. We previously stayed here when it was The Four Seasons. 

Particular mention for the reception staff, all of whom were wonderful to deal with, extremely friendly and very helpful. Our room was beautiful, the food was top class and we thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of this hotel. My daughter used the pool and the facilities here were excellent.

The only one tiny quip I had was that the bar/lounge was 'fully booked' on Sunday afternoon, so we had to go elsewhere for lunch,however this is something I should have checked myself beforehand. 

Overall, this hotel definitely deserves a 5 star rating for it's luxurious surroundings, attention to detail and wonderful staff. 

Thank you Intercontinental,Dublin for an amazing stay.",5,2019,06,17
205,A lovely way to take in Dublin,"We visited Dublin recently to take in an Elton John concert.  When visiting Dublin in the past, we have generally stayed closer to the city center.  This time, the location of the Intercontinental was ideal for our needs.

This is a gorgeous property - opulently furnished, nice amenities, a little distance away from the buzz of Dublin.

Generally speaking, the restaurants offer a good selection.  The lobby bar is comfortable yet elegant with a slightly more laid-back venue.  The more formal Seasons restaurant is ideal for dinner.  In addition, they offer a buffet breakfast in Seasons which is of the best I have experienced: offering an excellent selection of baked treats as well as almost any cooked food you could hope for.  The bar comes alive in the evening, offering pretty much any cocktail you could imagine.

The gym and spa looked spacious.  They also had a heated pool.  Sadly I could use neither while I was there.

A drawback to the property is the service when the restaurants get busy tends to dive.  We frequently found ourselves waiting for service, or trying to find a server who could help us.

If you are looking for a hotel close to the city centre, this is not an ideal choice.  However, the Intercontinental is a comfortable selection a little farther afield.",5,2019,06,17
205,Start of trip,"Great start to holiday in Ireland. Chance to recover long trip from Australia. Staff , friendly and helpful. Upgrade to executive suite was a nice surprise. Classy hotel . Breakfast buffet was substantial. Not too fat into cbd, easy to get a taxi. ",5,2019,06,16
205,Little piece of heaven,"Stayed here for one night with a friend while we attended the Bon Jovi concert in the RDS. We got a taxi from Heuston Station to the hotel and from the moment the taxi door was opened for me to when it was closed as we were leaving we were in heaven. As much as I love Bon Jovi and do my best to get to their concerts when they are in Ireland, after lieing down on the bed I contemplated not going around the corner to see them!! I may have had to have been talked out of borrowing the duvet.....😂 the bed was massive and loads of room even with my quilt hogging friend! 

Dillon in the Ice Bar was a gentleman, he was most obliging on any request, we wanted to sit outside but the seats were wet, he had them dried for us within minutes to getting us cigarettes from the machine.

Check in and check out was as efficient as I have ever experienced. It wasn't a problem I don't have a credit card to be able to charge to the room, so a deposit was taken from my debit card and the remainder will be refunded in the next few days. ",5,2019,06,16
205,Intercontinental Dublin,"Very helpful and friendly management and staff, in particular Isaac, our wonderful porter. Our room was spacious, clean and well appointed and the hotel amenities and grounds excellent. My mother and I stayed for 7 nights before moving to another location. By comparison, we wish we’d stayed at the Intercontinental for the entire 2 weeks of our holiday! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!",5,2019,06,12
205,Great as usual,"Stayed here before. We loved the comfortable bed, not noisy, cleaning was well done, breakfast is worth it. Staff is great, friendly and organized. Close to nice restaurants, short cab ride to downtown. ",5,2019,06,04
205,Comfortable luxury in Dublin,"Unsurprisingly the Intercon provides a discreetly luxurious stay in Dublin away from the hustle of the centre. Spacious rooms with relaxing lounges for refreshments overlooking the garden with attentive, well-trained staff.  From check-in through the bar to the spa, nice way to spend a weekend in the city.  Ballsbridge is 20 minutes from the centre, but good food and drink options under 10 minutes walk away in nice suburb.",5,2019,06,03
205,Fabulous,"I stayed here for one night on business. While this is not my usual hotel in Dublin I was extremely pleased t stay here. As this was my first stay I was offered a free upgrade to a suite. This was fantastic. The room was beautiful and very large and very comfortable.
The staff here are very courteous and the service is excellent. 
I will definitely be returning.",5,2019,06,03
205,"Second stay, still very good","Another nice room and bathroom, couldn’t fault it. Room service again good, though my glamorous companion’s breakfast of yogurt, fruit and a few odds and bobs came to an astonishing €48 inc delivery charge to the room. 

Same criticisms as last time, where’s the Club Lounge? Come in guys. Also no shower by the very nice swimming pool and no access to the pool directly from the changing rooms, don’t you want people to shower first? I certainly do!

Will happily return.",4,2019,05,29
205,Comfortable stay...,"My wife & I stayed here for 5 nights for her work trip. They didn't have our room ready at 3pm check in. We had to wait a bit for our room. Everyone at the hotel was quite friendly. Room was clean & roomy for the both of us. We had breakfast buffet every morning at the hotel. Good selection of food & drinks to choose from. 

Hotel is not close to downtown. Had to take a 15 min taxi ride, depending on traffic, or a 40 min walk to get in to downtown.",4,2019,05,28
205,Beautiful hotel with great staff,"Stayed at this hotel for a family trip. Room was spacious, very clean, and comfy bed. Also had a decent sized shower - bath was very tiny. Staff were friendly and helpful - would recommend this hotel to others.",5,2019,05,24
205,Best Hotel of Ireland Trip!,"I have been in several Ireland Hotels and this one by far has been the cleanest, most modern, and best staffed hotel! There was actually an open and easy parking lot part of the hotel (annnd valet), multiple people asked if they could help us with luggage, the room is outstanding and the bathroom is luxurious! AMAZING! Oh and they were extremely accommodating and let us check in a little over an hour before check in.",5,2019,05,24
205,Spa treatments & Afternoon Tea,A huge thanks to all the staff for a memorable day with my daughter yesterday We enjoyed a beauty treatment and then afternoon tea and for our celebration a lovely glass of bubbly..... recommend this highly 10/10 😃,5,2019,05,23
205,"Great hotel, Good location","Stayed here for one night during an exhibition at the RDS, te service was good and the room was of a high standard.
Brekfast is buffet style but you can order your own eggs and versions of it.
the hotel is not cheap to stay in but good quality",4,2019,05,19
205,Excellent reception,"The people working at reception are so friendly, welcoming and professional. It was a pleasure dealing with the reception team and they really make the hotel what it is. Excellent service all round. Will definitely be back.",5,2019,05,16
205,"Lovely hotel, shame about the food","Stayed recently at the Intercontinental hotel with my wife and baby last month. The staff and hotel were excellent. After a long day out touring around Dublin we returned to the hotel looking forward to a lovely meal in the restaurant. However, the meal was a huge let down to our stay. Myself and my wife had to return our main courses to the staff not once but twice, such was the poor quality of dinner been served. We never ended up completing any course meal. Steak or pork belly starter are not the most difficult to cook, for a 5-star hotel such as the intercontinental meals such as these could be done blindfolded. Having been looking forward to staying at the hotel for months, we came away feeling disappointed. First time reviewer.....",3,2019,05,14
205,"Gorgeous Resort in a Quiet, Lovely part of Dublin","This resort has a very high level of service, amazing rooms, lovely dining, a spa and pool, and the staff is outstanding!   We LOVED staying here.   The rooms were generously sized and had great amenities, large windows and were very comfortable.   Isaac - and all of the valets - were wonderful.   We also interacted with the front desk quite a bit and they were very helpful.  Bartenders and seating hostess were also talkative and kind.   This hotel is out of the downtown hustle and bustle, but the train station is only a couple of blocks away (stops at Tara Station - a couple of blocks from Temple Bar, Trinity College, Grafton Street etc.).   We did have difficulty securing bus passes, so we weren't able to use that service - there is a stop right in front of the hotel if you can figure it out!",5,2019,05,13
205,True luxury and a friendly welcome,"We stayed for two nights in this gorgeous hotel. Everywhere was immaculate and luxurious. The staff were friendly and nothing was too much trouble. But they were not stuffy or intrusive. The breakfast buffet had something for everyone and lunch in the lounge was lovely. The pool was an added bonus 
Would totally recommend this hotel and cannot wait to stay again ",5,2019,05,13
205,Ms.,"The staff are fantastic, truly went above and beyond. In particular reception who could not have been kinder or more helpful to my Dad who had just had surgery. Fantastic hotel, great breakfast,  but really super staff made it extra special, so we’ll done all.",5,2019,05,13
205,Real luxury in the heart of the city,"beautiful hotel, incredible service. Special mentioned to Issac who was wonderful and very kind to my kids who were traveling with them. This hotel really is a little piece of heaven. Its more expensive than most hotels in Dublin, but definitely worth it for a treat, I am booked in again for a concert on the 13th of June, cant wait",5,2019,05,13
205,a Vacation In Its self !!!!,"This place is fantastic, something you have always hoped for but never found in a deluxe hotel !!! Fine Irish linen bedspreads will make it difficult to leave......An articulate and  friendly staff will  make your stay relaxing  and a memorable experience. The place is immaculate, rooms large and bright. Were here for five days in April 2019 and would return in a minute. A beautiful and huge buffet breakfast is served each  morning and the food delicious as is the food in the hotel's restaurants. The Irish beef,lamb, and seafood is outstanding !! The hotel, located a block away from the US and British Embassies , is within walking distance of some some small but excellent restaurants. 

Fine Irish linen bed sheets do make a difference, I could have slept all day,,,,Large bright rooms and baths add to the pleasures of staying here. The place is immaculate and quite stunning in appearance. Service is immpecable

",5,2019,05,08
205,Excellent!  Very friendly,"A recent visit for business was met with an exceptional stay.  I have stayed in many hotels around the world, but the InterContinental in Dublin is high on my list of establishments i have stayed at.  

We booked a private dining room for business, and had an exceptional dinner.   The food the next morning was equally a very high standard, and the Guiness bread was tremendous.  With the service at the hotel (in particular the greeter at breakfast) this is a hotel i will return to.",5,2019,05,04
205,Dinner,"I recently had dinner in the lobby restaurant and I gave to say the food was lovely. A young lady served us and she was very attentive whilst not being intrusive. Really enjoyed the food, the visit and the service and would definitely recommend. ",5,2019,04,29
205,A First Class Dublin Hotel,"When I was in Dublin recently I stayed at the InterContinental Hotel. I found the hotel team to be charing, gracious and courteous. I enjoy the lovely surroundings. 

During my stay, I chose to do some writing in the lobby cafe for a long period of time and they accommodated me in a nice location. My room was quite modern, but had a Irish splash of tradition in it!",5,2019,04,27
205,Luxury and Elegance,"Luxury and pampering in the lovely neighbourhood of Ballsbridge away from the hustle and bustle but perfectly located for the AVIVA.
Nice but pricey dining options - look out for special deals.
Indoor swimming pool.",4,2019,04,23
205,Incredible ,"

Highly recommend best hotel in Dublin , the lobby area was the most beautiful side of the hotel .. very bright , nicely decorated . My room
 was big and there is an attention to the details .

 I think it’s the best hotel of the intercontinental group as well as I have been in many of its hotels . I had very warm welcome from the professional staff as well , the concierge lady was so helpful and friendly. Definitely will come back . 

The location is the only negative point , a bit far from the center.",5,2019,04,23
205,Perfection,"This was my first time staying in an Intercontinental and they have set the bar very high.
It was my partners birthday so were given a complimentary upgrade which was delightful, the room was absolutely huge and had a balcony which is lovely to have that fresh air come in. The room was spotless, bed was enormous and comfortable and the bathroom was excellent with all the amenities you could want.
The first night we went down for a swim which was lovely, jacuzzi was a perfect temperature. 
Second night we had dinner in the Seasons Restaurant which was delicious, especially the deserts which we loved.
On our final day we had breakfast which was delicious, a brilliant selection of hot and cold foods.

I will also mention Cecilia at reception who checked us in who was absolutely delightful and couldn't have been more welcoming. Also Livia at breakfast was just so lovely and couldnt have been more helpful and she gave us an excellent table by the window. 

they really made our time in Dublin so special and we will definitely be returning.",5,2019,04,22
205,Pretty close to Perfection!,"We had a quick pit stop in the Intercontinental.  A fantastic building, located outside the city but easy access to city.   Staff were all very friendly.    Room was very spacious, bed was enormous and very comfortable, never really saw the wife once in bed, felt she was in a different wing.   Spa on the lower floor had plenty of lockers, very relaxing place for an hour.  We had a pre dinner drink in the whiskey bar, and then a 3 course meal in Seasons.   A bit disappointing that the Wedding planner chose to use the restaurant to finalise arrangements with a couple at the very next table........ps reasonable chance your guests will know the difference between Prosecco and Champagne, but good luck regardless.   Our food was fantastic, pork belly, steak and raspberry milk brûlée.   Back to the bar where the pianist who must be well into his 80’s entertained us fantastically well with a range of music performed in his own particular style.    Breakfast was a buffet, good range of offerings, full Irish hit the spot.   18euro to park does seem a bit excessive, but other than that bravo bravo.",5,2019,04,19
205,Super service as always 10/10,"As I am an Equine Consultant  
I need to be @ RDS every August for The Royal Dublin Horse Show.
I need the best Dublin location, accommodation & service & The Intercontinental provides all three, well done!

205,Incredible!,Beautiful Place.  Friendly staff.   Came with large group.  Quickly checked us in.  Accommodations are above par. Clean.  Quiet.  Would highly recommend to any large or small group to consider staying here. Best.,5,2019,04,11
205,A relaxing oasis.  Luxurious.,"A beautiful hotel.  Very comfortable.  Sheets and pillows heavenly.  Huge bathroom with soaking bathtub and also a separate shower.  Staff very professional, friendly, and helpful.  Nice area, or if you prefer, Grafton Street, etc., is a short bus ride.",5,2019,04,05
205,Excellent Short Stay,"I stayed here for just one night.
The room was amazing and great value. 
The bar is lovely to relax with a drink.
Didn’t have breakfast as had to leave to the airport very early and no food option at 5am.
I’ll definitely be back to use enjoy all the facilities.",5,2019,04,01
205,A True 5 Star Hotel,"Many hotels advertise that they are 5 star but in reality they do not offer 5 star service.

The Intercontinental is a true 5 star hotel from the moment you arrive to the moment you leave you are treated like royalty with exceptional service by all staff.

The rooms are spacious, clean and very well appointed 
The food is varied, well presented and superb quality - the breakfast is an experience not to be missed
The staff at all levels are very helpful, friendly and knowledgeable 

This is an amazing hotel and far superior to any other 5 star hotels in Dublin

My congratulations to the manager and all staff for providing a truly memorable experience",5,2019,03,27
205,Fantastic!,"Simply amazing stay.  Perfect service with a smile every time.  One comes to expect a high standard at the Intercontinental, but I can’t say enough good things about this particular one.  The hotel is somewhat outside of the core touristy area, but it is within walking distance to a small shop for sodas and snacks and a really cute restaurant/pub (“The Bridge”) nearby.  Otherwise it’s a short cab ride into the heart of Dublin for the usual tourist stuff.",5,2019,03,23
205,Comfortable upscale hotel,"We arrived from Boston on the day after what we call the high holiday at home, St. Patrick’s Day. March 17th in Dublin appears to be just as crazy and we were concerned about crowds, service, etc but the IC Dublin was so welcoming and accommodating to us arriving well before check in time and got our room ready for a nap after a nice breakfast. We wanted to stay clear of departing crowds at the hotel and took the advice of the porter and headed to Roly’s up the street a few blocks for breakfast, after freshening up in the spa downstairs which I thought was a nice gesture since we had not officially checked in yet.

Spa is very nice with excellent service, nice pool & large peaceful hot tub inside a solarium looking onto a sunlit courtyard. Fresh fruits, teas, coffee, and herbal water available. Fitness room and very nice spa service menu although we did not have time for such other than the hot tub one evening.

Breakfast in Seasons restaurant is excellent. Buffet style with plentiful selection. Although pricey for breakfast, when touring we never really like to stop for lunch and just have a snack and do an early dinner so it ends up being a reasonable way to go for us. It would be worth including breakfast in your rate at this particular IC as it would set the day off to a great start!

Desserts and drinks were all we did in the Lobby Lounge and David was our favorite server. He did an impromptu whiskey tasting for my husband and introduced him to some nice new favorites from Ireland. What a valuable employee this hotel has on staff! He seemed to enjoy spending the time with us as we did with him. He suggested the Connemara whiskey which my husband ordered again upon our return later in the week. My daughter and I chose the “Must be honey” drink with a vodka twist which was also excellent made by David. 

I tend to have all of my trips researched, planned and synchronized, and generally have zero use for a concierge. Not so for this particular trip. I had rough ideas of each bit of it but definitely chose to access the proper resources once checked in. The concierge on duty, Barry, was super helpful with all of our arrangements to tour the hot spots. All of the tips were right on the mark and he even booked us R/T train seats to get to Galway for a couple nights. A prize of an employee for the IC/IHG company. Not everyone working in hospitality is suited to take such avid interest in strangers and attend to detail. 

Taxis magically appeared for us before we finished asking for them and the price for 4 people without waiting for a bus made this a perfect way to travel into the city center. $15-20. Porters are very switched on and helpful.

Upon our return to Dublin we were greeted with the same warm hospitality by Cecelia at the front desk. She too is a great calling card for IC Dublin. Flawless check in and ensured Platinum Ambassador service was executed. 

Overall, the service is as friendly as you can get anywhere. The food is outstanding, and we recently returned from a foodie’s dream trip to France so I don’t get some of the reviews noted about the food here. Hotel is in excellent condition and definitely is a 4/5 star experience. If you are so fussy that only a perfect 5 will do, you will most likely find fault with something almost anywhere. Go and enjoy Dublin from here!!",5,2019,03,22
205,"A long weekend away, and treated like royalty!","From the minute you arrive at the Intercontinental Dublin, you feel like you are in safe hands. From the smile from the welcoming doorman through to the classy, elegant reception, check in was swift, efficient and friendly and we soon found ourselves in our beautiful, spacious room. If I tried to detail every little thing that made this hotel so special, I would run out of room so to try and sum it up; warm, friendly staff, delicious food in beautiful surroundings, the helpfulness of the staff in accommodating our vegan requirements, relaxed, comfortable surroundings, sumptuous, enormous beds, large fluffy towels, gorgeous and plentiful toiletries, free wi-fi, calming pool area and clean, relaxing spa. What’s not to love? We didn’t find anything and add to that the fact that it is a very pleasant walk from the hotel into the centre of Dublin, we loved it all. Even the sun shone! This is clearly, an extremely well run hotel that makes every guest feel special from the minute you step through the door, to the minute you sadly, have to leave. But fear not, the next time we want to be pampered and made to feel special, we will be straight back!",5,2019,03,21
205,Immaculate Hotel and Exceptional Staff,"What a beautiful hotel this is! We arrived here to Dublin for the first time during St Patrick’s Day weekend and could not be more happier. The receptionist Debbie is a real gem to the hotel, she warmly checked us in and even though the room wasn’t ready at the time, she found us while we were eating in The Whisky Bar and handed us our room key as soon it was ready. Barry at the Concierge is incredibly knowledgeable of Dublin and really tailored to our needs in order to really enjoy St Patrick’s day by avoiding Temple Bar and recommending some of the nicest bars, pubs and restaurants Dublin has to offer. The rooms are incredibly spacious! Gorgeous bathrooms and lovely view overlooking the forecourt which was a delight to wake up to. The staff here are the highlight...Debbie again will always go out of her way to pay genuine interest to you and many others always had a smile and were very approachable. Ciara on check out was really friendly too. All in all a wonderful experience and will definitely be returning again! ",5,2019,03,19
205,Wonderful Stay...,"Stayed here to celebrate 20 years since meeting my good wife.  Booked direct as it was cheaper than online and Nicole was very helpful in the reservation department.

Our room was a King Deluxe and represented pure luxury.  The bathroom was amazing with double mirrored doors and the bed massive and so cosy.  You could see the 5star attention to detail in the room.

Headed down to the Spa in the afternoon which was very relaxing before going  out for dinner in Dublin.

I feel the breakfast in the morning could be improved slightly because we had to go asking for various things.

All in all a truly wonderful stay and one we may do on an annual basis.

A final thank you to all the staff who were excellent throughout and just to say I feel the B&B rate of €371 was justified for such a high level of service and standard of accommodation.",5,2019,03,13
205,A Classic & Elegant Hotel,"The Intercontinental Dublin is a classic and elegant Hotel in Ballsbridge District Dublin Ireland. A very well run and managed Hotel. Alan, the night front desk Mgr. was superb. He greeted my Wife and me with friendliness and a very welcoming attitude. He understands that when he greets his guest in this manner he sets the table for our entire stay. he pulled out the site map and directed us to all of the main sites of Dublin. He listened to our requests at check-in and then delivered in spades. Alan is an old school professional and understands guest relations to a tee. The room was fantastic. Not one complaint while we were there. We would also like to mention Valerie, the Concierge who was very professional and helpful. Intercontinental is the way that Hotels should be run but that most are not. The staff is well trained and it all begins at the top and the management. We highly recommend that you stay here during your visit to Dublin, Ireland",5,2019,03,03
205,Quite outstanding from check in to departure,The service from the moment I arrived until the help I needed on departure was not only outstanding but managed also to be genuine and uncontrived. The staff were helpful to a fault and yet I came across none of the fake friendliness and cheesy smiles that so often characterise hotel service. The bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept in. Breakfast was stunningly good - a repast of a buffet that seemed to cater for every type of food creature. I recommend the artisan Irish sausage (and it’s not often one sees Toulousain!) and the silky smooth scrambled eggs. Outstanding hotel - it’s high end for sure but very good value in that bracket in my opinion. I will be back.,5,2019,03,02
205,Wow!! ,"Wow, what a fantastic hotel! One of the best Intercontinental I’ve stayed. 
Fantastic service and very comfortable room / bathroom. The grounds are beautiful and the location at the most posh neighborhood in Dublin. Great experience and stay!
",5,2019,02,26
205,Great Hotel,"Had the pleasure of attending a friend's 60th birthday here over the weekend and decided to treat ourselves to an overnight stay. From the moment we were met by Radimar at reception all the way through to checking out today we had the most fantastic experience.
There was a high number of well trained friendly staff who really understand the meaning of customer service.
Our room was fantastic - very comfortable and spacious. So much so in fact that we were delighted that we had availed of a late checkout.
The food, both at the party and at breakfast was second to none.
We had no down-sides to our experience and look forward to visiting again.",5,2019,02,24
205,Amazing Hotel in an Average Location ,"This hotel is one of the best I have ever had the pleasure to stay at. It is well maintained, very clean, pleasant staff and extremely comfortable.

This is what you would expect out of 5 star accommodations! This hotel delivers all.

The bar area was beautiful and the food was wonderful. I have no criticisms here what so ever. Be sure you dress appropriately and be prepared to spend some cash! However even though the cost is high for the food a drinks, it is such a wonderfully delightful experience, it is so worth the money. 

The room was high end decorated, well stocked, spotless and quiet. See photos. I enjoyed a relaxing bath in the spa tub and took advantage of the ability relax while on vacation in busy dublin! 

My only complaint is the location. It’s not very very central to down town historic Dublin. You will need to catch a cab or drive and pay for parking. It’s about 20-25 mins without heavy traffic. A few pubs and restaurants nearby but not a great selection.

All in all - amazing hotel. We felt very refreshed and taken care of after leaving. Highly recommend! 
",4,2019,02,24
205,Amazing long weekend in Dublin!!,"I stayed at The Intercontinental Dublin with my other half for a long weekend on an employee rate, and it was our first time in Dublin. The Reception staff were absolutely amazing, and our room was ready when we arrived at 12.30pm. The room was spacious and the bathroom was fantastic with a big shower and deep bath. Housekeeping did an amazing job also. The hotel is away from the city centre, but we loved the area of Ballsbridge as it's a lovely area to walk into town from. On a sunny day, you can definitely walk into central Dublin in under an hour, and to 3Arena in 20 minutes. A taxi only costs around 15 euros though. The spa is lovely, and the staff are a credit to the hotel. 10/10 weekend away",5,2019,02,19
205,Luxury and splendor with personality ,"100% Amazing. Just book it. If you want a super luxurious hotel that goes the extra mile to make you feel special, then this is the place. Great dining at all meals in Seasons restaurant too. The staff are so welcoming and genuinely friendly. Sarah Geoghegan at the front desk is a breath of fresh air. She’s really efficient and super helpful and nothing is too much trouble. Jane and Debbie on front desk are also extremely helpful and kind, always smiling and most obliging. These are the people who keep me going back. The personal touch. We stay at the Intercontinental in Dublin each time we visit the city. We have stayed in a wide range of room types and have always had utmost comfort, spotlessly clean rooms, all the facilities you might require and a feeling of utter indulgence and pampering. My children are very welcome and are fussed over and spoiled with little treats. 
Location is excellent. Not too far from the City Centre but in a nice area where we feel  safe walking around in the evening. This is a great hotel and I don’t think I can do it justice. Even after just one night there you feel like you have had a holiday. We will most certainly be back. For sure. ",5,2019,02,14
205,Disappointing,"I arrived at the hotel for a romantic getaway with my boyfriend. We had complained at our last stay about front office unable to tell us when our room was ready and we had to wait until 6 o'clock to enable us to actually get into our room making us miss our transport for a concert. 
On this particular stay we arrived to the hotel and we were welcomed back. I have an employee discount and was told that I had to pay as I go and was not aloud to use my employee discount due to not having a credit card. I explained I stayed here before and did not require a credit card in which the receptionist did not seem to please. She then said that She would leave it open but we would not be aloud to dine in the seasons restaurant for no apparent reason? When I asked why this was she just replied its how things are now...I checked the contract of IHG employee rate with my manager who is the spokesperson for our employee rate and he said it counts for all food and drink within any hotel.  This left us quite annoyed due to the amount of money we spent on the room and the disappointing stay we had the last time. Food in the lobby lounge was beautiful but the service was terrible. Waited 20 minutes for someone to take our order and during courses all we could hear was laughter from waitresses instead of coming in to clear our plates. To get attention for drinks was impossible resulting in us walking to the bar ourselves. The room was gorgeous but the disappointment  from both the reception staff and restaurant staff made us feel uneasy. It would take us a long time before we go back to the intercontinental after feeling so uneasy from this stay.",3,2019,02,11
205,Expensive but gorgeous ,"I don’t normally frequent such expensive hotels, but had business in the area and other options weren’t available. I am glad that is the case; from the reception staff, through bar staff, cleaners and janitors everyone was s complete delight. The bar is lovely but not pretentious, the food is delightful, and the rooms are stunning. A real gem!!!",5,2019,02,05
205,Very nice stay,"My wife and I recently stayed three nights during a recent visit to Dublin. Check in was fast and efficient and we were offered an upgrade at a cost from the IHG points booking we had made. Whilst we accepted it in hindsight we would probably just have taken the standard points offering. 

The hotel is certainly in the grand style and looks imposing from the road and is certainly to a high quality throughout. It belies its age as I thought it was late 1800's/early 1900's but I was told it was around 20 years old. It certainly is a very nice and thoughtfully designed building.

The Junior Suite that we had was spacious and well designed. Without a doubt the best room we stayed in during a three week visit to Europe. 

We found the hotel just a little bit further out from Dublin city than we expected but found using the train (a short walk down the road) to get about quite easy. Further along the same road is the small town of Sandymount which has a range of nice restaurants and pubs.

Unfortunately we didn't get to eat any restaurant meals in the hotel but did enjoy snacks and drinks in the bar area in the evenings. All very nice.

We would certainly stay again next time we are in Dublin. Recommended.",4,2019,01,27
205,Stellar hotel,"Beautiful room, great bar and breakfast. Attentive staff willing work with you on any needs. 20-25 minute walk to city center but also close to subway/train stops to get in to town. Can’t wait to go back and stay here.",5,2019,01,27
205,First class,"An absolutely amazing stay from check in to check out. Can't find fault with anything to be perfectly honest. The breakfast is the best I've ever seen,and myself and my wife would especially like to thank Jacqueline who showed us around the breakfast area and went out of her way to fetch a kids activity pack for our 5 year old when I remarked on how much he'd enjoyed it on a previous lunch visit.",5,2019,01,21
205,Wonderful venue,Attended a charity event here. Fantastic location just outside Dublin city and beside the RDS. Excellent service and as we have allergies the staff were excellent on addressing these issues. Recommended.,4,2019,01,19
205,Amazing Customer Service,"Not only is the hotel beautiful but the check in process was very welcoming. Tea in the lobby is a wonderful experience.
I cant praise the manager enough. She was very kind and helpful when i injured myself. I highly recommend this amazing hotel!",5,2019,01,18
205,"The Welcome, The Goodbye, The Bar Food:","I had a tasty burger, with chips, however it did not mix well with COLD garnish layered up i.e. cheese, tomato, relish and lettuce.  This would have been better left on the side.  
My husband who has a highly sensitive tummy, had the chicken with aromatic rice & colcannon. He sat up most of the night in discomfort.   
When Leaving the hotel I had to smile to myself - upon arrival, porter opened the front door with a smile - upon leaving, the front door uniformed staff took no notice of me coming along carrying my luggage - this time ""open the door yourself"" !!",4,2019,01,17
205,Always superior customer service,"This was our second stay here to celebrate my son's birthday (which falls on Christmas). I am sure that this will now become an annual affair for us, as the customer service is worthy of a five-star hotel (although the service in the bar can be slow at times, especially when busy). ",5,2019,01,17
205,Luxury Weekend away ,"Dublin has some lovely luxury hotels and last weekend we stayed in the Intercontinental on Simmonscourt Road, and it was luxury. 
Our original room was a Junior Suite but on arrival we were upgraded to an Executive Suite. A perk of being a IGH member. 
The room was stunning and the colours made it very rich to look at. 
We ate on the evening of our arrival in the lounge/bar. Great food great service and a lovely ambiance with the piano player playing in the background. 
Breakfast on both morning was very good. Big selection of continental and cooked food. Service was great again and the room we ate in was beautiful. 
The walk into Dublin City centre is about 15/20mins depending on your walking pace, and it is a lovely walk. 
The Intercontinental is also positioned beside the Aviva Stadium but it doesn’t affect or impose on the hotel. 
We were so impressed we will be back soon. ",5,2019,01,16
205,A beautiful Hotel Full of Charm and Character!,"Our stay just prior to Christmas was amazing and now one of our top rated hotels.

I travel extensively and always use the IC chain where available, so have stayed in many Intercontinental hotels around the world from North America to the Middle East, Africa and Asia - the IC Dublin is now comfortably within my top 3 hotels and will be my only choice when next visiting Dublin....in fact its one of the reasons I'll be going back with my Wife.

Everything you would expect from a top quality five star hotel coupled with real character and charm - the staff always make the difference and this hotel won't disappoint, it has friendly and professional staff. 

Coming from the airport the air coach takes approx 30mins and stops opposite the hotel - I'd recommend that the IC get their hotel listed however, as its not clear on the air coach booking site. 6 euro each way and not much slower than a taxi, but a lot cheaper and almost as convenient!

We jumped a taxi into the city centre but buses and very frequent and stop nearby.",5,2019,01,13
205,Worth the money,"Lovely stay and staff, only thing that hindered the experience was that we were offered late check out and then they forgot to put it on our room and we had someone knocking at the standard check out time followed by a phone call from reception prompting us to leave. Had assumed the carpark would be included in the stay but it wasn't. Really nice staff ",4,2019,01,10
205,Christmas Getaway - 5 nights,I would say 'good' not very good. The finer things of a true '5 star hotel are lacking. I did appreciate that the pool was open to children at reasonable hours and not just in the mid afternoon. the hotel was very busy but we were always able to get a table for breakfast with delay. The hotel is busy and open to residents and non-residents. There is no eating/drinking priority given to residents. We  were offerred a queing time of 1.5hrs to have the kids fed in the lobby bar. Why is the Ice Bar closed? Can this be converted to accomate eating for residents only?,4,2019,01,09
205,Christmas Dinner and Accommodation,"We booked our parents into the hotel for two nights at Christmas as their present and we all then booked Christmas dinner 8 adults one child and toddler.  Service in the run up to it was poor and it was only three days before Christmas after many messages left that we got the correct booking confirmed.  The accommodation had to be paid separately (which is fine) but the ladies manner was very poor, stating if we didn't pay that day that the booking could not be confirmed albeit that we had booked in advance and would have paid whenever it was required but her manner of requesting it was poor.  The hotel on Christmas day looked amazing, staff were all very friendly, Santa and kids entertainment was good, music was lovely.  I'm pregnant so could not eat most of the starter (which was a pity but it was alot of fish and soft cheese). The main course was just okay (my sister could not eat the beef) and dessert was lovely. So mixed experience.    ",4,2019,01,09
205,What can I say about the Hotel ??,We when there for our anniversary at Christmas and it was a big mistake . There service so bad and not up to what it was meant to be and I would not rate this hotel a five star. The Manager was to call,2,2019,01,09
205,New Years trip ,"Generally the hotel is what you would expect from a Intercontinental. Warm, nicely decorated and a touch of old style luxury. It was a nice stay, great breakfast, location little outside Dublin but no problem with public transport at the front doors. Rooms were clean and comfortable and also quite big. The only disappointment we had was that the service in the bar and restaurant area was below average. A quick drink was impossible, as a minimum waiting time for a waiter was ten minutes plus, and that was just to order the drinks. A lot of room for improvement.",4,2019,01,09
205,Excellent as always,"Really great stay again at the Intercontinental...lovely staff, great rooms, awesome spa, pool and gym. Probably my favourite hotel in Dublin these days. If there was one thing I would add it would be eir and BT sport to the TV...its right beside the home of Leinster Rugby so I would think it was mandatory!",5,2019,01,09
205,Thanks,"Probably the best hotel stay we have ever had, Christmas decorations were outstanding, we were very fortunate to have a suite which was extremely comfortable.

The hotel is very well situated for a visit to Dublin, staff are very friendly and accommodating of any request.

Thanks for a wonderful stay.

Regards
Sandy and Keith Lowe",5,2019,01,07
205,Excellent Hotel in Every Aspect,"I booked into this hotel for a brief visit to Ireland and must say I was quite impressed with everything.

I arrived early and all staff members, from the doorman to front office desk were most welcoming and accommodating. Despite my early arrival, a young lady at the front desk contacted the Housekeeping and got me a room within minutes. 

The hotel is located in a quiet residential area outside the city nucleus. The large lobby was in full Christmas decoration and spirit. The hotel features two separate restaurants, one that functions as a formal dining and events room where also the Irish breakfast is served, and a second one that is of more casual ambiance.

My room number 154 was spacious and well-lit with a whole wall of windows, large bathroom with separate shower and toilet, desk and safe, large flatscreen TV and plenty of closet space and a very comfortable king size bed. There’s also an iron and ironing board in the closet.

For those who’d like to visit one of the many magnificent cities around or wish to get downtown, there is a D.A.R.T. (Dublin Area Rapid Transport) Station roughly a 10-minute walk from the hotel which is the most economic way to get around, but of course there are plenty of taxis at the hotel as well.

Ireland is a member of EU and uses Euro as currency. Due to the heavy influx of international (predominantly American) businesses into Dublin, the prices are in an upswing in the city and surroundings. Taxis are as costly as in major East and West Coasts U.S. cities and dining is of moderate to high levels. Be prepared to pay 10 Euros for a simple Fish and Chips or 5 Euros or more for a glass of Guinness. A dinner for two in a good restaurant could easily set you back 50 Euros or more. A cab driver was telling me that housing—especially rentals—is near unaffordable now with property prices soaring into tens of millions of Euros.

If you have the time, I’d definitely recommend a day trip to the fishing village of Howth (pronounced HO:TH). It is an absolutely beautiful little harbor city with endless vistas and plenty of scenery for photographers among us. Other recommendable places are towns of Dalkey and Killiny, ( pronounced Killahyni) all within 40 minute DART ride from the hotel. 

This was my first trip back to Ireland in more than 35 years and I’m definitely going back will definitely select Intercontinental Dublin again.",5,2019,01,07
205,Tasteful Property in Quiet Area,The quality and amenities are exactly what you would expect from an InterContinental property.  We walked to/from the city center which was an hour each way.  It's a convenient choice for a short stay and is located in a quieter area of the city. ,4,2019,01,06
205,family break after chrsitmas,what a lovely hotel - the staff are amazing special mention to debbie at reception and all the team in the lounge that looked after us so well. well done to Nicky Logue on another great stay - happy new year,5,2019,01,04
205,Difficult situation handled well,"I stayed at the intercontinental Dublin last night, On arrival I was greeted by half the Dublin fire brigade! An alarm had been sounded and guests and staff were evacuated to the lobby and cafe, 

It took quite some time to reset the fire Alarm and make sure the Hotel was safe foe guest and staff to return to there rooms.

All the staff handled this situation very well, some guest were a little put out but these things happen, The staff's first consideration was our safety! You can't ask for much more than that. J kirk",5,2019,01,04
205,Excellent stay,I was so impressed with the hotel as I hadn’t stayed there since it changed hands from the Four Seasons. The food on Christmas Day was so good that we have decided to stay again next Christmas. The staff were so helpful evethough they were run off their feet with vast numbers visiting. I couldn’t recommend this hotel enough. ,5,2019,01,02
205,Good Business Stay,Hotel is located a bit outside of the main attractions of central Dublin but still very accessible by rail and taxis.  Stayed one night for business over St. Patricks Day weekend.  Rooms were very large and comfortable. Staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Enjoyed high tea with a friend in the lobby atrium.  Ambiance is very nice and food traditional.  I'd stay again for a peaceful retreat slightly outside of the city zone.,4,2018,12,29
205,Exceptional attention to detail,"Stayed here 1 night leading to christmas.  Check in was seamless.  The suite we stayed in was stunning, fabulous coastal views and the attention to detail in the suite itself was exceptional.  The breakfast was delicious and being our first time there the hostess showed explained the different offerings before taking us to our table.  The bar staff were friendly, informative & patient with our questions.  Would absolutely stay again & most definitely recommend.  ",5,2018,12,29
205,Fabulous Hotel,"We had a great few nights here leading up to christmas. The hotel was absolutely beautifully decorated, a pleasure to stay in. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast, as always, was about the best you could ever see in a hotel. Thank you.",5,2018,12,28
205,McInnes pre Christmas visit 2018,"Excellent hotel, fantastic Christmas decorations, warm welcome a really nice stay.  Spent 2 nights at the hotel including use of the pool in the spa downstairs.  Walked into the city centre which took 45 minutes on the day we arrived, it’s a good walk but we did break it up with a stop at the Napper Tandy’s on on Merrion Row, great pub.  Second day used the train from Sandymount only 5 minutes from the hotel and then walked along the river stopping at the Temple Bar before walking onto the Guinness Storehouse to do the tour, all fantastic and well worth the visit and probable a return visit as well.",5,2018,12,27
205,4 start,Breakfast was poor - a significant chunk of the containers were empty (and not refilled) between 10am and 11am.Charged €36 for parking (2 cars) notwithstanding after shelling out a significant amount of money to stay. Very disappointing ,3,2018,12,26
205,What an Intercontinental Should Be,"Stayed twice between a meeting and holiday (front end and back-end travel.)  The first room was a large room with first class amenities, large bathroom, small balcony looking to the river and bay.  The room at the end of trip was a large corner suite with living area, bedroom and entrance way. Simply stunning and newly renovated.  Front desk service is wonderful - the front desk clerk remembered me by name 5 days after my first stay.  Bell service is fantastic as is the concierge who helped via email and in-person.  The Whisky Bar is a great selection of Irish whiskey.  Our bartender was wonderful, coaching us on types, tastes and his recommendations were just right.  The location is not in central Dublin, rather it is in the embassy area with the US Embassy a 10 minute walk up the road.  Cab service to central Dublin is quick, needs to be called and the drivers were good guides.  There are a large number of restaurants within a 10-minute walk from pubs to upper-end dining.  A 35-minute cab ride to the airport, and have the driver take the tunnel if you are time challenged.",5,2018,12,26
205,Fabulous hotel,Best hotel staff in Dublin Great break would stay there again location excellent bar not too expensive food is  really good dining room is very cosy spa is clean and staff really helpfully he hotel is very clean ,5,2018,12,25
205,"Outstanding facility, rooms, service and food!  Highly recommended!","I spent 11 nights at the InterContinental Dublin and was extremely happy with the facility (including workout room, indoor pool, spa) and large bedroom/bathroom.  The hotel was very festive with holiday decorations and piano player.  Front door, lobby, lobby restaurant, room service and spa personnel were all very well trained, coordinated and nice.   Kudos to the General Manager.I will go so far as to say it was as good or better than the Four Seasons which previously ran the hotel.   Highly recommend for business and personal trips.   ",5,2018,12,20
205,Amazing Hotel,We stayed in this fabulous hotel foe one night we were going to a show in Board Gais theatre.I arrived early but was given my room keys immediately which was great.Staff were so helpful offering to carry my bag etc.Room was great twin room but I got a lovely suprise it had two double beds.Breakfast was top class.I am looking forward to returning to this amazing hotel in the near future. ,5,2018,12,20
205,Very comfortable stay,Dinner excellent in dining room on this visit. Dined in foyer within a week of our stay . Service poor . Soup dreadful. A bad experience  definitely won’t dine in foyer again . This was our  second disappointment  in same venu within a few months . ,5,2018,12,19
205,Lovely Property but some issues,"Although an InterContinental, no lounge, nothing offered as a substitute for Royal Ambassadors- disappointing! Had to request the Ambassador gift. Reception staff were great. The Executive Suite felt under furnished! Generally felt a bit nickel and dimed. The Amstel in Amsterdam could teach this hotel a thing or two!",3,2018,12,16
205,Not as good as in the past,"I know we stayed when the Hotel was fully booked because the All Blacks were playing against Ireland,  so perhaps that is the reason the service wasn't as good as we have had in previous stays. 
We received a bowl of fruit for being a Sprire Elite member which was nice and we were grateful. However it takes a lot of stays within a year at IHG Hotels to get to that level and  we did not receive a "" thank you for your loyalty "" greeting upon arrival which isn't a big deal but after staying in the Intercontinental in Hong Kong they made a huge thing of it which makes you want to stay loyal to IHG.
 We found some staff  that were outstanding with their level of service especially Barry , where as others were not so great.  The bar staff were extremely busy for sure on the Friday night and there were a lot of people wanting drinks but they allowed people to push pass us and they took their drink orders when my wife and I were standing politely  in the front of the bar for over 20 minutes, and they just ignored us. It wasn't to we asked why are you not serving us that he did and he was grumpy about it.   Then after  the All Blacks game on the Saturday night a man at the entry of the main bar asked us if we were staying in the Hotel and I said yes but you could tell he didn't believe me , my wife who was in the bathroom had the room key so I could not prove it so was disappointed when he wouldn't let me in because the bar was too busy in his words but it was no where near as busy as the previous  night .  So I thought I would take my custom else where but every where else was too busy so we came back and a lovely girl who was then main entrance of the bar remembered we were guests and welcomed us in straight away. 
 Then we  had our worse experience ever at check out, when we asked Kristina  at reception if she could book us a taxi to the Crown Plaza near the airport and because we had 4 suitcases she said we needed an 8 seater van, after 50 minutes of waiting and getting fed up,  we went to the lovely friendly blonde lady at concerige desk  to ask why such the delay, she was horrified and a nice Australian employee ordered a normal taxi straight away which arrived in no time but then our bags were still not down from the room as requested and this was after 50 minutes and also after asking several times to where our bags were.   Kristina saw us lots just waiting and waiting and didn't follow it up at all.   Barry wasn't working that day so whether that had anything to do with the poor service or not, but it is a very long time just to sit there where they could see us waiting and everyone ignored us until we went to the to the very nice lady at the concierge desk who by the way could not see us from where she was. We had way better service all round at the the Airport Crown Plaza on our last night in Ireland.",4,2018,12,16
205,Breakfast,"Great Hotel,   only hotel in 2 weeks that breakfast wasn't included and that would have added to a nice experience.   Hotel was great but just not as enjoyable when you have to wake up and think about what do about breakfast, much more enjoyable to just go down and enjoy.",4,2018,12,16
205,"Intercontinental Dublin, Nov 18","This is a wonderful hotel in a great location. Super food and beverage options and friendly, efficient staff.  A perfect base for work or leisure when visiting Dublin. Mostly, however, I choose it for the Spa and Gym.",5,2018,12,16
205,delightful and attentive service,"I enjoy the warm and professional service when staying at Intercontinental Hotels around the world, and the Dublin property is no exception. I arrived in the morning from the airport, and of course my room wasn't ready, but they checked me in and invited me to grab my swimsuit from my luggage and enjoy the spa, pool, hot tub and sauna. There was also an opening in the schedule for a massage treatment. I took advantage of all of the above for a relaxing mid-day break in the beautiful and serene pool area, and I was not the only guest napping on the comfy chaise longues... ;)

There was a slight glitch when I asked if I could have my room key delivered to me at the spa (so I wouldn't have to go into the lobby with my hair all wet and messy from the massage, and I could shower in my own room instead of in the changing room), and they said NO - I had to go out into the lobby to the reception desk looking ridiculous, and carrying my boots and wet swimsuit. But of course it turned out that they could have brought me the room key at the spa, because of course I had already checked in hours before. I'm not sure why that was an issue, but it did feel a bit awkward. 

Otherwise, the suite was absolutely gorgeous and the birthday amenity was a beautiful platter with scrumptious chocolates. The holiday decorations were festive, and the staff were universally very friendly. I would love to stay for longer next time.",4,2018,12,12
205,Great Staff Great Hotel,"Family Trip with Wife and Two kids 9-11 meeting friends for the weekend ,Stayed at the Intercontinental and am very glad we did Staff could not have been more helpful Sarah Geoghean managed our stay and made it an absolute pleasure ,Thank you Sarah   ",5,2018,12,10
205,Perfect Pre Christmas Treat ,"Booked as a special weekend trip to treat my sister and nephew. Two nights which was far too short an immersion experience in this very lovely hotel. 
Extremely professional service from all front line staff. Very helpful throughout the team. A special mention to Jackie at breakfast who is so helpful and bright first thing the morning. The breakfast fare is ample to suit all tastes great coffee. 
Amazingly comfortable room and beds. Brilliant and attentive housekeeping. Very impressed by hard working, professional team. This is Ireland at its best in terms of hospitality and professionalism. I’m already planning a February stay and can’t wait to come back. ",5,2018,12,10
205,Best Dublin has to offer,"Service outstanding, quality of facilities and location second to none. Great place to relax and unwind whether business or pleasure. My favorite hotel in Dublin at moment. Great place to stay to enjoy festive season decorations were amazing",5,2018,12,09
205,Fabulous Christmas Season Stay in Ballbridge Dublin @ The Intercontinental,Perfect room overlooking a beautifully lit skyline view . We enjoyed a renovated room/luxury feel with high end amenities&electronics to suite your needs!Our stay was magical start to finish..staff are pros&friendly and soooo attentive ..dining superb ..waitstaff went above /beyond & location of hotel was a treat from our normally staying in downtown Dublin...We could  still take a nice 25minute walk to Dublin downtown which was great to do as gave us a chance to see the area .We highly recommend it ..give it a 100% recommendation ..For the season of our stay I should mention  the hotel's Christmas decor was lovely and seemed to get all the guests in the mood! You won't be disappointed to choose this hotel ...We are seasoned travelers who like to stay in higher end hotels ..I would say the cost of our stay was a bargain for the overall atmosphere and quality of dining and service .Cheers!,5,2018,12,09
205,Absolutely love the intercontinental Dublin.,Beautiful hotel.  The Christmas decorations were breathtaking. The Service was excellent;  everyone had a smile on their face. And the food was delicious!  I was there for business. They have a fabulous breakfast buffet  in the morning,5,2018,12,09
205,Regular Stay in Dublin,"This is my go-to stay in Dublin. I’ve stayed at this hotel 2–3 times a month for the last year. The standards in the hotel are excellent and the staff very friendly. The gym in the morning is never busy, and the hotel location is great.",5,2018,12,09
205,Love The Place,"Stayed before, just love the place, feel all my stresses disappear as I enter the hotel. Its what a 5* should be, every member of staff we dealt with were so nice and helpful.

We didn't have dinner but we did have the continental breakfast every morning and the porridge is to die for.

It is about a 40 minute walk from the hotel into the center of Dublin, its a safe and busy walk. We often walked in and taxi'd or walked back depending on our mood.

One small feedback. The hotel is not in the right location on google maps, genuine, check it yourselves, you need to speak to google. A pain when trying to use a map for driving directions.

We will be back!",5,2018,12,06
205,PERFECT! ,"Everything about my one night stay here was perfect. Hotel was so beautiful inside and out, room was spacious and very comfortable, and the food very good. Staff at check in were nice and attentive! Very much recommended if you’re in Dublin for business or pleasure!",5,2018,12,04
205,Gala ball,"This hotel is now one of the grand dames of Dublin. The epitome of luxury.  The staff are so friendly and helpful.  We were attending a charity ball and the attention to detail, the Christmas atmosphere and the food was fantastic.  This hotel is in a great location and a wonderful place to stay while enjoying Xmas in Dublin. ",4,2018,12,02
205,Pleasant accommodation in a fairly inconvenient location,"The hotel itself is solid.  Welcoming staff, clean rooms, comfortable beds, an extensive breakfast buffet and a small but spa with a pool and other facilities.  But there were a couple of serious dings. There are very few food choices in the hotel and there are just a handful of restaurants nearby (about 10 minutes walk).  The central area for tourism and shopping is a solid 45 minute walk from the hotel. Yes, you can take cabs, but the price adds up and at times, Dublin traffic can resemble what you experience in New York. The taxi to the Guinness Storehouse took a solid 35 minutes. ",4,2018,11,30
205,What’s not to like,"I like Intercontental hotels and have never been disappointed.
This is my second time staying at the Dublin location. Some of the same staff is still there which it is nice to see.
There is something extremely welcoming upon entering and the service from the staff is outstanding. The beds and linens are wonderful, the beds are a dream. The pool is lovely, nice gym and excellent spa services.
The restaurant  flows into a bar then flows into a common area with a piano  for socializing, eating, drinking or just relaxing. Just a lovely environment without being stuffy.",5,2018,11,29
205,The best hotel in Ireland,"I went to the Intercontinental with my wife as part of her 60th Birthday treat weekend. I must say that this cost a bit more than I would usually spend on a hotel but it's true what they say: ""you get what you pay for in life"".

From the moment we checked in until we checked out everything was just amazing. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff. The receptionist we checked in with remembered all our personal details every time we went back to ask her anything and was very well suited to her role. There are doormen and Concierges on hand at every opportunity to open cab doors, hotel doors etc. and to give you a very welcoming smile whilst doing so.

The location is perfect for walking to a number of cafes and restaurants nearby and is a short walk from the Aviva Stadium. The room was absolutely top notch with so many extras I couldn't possibly remember them all. The health centre and spa was also very impressive. We only used the swimming pool and Jacuzzi but there was also a gym and a very impressive range of spa treatments available. Little things impressed us there such as tea, coffee, nuts & fruit being available within each changing room and the foyer area. There was also a steam room and sauna inside each changing room. That is one area that could be improved to have a communal facility so that couples could use it together.

We didn't have breakfast or evening meals in the hotel but used the lounge to have a lunch with relatives who popped in to see us and that was also very good indeed.

To summarize, we thought that this would be a one-off to celebrate a special occasion but both came away saying how much we intend to return for more of the same.",5,2018,11,28
205,Nice hotel ,"Lovely hotel with good service— and we had a good stay. Nice rooms; as you would expect an Intercontinental brand. We didn’t get to explore the hotel much as we had a short stay.

FYI it is has a small parking lot up front",4,2018,11,28
205,Superb stay,"A group of 5 of us stayed at the wonderful Intercontinental last weekend. We had a fabulous trip. Service was excellent, rooms super comfortable, breakfast delicious and the Christmas atmosphere was in full swing! We will be making it our annual start of Christmas event!",5,2018,11,27
205,5 star service! Great staff in a great hotel.,"Thanks to all the team at the InterContinental Dublin for a lovely stay last night, ahead of a work presentation in the hotel this morning. There was a warm and genuine welcome from Isaac at the concierge that set the tone for the rest of the stay!  The room was excellent and the breakfast was top notch.  The whole hotel is beautifully kept and the decorations for Christmas are splendid.  Hoping to have a repeat visit again in the future!  Keep up the good work!",5,2018,11,26
205,Family Holiday,"Came down with my sister and it was an amazing property! Everything was super 5 stars, Concierge was very helpful! It was also very close to the city with many different forms of transport available! The airport bus picks up and drops off right in front of the hotel! We were lucky enough to get an early check in as well which was nice of them! The only confusing bit was that half the building had a four seasons logo on it, which we found a little odd!",5,2018,11,25
205,Weekend Break,"Myself, my wife and our two teenagers enjoyed a two night stay over the bank holiday weekend at the end of October. Our bedroom (the staff set up a single bed alongside the two double beds) was spacious, comfortable and very luxurious (I was told the rooms have undergone a recent refurbishment). After a relaxing swim in the pool, we enjoyed a delicious meal in the Seasons restaurant on the Saturday evening. The hotel is situated within easy walking distance of the city centre and though located beside a main road, the absence of traffic noise was remarkable. The staff were all super friendly and very helpful. We enjoyed a very relaxing stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a base to explore the city.",5,2018,11,24
205,Concert stay,We stayed the night of a concert at the 3 Arena. Had a really lovely meal in lobby lounge which was a much better option than eating near the concert venue. We were able to leave after the worst of the rush hour had passed. After the concert it was an easy journey back and we enjoyed a post concert drinks in the comfort of the hotel. Then up to our beautifully refurbished suite for a great nights sleep. Breakfast is always excellent here and the previous nights band were there too!Looking forward to our next stay,5,2018,11,22
205,Rugby Weekend,"Had an amazing stay for the rugby weekend! There was a great atmosphere around the place.Room was beautiful, Staff were great. Thank you to Carla in the lobby lounge for taking care of us and Garav on the front desk also for making sure everything was perfect.Will definitely be back !",5,2018,11,22
205,Another fantastic Stay,This is really a great hotel in Dublin not cheap but definitely high in quality. The service level is impeccable and you have an array of restaurants and leisure facilities to enjoy during your stay.  The leisure facilities are superb and they also offer spa treatment. Breakfast was excellent once again,5,2018,11,22
205,Review,"Great location, Overall stay was nice, super comfortable bed all of the staff except 1 were fantastic, really friendly and professional. Lovely breakfast. Unfortunately the room was not very clean. Was really surprised at how unclean for a hotel of this quality. Work hard myself and understand what goes behind it but basic stuff here overlooked for a long time. Hopefully will be picked up and rectified.",3,2018,11,19
205,The warmth of hospitality,"I had to check in to Intercontinental Dublin for one night as one of their sister hotels had over-booked. But the way it was handled both - by the Spencer and Intercon for me is a lesson in how to delight with great service.I was given the room at same rate as the lesser starred Spencer - but the staff at Intercon were absolutely gracious in how they treated me. I was given a grand room and the service was truly warm, showing great empathy for me (I had just landed after a 18 hour flight and my baggage had not arrived!). The room, the facility, the location all were impeccable. ",5,2018,11,19
205,Amazingly helpful,"My parents are staying there at the moment. They were originally booked in on the wrong date but when they showed up, the hotel went above and beyond to rectify the mistake even though it was because of booking.com or mistake in booking it. The manager was so accommodating and friendly (I think his name was Zack) and the reception staff were equally so. I just want to thank them for all of their help in making my parents 40th wedding anniversary so special. 5 stars isn’t enough!",5,2018,11,18
205,Amazing stay and marvlous staff! ,"We had an amazing stay at intercon Dublin, stayed in the suite which was huge and very tastefully decorated. Loved the dinner service in seasons restaurant. Reception staff was super helpful, however Rehan and Kristina was amazing, courteous and very well mannered. ",5,2018,11,16
205,You are made to feel at home,This is a beautiful hotel. You are made to feel at home upon returning. The service is excellent. There were no slip ups at any stage of our stay and we thoroughly enjoyed it. It was lovely to be looked after so well and to have someone else have all the responsibility for a change.,5,2018,11,16
205,Amazing service,"Stayed here for work. My friend hurt her back just as we arrived and the staff could not have been more caring or helpful. They found us a space, got us ice, rushed to get rooms ready (we were very early) and responded to every request positively. The rooms are luxurious and the beds super comfortable but the staff make this a truly classy hotel",5,2018,11,16
205,Perfect stay as an ambassador ;),"Great in every detail ;) hotel checked me in earlier ( about 11 am) which was great. We got a gift and great treatment as we had our anniversary ;) perfect place, great swimming pool, good location. Late check out till 4p.m. with no problem even on a reward stay. Greatly appreciated! ",5,2018,11,16
205,Comfortable,"Large, comfortable and quiet rooms make for an excellent place to sleep and unwind. The common area in the lobby is good for meeting informally with colleagues or friends. Breakfast was also enjoyed by all. ",5,2018,11,16
205,Great hotel,"Intercontinental is modern, clean hotel with all amenities, great service and excellent location. Reception was quick and efficient as was the valet parking and departure. Always good value breakfast.",4,2018,11,16
205,Overpriced,"Stayed at the Intercontinental in Ballsbridge on 2/11/18. Booked this hotel directly on their site a few days before arrival using my visa debit card. Upon arrival we were greeted by a very professional and friendly front of house team. As we were checking in we were asked for our credit card to swipe for any amenities we would use on our stay and when I presented the same card I'd used for my booking I was informed it was not suitable as it was a debit card and not a credit card! This seemed strange as the exact card was perfectly fine to prepay the room only days before.We continued to our room which was spacious and tastefully decorated and included all the services to expect from a hotel of this standard.As we were quite tired from our journey we decided to order room service from the ample room service menu and had it delivered to our room.It was nicely presented but a little mediocre. I signed for our order and ate a little then decided to sleep. A couple of hours later there was a loud knocking on our door and when I opened it there was a young man from room service handing me back the bill with a large NO CREDIT written across it. I did not have cash on me and am not accustomed to needing it staying in any hotel in 2018.I rang reception and after a couple of minutes was greeted by a nice lady who quite simply asked would she put it on the card I'd initially booked with! Problem solved.The next morning we were awoken at 7 by a loud alarm going off downstairs. On ringing reception I was told it was a neighbouring school and there was nothing they could do.As we were now awake we decided to dress and go for breakfast. Upon looking at the breakfast menu we decided to take a walk down the street to eat elsewhere as breakfast was priced at €30 EACH.At check out we were then informed that there was an overnight charge of €18 for the use of the hotel car park.So altogether €230 for room, €60 for breakfast and €18 to park and although the hotel is of a five star standard I feel you will find a far more luxurious and modern hotels in Dublin for less money.",3,2018,11,16
205,Always Suprememe in every way,"Once you step into the Intercontinental ,your worries fade away,..!!! relaxation is overpowering and the hotel and staff are amazing. Don't change anything we expect the best and always get it.For 14 years we have enjoyed a few days in Heaven.",5,2018,11,16
205,Can’t wait to visit again.,We had a wonderful warm and welcome stay!  Everything was splendid from the joining rooms to the dining.  We would highly recommend the Intercontinental to anyone visiting Dublin.  Isaac the doorman was just wonderful.  He had the perfect personality and made us feel at home.  ,5,2018,11,15
205,Home from home,"I truly Enjoys staying at the interContinental hotel In Dublin, from the receptions Staff, restaurant staff to the room staff every element of your stay is managed to ensure your feel welcome and at home. The hotel
Is ideally located for those evenings out in Dublin or a day trip around the city, I would highlight recommend this hotel. ",5,2018,11,15
205,"Very, Very, VERY disappointing","OK, so I was attending a Cancer Trails Lunch Fundraiser at the hotel last Saturday 
( November  10th) The lunch was scheduled for 1pm so, myself and my Superwife (and she IS super) along with 8 close friends and family members aimed for 12.30/45. On arrival there was the usual wine and G&T's being passed around. I wanted a water and had to wait at the bar for what seemed like an eternity. Anyway, the bell rang and in we went, along with the other 4-500 people. Great atmosphere and a really worthy cause. Wine flowed at the table, and then wine flowed at the table, and then wine flowed at the table. The starter came out at 1.30 and at that stage I said to myself - ah well it is an important fundraiser and so i'll give them the benefit of the doubt. After all I had been to a Belevedre ladies fundraiser earlier in the year and the same thing happened. However, by 2.30 I was getting so hungry (no sign of main course) that I was tempted to call Justeat ie. And the wine kept coming !!! By 3.10pm the main appeared. This to me is OUTRAGEOUS and the hotel should not take booking like this unless they are capable of handling these events. They will tell you that the delay was due to various speeches etc etc taking place. Thing is the same thing happened at the event I attended earlier in the year. Would I go back ??? Maybe, but I'll pack a sandwich and pop it in my inside pocket. Very very disappointing.",4,2018,11,14
205,Get Ready for Wonderful,"Can’t say about this hotel. The luxurious atmosphere & grounds make you feel like you are in a resort!  The staff & superior service all help to make this a fabulous hotel stay.  It’s location is a little off city center, however the 10 minute taxi drive is worth experiencing the gorgeous public rooms, including a very inviting bar.  But if the room is your priority, they are fairly small & just a step above adequate.  All the above more than makes up for it!",5,2018,11,13
205,Large dinner at Seasons restaurant,My family and I visited Seasons reastaurnt on Friday evening. The food was superb and the service was incredible. Yonelys and her team went above and beyond to accommodate us. I would highly recommend Seasons restaurant.,5,2018,11,12
205,Left feeling very spoiled!,"We do not stay in luxury hotels often but decided to splurge on our last two nights in Ireland.  What a treat this place was!  The room and bathroom were huge, bed was very comfortable and the best shower we had in Ireland!

Staff was above accommodating, from the doormen to the front desk staff to the lounge staff.  I neglected to get names, but everyone was so nice and helpful.

We spoke at length w/ Barry, one of the concierges, who helped us plan our day in Dublin.  He was extremely helpful and nice.

The only downside to this hotel is the location in terms of downtown Dublin.  Unless you want to strap on your walking shoes, it's about a 20 minute walk, one-way.  We ended up doing the DoDublin Hop On/Hop Off tour, which picked us up at the hotel, and took a taxi back at the end of our day (DoDublin does not drop you back off).  It's in a lovely area of Dublin (Ballsbridge) and you can easily walk to restaurants and pubs in that area.  We were glad to be out of the hustle and bustle of the city but if that's what you want, you won't get it at this hotel.",5,2018,11,07
205,This hotel has pampering down to an art!,"So glad we chose this perfectly elegant, quiet and comfortable hotel for our week in Dublin. I was concerned that we were too far from the downtown action, but with the new train around the corner, it was a breeze!",5,2018,11,06
205,Such a lovely experience ,Beautiful hotel with fabulous suites  . The whiskey bar is a great spot and breakfast is superb . Our room was very big boasting a beautiful bathroom with separate shower and another single toilet to host the living area just luxury. The balcony looked out over Simmons  court and the RDS  . Welcome chocolates left in room was a nice touch  ,5,2018,11,06
205,Excellent Birthday visit,Stayed in this fabulous hotel recently as a birthday treat for the significant other.  Was checked in by the lovely and very professional Radomir and all I can say when we got to the room is WOW!  The room was spacious and had every comfort you could ask for. The hotel had acknowledged that this was a special birthday and they really pulled out all the stops.  Service was attentive and unobtrusive throughout from arrival and being greeted by the very friendly Muzzafer at the front door to check in to the intimate bar and subsequent dinner and through to breakfast the next day.  Jackie was a delightful host for breakfast and the selections on offer were so good we just had to go back for more.  I would also like to thank Gaurav and Russell for their assistance in helping me to arrange this trip and in general well done to all.  You all made this a memorable stay and one we will never forget!,5,2018,11,06
205,Great location - dated rooms,Fantastic building that I know well . Staff are very good and the ambiance on ground floor is good . The pool is very poor and certainly not what you expect - really needs updating . The area was not supervised on arrival so feels 3 star . The mini suite was large bedroom and very dated . Could be much better but needs investment,3,2018,11,05
205,Consistently top shelf,"No need for long winded review.   From start to finish this hotel is five star. It ticks all the boxes. Friendly, welcoming, helpful staff, staff that make you feel they are happy to see you.  Food is absolutely top class.  Breakfast cannot be beaten in my opinion.",5,2018,11,02
205,Excellent ,"Visited here for one night, wow! It is fantastic. As soon as we arrived the concierge took our case, easy and fast check in, got to the room which was stunning, very well presented and clean. Case was Brought to our room. Staff very attentive. Had breakfast on the morning and there’s a lot to choose from and it’s delicious. Would visit here again and would recommend it. ",5,2018,11,02
205,Just gorgeous,"Unreal rooms, amazing service, polite staff, delicious desserts.
However the pillows were slightly too soft for my liking. 
Overall and amazing experience and will definitely return soon. 
Breakfast was like something i never seem before! Was just amazing ! 
However the menu at the bar was a bit too formal/posh for me.
",5,2018,10,31
205,Lots of positives but ...,"Stayed here for business trip and have stayed many times before and always enjoy . First time I’ve been a little disappointed.

Rooms are excellent with great space and beds are so comfortable. Dinner and breakfast is really good. 

Reception for past two times I’ve stayed has only had people who were in training and while they were fine, lacked the usual slick check in and welcome with someone telling them what buttons to press

Main issue would be bar and lounge area. There are twice too many staff who wait for you to finish a drink and take it but you can’t get an order inside 10 minutes - and twice in last two stays they  have run out of something , either a tap or an ingredient or short. 

Excellent hotel but lounge could learn a trick from some of the busy pubs in Ballsbridge ",4,2018,10,30
205,Fantastic hotel,"We had a 3 night stay here recently and had a lovely time. The staff were all very friendly and we spoke to 2 different concierges and they were both extremely helpful. The breakfast was very good and we ate in the bar one evening and it was also very nice and the staff were very friendly. Our room was quite spacious with a nice big bathroom. The only slight annoyance we had was the fact that we were in a room with an inter-connecting door, which was not soundproof. It is a half hour walk into the city, but there are lots of restaurants 5 minutes walk away. There was also plenty of parking. I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2018,10,30
205,Not a 5 star,I stayed here in the summer for a family weeding. The staff are so cold and rude. During the wedding reception if we left our table to dance the staff would clear all the drinks off our table! Most drinks on average were over $10.   To ensure we did not have to replinish our drinks one person had to always stay at our tables. At breakfast it took at least 30mins to get tea or coffee. On leaving i voiced my concerns to the front dest staff. They apologized and assured me somebody would contact me  within a week ......... that never happened!,1,2018,10,28
205,Great Staff - Beautiful Room,"My mother and I stayed at the InterContinental while celebrating her 75th birthday.  Unfortunately, she was not feeling well when we arrived. The staff was wonderful, especially Natalie, who helped us to get her a doctor.   Barry was a terrific concierge and helped us find some good day trips that wouldn't be too difficult for her and she would enjoy.    I would recommend this hotel to anyone.  The only con I would say is the menu, it's not very extensive.   ",5,2018,10,27
205,Intercontinental hotel,"Fabulous family friendly hotel.
Big shout out to Livia. She was so attentive to our 7 year old daughter. Couldn't do enough for us in the piano lounge. The staff made our trip all so special.
Check in couldn't be better.  My opinion one of the best hotels in Ireland fir service.",5,2018,10,27
205,Very nice hotel,"Only here for one night so didn’t get to use all the facilities but:

 - staff seemed very attentive
 - room was spacious and felt recently refurbished
 - shower was a bit feeble
 - decent gym
 - pretty reasonable rate

Overall, good quality and value.",4,2018,10,26
205,What a wonderful experience! ,"The hotel and the rooms are Luxurious and spotlessly clean - a very well maintaned hotel.
Very polite staff and especially Bratislav (porter), Radomir at the front desk and Alice at the Lounge Bar who delivered us an excellent service and making our stay 10/10. 
 
The hotel's location is not in the city centre, but, 10 mins ride by bus -bus stop just outside the hotel. 

Matress: the most comfortable bed i've ever had!

Breakfast: High quality of food with variety - lovely view to the garden.
We had afternoon tea and Dinner at the Lounge Bar. Very satisfied  with the food, portions, quality of food and service - very attentive staff. The live music from the pianist was very much apreciated as well.

Spa and Health Club: I had  massage - highly recommended. Loved the heated pool.

I highly recommend this property and i will definitely stay there again for my next stay in Dublin",5,2018,10,23
205,Public areas 5 star guest rooms not,"On arrival at the hotel you get the immiadate feeling of been looked after.
Staff are attentive and welcoming. Public areas are excellent.
Checking into the room I have to say was disappointing
The room needed to be refurbished. Possibly other rooms have received upgrades.
Overall this is an excellent hotel with the staff been their best asset",4,2018,10,23
205,Outstanding !,"Just returned from another say at the magnificent InterContinental Dublin.  From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty.  When we were checking in Radomir was so courteous, helpful and obliging.  He ensured our Spa Treatments were confirmed and walked us to the elevator explaining where everything was.  Our suite was out of this world, elegance beyond compare with a cosiness that encouraged you never to leave ! We had lunch in the Lounge and Jackie was on hand with a smile, ensuring everything was perfect for us.  We spent the afternoon at the Spa, and we felt we were the only guests at the hotel we were treated so well. I had the most magnificent treatments from Zoya – it was in a different league to other Spas I have visited.  We had drinks later at the bar where the Director of Operations, Russell, was subtly ensuring all guests were being looked after, he was so professional.   Finally we dined in our suite on this occasion and the food was superb. Overall a 6 star experience from a wonderful hotel. Well done to the GM Nicky Logue and the rest of the amazing team - both front of house and behind the scenes.",5,2018,10,22
205,"Luxury setting, location just ok","This hotel is luxurious and well maintained.  The staff is very friendly.  Rooms are great and comfortable.  However, it is about a 45 minute walk or 15 minute bus/train ride to the center of Dublin.  There is not much around the hotel itself other that a pretty residential area.  The train station and bus stop are just a short walk from the front of the hotel. 
  My room had plenty of space, a great bath & shower, and comfortable desk & chairs.  I was excited to see full length French doors leading out to a large balcony, but was disappointed a door stop was installed to allow them to open only a few inches.  One could not go out onto the balcony!  Good lighting.",4,2018,10,21
205,Fabulous stay in Dublin!,"From the  doorman to the maid, the  staff was outstanding.   Room was beautiful.  Linens and bed were wonderful.  Breakfast was the best in Ireland.  Very nice pianist in bar.  Concierge was Very helpful and  right on with suggestions.",5,2018,10,20
205,Quite Nice Hotel ,"✅ comfortable bed and pillows 
✅ good WiFi connection 
✅ nice gym with a bonus dry sauna and wet sauna plus it’s not busy at night so you can relax after using the gym 
✅ quiet room
✅ nice staff
❎far from the city but the train station is near 
✅ will recommend to families and friends ",4,2018,10,18
205,Just great,"Large beautiful rooms and very helpful staff in a good location. 

Breakfast was absolutely excellent and I suspect dinner in the hotel restaurant would be just as good but we chose to eat in Dublin instead. The concierge service was very good and we found all of the staff to be helpful and friendly. 

It costs about €15 for a taxi into the centre of Dublin (and taxis were plentiful). 

My only gripe was being charged for parking (circa €15 per night) - surely a 5 star hotel should include parking in the room rate!",5,2018,10,16
205,Not great,"I was very disappointed in this hotel and unfortunately, I made my family stay here as well. The food was average and the hotel is just too far from where you want to be. It was a better hotel when it was The Four Seasons. ",2,2018,10,14
205,Disappointing ,While we had a gorgeous room - everything else about our stay here was disappointing. There was no concierge throughout our 2 day stay. The taxi stand would only use “their” service even if it meant waiting put 30 minutes when there were plenty of available cabs on the road in front. Turn down service never happened and we specifically requested (not just do us but apparently the entire floor). The front desk never heard about the Dublin city bus passes after we gave up on the cabs. They could not inform us this very basic information. And while we were upgraded to a suite. We felt “nickeled and dimed” as my platinum status was not taken into account and we negotiated the extra 100 euro cost down from 200 for a room that was available. Love love love Dublin but not this hotel. Too far from the center.,3,2018,10,14
205,I have never stayed at a nicer hotel.,"The hotel  & accommodations could not have been nicer.  The hotel was well staffed with employees who were competent and very friendly.  Their food service was second to none. The location is excellent withing walking
distance of the of the National Gallery of Art and Trinity College. Our room was first class with plenty of room and
incredibly clean.",5,2018,10,12
205,Pure excellence,"This hotel is flawless, the design is very special, may look a bit old for some but I liked it. The room was very impressive, immaculate, a nice view. I was alone and almost thought the bed was way too big for me. Breakfast was amazing, room service enjoyable, the bar area very nice. I honestly can't find anything wrong, staff was very professional. And the Spa area is also very special, it's actually quite dark, at first I was a bit surprised but then I liked the style. Well done on every level.",5,2018,10,10
205,Simply great,"This was our second stay at this hotel and again it was excellent from start to finish. The staff are very efficient, but friendly and welcoming - from Jane who checked me in, the late waiting staff in the bar (sorry guys didn't get your names), through to the concierge staff.
The bedrooms are very spacious and equipped with pretty much everything you need. The beds very comfortable and almost invitite you to stay there once you're in. Bar/restaurant definitely worth a visit - again spacious and welcoming.
The surrounding area of Ballsbridge is well worth a walk around, but it's not a huge walk into the centre of Dublin either. Perfect location. 
The only downside is that we only had 2 nights here.",5,2018,10,02
205,A prestige hotel,Just back from a wonderful birthday weekend break at this hotel. I have stayed here around a dozen times and love coming back. Our stay was made very special by Kate O’Flynn and her staff and we were made to feel valued guests. We stayed in an executive suite on the 4th floor. The room was huge and we had a great view out towards the city and coast. The room has top quality furnishings with plenty of space and a separate bedrooms which was spacious also. The bed was very comfortable and it was so peaceful that we had a great nights sleep. We used the spa and pool which were excellent. The lights are dimmed at night and it was lovely having a swim in the ambient surroundings.  The breakfast was lovely too and plenty of Choice. The Irish lady who is in charge of the restaurant but I can’t remember her name is a very nice and professional person. I have already booked another night and will look forward to our return in the near future. ,5,2018,09,30
205,Wonderful and kind service to a non-guest,"We were at the InterContinental to meet a day tour  at 7:00am.  After waiting 30 minutes (had arrived 6:45a), we asked the Desk Person (Zoey) if she might contact the tour company. She made several attempts (we had only reached voice-mail) but persisted and eventually made contact with a person who confirmed there was a delay (blocked motorway).
I want to thank Zoey specifically but also the the hotel management - all the staff we encountered had great attitudes (and we were not even their guests).",5,2018,09,29
205,"Great hotel, but not 5-star","I travel to Dublin for business and stay at this hotel often. I do like it and it's mostly great but it's not perfect.  I'd argue it's closer to a 4-star than a 5-star.  The front desk staff are very pleasant and genuinely welcoming but outside of the front desk they're really not that detail-oriented  For example houskeeping has forgot requests on a few occasions and at the restaurant and bar the are usually understaffed and slow.  

The rooms are always clean and the beds super comfortable but they lack consistency and don't all look like the website pictures so watch out! You may get a gorgeous new room one time or you may get a really old dated room the next (see pictures in case you're worried about the latter - they're really ugly). The breakfast buffet is quite nice and the food is great but the service isn't always consistent either.  I'm not always noticed when I sit down and have often had to chase servers down just to get a cup of coffee.

The health club is very nice and the facilities are great including a nice gym and pool which I try to take advantage of when I'm here.

In terms of location it's great for me since my work is close to the hotel but if you're here to see the sights it's quite far from the city center and taxis are not always easy to come by.",4,2018,09,24
205,Very pleasant stay,"We stayed for a weekend, would have loved to have stayed longer, service was great from start to finish... 

The hotel is a modern building with a touch of past elegance. 

Set away from the town centre, a 15e cab ride each way into town, but worth it just for being in tranquil surroundings.

Rooms were well appointed, extremely comfortable bed, and fairly priced mini bar.

All in all... most enjoyable and relaxing stay, would definitely book again.

",5,2018,09,24
205,An unexpected journey,We had had an upsetting experience on the Irish Sea and had not planned on staying in Dublin on this trip to Ireland. My 84 year old mother had been particularly upset by the experience. The sympathy and kindness of the staff went a long way to making her feel better about venturing on the Irish Sea on the following day . This was our second stay at this hotel in nine months and the service puts the other 5 star hotels in Dublin in the shade. I look forward to returning next month.,5,2018,09,24
205,Great place- truly intercontinental,"Again a truly brilliant hotel - hospitality as it should be. Was there for a conference and used the conference rooms and other facilities there as well and everything was well, as expected from the intercon.
Great hotel at a nice location with lovely large rooms and beautiful gardens ....the staff service and courtesy was superlative...
",5,2018,09,23
205,BC Canada gals visiting for the week with NAPA,"This hotel is by far the most lovely I’ve stayed in... and I travel quite a bit. The staff, ALL OF YHE STAFF, were more than occomodating. The grounds were beautiful and spotless. Our room was huge and very clean. Large bathroom and extra comfy beds. We visited the spa which was so relaxing and very posh.  Breakfast had a tonne of options, drinks in the lounge were perfect! 
Unlike some of the latest reviews I have read, there are several delicious restaurants within close walking distance (Beluccis, the lobster pot and Riley’s to name a few- food is delicious just like the rest of the restaurants in Dublin)

On behalf of my friend and I, we would DEFINITELY stay at the Intercontinental again!!!",5,2018,09,23
205,Overpriced; rather ordinary,"This is really just a corporate style hotel for conferences, seminars and airline. As a private paying guest we found it grossly overpriced for a very ordinary rather tired room and I imagine one is paying a lot more than the corporate guests who also fill up the bar. 

The photographs and room descriptions bear little relation to what you actually get. What was some Four Seasons elegance is now wearing off. I would definitely not go back. 

The location isn’t ideal for the city centre, but it is quiet and near the DART station. 
",3,2018,09,23
205,Fantastic Hotel,Let me just say this is a great hotel. Amazing staff and grounds. The property itself is beautiful and well appointed. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly. I was only able to stay one night as part of my travel plans. The rooms are clean and comfortable. It is in a good location. The next time I'm in Dublin I will stay here for a few extra days. You will not be disappointed.,5,2018,09,17
205,"Great hotel, great staff, great location","Excellent staff, great room, great location. I was upgraded as an IHG Platinum to a junior suite, which was much appreciated even though it is not guaranteed and based on availability. This definitely made the stay more enjoyable. Even without the upgrade, the staff and facilities were great. The room was a good size, with a walk-in closet, nice marble bathroom, good access to outlets at the bed and desk. The sofa and day chair were some of the most comfortable I've seen at hotels. Usually, upscale hotels try to furnish with fancy but uncomfortable furniture. That was not the case here. The beds/bedding were also great and allowed a comfortable night's sleep. I'm not sure what the capacity was like, but I could not hear one peep from other rooms or the elevator (and were near the elevator which I initially regretted because I thought I would hear the noise, but once I realized that was not an issue, we appreciated the proximity). Restaurant staff at breakfast were also great and were attentive to everything. The chef made great omelettes and the staff kept up with everything.

Minor quibbles: the chair at the desk was not a good height for the desk it is matched with so I kept hitting my legs on the desk. The internet had some connectivity issues and was decent but not what I would call high-bandwidth. I could not connect my router which had my work VPN to it, so I'm not sure if they prevent VPN access. Also, I had some trouble receiving two packages during my stay. Logistics seemed to be needing some improvement to coordinate between daytime concierge and night time desk staff. Both times, they were eventually able to locate my packages but after considerable delay. This was a minor issue, however, and does not affect my rating of this hotel or its staff, both of which are excellent. Everything else was great and this is one of my favorite hotels internationally!

A tip on travel: taxis seemed expensive, and we prefer public transportation, so if that is good with you, here is what you do. Prior to arrival, obtain the Leap Visitor Card which is good for almost all public transportation in the city centre. To get to this hotel from the airport, the cheapest way is by Airlink bus to Connoly Station then DART to Sandymount.  Easiest way is Aircoach from the airport to the Clayton Hotel/RDS stop (not ""RDS"" or the first ""Clayton"").  To get to city centre take the DART in to Tara, Pearse, or Connoly, depending on where you are going.",5,2018,09,16
205,Seems to be a new excellent General Manager,"I have stayed several times at the Dublin Intercontinental Hotel and wow has it improved .It is a beautiful Property in an amazing location ,near enough to the City but still in Leafy Area . As always the food is fantastic especially the amazing breakfast Buffet .
What has dramatically changed is the friendly service you get in every single department of this fine Hotel . 
We were a group of three sisters and all agreed it was down the the new Dinamic General Manager we saw everywhere everyday . He stopped to talk to us several times as he did with all of his guests . It is easy to see that he has passed his friendly customer service to all the staff. It was evident that morale is high throughout the Hotel .",5,2018,09,14
205,Fantastic luxurious stay,"My friends and I chose to stay at the InterContinental on a weekend break to Dublin and it was the best decision we could have made. We had an fantastic stay. 

We dined in the lobby and my expectations were surpassed. 2 of us ordered salmon and the other 2 ordered the duck - the food was delicious. There was a piano player playing in the background who was amazing - added to the evening.

The following day we had breakfast and I think it's the best breakfast in Dublin. There was a huge range of food for all tastes and the white pudding was to die for.

The hotel is sooo luxurious and the staff were so friendly and attentive. 

I had stayed there about 3 years ago and didn't think it was anything too special but I understand there is a fabulous new General manager there who is clearly making a huge difference. 

I will definitely be returning.",5,2018,09,14
205,Pure luxury and value for money. ,"Some months back went to the InterContinental for Afternoon tea and really enjoyed it.Talked to my friends and we decided to book a two night weekend break.Arrived,checked into our room and immediately headed to the Lobby Lounge for some liquid refreshments.After a brief discussion we decided to remain in the Lobby and order dinner from an impressive menu. I had the Thornhill Duck Breast which was excellent.My friends had the 10oz Irish Striploin steak and Fish and chips. We all agreed the standard of the food was five star.
After a good night's sleep we had a leisurely breakfast.We were in no rush to leave the breakfast room but we had booked some Spa treatments and pampering awaited. The Spa has a very good reputation and that is well deserved. Have to say really enjoyed the 14m pool. I would have spent all day.We had a good laugh in the Whirlpool.If you book a break, treat yourself to the Spa you will not be disappointed.
Finally, can't finish my review without a special word of praise for the General Manager Nicky Logue. The man is everywhere.The professionalism of his staff is down to him. There is probably 300 staff and he appears to know each  one by name.Thank you all for a lovely weekend. We'll be back again and that's a promise. ",5,2018,09,13
205,Nice stay,"So, the room is nice and clean and spacious. The breakfast is very good. If I would do it over again, I’d probably do just one day of breakfast at the hotel and go out into town for breakfast.  Oddly, there are no trash cans outside or in the foyer. Parking needs to be validated prior to leaving and it’s 18 daily. You can pay cash on the machine outside or pay at the end of your stay. Remember  not to do both. You can walk to the center of town and that takes maybe 20min. Hop on and off bus is about that long a walk to get to anyway. If you do the bus, it’s 20euros a day or 25 for 2 days. Food in restaurants is very affordable and good. ",5,2018,09,13
205,Excellent!,"The Intercontinental was amazing. It made our Dublin experience fantastic.  The staff are exceptionally polite and helpful.  The concierge was amazing and the transportation services were fantastic.  I highly recommend Rod's Dublin Taxi, Roderick Malone.  He is very knowledge and friendly and a wonderful tour host.  I can't wait to return to Dublin and will definately stay at the Intercontinental.  It is 5 stars plus, plus. ",5,2018,09,09
205,Nice Hotel!,"The hotel was nice.  Very lush.  But I had to downgrade to 4 stars.  I paid an extra 50 euro a nite for an upgrade.  Our shower could only be used for 2 minutes and then it would have flooded the room.  I asked for it to be fixed 3 times.   I spent my first 2.5 days taking 2 minute showers.   I asked for a $100 euro credit and got it.  I
Also waited 3 hours for them to bring our luggage to the room when we arrived.  Strange.  Other than that it’s a pretty hotel and very quiet.   I wanted to be away from the Dublin city center and noise.",4,2018,09,08
205,Wonderful stay.,"We had a very nice time here.  The staff were wonderful.  I love seeing the staff smile and say hello.  The room was fabulous.  Breakfast buffet was great! And the location is fine, it is within walking distance of the museums and Trinity College.  Yes, I did walk there.  And it is also a very short cab ride, which I also took one day, so distance should not keep one from staying here.  Simply, Lovely!",5,2018,09,02
205,A beautiful hotel with a great staff,"I went to the hotel for breakfast for my grandfathers 80th. The staff overheard it was his birthday and surprised us with a lovely plate of chocolates. We were served by Ida who gave us amazing service and was so polite and friendly to us. I was very impressed with the service and the food was delicious. I would highly recommend the hotel to my friends and would definitely visit again. My experience was definitely made more enjoyable by the excellent staff, especially my server Ida.",5,2018,09,02
205,"Spacious Rooms, Quiet Location - Far From City Center","Our family of 4 stayed here for 5 nights in a very nice, very big room. The beds were comfortable, and the hotel was very quiet. 

On the downside, this used to be a Four Seasons hotel, and as an Intercontinental, it's definitely a notch or two lower on the Luxury Hotel spectrum. The staff was attentive, but not very detail-oriented. The room was clean, but a bit dated. The breakfast buffet was big, but not very tasty. 

Also, since we wanted to see the sights of Dublin, we spent a lot of time (and money) in taxis. This location is quite far from the city center.",4,2018,09,01
205,Highly unprofessional,"Attended wedding in hotel and stayed for B&B.Lovely hotel,bedroom fab.On returning from church had drinks in ice bar.There was 170 guests with two barmen absolute carnage,had to wait twenty minutes for drink then requested beverage manager to attend.Had wonderful breakfast great quality and choice.On checking out I was informed the account had been taken care of.The following day we noticed two charges pending on my credit card one for the b&b and one for two beers from room which we did not have.We were informed there was an error on the group sheet for the wedding.Reception thought the bride and groom were paying.I had to explain the situation to them which was so annoying.Would I stay again no,if you are looking for a genuine five star experience in Dublin avoid this hotel.",4,2018,09,01
205,Amazing Hotel,We were warmly welcomed on arrival.Receptionist was so helpful.Our room was fabulous. Would rate this hotel 7 star.We look forward  to returning and staying for longer next time as the location is so convient .,5,2018,09,01
205,Gorgeous Lobby and Bar,"Stayed here last week on a group trip booked through Delta. This hotel is very nice, very clean and very comfortable. Front desk was very helpful and rooms were spacious. We had some issues obtaining transportation during the busy weekend; if you rent a car or have prearranged transportation then this would be the hotel for you, taxi's were few. I give four stars because I believe this is a four star hotel. Once all of the rooms in the hotel are upgraded and remodeled as seen in photos,  I may reconsider the rating. Mine was not, but the bathroom was.",4,2018,08,31
205,Lovely trip to Dublin.,"We enjoyed our visit to this hotel , for a short stay in Dublin. We felt welcome , and loved everything about this hotel. Would love to visit again , next time we are in Dublin. We thought it was a really beautiful hotel and location. Well worth a visit. I recommend the intercontinental Dublin if you are visiting Dublin.",5,2018,08,31
205,Great beds,"Nice hotel. Very comfortable beds. Very good breakfast. 
Ordered afternoon tea which took a very long time until we were told they had run out of loose leaf tea! Brought tea made with tea bags and a tea strainer for appearances. 
Drink prices a bit on the high side but to be expected in a five star hotel. 
Would go again. ",4,2018,08,29
205,Very pretty. Staff : just OK.,"This property looks amazing. The grounds are elegant and well maintained. I had a room that was not yet updated, but still very nice. The bathrooms were exceptional as well. However, our mini bar was empty on arrival. We did not mention this to mgmt. because we did not plan to use it, but worth noting. The beds were beyond comfortable. The hotel itself was quiet and peaceful, despite construction on our floor. 

The service, however, was just OK. I will say that there was a mix up with the type of rooms we had reserved, and the front desk worked to resolve it immediately, but the rest of the staff was not as accommodating. The doorman repeatedly gave taxi's to families from the area even though we had been waiting, this was common theme. 
When we mentioned the behavior to management, we were just ignored completely moving forward. Because this hotel is not in walking distance, taxis must be taken and transportation is key to a good stay. We did not feel we had any help at all from the concierge or doorman and were told by drivers that they themselves do not have a good relationship with the hotel. I can see why. Any taxis that arrive to the hotel also must pay a fee to the hotel and so I would advise hailing cabs off the property (which requires walking a bit down the road). For a five star hotel, this is a very stupid issue to have and seems like it could be easily resolved.",3,2018,08,27
205,"Beautiful Property outside of Dublin, Some negatives. ","Start with the positive. The hotel is a beautiful property. Has a nice fitness center and spa for guests. We did breakfast one day and one dinner at the hotel. Food was very good and reasonably priced for quality of hotel we were in. 

Rooms were very well appointed. WiFi was relatively fast and free. Bed very comfortable. 

Location.. if you’re coming to see sights of Dublin I’d recommend somewhere closer. Pretty close to public transportation but none of the sights of Dublin are within walking distance and there’s not a ton of restaurants in the immediate vicinity as well. 

Negatives;
-Tried to run the bath and water was completely gray/brown. See picture. 
-We had an early morning tour bus to catch. They claimed they had 24 hour room service. Tried to pre order breakfast for the morning. Couldn’t serve us hot breakfast until 7am
-Next day we had a very early flight so asked front desk to get us a cab and specified we needed to pay by credit card. Get to airport our cab doesn’t take CC. So now I’m scrambling at airport to try to find an atm at 6am. 

All seem like minor issues and on their own probably not a huge deal but when you stay and pay at a hotel like this, especially considering you’re not paying for location, you expect the level of service or amenities to match expectations and just didn’t here. 

If you’re looking for a luxury stay I would have to guess there are superior options with superior locations as well. ",3,2018,08,25
205,A great hotel with a wonderful atmosphere,What a great time we had staying at this hotel.  The entire staff was great. They were very courteous and very attentive to all out needs.  They made great recommendations for different types of places to eat and in general were there to meet all of our needs. They truly made a difference in what was already an amazing trip.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. Thanks to all for making this a great place to stay.,5,2018,08,24
205,Dublin Excellent Visit,We had an interesting stay at Intercontinental hotel of Dublin with family members . The hotel facilities and staff are friendly and excellent in addition the quality of food and meals with prime location.,5,2018,08,23
205,Outstanding property in leafy South Dublin,"Had a 2 night stay here on business and despite Hurricane Ophelia raging outside you wouldn't know it in the hotel. Beautiful opulent property in a very American style...think lots of dark wood, marble, crystal lamps and plush cushions.  Was upgraded to a suite on arrival which was a lovely treat and actaully worth paying extra if I had to. Room was richly decorated and had every amenity you could think of.

Breakfast in the morning was a relaxed affair in a grand dining room, Well stocked buffet and attentive staff.  

As I was on business I didn't get the opportunity to use all facilities but did pass the spa and wish I had time to visit.  

All in all a great hotel in a beautiful location. Will be back.",5,2018,08,21
205,Never Again,"My spouse and I visited this property primarily to begin our trip in Dublin and then into Northern Ireland for a golf and sightseeing vacation.  Check-in was seamless; they greeted me as an Ambassador member and offered an additional upgrade to a junior suite for an additional fee, which we took.  Room beautiful - front office and hotel staff lovely.

Jet-lagged from the travel we went to bed, expecting to sleep in late the next morning to recover only to be awakened by banging on the pipes from the room below at 0700.  Evidently renovations that WE WERE NOT INFORMED OF were being performed in the room below us that we had ironically paid an additional fee.  No mention anywhere of hotel renovation or mention at check in.  Thinking it was a fluke, we did not complain, only to experience the exact same situation the next morning.  They offered to change our room and/or curtail the renovation for the remainder or our 4 evening stay and refund the upcharge for the Junior Suite which I would have gladly forgone had I know I was checking into a construction zone.

The front office staff was truly sad and I was offered 10,000 points to my Intercontinental account for my inconvenience.  Unfortunately, this ruined our entire trip - we were jet lagged and didn’t enjoy our stay in Ireland as we were exhausted; cut our golfing short and ended up leaving the country early.  The best night’s sleep we received was in the Radisson Blu hotel at the airport the night before our flight left for the US.

This hotel needs to be honest with travelers and is a travesty to the Intercontinental Brand.",1,2018,08,20
205,Best choice in Dublin,"Location is wonderful, not really in the very centre of the city but in a wonderful area of Ballsbridge. Everything was great, really specious rooms, excellent service and a beautiful courtyard. Highly recommended.",5,2018,08,20
205,Excellent stay,I had a quick stay for two days. The hotel upgraded me to a one bedroom suite. The room was very spacious and beautiful. The food is amazing and everyone in the service team is very professional. I will definitely come back to explore Dublin more. The price was a bit chilly but it worth it.,5,2018,08,19
205,"Gorgeous Hotel, ","There are so many wonderful things about this hotel. Exceedingly comfortable beds, very quiet, lovely spa area, extremely helpful and kind concierge, and extensive breakfast offering.  The only reason for 4stars instead of 5, some inconsistencies. After waiting for our room to be cleaned (we arrived quite early) the bags took much longer than they should have to be delivered. So long that we called multiple times and almost became concerned they were lost. Also, bathrobe in the closet was dirty, and shower water fixture broke off and would not properly drain (twice, even after fixing). These things can happen, but it’s not what I would expect from a hotel of this caliber and price point.  That said, the staff was very welcoming. Room service was the best I’ve had - perfectly cooked and still hot. Breakfast staff was warm and friendly, as were the staff in the tea room and bar. We splurged for our Mom, and she truly enjoyed herself. We were given an apology for the shower incident and a bowl of fruit the day before checkout. Overall, we did enjoy our stay. ",4,2018,08,17
205,Beautiful hotel with great service,"It happened so that I stayed in the hotel during annual horse show which takes place on the grounds adjacent to the hotel. The hotel, its bars and restaurant were full of drinking, chatting, shouting people and the staff somehow managed to cope with this ocean of visitors. I did not suffer any problems - polite and attentive service, prompt room service, excellent breakfast, cleanliness in the room and all public areas. Special thanks to Natalia from Guest Relations who was my 'guide' to get acquainted with the hotel, local area, city of Dublin and 'things to do'. I should note that the hotel is pretty far from city centre (good opportunity to walk a bit) but the surrounding area called Ballsbridge is also nice.",5,2018,08,17
205,Luxury at the highest level ,"Visited this hotel last nite with my girlfriend. From the minute you drive through the gates of the hotel you are met with the wow factor. After we parked the car in the very secure car park which they provide on the premises. We proceeded towards the entrance. From the second you walk through the doors you are made feel important, the gentleman at reception was extremely professional about his job and although our room wasn’t just quite ready (in fairness we did arrive just after 11) he had one of the gentlemen from out front come and tend to our luggage while we went on the tour of kilmainham gaol which reception had organized a taxi to collect us promptly to take us there. A short while after leaving I got a pleasant phone call from reception to say the room was ready and our bags taken up with the key cards waiting at reception for us and if we would need anything else just to let them know. Later that evening we arrived back the receptionist knew me straight away and knew about the key cards waiting to be collected and we were informed that all our luggage was taken up to the room and the two shirts I had with me on hangers were neatly hung in the wardrobe.All I can say for the room is wow by far the nicest hotel room that we had ever stayed in and it was spotlessly clean aswel the whole experience fro start to finish was top notch and I can assure you we will be back... and last but not least I can’t leave out Viktor that worked in the bar to class character and bartender..",5,2018,08,16
205,Amazing,"I have stayed a few times here but stayed for one night on a recent bank holiday with extended family. Talisa and Colin on the desk are amazing as usual! So welcoming and made me felt at ease from check in. Our rooms were beyond spacious with beautifully kept bathrooms and very comfortable bed. We ate in the lounge for dinner, the service was as relaxed as the atmosphere. Food was great. We had the pool to ourselves the next morning which was a final treat before we had to leave. Overall, such a lovely retreat in the city centre, all the staff I met are lovely. The younger kids already want to go back. I am looking to get another stay in before Christmas.",5,2018,08,15
205,Dreadful reception / concierge,"First impressions of the hotel are that it is very nice.. lovely grand reception and entrance.
We arrived and unfortunately the room wasn’t ready. On returning later that day we were given the keys for the room and told that our luggage had been taken to the room.
When we got to the room the keys did not work so we went back down to the reception to advise... the receptionist changed the keys but did not apologise. When we got into the room, the luggage was not there. We went back to reception and discovered that the bags were still in storage even though the staff had had 4 hours to get them to the room..... we took the bags ourselves to the room...... again no apology.

Breakfast was lovely although quite steep at 28 euros per person. The bedrooms were big an clean with a good mini bar etc.. 

Shame that the concierge / reception staff did not actually care and were that rude not to apologise. The staff were mainly foreign so no surprises there.",3,2018,08,14
205,Wonderful hotel,"This is a belated review, my family and I had the pleasure of staying in early January to recover from the exertions of Christmas!
Exuding elegance and style this is a must for anyone who appreciates life's  luxuries.
Having booked an executive and junior suite  our break was enjoyed immensely by all, the comfort of the accommodation i s superb and of the highest standard.
This hotel is most worthy of it's five star status from the staff who are so courteous and welcoming to the food both 
restaurant and room service.
A return to this gem is most definitely a must!

",5,2018,08,13
205,Poor restaurant food and service,Beautiful hotel. Concierge very welcoming. We sat for dinner at 7.30pm. Order was taken by a lovely girl. It was 8.30pm before our starters arrived and not altogether. We waited a further hour for our mains. We had to ask where 3 of our mains were. When we eventually received them the rest of our family had already finished. Food was undercooked. One had to be sent back as was almost raw. No sign of a restaurant manager. Staff not trained for a five star hotel. This needs to be seriously addressed. Restaurant was not full. Very disappointing as we were celebrating 3 birthdays. Seriously overpriced food that's not to five star standard.,2,2018,08,12
205,Lovely hotel and great pool,"Family holiday and stayed at this hotel (formerly four seasons).  Excellent hotel, fab pool.  Kids loved their personalised cookies waiting for them in the hotel room.  Very central to dublin ciry and ballsbridge area.  Will be back to stay again.",5,2018,08,11
205,Luxury in the city,"Only one night visit to Dublin on a Birthday treat for a bit of shopping. Hotel interior oozes luxury. Fresh flower displays, fabulous decorative lighting & comfy chairs & sofas in every part. 
Room very spacious for city hotel. Beds very comfortable with great quality linen. Large screen tv, (But no pay for movie options?)kettle also available which was a plus for a five star. Overall’ staff sleep interiors all live up to what you might expect in a five star.
The reason I don’t give it the full 5 is breakfast! It’s buffet style (with the option of extras to be ordered of menu at a supplement). Very small display area with food on offer & to be honest while there was enough to fill most people’s appetite it did lack quality. 
This is a huge tourist hotel & felt it really let itself down on presentation for breakfast. No information on hot food as to source? Continental for gluten free came in packets?! Granola options limited to one small jar.
For the ambience of the breakfast room the food let it down. Didn’t feel special or luxurious in anyway.
Truth be told better offers have being found in 3 star on business trips.
I really feel table service needs to be brought into 5 star hotels for breakfast. 
As is let’s the quality of hotel down.
I would stay again as said hotel itself is beautiful but I’d choose to go out for breakfast. 
Intercontinental Dublin fabulous but needs to get breakfast standard raised to five star too.",4,2018,08,10
205,Great stay overall,"The time I stepped into the hotel. Was greet with a smile by reception staff who were very helpful. 

Spa was relaxing and extremely clean. All the amenities were available in the spa and the room. 

Room was clean and bed was very comfortable with duck feather pillows. Once you get into the bed you just sync in. 
Great nite sleep. 
Reception made check out and check in hassle free it just took us 2 min. 
Over all gray stay in Dublin. ",5,2018,08,09
205," Over rated views,poor service","In spite of being a gold member,no early check in.Offered to upgrade paying 140 Euros extra so that we could get a room and ultimately got a room 10 mins later!Elated we go to the room and find that our Deluxe room with great views looked out on to a storage yard full of containers! So if you are booking to stay here because of Greta bucolic views ,think again! The one silver lining- a great concierge- Rhys was great with all his suggestions and always happy to help.",3,2018,08,08
205,One of Dublin’s Top 3 Hotels.,"Outstanding facilities, very friendly and welcoming staff, great range of dining and drinking options. Rooms very well appointed. Lively at night. Only slight drawback is Dublin rush hour traffic makes for slow travel to/from Dublin Centre.",5,2018,08,08
205,"Beautiful Hotel, lovely Lobby & excellent bar staff!  Gorgeous flowers everywhere!","We stayed for one night, two rooms for our family of 6. Everything was lovely - great breakfast but had snafus with check in.  Be careful!  We confirmed our rate with breakfast, and when we checked in they said it wasn't included.  Good thing we had our confirmation with us.  Also, there was nobody to greet us when we arrived with our luggage, and we had to haul everything ourselves.  Not a huge deal, but you'd expect more based on the hotel itself and the facilities.  Loved the older gentleman playing piano in the lobby bar when we arrived - so nice & willing to take requests!  Also, Barry our server could not have been more amenable to our familiy and our needs. He was amazing!",4,2018,08,07
205,excellent hotel - upscle area,"We enjoyed our stay in this four star hotel. Has all amenities and services. It is in the upscale residential, secretariat area of Dublin. Little away from ""happening"" places but thr hotel is in a pleasing area. The staff (especially Front desk) was not that great, but food, facilities and rooms were excellent.",4,2018,08,06
205,Great for lunch,"Popped in for a quick bite and had the Express Lunch.  Lovely, well-presented food in great surroundings.  Salad, main course and a dessert all presented on the same platter (salad in separate dish).  Really enjoyable lunch.",5,2018,08,06
205,Dublin,Stayed for 1 night. Rooms are a good size. Room service menu good variety had the vegetarian burger it was lovely. Big bed. wi fi fast. Central if you want to go exploring the area. Dublin is nice place is lot bigger than thought it would be.,5,2018,08,05
205,A Cut Above,"Without giving you the play by play, which I consider unnecessary, I will simply tell you that this is a first rate hotel with magnificent appointments and furnishings, a highly professional and well trained staff that is always helpful, polite and appropriately engaged, and service second to none.  Also of note is its elegant setting, away from the crowds and touristy activities, but if you want them, they are a short cab or bus ride away.  Excellent breakfast included with more choices and options than you can imagine, and a spa and pool that looked magnificent.  One of the finest hotels in which I've stayed.",5,2018,08,04
205,Fabulous,"What a great stay.  Clean, classy, all services provided, including a front desk that printed tickets for us  Great staff -- always welcoming and friendly.  We stayed in a junior suite and had plenty of room for a family of four.  The location was a tad bit out of the way but other than that I don't think we could have done any better.",5,2018,08,03
205,Peaceful and Pleasant Stay,"Recently I was delighted to get a late booking in the Intercontinental in Dublin. From when I pulled up in the car I was greeted cordially at the hotel door and this welcome began to extend throughout all of the staff who were working there. All were pleasant and smiled when greeting me, which made me feel very welcome. The room was incredibly spacious and the bed was nice and firm. Room service was quick and the full menu was on offer very late on. As I was checking out I locked myself out of the room but swift and sound service made it easy for me to get back in before checking out. The breakfast was lovely too and it gave me a great start to the day after a sound night`s sleep. I would highly recommend a stay in this very relaxed and well run hotel.",5,2018,07,30
205,Relaxing stay with some disappointment ,"We stayed for one night, and were met with very inviting reception staff.  We first ate in the bar,food and service was very good, a lovely friendly bar man on duty.  We had a spa treatment booked and arrived down there about half an hour before treatments. Not impressed with the spa which we thought only had a pool and a jacuzzi.  Following on from our treatments only then did we find  the steam and sauna room.  We should have been shown the facilities prior to our treatments.  We ate in the dining room, food was really good but service very poor. We were left sitting for 35minutes before any body came to our table, prior to this we were in the bar and were rushed in to our table in the dining room.  Staff in the dining room need more training the staff in the bar area are far superior .  Bedroom was clean with a very comfortable bed.  Breakfast was also good a lovely friendly girl on duty showing us to our table. Overall we enjoyed ourselves but I have been in far superior 5 star hotels. ",3,2018,07,29
205,Beautiful hotel,"I loved my stay in the intercontinental. We decided to treat ourselves to a relaxing night and thats exactly what we got. The most beautiful decor, chilled live piano, soft fluffy towels and robes, comfortable bed, stunning clean bathroom and great friend helpful experienced staff always ready to assist. 10/10",5,2018,07,29
205,Expensive but superb service and beautiful hotel,"This is a top class hotel with large, beautiful rooms and very helpful staff. Beds are extremely comfortable. It is pricey though. However, if you can get a good deal, it is definitely worth staying there.",5,2018,07,27
205,One short night,"We spent an extra  day/night in Dublin after a  British Islands cruise on Regent cruise lines and this was the hotel they included in their package.  The room was very large - almost as large as the suite we had on the ship -  and beautifully laid out.  I would call the furnishings classic contemporary all in a dark wood.  The king sized bed was very comfortable and larger than the one we have at home.  Since it is located in an upscale residential neighborhood, there are no local restaurants nearby so we ate dinner in their own restaurant - good food but very expensive  - 100 euros for the two of us for a meal that would have cost at most $70.00 here in the states.

One last note, actually more of a question?  Why do hotels think that all they need to have for a bed cover is a duvet?  Both myself and my wife were stifling under that when just a sheet or two  would have been enough for all but the thinnest skinned people.",5,2018,07,26
205,Always reliable,The intercontinental in Dublin has a lovely lounge area when you can also dine informally. The food is always good but the service can be slow or inexperienced. I enjoy the decor and the setting close to the RDS and Lansdowne Rd. I have not stayed overnight but would definitely be happy to give it a try. Our lunch was a little pricey although enjoyable.,4,2018,07,24
205,Nice hotel,"Family of 4, including 2 tweens.  Great wifi, clean rooms and great staff.  Food was great but a bit expensive.  Beautiful spa and scenery, especially the Library Lounge.  Not in the center of town though and closest restaurant is 10 minute walk.",4,2018,07,24
205,Could not fault it 👌,"Absolutely amazing stay at this gorgeous hotel! The room was amazing and had everything you needed. The staff couldn't do enough for you and the breakfast was great and was available until 11 o clock!! Really couldn't say enough good things, will definitely be back!",5,2018,07,17
205,Can't wait to come back,"We arrived and were greeted by the lovely doorman and then a friendly receptionist, we were upgraded on check in which was such a lovely touch. Beautiful flower display in reception and the lobby area is relaxing. The room was fab ! One of the best we have ever stayed in. The views across the city were great. Our bed and pillows were simply luxurious and the breakfast superb. We are looking  forward to returning.",5,2018,07,15
205,Quiet and Safe Area in Ballsbridge,"Stayed a few days with friends for a holiday in Dublin. The hotel is located in the Ballsbridge area of Dublin which is approximately 2.5 miles away from City Center. Walking to and from the hotel to City Center is manageable; however, if you are unable to walk, taking a taxi or Uber may cost approximately 15 Euros one way. The hotel is very clean and well staffed. The room was huge and all the amenities were excellent including L'Occitane Bath Products and Nespresso. The swimming pool and the gym were very clean and never busy. This hotel is also close to the US Embassy.",5,2018,07,15
205,"Good location and facilities, poor service","Great location and facilities, as you’d expect from a former Four Seasons... just don’t expect Four Seasons-level service.

It’s hard to reach anyone on the phone, for any reason.  Slightly snobby attitude, almost Basil Fawlty-comical given their management and service problems.

Room service food ok but uninspiring.

One service highlight - although difficult to reach via phone, house-keeping has been excellent, very accommodating in person.

Also, if traveling as a family, be warned- for large chunks of the day kids not allowed in pool “so not to disturb the residents above”.",2,2018,07,15
205,Contact the concierge before you go.,"I had a business trip to Dublin this July and felt that asking the concierge ahead of time to look into my stay would be helpful.
He arranged the room location, sent me a list of local well known pubs and had my car rental at the hotel ready to go when I got there. No fuss,  no muss. I needed the car rental an extra day and he looked after it all. As for the hotel, it was a great place to stay.   ",5,2018,07,13
205,Lush!,"We stayed here recently, because we were going to a concert in Dublin.

This is such a lovely hotel.  The service is first class - friendly and efficient.

Our room was a huge corner room with a dual aspect to the side and rear.  The bed was so SO comfortable and the pillows were perfect.  The bathroom was big and the toiletries were good quality.  Everything was impeccably clean - perfect!

Breakfast was delicious.  The poached eggs that we ordered were perfectly cooked and hot on arrival.  The buffet had a good selection and everything was fresh.

If you are visiting Dublin and do not mind staying in the city centre, I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.",5,2018,07,10
205,Luxurious,Had dinner here.  Very expensive but we knew that before we booked.  Special occasion for my hubby and I and it was well worth the expense.  Great selection and no rushing us between courses. Well worth the experience,5,2018,07,09
205,A remarkable hotel!,"This place had beautiful and comfortable rooms, and the amenities were wonderful. There is attention to detail with the rooms and they make sure to keep everything clean and well stocked.
However the breakfast was the best breakfast buffet style I’ve ever had. 
The coffee was delicious and I still dream of the food! 
Our company held their dinner in one of the event rooms and it was incredible!",5,2018,07,09
205,Check that there is no construction happening - very poor experience,"I have stayed here a number of times. First when it was the Four seasons and now as The Intercontinental. It was a very disappointing experience. There was a lot of construction work which meant that the drilling was incessant for the three days of our stay. Despite moving us the drilling still was there. The management were very apologetic and gave us a bottle of wine and 20 Euros back from a stay that cost €1350. When you stay in a suite that you are expecting to spend time in (I had a number of calls to conduct) and enjoy it - then it's very upsetting. Additionally the food is not very good, expensive, and there are plenty of fabulous restaurants in the Ballsbridge area including the Girl and The Goose and The Lobster Pot which provided superior quality food for better value.",3,2018,07,09
205,Great value,"One of the few hotels with A/C we had in Ireland!:)
It’s a bit far from the city center (40-50 min walk) but in a lovely quiet neighborhood, besides the Walt was pretty pleasant. Though we didn’t find much of the Irish character, the hotel itself is nice and well maintained, like any other InterContinental. The spa was almost empty and relaxing, breakfast was good!",4,2018,07,07
205,Top-class hotel in Dublin!,"Excellent hotel, not far from the hustle and bustle of the city. Rooms were opulent and spacious, amenities great, the coffee shop, restaurant and bar a great place to hang out and socialize. The business rooms were well laid out, roomy and offered the perfect setting for those all important meetings.

The outdoor seating and gardens was well manicured and the staff ever so friendly. If I had a bone to pick, it would be that the concierge services were not the most prompt.

Highly recommended!",5,2018,07,06
205,A Gem in South Dublin,"Wonderful open layout with spacious suites . The concierge Barry deserves a special mention for the excellent suggestions as well as prompt bookings he made for our sightseeing.
The breakfast laid out at Seasons is sumptuous and the chef (a Sardar from India- my apologies as I didn’t get his name) was very conscious of our preferences and went all out to cater to them. The parathas were awesome!
The intercity rail station Sandymount is 2mins walk away and can take you to many places worth visiting in a short while and at a fraction of the cost a taxi would charge.
The service is prompt and the staff helpful and polite. Definitely recommend this hotel",4,2018,07,03
205,Top Service.  Top Entry area.  Top room service. Small deductions for room and Breakfast,"Many positives to this hotel including a Five star Service. 
Reception, despite being fully booked, took time with us.
Friendly welcoming reception at front door
Extremely knowledgable and likeable Concierge called Barry.  Nothing too much for him.  Would have liked to have talked to him longer on Irland.
Big enough pool for swimming enough lengths
Brilliant room service at really affordable prices.  Wished we´d done this from the start.
Bar area really friendly.  Lovely to spend afternoon here with a lovely atmosphere (lots of guests seem to do this)
Orders of taxis and room service dealt with efficiently and promptly.
One of the best Fitness Rooms we´ve seen.
Very mixed clientele internationally.  Seemed to be lots of Business People, and Maybe they had a conference on? 

Reason for a 4 and not a 5 in the evaluation are as follows:
Room looked very tired in decor and curtains and not really worthy of executive suite - although it is huge in size.  Fitted carpets had waves in them.  The bay window had damp issues making the plaster detach.  This does not create a good impression.

Breakfast had issues (but this is complaining at a v. high Level).  Halfway through breakfast times, there were no croissants left and no apple juice. Sorry, sold  out came the reply?!?!!   A Positive coming out of this was a wonderful unassuming service Lady (Thin, very tanned) who managed to find 2 croissants for my boy and made his day.  This was Service over and above the norm, and well done to this Lady (Wish I´d got her Name).  On the whole, Breakfast just didn´t look sumptuous enough, and well presented enough in comparison to nearly all Hotels (4 and 5 star) we have stayed in.  

Walking distance from the town centre is an issue with children.  Having said that the distance to the beach is better.  Location is however in a very good area, so you feel safe.  Additionally it is quieter than being in the centre.

Recommendable hotel at the right price, and I would definitely consider rebooking if only for the brilliant service all round.",4,2018,07,03
205,Great hotel.,"My husband and I stayed here last weekend in a king room with a balcony.  Room was clean, very large and extremely comfortable.  Bathroom  was all marble and granite with a large shower and separate soaking tub.  We had breakfast included and it was fantastic!  Great variety of hot and cold.  Really good not your typical hotel breakfast.  Very fast to get a cab and great Wi-Fi in the room. Safe neighborhood and close to the arena if wanting to go for a concert or event. Tour bus picks up in the morning right in front of the hotel.  Definitely recommend and would stay again.",5,2018,07,03
205,First Class Hotel,"Welcoming and helpful staff, beautiful hotel, beautiful rooms, and in a great neighborhood with a lot of restaurants and bars to choose from.  Also very easy access to town by bus, Uber, or walking!  Loved!",5,2018,06,29
205,Fine,"Very classy hotel in nice neighborhood. Room was great except the air conditioning did not work. Several attempts to correct failed (they were switching over from analog to digital). Slept with the windows open. No problem. Room service was top notch. Fish & chips were the best we experienced in Dublin. Hung out in the lobby bar a couple of times during our stay and could not help but notice ongoing tension between the barkeeps and the wait staff. I do not believe that the issue should manifest itself in front of the hotel's guests. Overall, a great stay.",4,2018,06,28
205,Wonderful Hotel,"We loved this hotel. Stayed here with son and daughter-in-law, 3 grandchildren (all teenagers) and my husband. The staff was great, always willing to help with any problem. The rooms were good sized. Breakfast was bountiful and we loved the Lobby and the Bar area.",5,2018,06,26
205,...better avoid a day with a function,"May be it was all bad timing but at the check-in my status  did not get got acknowledged - not a real problem in itself nor was my choice of news papers (asked for and offered at check-in) delivered during my stay. Later a number of more shortcomings were encountered with house keeping which all of them alone were not really worth mentioning but one on top of the next are simply not what you expect for the hefty price you pay. Yes they apologies sincerely when mentioning the list of issues but still it leaves a shale taste. 
On the bright side the room was just fabulous and in room dining was great as was the concierge and the portiere as well as the night shift man on duty for housekeeping.  
So might be not as bad as I make them on a different trip but makes you thing whether to spend your money there again.",2,2018,06,26
205,"Great amenities, service could be improved ","Overall the staff in this hotel are very nice but there definitely needs to be some fine tuning in terms of their management.  The food in the restaurant and and room service Apparently there is renovation going on and the noise was very loud during the day in the room with drilling, knocking, and banging.  That combined with the schoolkids next door being let out to play meant it was impossible to get any rest during the day.  The service in the bar area is much to be desired.  A lot of staff running just around like chickens with their head cut off.  Took forever to actually just get a menu, then servers would just look at us and not saying anything.  Finally had to go up and order ourselves.  Once we finished our drinks, it was the same trying to get the bill.  Eventually had to go up to the bar and ask for the bill.  Spa area is the biggest plus for me at this hotel...great gym and sauna/steam room in the changing rooms.  ",3,2018,06,20
205,par excellence,"I had the pleasure of staying two nights recently in this hotel....what an experience.  I am an older person, staying on my own and how I was treated.   The wonderful, kind , caring Jacqueline at breakfast, who took me under her wing and minded me for the next couple of day, to Nicholas in the lounge.  Simply first class attention from a 5 star hotel.
I loved every minute of my stay and so pround to be Irish in my own capital city.
Also not to for get the lovely Donal at the piano who entertained me so well.
Well done to all the staff at this great hotel.    Its the staff that makes it all work !!
Mary  from Limerick....",5,2018,06,20
205,4.5 stars!! We had a wonderful time at the Intercontinental.,"We stayed at the intercontinental Dublin for 3 nights. It was the memorial holiday weekend so we decided to make a quick trip to Ireland as it is only a 6 hour flight from Boston. 

The location of the hotel is not in the city center. It is in Ballsbridge which is a quiet and nice area of Dublin. It’s probably about 2  Kilometers from the city center, around 45- 60 minute walk according to google maps. We took uber taxis (no uber X, just uber taxis and uber black are available in dublin) going to the city center when  we were there and it was around 10-15 minutes to temple bar area so it was not that bad. My husband is an ambassador member so we were upgraded to a one bedroom suite from a king bed room. There were 3 of us and the room came with a sofa bed. The room is very spacious. Property looks very well maintained. I did have an issue with the bed as it was very firm and it exacerbated my lower back pain. It was previously a four seasons property and I think they maintained that classic luxurious look for the room. The bathroom is very spacious as well. The room has a 4 piece bathroom and we really liked. The hotel has an indoor pool and jacuzzi which is great feature during the winter. Gym is 24 hours and has pretty decent equipments. We only had one complimentary drink which we find disappointing since the room is booked for 3 people. With the previous intercontinental properties that we have been too, the number of complimentary drinks always depend on the number of registered guests and not only the ambassador member. Maybe it’s different with this intercontinental property. We did get a welcome fruit platter and we were able to check out late (4pm). Water is complimentary so we did not have to go to the grocery to buy, but if you ever need to buy sodas, there is a convenience store that is nearby maybe a 5-10 minute walk. Staff is very welcoming and helpful. There are a lot of restaurants nearby and we were able to eat a good Irish brunch at a nearby restaurant.

We had a wonderful stay at the Intercontinental. The hotel may not be in the city center which is our preference when exploring a new city, but we did not mind the commute at all. We chose this primarily because of the ambassador membership of my husband. I really think the membership is worth it because of the additional perks such as free upgrade and late check out. The price range though is more on the expensive side even though the location is not city center. You might be able to find a cheaper hotel at or near the city center. ",4,2018,06,17
205,Nice but expensive hotel,"The hotel itself is very nice and the room upgrade appreciated. 

I was contacted in advance to ask if I had any special requests, I asked for fresh milk in my room to have in my tea. This was sadly not provided plus there was some very noisy building work right next to my room which made it particularly unpleasant spending any time in my room, which was a shame as the room was very nice. I needed to make some work calls which was not easy with all the drilling and banging outside my room.

Being upgraded to a room right next to the building work was very disappointing and not what I would expect from a 5-star hotel. A poor way to treat guests.",3,2018,06,16
205,"Lovely lobby, pleasant staff, but overpriced ","I spent 3 evenings at the Intercontinental; I was in town for a meeting. The hotel is gracious and welcoming. My room, however, was tired and worn - not worth the €500 nightly rate. Lunch was also fairly standard during the conference- I expected more.  Staff were very helpful and welcoming which was a plus. I don’t think this is worth the money. ",3,2018,06,15
205,"Was a good stay, not impressive for the price","The stay was good and comfortable. The room was nice and set up as promised for our family of 4. 
The staff was generally friendly and helpful, but seemed a bit disinterested. I guess I expected a bit more flair and luxury than we got for the price. 
Overall very functional for our stay. ",4,2018,06,15
205,Classy hotel with perfect service,"Booked a room for 3 nights and was upgraded (like it should be as an Ambassador memeber). The first niight we stayed in the renewed executive rooms and I must admit that they are very classy. A lot of power supplies and USB ports everywhere.
After that we were moved to a Suite, that was a lot bigger, but was not refurbished yet. Loved the 85 SQM room and salon and I hope these rooms will be upgraded as well in a near future because they are a little worn out.
Service from everybody in the hotel from Bellboy to breakfast to nightmanager were impeccable. Breakfast is nice and cocktails in the bar well served. I would book again even if it's not in city center (10 minutes by Taxi)",4,2018,06,14
205,Incredibly Special,"I am fortunate enough to get to stay in a lot of hotels around the globe. However this is not the case recently due to personal circumstances until my first time stay in the InterContinental Dublin.
Previous to my arrival I joined their Ambassador programme and boy is it worth it. You are guaranteed a one room upgrade along with water in your room etc. Don't hesitate, just join! Upon arrival I was checked in by the wonderful Alex who immediately noticed that my upgrade was unavailable, due to the hotel been fully booked, but offered me complimentary breakfast in lieu of this. No hassle, no fuss, the way all check-ins should go in a five star establishment. A wonderful start to my 3 nights. Previous to my arrival, the amazing Natalia in reservations helped me out and looked after any requests that I had such as a room with a walk-in shower etc. Again, no drama, no fuss but with everything looked after. I even received a call to my room to check everything was to my satisfaction. A true ambassador to the IHG group, Natalia made sure my stay was completely faultless. The milk and cookies were gratefully received.
In the bar area Shane and Barry were faultless in service, professionalism and efficiency. The spa is also truly wonderful. Just book it, ask for Linda and see what I mean. Fantastic. I could go on but would be writing all day. Monika in revenue has already been onto me regarding my upcoming stays, while Sarah, the FOH manager, took time to say goodbye at checkout. 
A most memorable stay. A five star experience in every area. Can't wait to go back. My next stay is already booked. Thanks a million to all in the InterContinental Dublin.",5,2018,06,12
205,Best 5 Star in Dublin,Has to be the best 5 Star hotel in Dublin! The staff the service and the warm welcome is second to none! It feels like a home away from home. Love this hotel. The rooms and suites are beautiful. Breakfast is fab and the bar food is really good. Can’t wait to go back ,5,2018,06,11
205,Great Stay!,"Landed 16 hours later and at 3PM our room was not ready. Shift changed and they did not inform the new shift that we were waiting for the room. At 3:30 we enquired about the room and we were told that the room was ready. Beyond that this is a great hotel from the lobby to the courtyard to the bedroom. Beds and pillows were very comfortable with block outs as the sun rises very early. The hotel is in pristine condition. The pub is awesome. We were lucky to have great weather. The room had a view of the river from the 4th floor. If you dont feel like taking a taxi at €13 euro to Grafton Street where you can find great shopping, you could take a 40 minute stroll. All in all I love Dublin!",5,2018,06,11
205,Wonderful stay,"We stayed here for one night midweek. The reception from the moment we walked through the door was so warm and welcoming. Executive King room is gorgeous, huge bed, great shower, lovely views, mini bar, tea and coffee making facilities, etc. Breakfast was outstanding, massive selection and staff were extremely helpful and pleasant. Hotel is in a great location, right beside RDS, near the Aviva Stadium. Very close to city centre by bus. Only criticism is parking overnight is expensive. However, I think we will be returning! ",5,2018,06,10
205,Superb base for first trip to Dublin and Pro14 Final,"Actually the place grew on us over our seven night stay and we ended up feeling  quite embedded - yes there were a few niggles - e.g. chipped sink, carpet in hall needed sticking down in places but overall would happily return again to drink Guinness from the bar and eat in the lobby area which was welcoming both with the staff on duty and comfort wise. Only other niggle the breakfasts were great but could have been hotter temp wise - maybe better to put less out and keep refilling with more freshly cooked selections - but was impressed with the honeycomb always on offer.",4,2018,06,06
205,One of the best in dublin,"This fine hotel is centrally located a short distance from both Trinity and Aviva stadium.  Formerly a four seasons hotel, and probably even better managed now, the hotel offers excellent accommodations and top notch service.  ",5,2018,06,05
205,Lacked the polish and attention to detail of the brand,"The hotel rooms and grounds are stunningly beautiful and well kept and the presentation of the staff team and service areas match this. However the service lacked the 'special' element that is synonymous with the Intercontinental brand of the IHG group. It was not obvious the senior hotel team had ever visited another Intercontinental hotel or tried to ensure their standards matched the expectations that come with this brand. 

A sample of the issues: 

* Waiting 25 minutes for the bill in the whiskey bar (including three requests to the same waiter)

* Ordering a steak and asking twice for a steak knife - this never appeared so we gave up and chopped through the steak with the blunt knife they supplied

* Ordering two grapefruit juice with breakfast and receiving only one - then being asked if we could ""make do"" when we called the Instant Service line back

* Very poor local knowledge of the concierge for local transport on the day of a marathon that closed the road. I asked for alternative public transport information, i.e. where buses were being diverted. They either weren't interested or didn't know and would only help if we wanted a taxi. 

The above are examples of minor issues but this a premium brand of the IHG group and I was disappointed to experience them. 

I am a Spire Elite member of this chain's loyalty programme but note the hotel has failed to respond to any of the reviews on their own IHG review website, on which they score 4.5 stars.",3,2018,06,04
205,Very nice,"We stayed as part of a conference but apart from our check in experience the stay was very pleasant. We felt the member of staff on ckeck in was not knowledgeable and although our room was not ready a phone call was promised when it was but that never came. Jackie on breakfast duty each morning is a credit to the hotel. The other breakfast staff are very pleasant. There is a good choice too and the  breakfast room is delightful.

Our room was enough for our needs although dusty in places on arrival which remained that way throughout
our five night stay.  This hotel is away from the centre however there are very nice restaurants within walking distance. The pool and spa area are very nice too. This area seemed very relaxing. Shame about the check in experience otherwise a very nice hotel.
",4,2018,06,03
205,Best,This was my first trip to Dublin and it was great..  This hotel was excellent from the quality of the rooms to the superb customer service they provided..  I have to especially mention Barry and Nikolaus in the bar/restaurant ..  I hope to return soon,5,2018,06,01
205,Superb!,"My husband and I stayed at the Intercontinental Dublin in early May for 2 nights. We stayed in a Junior Suite and it was simply heaven! The room was huge and so comfortable and spacious. I had mentioned in my booking that it was my birthday, the most beautiful cakes were waiting for us on arrival in the room!

The hotel is beautiful. We had a a drink and our evening meal in the lobby and it was sensational/. This area is beautifully appointed and staffed by very professional and friendly people. *Try the fish and chips!

The General Manager, Nicky, was available on check out and spoke to the guests which i thought was a nice touch. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff of Intercon Dublin!

The location is perfect, we strolled into and out of the city each day enjoying the beautiful buildings and history along the way.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back.",5,2018,05,28
205,Amazing birthday,"I came for my Birthday with my wife and all the staff made my stay memorable!
The afternoon tea was amazing and the jacuzzi was accesible for men and woman's, it's good to be able to be with your wife in the jakuzzi. But hammam was not mixte. ",5,2018,05,28
205,"Great location, poor service","This hotel is superbly located and the property itself is bright and modern. The access road in can get very congested as it is on a busy road junction. The parking was almost full on both occasions we parked but we did find spots, so all good. The first issue though was getting the parking ticket validated. We went to the concierge outside and they could/would not validate the parking ticked and we had to join a looooooong check-in queue. We also tried the second desk opposite the main check in desk and they also declined to help. The main check-in staff were already under pressure so I can't see the value in overloading them with the parking ticket validation as well. The room was comfortable, the mattress was on it's last legs with a big slope in the middle from years of use. Breakfast was a bit of a disaster. Even though at least half of the tables were either unoccupied or piled with dirty dishes, we were left standing for over twenty minutes. The lady in charge was doing her best but the staff bluntly ignored her requests to prepare a table and continued doing other work. In the end, embarrassed, she went off and prepared a table herself and issued several apologies. We had to chase staff to get served coffee and toast. The guy that ignored the lady earlier, returned to the table with a grunt and dropped burnt toast (photo attached) at the table and headed off. This chap seemed to have a major chip on his shoulder. I complained at check-out and to be fair the lady cancelled the parking charge as a gesture and promised to relay our experience to management. You could say these are small complaints but when you pay a fortune to stay in a five star hotel you expect better service than a holiday inn express. We also booked newspapers which duly never arrived. So, overall a fine hotel but with poor management. I would suggest they visit some of the 5 star hotels in Kerry, such as the Park in Kenmare or the Sheen Falls and see what 5 star service is. They are getting away with it in Dublin with the super location, but I won't be recommending it as a 5 star.",3,2018,05,28
205,Much improved since last visit,"Having been less than impressed on our last stay here, I did wonder whether standards would be better on this occasion. I am pleased to say they had. The staff we met were all friendly and polite with many going the extra mile. Meal portions in the bar are huge. Breakfast is still as good as it’s always been. Little touches have been added to rooms such as USB slots for charging.
I still have a few little gripes. The bar is simply too small for a hotel this size- when we came down during the day there was nowhere for our party to sit and unless you’re having afternoon tea, you can’t reserve a table. The bar still shuts at 1am- make it later when there’s a demand for it!!!!!
The hotel is undergoing renovation at the moment albeit small but we were not told of this at check in. The building work made it impossible for us to stay in our room during the day as it was so loud.",4,2018,05,28
205,Great Place...except,"Nice hotel, large rooms, near City Center (not comfortably walkable so take a cab).  Good breakfast and nice bar.  Would have been perfect except woke up to sounds of SERIOUS construction going on above my room.  This was the level of noise where you couldn't have a conversation with others in your room.  Called front desk and they said it would be going on for several more days and moved us to a nicer room. All's well that ends well.",4,2018,05,27
205,An unnecessarily disappointing stay,"Having stayed at the InterContinental Dublin before, when we returned to the city for a 2 night break, I picked this hotel again. Unfortunately, this stay did not live up to my experiences of my previous stay, nor of my experiences of the umpteen InterContinental Hotels I have stayed in around the world over the years.

We were travelling as 3 adults (wife and sister-in-law). As a Spire Ambassador of the IHG rewards club, our room had been upgraded from an InterContintental Deluxe Room to a King Contemporary. The original booking showing 3 adults with a choice of a king bed or two queens, subject to availability. The King Contemporary on their website shows a maximum of two guests allowed in the room.

After a rather slow check in experience and lengthy wait for the room key, we were surprised to get to our room to find one bed. A man arrived shortly after with a massive rollaway bed. How it would fit in the room without us all climbing over each other seemed was beyond us and seemed to fall on deaf ears! We were advised that to change to a two bedded queen room would cost another 55 Euros. Odd, given our original booking stated two queen beds in the room blurb and my Spire Ambassador status should ""upgrade"" us to something better, not worse! We were happy to stay in what we had booked if it meant two proper beds.

The guest relations manager, Sarah, kindly sorted this out for us, and when we returned later that evening we had been moved to a two bedded queen room with no charge. It seemed to take far too much effort to get this resolved.

Unfortunately, for our second night, we were still in a King Contemporary room, they had only amended the first night! Here we go again I thought....Thankfully, when we spoke to a member of the reception team, they kept us in the same room without any fuss and apologies for the confusion.

Our room rate included a lovely bottle of champers. Unfortunately, the ice had melted in the ice bucket and the ice machine on our floor was broken. We called Instant Service for more ice but it never showed.

It's a shame that a simple error in service, that took too long and too much effort to resolve, marred what is otherwise a great hotel. The building, the furnishings, room quality were all excellent. If we had been staying in a Holiday Inn Express or similar then you can accept some failings in service, but at a 5 star hotel with the nightly rate into the few hundreds of Euros, it was unacceptable.

I would definitely think twice about staying at the InterContinental in Dublin again, particularly if you have a decent status in the IHG Rewards Club. I may well try the Holiday Inn Express in the center of town next time.",2,2018,05,27
205,Great stay,"Just want to thank all of the staff at the intercontinental who made our stay so we enjoyable, definitley would stay again, Jaqcueline at breakfast was so friendly and Tallisa who checked us out was so lovely and professional",5,2018,05,25
205,50th Birthday,"The Dublin Intercontinental, by far out beats any of the IHG hotels in Europe. The service, cleanliness, food and atmosphere are second to none. 
I spent 4 days here and in that time I’ve been along the coast line from Sea Point to Britas Beach, all of them are clean and jaw dropping. Glendalough Wicklow is also a must, if you like scenery you won’t be disappointed. The location of the hotel makes travelling south very accessible by car. If you want to go into the city there is also a train service which is about €4 and it takes about 10 minutes.",5,2018,05,24
205,Always a pleasure.,"We stay here regularly as it is always a memorable experience. We use it as a base when visiting family in Dublin and down through the years we have so many wonderful memories at the hotel. The staff are exceptional in the welcome we receive and nothing is too much trouble. We have stayed in various rooms over the years and the decor and attention to detail is beautiful. Breakfast is fabulous, great selection and the Lobby Lounge has a comprehensive menu to choose from. Some times we check in and don't leave the hotel for a day as it's quite easy to spend a day here, a nice leisurely breakfast, visit the spa, light lunch in the Lobby Lounge and have family over in the afternoon. We LOVE it, that's why we keep going back. Keep up the great work Team InterContinental. See you soon.",5,2018,05,16
205,A tale of two rooms,"Stayed 2 nights end of March and then 3 nights over the Easter weekend at the start and end of a road trip around Ireland.

The hotel is sumptuous. Our first room was a newer refurbished executive junior suite. The second room was a full suite but did lack a little of the wow of the newly refurbished rooms. Both rooms upgraded from what I had booked with IHG ambassador status.

Both stays were faultless. The breakfast room is a delightful place to start the day. The small pool and spa are great and service throughout is excellent. 

At first my partner was disappointed by the hotel’s location as it is a good 50 minutes walk from the centre of Dublin but the Dart train is a few minutes away and the area around the hotel has some great bars and restaurants so the location is very good and s short drive from the port too.

An excellent choice for a Dublin stay.

205,Very good,"3 night weekend stay, really very good, with small room for improvement in some areas.
The good
We stayed in an excellently appointed Junior Suite, spacious, nicely furnished, nice bathroom, huge comfortable bed.
The room service was first rate, food portions were generous and sensibly priced.
Nice enough pool (though a poolside shower would have been nice), gym looked well equipped but didn't have time to try it.
All staff encountered were helpful.

Room for improvement!
No Club Lounge!!! Seriously, is this the only Intercontinental in the world without a Club Lounge? Come on guys, get it sorted.
Lobby drinks service. 2 nights in a row I had to go to the bar to get drinks after we sat waiting for more than 10 minutes for someone to serve us.
The in-room entertainment was a bit lacking, we had a nice enough TV that was OK for viewing in our seating area but too far away to see properly from the bed. Either a bigger TV or another TV would have been nice. The channel choice was largely Freesat/Freeview with a couple of Sky sports channels. No decent movie channels (I don't count Film 4 as a great choice) and no in-house movie provision.

All in all a nice hotel and would certainly go back.",4,2018,05,01
205,Luxury in Dublin,Our family loved this hotel. Everything about the intercontinental is exquisite. We were greeted warmly with early check in after a long flight and jet lag. The breakfast is to die for. What a beautiful place.,5,2018,04,30
205,Excellent ,"Great 5 star hotel with 5 star service. Welcome very good. Room very comfortable. Lovely bathroom towels. Very quiet.  Nice pool and spa and lovely bar and lobby. Didn’t eat there but dining room looked lovely. 
",5,2018,04,30
205,2 Great Stays in one week!,"We spent our first two nights and our last night at this great hotel.
First of all Hayle at check in was perfect. She found us the perfect suite and made every request effortless and really made us feel welcome.
Barry and Rhys at the concierge desk went well out of their way to support some travel arrangement requests and they did it with true professionalism!
We loved the location, walking to restaurant like the French Paradox and the Girl and Goose and Rolys, as well as local pubs like Mary Macs.
We traveled to Galway and Waterford in the middle of the week, then returned to this hotel.
We stored some luggage and it was al handled perfectly.
Being a Hotel GM, I can tell you that this is a place you will enjoy, remarry because of the service.
Also the rooms are spot on and very comfortable.",5,2018,04,29
205,A Five Star Hotel in the quiet residential and embassy part of Dublin,"An extremely comfortable hotel (previously Four Seasons) in a quiet part of Dublin, not far from downtown. The rooms are large and comfortable, the staff is attentive and polite, all amenities including the SPA and Swimming Pool are there to make life easier.",5,2018,04,28
205,highly recommend hotel,"Just back from a night away at intercontinental hotel.

This is a beautiful hotel with excellent service and attention to detail well worth  five star . 

On my stay in hotel we were greeted by General Manager Mr. Logue who was on his daily check of hotel , He and his staff could not do enough for us to make our stay in hotel such a memorable  one.   Not many general Managers would stop and have time to talk to you as they have such a busy schedule .  very impressive .hotel.

We will defiantly stay longer on our next visit",5,2018,04,26
205,Great Stay in Dublin,We stayed here for 2 nights at the start of an 8-day trip around Ireland. What a great hotel! The location is perfect for walking downtown (about 1.5 miles) to the heart of Dublin. The entire staff in the hotel is professional and friendly. I easily could have stayed there for a week. I would highly recommend this hotel if you are in Dublin...you won't be disappointed.,5,2018,04,22
205,Good business hotel,"The hotel was what you would expect from a respected brand like the InterContinental in an old European city.  It was fairly old but felt quaint and certainly comfortable enough for business travelers.  

The breakfast buffet was good and the staff generally friendly.  

For a 5-star hotel, however, it was missing those ""extra"" touches, like toothpaste and toothbrushes in the room. ",4,2018,04,21
205,Fabulous hotel as always,"Had a lovely stay, even though it was a work trip, was totally relaxed in hotel. Service, Food bedrooms for a 5 star and more standard. The team from porter to reception to bar and seasons restaurant staff as well as housekeeping gve excellent customer care. Made feel very welcome by all. ",5,2018,04,19
205,Super hotel!,"Beautifully decorated lounge, bar, restaurant areas and we stayed in a fabulous suite (thank you for the upgrade :-)..). Professional, friendly and efficient staff who were always willing to help with a smile & genuine attention to your needs.
We particularly liked the welcome in the breakfast room during our stay - (apologies I don't remember the name of the lady) and food during our stay was delicious - from breakfast, snacks at the bar & the charity lunch we attended (400 people served super food is not easy - so congratulations for that!!).
The best way for me to describe this hotel is that it captures the real essence of Irish hospitality! Cannot recommend it highly enough!! Congratulations to the General Manager and all his team!",5,2018,04,17
205,Intercontinental Dublin,"Beautiful hotel 
Thank you Alex for the lovely welcome on check in and the concierge too who was so helpful with luggage.
Was so impressed with the fabulous room.
Stayed for one night 
There was a few functions on and it seemed to be short staffed so service was extremely slow in the evening.
So that was a bit of a disappointment.
But still a beautiful hotel. Wish I stayed another night!!!
Thank you 
",4,2018,04,15
205,Lunch after a somber occasion,"Joined my extended family for lunch after a funeral. Soup and sandwiches served in a great dining room. Self service type arrangement which worked well. Soup might have been a little hotter but this was a minor grumble. The wait staff, reception staff and door staff were very pleasant and friendly. Don’t know about the accommodation but the hotel is beautiful. Parking was free and easily sorted. Will I be back; perhaps if back in Dublin. Would highly recommend it. ",4,2018,04,13
205,Nice and fashionable ,"Super service, nice bar, breakfast buffet could have been a bit better, but the cant really put my finger on what I didn’t like about it, as the food was good 
The room are great and I mean the beds are just the best hotel beds I have sleeped in for a long time ",5,2018,04,12
205,Afternoon tea. ,"It’s Always a pleasure to go to the intercon.  They have amazing Staff and a truly fabulous setting. 
The afternoon tea is priced very well, in saying that we asked for a little bit more cake and they charged 11€ extra for a few pieces? A bit rich don’t you think? 
The staff didn’t explain this to us before the bill arrived. 
That aside I still love going to the intercon. 
I look forward to my next visit.",4,2018,04,12
205,City trip,"We had a lovely stay at the Intercontinental in Dublin Haley on reception was marvellous she checked us in so polite and friendly and she spent time explaining all the different tours we could do nothing was to much trouble for her and always with a smile. We asked for a late check out and she was marvellous she made us feel so welcome.
The room was lovely and spacious we went for a superior king,the bathroom was spacious and the toiletries devine there was tea and coffee facilities and two bottles of complementary mineral water a day.
Breakfast was excellent.
The only thing is you need a taxi to the city centre or it's a half hour walk.
Overall a fantastic stay would highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2018,04,11
205,"Quiet, lovely hotel but some disappointments","The location was pretty, fairly convenient, and quiet.
Pros of the hotel:
	• Comfortable bed and pillows
	• Nice bathroom and bathtub 
	• Spacious room with a step-out balcony
	• Plush slippers and nice robes
	• Large quality TV
Cons of the hotel:
	• As an Intercontinental Ambassador, I am supposed to receive a free “ Pay-TV film.” The reality was that they didn’t have Pay TV service, so I had to go downstairs to look through their DVD collection. It was a small, old, crappy selection. (See picture.)
	• Disappointing room service experience. The woman who took our order didn’t speak English well.  We had to repeat ourselves many times, and we made sure she knew that the order was for 2 people.  Still, they brought a tray with water and silverware for 1 person.  Plus the Caesar salad was supposed to come with a garlic ciabatta, but it didn’t.
	• Hotel robe had a large blood stain
	• There was a loose piece of hardware just sitting against the window
	• No light for the toilet room
	• Tiny showerhead with low water pressure",4,2018,04,08
205,Nice Hotel,"Stayed over the Easter weekend, we were promised that our room would be ready for us arriving at 1.30pm but they were very busy and we didn’t get checked in till 4pm, not a problem as the lounge area is very nice.
Our room was lovely although we were a little disappointed with the frayed bath mat & an uneven bed it didn’t spoil a lovely weekend ",4,2018,04,06
205,Impressive.,"World class hotel that ticks all the boxes. Professional service from people who know how to run a hotel. Very impressed.  Almost faultless. Stayed in a junior suite for a week. We stayed in March but the Air Con/Heating worked perfectly. And independently from other rooms. A/C not switched off until the summer like many British/Irish hotels. Impressive restaurant and bars, Sadly missed the pool. Could have had bigger TVs in the room but everything else was fine. Internet speeds in the room constantly between 900 Mbps and near 1Gbps download, 650Mbps upload. Room service menu extensive and every dish we tried was excellent except one. The Dubliner was disappointing and not much more than a couple of toasted sandwiches on top of each other. Expected more. Plenty of free bottled water, and I mean plenty. Couple of smaller bottles and four x 1.5L bottles when we arrived. Good car park with resident Leprechauns, see photograph if you don't believe me. Didn't see any while we were there but now I know where they live. Hotel is located in the Ballsbridge area of town, where most embassies are plus some stadiums and events hosting venues. About two or three miles from the town centre. Some restaurants and pubs nearby. Very nice architecture variety in nearby streets. Big (Tesco) supermarket less than a mile straight down the road.",5,2018,04,06
205,Great family room for a short city break,We stayed in one of the executive suites with an extra bed put in for one of our kids. The room was really quiet at the end of the corridor and the hotel is just a short 20 minute walk into the city center ina really pleasant part of the city. The pool and spa were great with no time restrictions on when the kids could use the pool which was really handy. A super hotel.,5,2018,04,04
205,Superb hotel,Just finished an all too brief stay at this wonderful hotel. The rooms are spacious and very comfortable. The staff friendly and attentive and the facilities excellent. Really enjoyed my stay - well done InterContinental Dublin and keep up the good work! ,5,2018,04,04
205,"Once again, Excellent!!","We stayed in this hotel last year and we were very impressed so for my wife's birthday we thought we go back, and i'm pleased to say we weren't disappointed! Once again we were greeted by very friendly and helpful staff making us feel very welcome. The room was lovely and comfortable, with all the usual amenities. The area where this hotel is situated is lovely (Ballsbridge), only 10 mins from Dublin town centre, but also has lovely restaurants/shops nearby. The food inside the hotel is excellent and the bar and sitting area very warm and relaxing. The overall experience was excellent and we'll definitely go back in the future.",5,2018,04,04
205,Must be the best Hotel in Dublin,"It was a double Birthday celebration for us over the  Easter Weekend . 
Perfect from the  moment we arrived .  We were lucky to meet the GM Nicky at reception when we arrived as he was meeting all his guests wishing us a very happy Easter . We also saw him checking all the tables in the lobby and restaurant throughout our stay .  The Gourmet meal in the Restaurant was outstanding and service to match . 
I had the best Spa treatments I ever experienced and will certainly return for that alone .
This must be the best Hotel in Dublin , rooms were Amazing and service impeccable.  I would highly recommend you experience this Hotel .
I  will definitely be back .",5,2018,04,03
205,"Fabulous Hotel, extremely friendly and helpful staff",The hotel staff did a truly excellent job of making our stay a very pleasant experience. I will definitely stay here when I'm back to Dublin. The atmosphere is warm and friendly. The hotel staff was very helpful in obtaining restaurant reservations that I was unable to book directly.,5,2018,04,03
205,Lovely experience,We were in the Intercontinental over the weekend and we had a thoroughly enjoyable time. Massive thank you to Robert on reception who made us feel settled and at home. I recommend the Espresso Martini at the bar. We will be back.,5,2018,04,03
205,Disappointed,"Having been a regular at this hotel some years ago it has certainly aged and is in need of updating. Service is friendly but not 5Star it does not come close to a hotel like the Dorchester. When we asked what channel the Leinster Rugby match was playing we were advised to check the Sky Sports Channels however it was not showing via sky it was only available via BTsport which appeared to be news to the staff at the concierge desk. We founf out at checkout we could have watched it in the Ice Bar however this was not suggested to us on the day so we reluctantly watched the match on our phones!
Breakfast was a disaster! 10.30am 30mins before it closed there were very few options available in the buffets simple things like plates were not available. We decided to order off the menue the bagel and cream cheese was served minus the cheese(no explination given) pancakes and maple syrup were served without the syrup again no explination was given. When this was raised with the server we were told that they had run out of both! But by this time we had lost patients and left the breakfast room hungry! It was a very disappointing experience. Especially considering that when we previously stayed at the hotel the breakfast was incredible we are shocked that the standard had dropped so badly!",2,2018,04,03
205,Exceptional !,My partner and I stayed at the Intercontinental Dublin last weekend.  From the moment we arrived we were treated to a truly 5 star service. We had both booked treatments in the Spa which was heavenly.  I have to mention my therapist Christina who was quite literally superb.  We had afternoon tea in the lounge and it was glorious and our room was stunning. We dined in our room for a change and the steaks were sublime. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough! Overall an exceptional experience and a special thank you to Ciara who ensured we had a smooth check out.,5,2018,04,02
205,Incredible Irish hospitality at the Intercontinental.,"Having stayed at a number of other 5* hotels in Dublin, and many other Intercontinentals around the world, our recent stay at Intercontinental Dublin has set a new benchmark and is one of our favourite stays anywhere ever.

The hotel has managed to set a perfect balance of Irish hospitality and a warm Irish welcome with an international standard of service and professionalism.  Arriving in Easter week, the hotel was tastefully decorated with some fun elements which created a relaxed atmosphere.  Our checkin facilitated by the wonderful Jane was exceptional, she was clearly knowledgeable about every element of the hotel and brought a genuine and personal touch to the arrival process, including recognising our friends birthday during our stay.  

Whilst we waited for our room, we more than happy to relax in the spa, have a light lunch and enjoy a perfect gin and tonic.  We found prices very reasonable with a fantastic range of gins served by Cher who maintained the friendly and professional service.

We had 2 rooms, one suite and one deluxe room.  Both rooms were very spacious, well furnished and designed.  The suite again was exceptional - over 70m2, 4 huge windows and a large balcony - definitely befitting a special occasion.  However the deluxe rooms are more than adequate. Our friend was welcomed with a birthday treat which she really appreciated.

However, what really sets the Intercontinental Dublin apart from the others is their breakfast.  Definitely one of our most memorable breakfasts.  So relaxed, so professional, that we spent almost 2 hours watching, eating, and chilling. The lady who manages the breakfast room is again exceptional.  She saw everyone’s needs well before they knew what they wanted themselves and she wasn’t shy about getting her hands dirty herself.  This exemplified the whole hotel - great staff who obviously enjoy working here and work together well.  Why would you consider staying anywhere else?",5,2018,03,31
205,Tainted by extortionate parking fees,"I recently stayed here and loved the hotel, our room was beautiful, and our breakfast the next morning was excellent with alot of choice. However, we were left with a sour taste on check out when charged €18 for parking overnight in their carpark. I find this completely unacceptable, especially after paying €430 for our room for 1 night. There was no prior warning of this cost, and no apology made for this charge. 
I understand given the location of the hotel they need barrier parking but I think guests of the hotel should not be charged. Or at least made aware when checking in if they have parked. 
Although a small value compared to the cost to stay here it did taint what was a lovely stay prior to this. 
I had planned to stay again in July, but have changed my mind due to this.",3,2018,03,28
205,Lovely Hotel,"I stayed here in March 2018. It was the 2nd time here and we stayed here for our anniversary. The whole stay was terrific. As I am signed up to the Ambassador program, an upgrade was offered on check in. The room was really nice with views over the RDS. Everything was as it should be in a 5 star hotel. Th staff were friendly and courteous and the bar man on that evening was particularly good at making cocktails (so my wife tells me!!). I the morning Charles one of the managers in the breakfast room, found out we were there as part of our anniversary and gave us both a glass of champagne. These are little touches that make this sort of stay memorable. So overall I would strongly endorse this hotel!",5,2018,03,26
205,Beautiful Hotel,"Stayed here for work in March 2018 and while the building is beautiful and my room was excellent I was somewhat underwhelmed by the experience. 

No real greetings by staff, no sign of concierge staff or porters to get a taxi. 

The room was very large and spacious and very luxurious with an enormous bathroom. Very much 5star standard and more. 

Might need to give it another chance at some stage. ",4,2018,03,24
205,Anniversary night,Beautiful hotel and grounds. Staff are very helpful and attentive. The room was amazing as wee as the pool and jacuzzi downstairs. Breakfast was scrumptious. From the moment you pull up and the doorman meets you gets your luggage and has a bell hop bring them up to checking out and getting a cab during an unexpected snow we were treated like royalty. ,5,2018,03,18
205,Room for improvement ,"Having just returned from a much anticipated stay at the Intercontinental I have to say I was pretty underwhelmed. We booked a King Deluxe with a view & according to the website we could expect ‘spectacular views over Dublin city skyline , landscaped garden & leafy neighbourhood ‘ Not quite what we got. While the lack of a view was disappointing, the room was comfortable & very clean my main gripe with this Hotel is the service lets it down its just not 5 star. Our server at lunch was unable to get the cork out of the bottle of wine we ordered, & that evening we stood for more than 5 minutes along with others at the hotel bar before a bartender appeared from the back. Breakfast needs a major shake up , the hot food was served buffet style & not cooked to order, you even have to make your own toast , at the prices charged in this hotel this in my view is not acceptable . The management needs to take at look at the amount of junior staff it relies on to deliver its direct customer service, their lack of 5 star training is obvious (and not their fault). The management of this Hotel need to stand up & be counted, I have stayed in far better hotels in Dublin, for an awful lot less. ",3,2018,03,17
205,Wonderful Hospitality,"I met a friend in Dublin for a quick girls trip that turned in to a week snowed in during the “beast from the east”.  The country shut down and I am so thankful we waited it out at the Intercontinental!  We were able to extend our stay without trouble and the staff never lost their sense of goodwill and hospitality.  We were never hungry, cold, uncomfortable or without WiFi!  I don’t know what went on behind the scenes but it was a refuge for us.  Thank you!",5,2018,03,14
205,Best Hotel in Dublin,"We have just returned form Dublin having spent a wonderful weekend at the Intercontinental. The level of service from the moment that we arrived was first class, as it was throughout the weekend. The staff make this hotel a most enjoyable experience as they are always friendly and professional. The rooms are very spacious , with beautiful decor and breakfast in our room or in the restaurant was superb. The lounge area is always excellent for food and is a nice place to relax for pre or post dinner drinks. We look forward to returning soon.",5,2018,03,14
205,Family break,"Super break and I really love the touch of having two mini bathrobes in the room when we arrived and there was no issue with children being allowed in the pool,which is not been always the case in other hotel we have stayed in. I only had one slight annoy issue and this was with a large delay in getting a table for breakfast as a lot of people had arrived down late to breakfast. I think that while they where trying to best to get everyone seated they need to make sure that the there is always someone to greet you when you arrive to the breakfast room as I waited with my family for a number of minutes before someone return to assist us and I wasn't sure before this if  we should wait there or just take the fist table we saw that was vacant. Outside of this small issue we enjoy our stay so much we are due to return in the March for another relaxing break.",5,2018,03,13
205,Absolutely Amazing,"A real treat - unfortunately could only enjoy the hotel for 1 night this time but cannot recommend the hotel & staff highly enough. Beautiful spacious rooms, excellent facilities - a real 5* experience",5,2018,03,13
205,"Opulence, exquisite - a luxurious treat!",Sampled afternoon tea here recently for a special occasion.  The presentation was faultless.  The tray was enthralling with the most divine food.  There was a vast range of teas to choose from.  The staff were most pleasant and helpful.  What a wonderful way to spend the afternoon!,5,2018,03,12
205,STILL THE BEST SERVICE EVEN ON A RUGBY WEEKEND⭐️,"This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel. It is just two hours from Belfast so we decided to stay overnight and watch the rugby. We arrived just before the match and the hotel was buzzing. The Outdoor Consierge took the car and looked after it for us. We checked in and as it was a late booking there was only a junior suite available. It was very cosy and well appointed as you can imagine. We went down to the Bar to have a late lunch where Jacqui was there to help us. Even though the hotel was so busy with people having lunch and drinks before the match, we were very well looked after. We did go into Dublin and I was sorry we hadn’t stayed in the hotel and enjoyed the restaurant as everywhere was so busy. We went down for breakfast before leaving and there was Jacqui in the dining room. Looking after us again. Nothing was a problem, we had a delicious breakfast with a lovely view of the garden. Checkout was very efficient as was leaving our valet parking. It was only an overnight but felt longer as it was a lovely suite and a happy time made even better by the very attentive staff especially Jacqui.",5,2018,03,10
205,"Posh, luxurious, epic!","We stayed at this beautiful hotel just before Christmas. On arrival we were upgraded to a superior rooms. The rooms are spacious and luxurious. You will be spoilt with complimentary Locci'tane products in your bathroom. 
The food is decadent. Lots to choose from for vegetarian and fish lovers. 
Breakfast is served with the best view of the courtyard. Try to get a room that is on the higher floors to get a view of the city. 
Be sure to do the high tea, it is definitely worth the price you pay.",5,2018,03,08
205,Pleasant Surprise Stay,"We recently were stuck in Dublin due to snow storm which closed the airport for several days. Our 2 hour layover ended up to be 4 days in Dublin. We were very lucky to get one of only a handful of rooms left in the city. We were fortunate it was at The Intercontinental. It's everything you would expect from a professional Hotel. The city and transportation were all shut down. If your going to get stuck in a hotel, we were fortunate it was this one. The hotel is beautifully designed and managed. The staff are attentive, very friendly and accommodating. The food and wine list is very good. We have only good things to say about the hotel. I recommend it for either a vacation or business stay.",5,2018,03,07
205,If your looking for that little bit of Luxury then look no further.,"Well after lots of travelling over the years in the music business and staying in an array of Hotels & Motels in all honesty this is probably as good as it gets on the luxury front baring the odd Boutique hotel, i stayed here with my family recently for a long weekend and like all their other hotels i have had the privilege of staying in the standard is always high on every level in fact i would go as far as saying there's an old cliche "" you get what you pay for "" well in this case you get exactly what you get! 
If your looking for that little bit of Luxury then look no further",5,2018,03,03
205,Wonderful stay,"I’m not sure how anyone has written poor reviews of this hotel.  I can only imagine it being related to an individual customer service type issue because the hotel itself and it’s offerings are wonderful.  I’ve stayed here now three times for business and each time was very nice.  Only complaint would be that in December the hotel was overrun with people due to holiday parties.  The hotel is situated in the nicest section of Dublin it seems.  You are walking distance to a few nice pubs, an Italian restaurant and some other stores and restaurants.  Rooms are clean and spacious enough, bathrooms are more on the luxurious side with granite and marble and beds are soft and comfortable as long as firm isn’t your preference.  Food was good, though expensive and the service is great.  This most recent visit we had some fairly loud neighbors partying in the next room but I believe it was a necessity as everyone is stuck here due to a severe, multi day snow storm.  My opinion is if you can get this hotel at a reasonable rate, it’s well worth it.",5,2018,03,01
205,Great hotel,"Highly recommend, great location, catch the dart into town, pool, spa, gym, lovely rooms, amazing breakfast, friendly helpful staff, stayed here for Rugby ground, walking distance, lots of bars and restaurants ",5,2018,02,25
205,On Point,"The InterContinental is a fabulous hotel, everything is of top class quality and everything is looked at down to the last detail. Staff are always only too willing to help you with anything you might need. Food is great and there is a nice relaxed atmosphere around the hotel! Definitely recommend. ",5,2018,02,18
205,Perfect stay,"We stayed here on our anniversary and the Hotel was amazing from start to finish. From our first welcome from Lukasz to Check-in with Manny at the desk, the room was really nice and had a great view towards the Dublin mountains. Relaxing for a swim and sauna before dinner in seasons restaurant which was absolutely superb, with unobtrusive yet individual service from (2 more) gentlemen called Lukasz, and Jorge and Stefano(?) the sommelier was really knowledgeable about the wines on offer. Our compliments also to all of the chefs in the restaurant who laid out a wonderful repast, and as a special treat brought out a slate board with happy 2nd anniversary calligraphied in white chocolate and some  small delicious chocolates! and we were undecided on dessert or the cheese board they brought us out a small sampler of the cheeses after dessert which was really nice. Jacqueline and Cesar in the restaurant for breakfast were really welcoming and the selection of food was amazing and of really good quality! Cannot recommend this place enough and they really went out of their way to make it a special anniversary treat!",5,2018,02,17
205,Great visit,"Myself and my uncle when we stay in Ballsbridge Clayton usually visit here for a night cap drink in nice surroundings and listen to piano.

For a Monday night there was no music however the service was good, the price for drinks was reasonable given the hotel 

Highly recommend for a nice drink with friends, family ",5,2018,02,13
205,Outstanding,"Yes previous reviewers have been spot on about this hotel. 
An utterly wonderful experience from the initial greeting & check-in (we were lucky to secure an upgrade from a Junior Suite to an Executive one) thru to an extraordinary breakfast, definitely the best we've experienced in Europe.
We indulged ourselves in the pool & spa on the final morning and ended our holiday considerably more relaxed than when we arrived.
The staff, all of them, are so friendly and helpful that you wonder why it is so difficult for other places to get this right.
Would we go back? Most definitely yes but (and yes there is a but) we would need to have thought through our itinerary first.
We chose our stay to be the first weekend in Feb deliberately to attend the Leopardstown Racing Festival. We thought choosing a hotel to the south of the city centre would facilitate our getting to & from the course. We couldn't have been more wrong. Getting in by taxi no problem, getting back, a major one. No taxis were waiting at the course and very few were seemingly in the area. There really was no solution. We discussed it with the hotel (both before we arrived and after the first day), we discussed it with various taxi drivers and I had researched the internet. A big black mark for the racecourse. But maybe the hotel should consider providing a shuttle (partner with another hotel or 2 if needs be) but something needs to be done. We'd be more than happy to pay a decent sum for the knowledge that we could get back! If you're in the centre of town you can get the Luas but there is no bus or rail facility to get you back to Ballsbridge. So simply put, being nearer to the track (4.5miles) was an enormous disadvantage. We'd be forced to look for a Dublin central hotel next time (if racing).
We also needed taxis for each of our trips into town in the evening. So that was 10 taxis at a cost of just under €250 for the 3 days (and that did not include airport transfer!) a not inconsiderable sum. But really it was the concern about getting a taxi from the racecourse that provided most stress. I'd have to assume guests going racing either had their own cars or were being picked up by friend's.
A suggestion: Hotel provide transport and charge each guest €10 per trip, 'cos It's not the money that's the issue but the fear of being stranded for a couple of hours! (& investigate getting together with another hotel if necessary).
Hotel: Facilities, staff, breakfast (wife says OMG) exemplary.
Value: Excellent
Location: Near plenty of things (Dublin's not large) just not particularly convenient for the places we had booked to eat at nor the racecourse.
We didn't dine at lunch or dinner.
So 5 stars is an utterly fair score to award. The hotel deserves it.
But our circumstances mean that we'd almost certainly  have to look elsewhere next time. And for that I'd be regretful!

205,Highly recommend this Hotel,"I would highly recommend this hotel.  Got upgraded to a beautiful room, spacious and beds very comfortable.   I can honestly say that staff in this hotel are amazing.  They know how to look after their clients.  Excellent customer service from reception, room service and breakfast room.  Thanks to all for making kids mid term break! Hopefully we will be back soon.",5,2018,02,11
205,A very comfortable stay,"This is the 2nd time I have stayed here on business and I would return again. It has everything needed for a good night's sleep. The room and amenities are comfortable, the public rooms are lovely and parking is easy.
I had dinner and breakfast in the hotel and both were very nice. The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is that the service for dinner was a bit haphazard - even though all the staff were delightful.",4,2018,02,04
205,Recommended 100%,35 min away from the airport & 35€ aprox prepared If you get on/off a taxi. Southern area location with some Irish pub & Italian Restaurant at 400mt. Very good service & attention. Room 113 superp but needs stronger pillows. Breakfast enjoyable. Gym & swim pool fantastic. Business area really nice with big space. ,5,2018,02,03
205,one night,"OK . It is a 5* but most 4* match it .
Breakfast choice and quality very disappointing . Continental bfast in a Dublin 4* ( half the room price) was far superior and cheaper.
This makes up the characters to 200 + !",4,2018,02,01
205,"First Class, lives up to its high tripadvisor ratings. Truly five star","This hotel excels in delivering the five star service in every aspect. The reception staff and very efficient, courteous and friendly. Rooms are large and very well appointed with everything you would need. The bed, a queen size was especially comfortable with terrific bedding. (We have a Savoir bed at home and this was as comfortable.....).
Full bath and separate shower cubicle is always appreciated. Free bottled water and Wi-Fi.
Breakfast has an excellent selection for both full Irish or continental.
Afternoon tea and coffee in the lounge area is relaxing and once again the staff were efficient and discreet.
We left our luggage with the concierge whilst we spend the day I Dublin sightseeing. 
Overall nothing to fault this hotel at all. It delivers every aspect of its five star rating and I would happily recommend to family and friends alike.",5,2018,01,30
205,BEYOND FIRST CLASS IN DUBLIN,"Located in the top quiet residential area of Ballsbridge, this hotel continues to exceed all my expectations. Located in a very nice historical building (Former Four Seasons), the rooms are big, spacious, very well kept. The bed pillows are so soft you fall asleep instantly. The breakfast is very good, the staff very friendly. the wifi works perfectly, the spa and fitness area excellent. Ideal for business or a city break in Dublin. It s simply the very best.",5,2018,01,29
205,Love this hotel!,Very relaxing stay! Everything was perfect. From booking the night stay to checking out. Very professional & lovely staff. Had beautiful dinner in restaurant. Breakfast was delicious. Can’t wait to stay here again!,5,2018,01,28
205,Great staff,"We stayed in the intercontinental just after Christmas for a city break. All of the staff we met were excellent, very friendly and helpful, in particular Zavi head bar man in the whiskey bar. He makes a great gin, has an excellent knowledge of what he’s serving and above all he is a real people person who can deal with all types of situations. Will definitely be back, thanks for everything.",5,2018,01,20
205,Excellent!,Really enjoyed our 2 night weekend stay. Nothing was too much to ask for the staff who were brilliant and the room could not be faulted. Atmosphere was relaxed but very professional. Would recommend to a friend.,5,2018,01,16
205,Cork couple,Great hotel. Excellent staff... nothing was any trouble and were all very helpful .  Nice food available in the lounge . Nice leisure centre. Good size bedrooms. Breakfast was exceptional with great friendly service. Will stay again. ,5,2018,01,15
205,ntercontinental Dublin,"Feeling of luxury and being made feel special; beautiful surroundings. Short walking distance to other great restaurants and to parks and only 5 minutes by cab to the centre of Dublin (shops, galleries and theatre)",5,2018,01,15
205,Fabulous on every level ,"Stayed 3 nights here. Solo female business traveller. Hotel was fabulous in all departments. The first room I was offered was not to my liking but when I talked to reception I was moved immediately and without fuss. Second room was perfect. Staff were ALL lovely. Special shout out to Tara on reception who was very helpful and to the absolute delightful Donal, the pianist. Such a gentleman and a brilliant pianist. The gym and as were top quality. I would say this was pretty much a perfect trip and would definitely recommend and definitely stay again. Thank you everyone",5,2018,01,13
205,Absolutely amazing hotel,"My husband and I stayed at the Intercontinental Dublin for 5 days from 12/28 through 1/2/18 and had one of the best hotel experiences of our lifetime. 
We are both frequent business travelers and also travel quite often to Europe for the holidays since we have family in London. We are fortunate to stay always at nice hotels with  good customer service, but what we've experience at the Intercontinental Dublin is truly unique. Everyone, absolutely everyone, is extremely nice and courteous but at the same time, utterly professional. They wake up every morning determined to make exceptional customer service the main goal of their day,  and they certainly deliver ! Tara at the front desk was just amazing and went the extra mile to ensure that we had the best experience - it was our wedding anniversary and she sent the most tasteful gift to our room. Jackie at the Seasons restaurant, Jorge and Nicolai at the Lobby bar, all the bell captains were just extremely nice and attentive, you can tell they  enjoy their work and making guests' stay special and memorable. The property is beautifully appointed and with exquisite decor. Some rooms have been refurbished treated to a sophisticated palette in tones of rich purple and green emerald - superb. The decor from Christmas was beautiful and tasteful. The hotel is located in a posh area of the city where embassies are - it's a bit far away from the city center but we prefer it that way - we don't want to be in highly touristic /traffic-congested areas. There are several buses just  around the corner that take you to the city and the train station is also close by. Location was really not a problem at all, we truly enjoy coming back to our 'sanctuary' after a busy day in the city.  Loved, loved this hotel and can't wait to come back.

205,NYE,"We had a great New Year’s Eve here. The pool and hot tub was very relaxing and great for unwinding over the holidays. The food was very well made too. The rooms were very comfortable and cozy, and the staff were kind and accommodating. Great visit!",5,2018,01,10
205,Just pure quality which leaves you knowing you have experienced something exceptional,"Have stayed at the Intercon Ballsbridge a number of times over the past few years. I have never been disappointed. Not even once. Just pure class throughout the stay - except for the quality of the food (which does require management attention). You will not find a better building, location, staff or experience in any of Dublin's wonderful hotels",5,2018,01,09
205,"Amazing Hotel, Staff and Service","From Check in to Check out we had a wonderful stay over the New Year. Front of house staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming and atmosphere was very festive. Nicola Hoey stood out in particular, sorting our problems out and giving us the most amazing upgrade ever, and was very friendly and willing to help. She's a credit to the hotel, as was every staff member we encountered. From Bartenders in the lobby lounge and the hostess on new year's eve in the lounge, all staff were incredibly helpful and friendly.",5,2018,01,08
205,Fabulous Hotel with Fantastic staff,"Stayed here in the newyear and yes it was all it should be. Fabulous rooms, Fantastic Staff and food
 Everything went fabulous, attention to detail is the big winner with me. Every department playing there part. Thank you ",5,2018,01,07
205,Had a Wonderful Stay @ the Intercontinental after a long day of travel.,"I stayed at the Intercontinental in Dublin after landing from a long day of flying.  I arrived early in the morning (8ish) and was able to check my bags but they did not have a room that I could check into ready yet. 

I ate breakfast at the in-house restaurant and it was decent.  It was a buffet style meal with a good, but not great spread.  They could have had a larger variety of items but what they did have was top quality.  The service was great and after some coffee and a hearty meal I was ready to explore the city until my room was ready. 

I arrived back at the hotel in the early afternoon and was promptly given my room key. The room was great as to be expected, it was on par with the level of quality that I have come to expect from the Intercontinental. 

Once in the room, I ordered room service, relaxed, watched tv, and fell asleep.  The beds are very comfortable and I awoke the next morning feeling refreshed and ready to start my adventure in Ireland.  

The next time that I am in Dublin, I will most certainly stay at the Intercontinental again.",5,2018,01,07
205,Great value luxury short stay in early January,"Perfect spot, especially if your visiting from overseas. Great location only 10mins from city by taxi or Dart. Stayed here when it was Four Seasons and gave it a five star rating then as the service under 4S mgmt was superb. The reduction in room rates in January makes this a fantastic value stay after the Christmas holiday, good spa, pool, gym, excellent room facilities and fabulous lounge and bar area for meeting old friends.",4,2018,01,07
205,You will welcomed and pampered in this beautiful place ,"We had a wonderful stay at the Intercontinental Hotel Dublin. I don't think it's possible to describe how beautiful this hotel is! From the moment you drive up you feel like royalty! All the staff are very warm and friendly.Try the freshly baked croissants in the morning with a fresh roasted coffee -
you'll think you are in Paris. All the staff are very warm and friendly with a special shout out to Aline,the server in the Lobby who took such good care of us. Thank you!",5,2018,01,06
205,Sadly... so disappointing,"Having had a number of excellent stays in this same hotel when it was a 'Four Seasons', my first trip under the new guise of Intercontinental ownership was such a disappointment by comparison. 

There was a very notable drop in the numbers of visible staff right from the first moment of arrival. A rushed valet attempted to trolley our bags and park the car simultaneously, although he was very customer oriented and polite. The reception had one person present, which for 3pm peak check in time was odd. The luxurious feeling of Five Star attendance and service, nowhere to be seen.

I booked the restaurant just off the foyer for an evening meal on check in, however my arrival to the empty restaurant was met with surprise from a member of staff that clearly had no note of the booking, I was brought out of the restaurant and given a menu at reception then shown back into the restaurant... which was still empty...7pm Friday?

Service during the meal was horrific, 4 members of staff took part, on asking one of them what dish he had just set in front of me his reply was ' I have no idea, I dont normally work in the restaurant, would you like me to get the manager'

On check out the invoice presented was considerably higher than the advertised price at booking. Inclusive elements where now being separately charged for at full rate, such as breakfast at 'walk in' retail price!! It took considerable time to have this made right, then, when I stepped away from the desk another exiting guest then began the same dispute over his bill. It is not luxury to have to double check paperwork and dispute charges.  

This hotel was once an annual treat to stay in, where even a single night felt luxurious and relaxing. As a guest you felt important and valued, and even though it was quite expensive you felt you were receiving value for money....on this visit I felt that I was an added strain upon an already panicking personnel. 

The building and its surroundings are still excellent, with a modern, opulent ambience. Excellent facilities and a quality feel to everything from the paper towels to the bath robes. Its so sad that it now feels that the staff are stretched and the details that make a 5 star experience are largely overlooked.

There are Travelodges that offer a more relaxed and professional customer experience than this, at one tenth of the price.

Check your bill, then double check the sum charged to your card and dine elsewhere",2,2018,01,03
205,Very nice hotel in a noble area,"We were staying in the Intercontinental Dublin over the New year and although it was at capacity the stay was very good apart from a few details.

The hotel itself is traditional and the rooms are pretty large as well as well decorated.

Breakfast selection was not as extensive as in other Intercontinentals but also cheaper - still good choice.

Bar area was solid with a lot of gins and traditional beers. Due to the high occupancy there was some waiting time and our order got mixed up.

I would however recommend a stay here!",5,2018,01,03
205,Top Class Hotel in every way,"I stayed at Intercontinental Dublin with my husband and toddler, we all had an amazing time. The hotel was decorated for Christmas and it was out of this world! The staff were so polite, friendly & helpful. The breakfast was lovely, The pool was beautiful. I honestly could not fault one thing, 5 star!  ",5,2018,01,02
205,Room in need of upgrade,"Painting is in progress in the bedrooms but unfortunately ours had not yet been done when we stayed. We stayed here as we could not get at room at our usual hotel, the Merrion. There was no comparison. The Merrion is in another league. ",3,2018,01,01
205,5 STAR...but,"Difficult to fault this exceptional property. We made short visit to the hotel for one night at New Year and were delighted with receptionist (Zoe?) and booking-in and double family room was fantastic. When we returned at night-time the bar and staff were also fantastic. My wife had also opportunity to use pool and gym and gave great report

...only disappointment and this if for the attention of the F&B Mgmt: 9.15am Breakfast service was a shambles I would hate to see what like at 10am. Greeter showed us to our table and that was it. Although we easily went to buffet (wife went to short order cook for omelette - great!) there was no one to take a tea/coffee order. The essential part of brekkie for an Irishman. This part of breakfast seemed to be hit and miss. Now we were asked four times had we ordered T/C - AFTER I chased down the greeter for same. The staff stood around fighting between themselves as to whose responsibility it was to arrange same. It is obvious that staff are tasked to do things - you clear off tables, you reset tables etc but NO ONE looking after guests. They should all be 'tasked' with looking after guests and do the other stuff in between. Short rant over...BEST WISHES TO ALL HOTEL STAFF FOR NEW YEAR. DOING GREAT JOB HERE.",5,2018,01,01
205,Exceptional !,"My partner and I have just returned from the most gorgeous stay at the Intercontinental Dublin. From the moment we arrived we were treated like we were the only guests at the hotel.  At every turn we were greeted by warm and friendly staff members who could not do enough for us.  We arrived early and had lunch in The Lobby Lounge  - beautifully prepared food and wonderfully festive surroundings.  The General Manager, Nicky Logue, was on hand working the room politely and welcomed us to the hotel with such genuine warmth which is lacking in so many hotels these days.  We had a fabulous room with wonderful views and the room service staff members were also superb.  We decided to eat in The Seasons Restaurant and once again both the food and the service were outstanding as was the breakfast service. Once again Nicky Logue was meeting guests personally ensuring everyone was looked after by his exceptional team. We will definitely be returning soon again cannot recommend this brilliant 5 star hotel highly enough to anyone considering a stay in Dublin.",5,2017,12,30
205,They certainly do Christmas very well !,"My husband and I normally travel to Dublin for a couple of days prior to Christmas to sample the festivities prior to the Big Day , this year we stayed at The Intercontinental Dublin on the 22nd and 23rd I am delighted we did so .
The accommodation was as to be expected of a five star establishment, of the highest standard and maintained so for the duration of our stay. My compliments to Ann in Housekeeping.
The breakfast buffet provided a myriad of beautifully prepared food really exceptional.The staff were welcoming pleasant and very helpful at directing us through the vast choice available. Thank you Harold and Linda.
Sorcha a very professional young lady and Manny saw to our every need at reservation and guest relations Thank you.
It was our intention to use the hotel as a base from which to sample the Christmas atmosphere of Dublin, but to be honest,apart from a quick shopping trip down Grafton Street we were enticed back to the lovely atmosphere of the hotel.
They certainly do Christmas very well!
The ambiance and particularly the Christmas cheer of each and every member of staff of which there were quite a few ,drew us back in from the bustling crowds. 
It certainly appears that every member of staff in that hotel realizes that paramount to the hotels success is the welfare of their guests , my compliments to the management for ensuring it is so.The evening meal on our first evening was exceptional the music atmosphere and genuine hospitality added enormously to my Christmas experience of Dublin .I cannot recommend the hotel and it’s staff highly enough. Thank you.",5,2017,12,30
205,Christmas Delight,"I have stayed at this hotel perhaps 10 times over last few years.  This past week was by far my most enjoyable visit.  The staff service better than ever, breakfast buffet elegant with excellent range of options, Ice Bar simply superb.  Our suite very comfortable and relaxing.

On Christmas Day, we were a table of 10 and were very well looked after.  So much so, some of our guests keen to understand when we could book for next year!

A big thanks to all the team at InterContinental Dublin for another memorable stay.",5,2017,12,29
205,Night away in Dublin,"Service was superb, breakfast was delicious. I wasn’t hugely impressed with the dinner from the set menu that was included in the deal. The bedroom was very nice, spotless bathroom with powerful shower and the pillows and linen were fabulous. Overall we had a lovely stay and the staff couldn’t have been more welcoming and helpful. ",4,2017,12,29
205,Wonderful for friends at dinner,"Wonderful food, service and atmosphere  in the Lobby.  Everyone enjoyed their meals and the service is first class.  Great friendly venue with a buzz.  The organic Irish salmon was excellent.  Really special especially at Christmas time.",5,2017,12,24
205,Very Average,"The hotel is a magnificent building in the heart of Ballsbridge. Very homely and well decorated for Christmas. Disappointingly our room (a suite) was very dated and needed refurbishment. I was also somewhat surprised, as a resident, to also be charged 18 Euros for parking my car at the hotel. ",3,2017,12,22
205,Super Hotel,"Hotel has great staff, is wonderfully located in Dublin 4. The rooms are top quality. The breakfast is just excellent. A great chef cooked the perfect omelettes for us. Such a mix of guests in the hotel from all over the world. The Ice bar is brilliant. Room Service was prompt. The only slight issue was that the fayre at the Function we attended was not as good as the year before. Soup was poor and the main course (beef) was only fair. Otherwise a great experience.  ",5,2017,12,20
205,Voucher buyers beware !,"Purchased a substantial voucher on the Inter Continental Dublin website as a Christmas gift for a business colleague recently.
I chose the option of having it emailed to the colleague and a copy to myself.
Neither email arrived.
3 days later and 3 emails to the Hotel Voucher Department and the Front Desk remain unanswered.
This is a serious lack of attention to detail.
What makes it worse is I had a similar problem with them 2 years ago which was sorted after considerable effort on my part.
Really sorry I didn't spend my money elsewhere.
These vouchers are still being advertised on National Radio so please sort the vouchers you have sold before selling anymore.",1,2017,12,20
205,A hotel as it should be...,"Exquisite...... enjoyed the gym, the quaint town just a stone throw away with all the shops. Would venture back anytime. Particularly like the attention to details unlike no other. Try the bfast, com continental to full affair, it's there.  ",5,2017,12,19
205,Unbelievable/fantastic/amazing,I can’t praise this hotel and the staff enough. The hotel it’s self was beautiful from the outside and from the inside. The staff Jane on Recepcion Cesar in the restaurant and bar and Barry and Nicolas were all amazing from start to finish. I have stayed in a lot of ihg hotels and I loved this one the most. The staff truly do make the hotel a fantastic place to visit. I just wish I could have stayed longer. I’m sure I will be back as soon as possible though. We had an upgrade for our anniversary and the room was amazing. We had an anniversary plate in our room that was also a really nice touch. I’ve tried to go away for this occasion a few times but had to keep cancelling due to work commitments but when we finally got away I was really surprised by the level of effort the hotel staff put in to make my stay the best it could be. So once again thank you all and I will be back soon ,5,2017,12,18
205,Fantastic Stay,"Fantastic Stay 

I have visited the this Hotel at least 5 times and it gets better each time.  I stay on business but decided to take my partner and daughter for a Christmas shopping weekend.  From the minute you arrive, the staff are the most pleasant individuals I’ve come across.  The management go all the way, Tony and Haraid are credit to their profession as these guys will and do the extra which makes each stay better than the last, which can’t be said for other 5 start Hotel's in Dublin.

The rooms are top class and I can issue a comparison from Europe to Dubai, this is my most favourite Hotel, yes all the other Hotels have been 5 star.  

This Christmas you can see that attention to detail is flawless and the traditional Christmas feel is amazing.  Our Daughter, 11 years old was so upset when we were leaving which shows how they cater for families and everyone is as important as the next guest.

Only one fault but not the Hotels fault, to the man who thought he could be abusive to the restaurant staff as they cleared you B/Fast table, your fault for wondering around. You need to be ashamed of your behaviour considering your age, but again, the Hotel dealt appropriately and with the upmost of professionalism……. They handled it better than I would have, it was a pity about this man and I hope I never come across him again but he was so insignificant and did not take away our enjoyment.

Sooooooooooooooooooooooooo happy.",5,2017,12,18

Great Culture in this vibrant City,cool bars, great restaurants, wonderful shopping.",4,2017,12,17
205,Beautiful hotel but left down by stagf,"Arrived at the hotel for an awards lunch to be told at 12 noon that there wasn’t a single room ready.  We had phoned ahead and explained that we would need our room to change before the lunch started and was assured that there would be no problem. Other guests at the function staying in different hotels had no such problem. The staff member at reception was very unsympathetic and unhelpful. 

After the function we went to collect our key and we were assured our bags had been sent up to the room. They hadn’t.  

At breakfast we had to ask for tea and coffee after being ignored by staff for over 15 mins!  Very disappointing from such a well regarded hotel. 

 The hotel itself and the room were fabulous ,  just left down by the service we received . 
",2,2017,12,15
205,Little bad things ruined it ,"Decided to do Dublin as visitor and booked into hotel with points 
Arrived early and room ready 
Headed off for the day and arrived back around 5.
Into bar and no Guinness, not a great start for a hotel in Dublin, on to the grey goose so, 2nd round ordered but did not arrive, waitress totally forget about us, enter Nicolas who saved the day, bar food nice,
Off to bed and room 411 was noisily all night, breakfast next day was a major problem. Bad service and residents had to wait for space as a lot of visitors for breakfast, 
On checkout we were asked about our stay and the manager overheard our conversation and spoke to us, agreed that breakfast was a problem and deducted it off the bill

Would like to visit again as I’m sure it was a one off bad day at the office 
I’m use IHG hotels a lot and love the brand.

205,Pre-Christmas Break,We stayed in the Intercontinental for a pre-Christmas break in one of their newly renovated Junior Suites with views over the City.  The hotel was full of Christmas atmosphere with some lovely trees and decorations.  The staff at the Front Desk were pleasant and helpful.  The bedroom was clean and well equipped.  The hotel was a lovely walk through the Embassy neighbourhood to the City on a crisp day.,5,2017,12,11
205,Nice hotel in Dublin,This used to be the Four Seasons and is now an Intercontinental.  I stayed 6 nights for business.  The rooms are large and clean and the staff are friendly and helpful.  The breakfast at the hotel is very good as I ate there every morning.  The hotel is close to a number of restaurants and pubs as well the Royal Dublin Society convention hall (there was an Irish craft show the week I was I town).  I did not eat lunch or dinner there and did not have time for the fitness area but it looked fine.  The hotel was decorated nicely for the Christmas as well.  ,5,2017,12,10
205,Being part of the Intercontinental,"Excellent service, staff very friendly.  Food was gorgeous.  Atmosphere was buzzing with young and old.   My only suggestion would be to change the seating in the main area to allow for more customers to have food or drink /coffee. ",5,2017,12,06
205,Great accommodation & staff ,"We stayed together with friends at the Intercontinental in Dublin last Saturday night. 
From the moment we walked through the front doors right up to our departure we were treated warmly and professionally by every member of staff. Our accomadations were upgraded and absolutely superb.
We all agreed that breakfast was the best we have tasted in years. 
The Christmas decorations and gingerbread house alone were worth the visit.
Well done to GM Nicky Louge and all  his team at the Intercontinental from a very happy Platinum Ambassador!",5,2017,12,05
205,Stunning place to stay!,We flew in from America and this was a treat.. love the hotel .. the breakfast ... the dinners.. the ambience.. the decorations for Christmas.. the staff were wonderful .. so much so we went back for an extra night a few nights later ,5,2017,12,05

We were made so welcome from our arrival by Ciara on reception, who also kindly took photos of us in the beautiful lobby! The room was superb and luxurious, in keeping with the 5 star standard throughout the hotel.  There was a lovely atmosphere in the Ice Bar and the breakfast was very good.  The staff were very attentive and professional and would do anything to enhance our experience.  The team are lead by example by the general manager Nicky, who was so helpful and seems to be on duty all of the time!  Thanks again to all of the team, we will definitely be back!",5,2017,12,05
205,Whats Not To Like?,"Just back form 4 nights there, it is a lovely hotel, great staff and it is all about relaxing in luxury. 5*'s aren't just about fancy rooms, the staff make the experience 5*. Can't fault anyone we dealt with from valet parking to house keeping, to the breakfast team to whoever prepared some fruit + pastries so we could have in the car when we set off for the ferry at 5am this morning. It is in a good location, a good 30 minute walk to town but a safe nice walk. 
My test of a hotel is simple. Would I go back there again if in Dublin. 100% yes.",5,2017,12,04
205,Excellent staff makes this beautiful hotel special,Once again had the pleasure of staying at the Intercontinental Hotel in Ballsbridge.  Lovely stay.  The hotel is beautiful with its holiday trimmings!  I was concerned that the lively activities in the public areas--a major charity event I believe--would mean noise in the guest rooms.  Was on the 1st floor and it was quiet and restful.  Stayed in the neighborhood for drinks and dinner and was really pleasantly surprised!  ,5,2017,12,02

Although very close to the village and the stadium the hotel was not too busy and we easily got seats in the lobby afterwards. A short walk to the bars and restaurants in Ballsbridge. Our room was lovely, large and had everything we could need and more. Breakfast was excellent. Would definitely recommend and will happily stay here again.",5,2017,11,29

205,5* hotel with 3* service,"Luxury hotel spotless clean but the service lets it down. The rooms are excellent with luxury bedding, great bathrooms, al very well decorated.
The issue is the service. The bar service is terrible. Ordered havana 7 with coke got bacardi but was charged on my receipt for havana 7. I brought it to the attention of the waiter because i know havana 7 is tawny not white. She checked with yhe bar tender who agreed and gave her a free one for me. Dont know if he was maybe pulling a fast one or a genuine mistake. Went for dinner as we sat down we were ask if we required drinks. I looked at the wine liat and ordered a red and a white for our party. The waiter disappeared only to return 25 minutes latwr in yhe middle of the main course proceeded to leave the wine on the table, no corkscrew and walked away. I called another waitress who went and got a corkscrew and opened the bottle.
I spoke to the floor manager who changed the waiter serving our table and sent a bottle of white extra as an apology.
When checking out next day the girl on reception insisted on the full bill even though my company had paid in advance for accomodation and parking. Finally after getting yhe manager she agreed rhe room and meal was indeed paid for but the parking was not. I decided at this stage not to argue but pay the parking get a receipt and leave.

As i said room, food, amenities, comfort 5* service lacking in professionalism so 3*.

Would i stay again, hmmm!!!! Yes.",4,2017,11,23
205,As luxurious as a fluffy warm bathrobe,"I recently stayed here for the rugby weekend in Dublin, from the doorman's welcome to the room service waiter's warm morning greeting, my experience was what one would expect of a quality 5 star establishment. All the staff were welcoming, attentive but not too overbearing. 
Great large comfortable bed, spacious bedroom and a cosy dressing gown on hand to enjoy my room service breakfast and late check out. 
The restaurant was an elegant room and again prompt attentive service which is definitely a positive theme throughout this hotel.
The bar was well attended and relaxing which I enjoyed with my friends on the Sunday afternoon.
I recommend the hotel and I will visit again",5,2017,11,22
205,Super Stay – luxurious!,"Just back from an altogether brief stay with my friends over last weekend. In a word WOW! 
The hotel is clearly making a come-back, it has had the advantage of a super location and is an imposing, impressive structure; but the standard of service and ambience has really improved since my last stay (this time last year)
Lovely spacious room which was spotless, very efficient check-in, very attentive service for the duration of our stay. Really did not want to leave on Sunday.  
I really enjoyed the atmosphere and my little group of friends were very well looked after. For example for breakfast we came down in little groups and even though the restaurant was quite busy they managed to combine the group & find us a lovely round table with a minimum of fuss. Overall the food and drinks are of a very high standard, the staff are on the ball and it was a really lovely, enjoyable experience. 
Well done to the entire team. I’ll be back soon.",5,2017,11,22
205,Great value,"I stayed at the intercontinental recently with my friends. We had an excellent stay. Great room, very spacious and tasty breakfast. The staff were courteous and helpful from bar staff, reception and room service. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the intercontinental, Dublin! ",5,2017,11,21
205,Quality all round,"Stayed at the hotel over rugby weekend in Dublin. The hotel was busy, but service was still top notch. Spacious room with large, comfortable bed. Nice big TV. Breakfast the following morning was excellent. The restaurant was full but the service was prompt and the buffet fully stocked. Would definitely stay again.",5,2017,11,21
205,Excellent 5 Star Hotel,"I have been twice in this hotel and it is one of the best in Dublin. 

Comfortable, luxurious and spacious accommodations. 

Extremely helpful and friendly staff. 

We ate at the Restaurant and in the room and both options were excellent.

We did not have the chance to try the spa but next time I will for sure :)

I'd really Recommended for a perfect experience in Dublin. Sorry for the quality of the photos :)",5,2017,11,21
205,Excellent Hotel - Definitely 5 star.,"I had the pleasure of staying in this hotel for 1 night @ the weekend.   I must say it exceeded my expectations from start to finish.   Lovely large room & it was extremely comfortable.  Great food & the service throughout the hotel was excellent.  We had breakfast served to our room, it was really well presented & the tray charge was very reasonable indeed.  Lovely pool also.  All in all, I can highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Dublin, it is well worth the price...  Thanks to everyone @ the Intercontinental - we will return.",5,2017,11,20
205,The best place in Dublin to stay,"Just back from a great stay with friends at the InterContinental. Great service from start to finish, brilliant breakfast and friendly bar staff. The room was ideal and a good value rate for a Saturday night. Keep up the good work!",5,2017,11,19
205,DSmyt,"Excellent location. Responsive staff and for a hotel of this standard good value. All five star facilities available but its value makes it a real choice over City centre hotels. We have now stayed there three times this year, in August, and in October and once in 2016. On every occasion we have been impressed.",5,2017,11,18
205,Weekend in Dublin,We attended a charity dinner for Ronald McDonald House Charity and stayed overnight. A lovely hotel although quite expensive and we felt needed a little more of a personal touch in the rooms. It’s a little dated now but still great service in both bar and Restaurant.,4,2017,11,18
205,Very good,"Went to celebrate a 70th birthday and everyone of us had a super time. Afternoon Tea was amazing, the restaurant served wonderful food and all of our rooms were perfect. Great staff, pleasant and very helpful. 
The Hop on Hop off bus picked up from just across the road to take us into the centre of Dublin and to various attractions. ",5,2017,11,16
205,First Class Hotel,"We stayed in the Intercontinental on 11th November  - everything was first class as usua. We were given an upgrade to a king suite, food was terrific and the service even on a busy day was exemplary. Just disappointed it is booked out for our next night in Dublin on the16th December.",5,2017,11,15
205,"Nice, nice, nice.","I stayed overnight while my wife and I were at a show in Dublin and the place, facilities and staff were lovely. The hotel is a short taxi ride from downtown Dublin and the theatre district, so that was nice.",5,2017,11,12
205,Beautiful hotel,"I was very impressed with this hotel. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. The room was spacious, well furnished and very clean. We got a great deal on Expedia for the caliber of hotel. I would definitely recommend staying here. The only negative about the hotel is it isn’t very centrally located. We spent a lot of money on taxis to get around Dublin. However, there is a hop on hop off bus which stops close by if you’re looking to save some money. The only reason we didn’t take advantage of that was due to time constraints. ",5,2017,11,12
205,some details are not up to the standard,"the room that I was in need some renovation door are make you feel you are staying at IBS. The rest is up to the standard, however I try the restaurant and was very good the tasty, fish chowder was excellent. The little issue was in the morning at the breakfast one waiter was not paying attention to us. The front office staff is friendly and helpful, the valet park very good and the lady in the morning Jaquiline she's a very good host. 

I advise to pay attention to details. I will be back for sure. But I cannot give more then average.",3,2017,11,12
205,You will not be disappointed with InterContinental,This is an excellent facility with a high quality and friendly staff.  The rooms are very comfortable and reflect the quality expected of an InterContinental Hotel.  We had a room facing the interior courtyard and it was very quiet. The lobby bar was excellent with very good food and service.  We enjoyed drinks and desert almost every night of our stay.  The gym was very nice for a hotel type facility. The only issue with the hotel is it's location.  The hotel is a little far from the city center so be prepared for the expense of a cab.,4,2017,11,11
205,amazing,beautiful place.really enjoyed my experience from the moment i walked into the lobby.very friendly and helpful staff. the food is very tasty. i was their for a family 50th party in the ice bar. really enjoyed the atmosphere. ,5,2017,11,10
205,Beautiful hotel ,"Stayed here for one night recently and it was not long enough. All the staff we met were very professional, friendly and efficient. We stayed in a King room on the second floor and it was absolutely beautiful.. minus the view. The only disappointment was the food in the restaurant,it was very basic and not what I would expect from a five star hotel. The menu presented to us was very lack lustre - soup/Caesar salad/ham hock terrine - just not what we were expecting. This did not take away from our stay though and we would definitely return again. ",4,2017,11,10
205,Weekend break,Super room and facilities.  Staff generally are very customer service.  Food is great.  Ambassador status did not work in that the additional amenities were not provided until we requested them.  Good position in Dublin and near to train station for visits into the city centre or along the coast.,5,2017,11,10
205,Brilliant as always!,"We have stayed here many times and the standards never slip. Very comfortable beds, impeccable service and an awesome breakfast! We got a really good rate online this time too! Really enjoyed the leisure centre after the marathon!",5,2017,11,08
205,Highly recommended Hotel ,"I had some correspondence with Bob Spillane concerning our stay . He responded to my emails with professionalism and courtesy . 

So from the moment we arrived and checked in til we were leaving every aspect of our stay in The Intercontinental was absolutely perfect.

The welcome from the receptionist set the standard.  Our room was beautiful, clean and epitomized 5 star quality. 

We had a beautiful relaxing meal in the Restaurant on the Saturday evening. As well as a lovely breakfast the next morning . The chef and restaurant staff are to be complimented nothing was too much bother .

I will have no hesitation in recommending the hotel to friends and look forward to my next stay .

205,The Intercontinental Experience,"As a Platinum ambassador member, IHG has been my hotel of choice for over 15 years. I have stayed in almost all in Europe and the US (oh and Israel and Australia) I must say that my favorites were Le Grand in Paris and  Marseille as I got to know the General Directors quite well. I speak French and I was there often. A month ago I was invited to  with some of my American colleagues (Casting Directors of Television from Europe and the US) for a meeting taking place in Dublin. I asked the travel agency to put me in the Intercontinental but as they had a special rate, I was not allowed to give the agency my membership number. Approaching the hotel I felt a slight rush as it looked like it was going to be a very special Irish experience in my 'feel at home' hotel group. I must say that I was overwhelmed with my whole stay. The welcome I received from the gentlemen in front of the hotel was the warmest I'd ever experienced in all my years at an IHG property. But walking into the lobby! Obviously the General Director has found the perfect blend of old world classic while instilling a feel of modern amenities that are apparent the moment you enter. In other words. Stunning, cozy, elegant with a touch of the 21 C. After my experience at the front desk I already knew this was the finest staff I had ever met and again ...bravo to the General Director for instilling his staff with first class service, warmth mixed with a sense of exemplary competence. Bravo! I wish I remembered the name of the young man who checked me in as this was the tipping point when I was sure about the staff. I was checking in and jokingly told him if I had booked this myself I would have used my membership number as I was a longtime loyal guest.I explained that I was booked under the Agent's corporate name and booked for a standard room.He asked me if I had my card. He looked at my card and said ""It didn't matter how I was booked...that I was a valued guest due to my status and loyalty and that I should hold on a minute"". He went into the back office for a moment and came out smiling telling me that I was being moved to a King Contemporary. Well...until I looked at the IHG site I didn't realize that I had been upgraded to one of the finest rooms in the hotel and yes...a letter from the General Director with a fruit basket arrived in my room. The room!  First the small balcony and view were of the city and it was just wonderful. The room was stunning in the way it had been appointed. Again...rich looking traditional with many modern amenities that gave you total comfort. Giant state of the art bathroom and luxe products in a generous nature.The bathroom truly was as big as an apartment in NY. The bed! That wonderful IHG bed filled with luxury linens and down duvets that just rocks you to sleep. The whole hotel including my room was shining clean, clean, clean!  All hotel guests should be lucky enough to sleep in the special IHG bed that you find in all IHG hotels. I was so pleased with my accommodations that I went down to the lobby area infused with a wonderful air of energy and I settled back into a wing chair and a server with a spring in his step was at my side within 5 minutes! I ordered a flute of champagne which was accompanied by some delicious mini chocolates. Breakfast the next morning was taken in the restaurant downstairs. Usually,I take breakfast in the club lounge. As this hotel did not have one I looked forward to trying the breakfast in the restaurant as i was famished from the flight the day before and I had not really wanted dinner. Well! All I can say is anything you could possibly want for breakfast prepared with obvious best ingredients (THE SCONES! ) could be found in the buffet.Freshly made breads, jams and pastries, main dishes that were excellent, meats, cheeses, salmon, fresh juices  and of course a pot of superb tea made exactly as I like with all my picky ""I need this and that for my proper breakfast tea."" (I don't drink coffee). Again the staff was friendly and right on point! You did not wait more than a few seconds when you looked like you wanted something. A quick workout in the well equipped gym and I was ready for my day. A cognac in the lobby that evening after my dinner downtown and I was one happy person. This is what I call the 'Intercontinental Experience'. I am returning in May with my partner to explore Ireland and we have already booked our 3 nights at the Dublin Intercontinental. What more does one need to say?",5,2017,11,06
205,Elegant delight,"I was in Dublin on business and could not get a room in the hotel where my colleagues were booked nearer to the Docks. Thank goodness! Because my stay at the InterContinental Dublin was absolutely delightful. It's clear even as your drive up that this is no ordinary hotel but rather a luxury accommodation. Walking in, everything is ornate, spotless and very well appointed, and the decor is simply beautiful. Even the fresh floral bouquets are over the top.

Our king bed room was spacious and very, very comfortable. We had a oversized tufted headboard for our king bed, so relaxing was easy to do. The bathroom is big and relaxing. Although this was a business trip, I brought my husband and young daughter. The room was big enough for us to feel comfortable for 5 days.

I should have gotten the breakfast package but didn't. However, I did enjoy the buffet three of our five days and it was delicious! The selection is wide and varied, along with a chef who makes eggs and omelettes to order. The gym is fantastic as hotel gyms go. You walk through the spa to get to it and the pool, where my husband and daughter spent time while I was working.

The InterContinental is located in the tony part of Dublin -- its most expensive neighborhood, which is also near some of the embassies. It was clear the hotel's other guests were upscale travelers and business people. Getting around from the InterContinental was easy; there are bus stops in short walking distance for wherever you need to go, and you're only minutes from downtown Dublin. If you want a taxi you must ask the hotel to call one for you -- and then be patient. I've been to dozens of cities around the world and as Western cities go Dublin is the most challenging to find a taxi, and one that takes credit cards is even rarer.

The service is unbeatable and the staff is second to none in friendliness, problem solving for me and my family, and helping to meet our needs. Overall, I would stay at the InterContinental Dublin again in a heartbeat.",5,2017,11,05
205,Reliably Excellent,"Stayed here 3 times so far on combined business and pleasure. The hotel staff - from housekeeping, to dining staff, to front desk and even maintenance - are very gracious and accommodating. The breakfast buffet is wonderful, but it never changes, so if you are here for several days, that could be a factor that impacts your enjoyment. 

On my first and third stay, while the water pressure was awesome, the shower drain was so slow the water spilled over the edge of the shower and flooded into the bathroom! Maintenance fixed it quickly, but it's something I'll be on the look out for during future stays.

Haven't had dinner or lunch here, nor used the spa, but afternoon tea is awesome!",5,2017,11,05
205,Couldn’t ask for more,"Decided to go to Dublin with my son for a four day break and this was the perfect hotel for us. Some 5* hotels feel very stuffy and uncomfortable but the Intercontinental hits just the right balance offering a first class service and beautiful decor for me but that my 13 year old didn’t feel out of place in either. The staff couldn’t have been more welcoming and helpful and we were both very impressed with them addressing us by name most of the time - such a nice personal touch.
We had breakfast each day in the hotel which offered a fantastic selection of both hot and cold and included amongst the preserves, a whole honeycomb which looked very impressive. I always avoid scrambled eggs in hotels as it is usually hard and rubbery having sat too long in the dish but had it every day here as it was light and fluffy. Perfect and set us up for a day out visiting the sights of Dublin.  The hotel is really well positioned to walk into the centre of town but it you don’t feel up to doing that, the bus stop is at the front of the hotel and takes you straight in in no time at all. Also worth noting that it is perfectly placed for events at the Aviva Stadium (which offers an excellent tour) being just a short walk away.   Our room was huge with two double beds and had everything we needed.  This was probably the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in and we both looked forward to getting in them at the end of a busy day and it was only the thought of breakfast that got us out of them each morning! Also worthy of a mention were the much larger than average bathroom and bath towels - nice. 
We both thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the intercontinental and will find any excuse to return soon.",5,2017,11,05
205,Like every stay here- Nearly perfect,"Love this hotel for business and pleasure travel. Brought my wife with me, she was floored by the level of service and quality found throughout the property. All amenities are truly first class. The staff is attentive and friendly, after a few days they know your name.",5,2017,11,04
205,"Loved our room, hated the Intercontinental","This was a very odd experience.  I believe that most of the staff at the Intercontinental believe that acting disinterested, curt, and superior equates to a high hotelier standard.  Of course it decidedly does not but they have not been trained otherwise.  After our first unsatisfactory go-around checking-in I always approached the front desk staff reluctantly - perhaps that is the purpose of their boorish behavior - to discourage guest inter-action?  
Let me give an example - when we inquired where we might have breakfast - or lunch at this point in the day - rather than pleasantly explain the use of their lounge we were pointed in that direction without further conversation.  Okay - off we went.  This same technique was used the following morning at breakfast when I asked the chef preparing the omelettes if I could have just a few scrambled eggs rather than an omelette - he pointed me in the direction of the prepared eggs on the buffet.  I felt dismissed at that point.
Our meals at the Intercontinental were rather meh.  I had read older reviews when the hotel had been a Four Seasons and were expecting some rather special dining which unfortunately was not the case.  It seemed as though everyone was only giving a half effort.
A further consideration with the Intercontinental is that it is in the Embassy District of Dublin and therefore outside of both the city center and tourist areas.  We were told we could either take a bus, walk, take a train, or use a cab to go into Dublin.  We used cabs most days.  Please be aware that for the most part cab drivers accept only cash - Euros.
Now to the bright spot of our three night stay at the Intercontinental.  Our room and bath were wonderfully spacious, clean, and comfortable.  I truly looked forward to returning at the end of the day to our room - it was a very quiet respite for us.  If only the other aspects of the Intercontinental were of the same high caliber - that would encourage a return trip.",2,2017,11,04
205,Wonderful hotel with lovely staff,Stayed here last week with my husband in a lovely suite.  The check in was efficient and the staff were most pleasant.  Unfortunately we didn't get a chance to experience their evening dinner menu as we had plans to meet friends but found their breakfast to be plentiful and tasty.  I would have no hesitation in returning to this establishment.,5,2017,11,04
205,Elegant Dublin Location,"A lovely stay here. Beautiful hotel a short walk to the city, and bus stop directly outside if you choose. Nice dining room and lovely spa area. Not far away is a nice selection of pubs and restaurants, and the local park with a coffee shop and cafe.We had a lovely autumn sojourn for a few days and enjoyed exploring Dublin.",4,2017,10,30
205,Old design hotel,"I was charged 40 euros just for help for a phone call (rip-off!!) / The lobby personal is very friendly, but lack of flexibility: I needed 20 euros cash quickly, it took half an hour to get it and charged on my bill The breakfast breakfast OK (but always same thing) / Globally, the hotel is very expensive for the price",2,2017,10,29
205,Intercontinental at its worst,"As a Royal Ambassador I am very familiar with the Intercontinental Hotels and the quality and service you can expect.

But this hotel in Dublin is not worth to carry the name INTERCONTINENTAL!

We got a double upgrade to an executive suite which was highly appreciated at first sight.

But this room was not in a very good condition.

Ok, the hotel is old but obviously no one took care of regular maintenances.

The room service was very poor. We did not get the breakfast we have ordered and when we asked to refill the minibar the staff told us that they cannot do it completely because they haven’t been supplied with the sufficient quantity of whiskey.

Dirty glasses were not changed much less cleaned up.

When we tried to have some drinks in the bar we had to wait 25(!) minutes before someone started to get interested in potential guests.

When we complained the waiter said: Yes, that’s very impressing.

During the check- in we were asked which newspaper we would like to get in the morning and we decided to take the Irish Independent. Unfortunately there was no newspaper delivered at no day in morning but all neighbour rooms got one. 

So all in all we felt to be on a black list.

I have never experienced such a bad managed hotel with the name Intercontinental and a 5 star level.

We have been this year in the Intercontinental in Paris, in Hongkong, in Berlin, in Budapest, in Vienna and in Athens.

Naturally even there you have differences in the general performance. But the Intercontinental in Dublin we will never book again.

205,Excellent hotel property,"I had pleasant stay in the hotel. The hotel property is beautiful. The interior and exterior of the hotel are well kept and hotel amenities are plenty. I had a deluxe king bedroom and it was decorated well..very classy! Excellent staff with great customer service skills.The restaurant offers local and international fanfare breakfast with lots of choices. The hotel is slightly off the path but not far from local attractions and areas of interest. 

I'm an SPG member but will definitely return for my next stay in Dublin. ",5,2017,10,28
205,excellent room and service from reception - food a little disappointing,"Checked in early afternoon - quick and friendly - room v good if corridors a little tired - tatty carpets etc. Had a snack in the lobby lounge - poor service when not busy and plenty of staff, food not as described and when raised poorly handled. Breakfast items some a little cold and buffet for hot food is not what I expect for 5*. Complaints were well handled by duty manager. car parking charge - living in London I would expect this for a city hotel so not a prob - its secure. would stay again but not eat there.",4,2017,10,26
205,Old school friends,"A very quiet Tuesday night we arrived for dinner. The main restaurant was closed but there was a room to the side of the lobby which was comfortable and decor quiet and plush. Service was good. Range of drinks on offer excellent. Perfect length of time between courses.Food superb. Mixed range of lobster, turbot, game, vegetarian. A very pleasant surprise . Somewhere I have never eaten before as I don’t eat in hotel restaurants at home but this is a place I would come back to. Looks like they have a great menu for Sunday lunch- one for the hungry family ...",5,2017,10,25
205,Dinner anniversary at Seasons,"Few days ago we booked a table for our dinner anniversary. We were escorted to the table by our waitress Ida, who looked after us the best possible way and was very attentive and knowledgable during the whole service. We got Champaign on arrival too as requested. During the service,  we experienced amazing dishes created by Stephen McGuire. The components were smartly combined together creating an unforgettable palate and as a consequence a wonderful experience. During the service we were entertained by Siobhan, who made us feel special. After a meal, we moved to the bar, where Gabor and Alen continued our celebration with extra personal touch and relaxing atmosphere. Overall the stuff and the quality of food were over the top. Would definitely recommend it to friends as a great spot to be served on the high standards.",5,2017,10,24
205,Inconsistency & Hidden Charges,"When this was the Four Seasons, I knew what to expect every time. I spent a lot of time working in Dublin and this was my preferred overnight. Now though, the advertised price rarely equates with what I wind up being invoiced. The latest hidden cost was paying €18 to park my car. First time ever that has happened. There is better value to be had in Dublin",2,2017,10,22
205,"great hospitality, beautiful hotel","great hospitality, big and comfortable rooms, professional crew.
a bit far from the city center, but very enjoyable. 
lovely gym and cool pool. 
other than that, ill be happy to visit the place again in the future.",5,2017,10,22
205,Great,From check in with Ciara the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The room was exquisite with an amazingly comfortable bed and pillows. We dined in the lobby and restaurant later. The food in the lobby was disappointing - ordered the humus and pesto which lacked flavour and the tempura seafood was over cooked. Dinner was satisfying- the salmon was beautifully cooked but the beef was average. However overall our experience in the hotel was excellent ,4,2017,10,21
205,Spectacular,"My family and I spent 2 days here as a gift from relatives, and I was amazed by the calliber of excellence , very posh and nice , the meal was great in the restaurant and staff very helpful, rooms even better highly recommend",5,2017,10,21
205,Excellent classic luxury hotel,"As opposed to the new boutique luxury hotels, the Intercontinental Dublin offers old style luxury: spacious rooms with big bathrooms, carpeting instead of wooden flooring and sumptuous decor. The room features a Nespresso coffee maker and a water boiler. Nice pool/gym area with small sauna and steam room in the changing rooms (i.e. genders are separated). Very good breakfast. The city centre is a 25 min walk away. In summary a very good hotel for your Dublin visit. We would stay there again.",5,2017,10,21
205,Fantastic Hotel!!!!,"Stayed in this wonderful hotel last night with my wife while attending a show in Dublin, from the moment we set foot through the door till the moment we left the staff and management could not do more to make our stay excellent. From the staff at check in to the staff at breakfast and the lobby they were very friendly and attentive but not overbearing.

The executive suite was very well proportioned with a relaxed seating area to chill out, read or watch T.V.

The gym has everything you need to do any type of workout while the spa is fantastic I am told.....

The food, and especially the breakfast is excellent. 

The new management have really taken this hotel back to its very best. I would highly recommend.",5,2017,10,20
205,Days in Dublin...,"The service was excellent.  The room was spacious, comfortable, with all the amenities...excellent facility!  I highly recommend this excellent hotel...all phases including the food at the accompanying restaurant.  ",5,2017,10,20
205,Awesome Hotel,Love this hotel!! Staff is great in all aspects. The front check in and all bar tenders as well as housekeepers are very welcoming. The hotel is beautiful especially the lobby with the beautiful flowers !! Would recommend this hotel to everyone.,5,2017,10,17
205,"My third time back, never disapoints.","I had a an option to stay at any hotel in Dublin for my birthday - and I choose the Intercontinental, I rate it way beyond the Shelburne or any other high star hotel I have stayed at in Dublin.  The customer service is excellent, the staff are very attentive, there is nothing I can really fault at all, I will return and I always recommend it for anyone looking to be close to the city but yet feel they are away from it also.  
Make sure you join their loyalty program, we got an upgrade because of this.",5,2017,10,17
205,Amazing hotel,"The suite was perfect. Would live in that room.. Lots of space, very clean, everything you need for comfort. Staff was very nice, we got all the help we needed with our luggage, getting cabs. The bar there is good, the atmosphere in the lounge is amazing, very peacefull and comfortable. Staff is very attentive.",5,2017,10,16
205,Expected better service,"Service was unbearable.  After a long drive here, I did not feel welcome in this property.
Also, the ""special rate"" that you get if you book the continental breakfast in advance made me question why they had to resort to high pressure sales tactics to get hotel guests to choose breakfast there.",3,2017,10,16
205,"Very nice hotel, great rooms and service.","I stayed at the Intercontinental Dublin after leaving my apartment ahead of my move to London. I booked it on points, and as I'm only Spire Elite with the chain (but not an Ambassador) I did not expect any upgrade or any fancy room. Instead I was pleasantly surprised as I was upgraded to an Executive Room.

The room was very spacious, particularly for Dublin. It was a corner room, with three nice windows (Victorian?) that make the room very bright during the day, and can be quite well obscured overnight. The bed and the sofa-chairs were very comfortable and the quality of sleep very good as there was no noise coming from the neighbouring room.

The bathroom was positively huge with marble floor and another big window that made the morning routine a very happy affaire. It included both a bath tub and a walk-in shower, and a separately closable toilet closet. The towels and bathrobes are comfortable, and the hairdryer modern and great to use. The only problem I can find is that the pressure of the shower was really limited, and the showerhead only had options for ""faucet"" and ""mildly misted"".

The amenities in the room were also very pleasing: a Nespresso machine makes for great morning (and evening, in my case) coffee, and as an executive room, free water was well provided during my stay. The minibar is well stocked, including chocolate and non-alcoholic beverages, and not terribly expensive for a minibar, particularly in a nice hotel like this.

The lobby of the hotel is also stunning. While waiting to check in, I really enjoyed listening to the pianist playing in the restaurant/bar of the hotel, and concierge and bellhops were all very happy to help with anything that was needed (though having been a local in Dublin for the previous four years, there wasn't much I required).

Location wise, Ballsbridge is a bit far off from the city centre, but it is walkable (I did just that). The closest light rail stop is about 20 minutes away walking, but if you are interested in an event at the RDS Arena or Aviva Stadium, its location is great. The former is literally next door, while the Aviva is about 10-15 minutes walking at most.",5,2017,10,14
205,Great hotel but service could be better,"Fabulous location and the hotel is the best. Our junior king room had everything and more. Arriving after a long flight we had lunch in the lobby bar and it was fantastic but it was difficult to get service. A hotel experience is not just about the rooms and facilities, it is about the service. We noticed a language issue as many staff we had contact with seemed to have some language difficulties. One night we needed a knife to cut some fruit and my wife rang for this but we were brought an ice bucket instead. Then we rang room service after 9pm but no one answered, so I rang the concierge and he tried to put me through but we were again left hanging. My wife eventually went downstairs to the dining area and brought back a plate and knife. Reception staff ignored us when we passed by as if we did not exist. We had just stayed in a similar hotel in Tel Aviv and the contrast in service level was stark. Customers matter, surely. Such a pity as this should be so much better. The WiFi though was very fast!",4,2017,10,14
205,Excellent!,"Superb room, breakfast was gorgeous. The hotel is beautiful furnished, elegant classic  interieur, very nice and helpful staff. The bar is a very good place for a drink after work.  Only minor issue with phone reception, quite a long time to take a call. Highly recommended.",5,2017,10,13
205,Welcome relief,"Great room, excellent breakfast though more breads needed. Slight difficulty with key not working in lift but eventually sorted. Paying for parking is irritating at this room rate & really ought to be free. ",4,2017,10,09
205,fabulous,"two nights here and I did not want to go home, great rooms, very quiet, lovely facilities, professional and pleasant staff, great bar, a wonderful experience. The hotel is a little way out of town but 15 mins by bus right outside the hotel and you are in the center.",5,2017,10,09
205,Aug/September/October,Excellent all round with one exception front desk are like robots they dont smile or greet and are not customer friendly with the exception of Jane and Alan (night ) and Michael (security) any inquiry seems a problem all other staff are excellent Safi in the us a top class bartender ,5,2017,10,08
205,Beautiful hotel with superb service,"Our stay was flawless. Excellent buffet breakfast with cooked to order eggs and omelettes. Gorgeous public areas and fabulous art in the halls and rooms. Comfortable, luxurious and spacious accommodations. Extremely helpful amd friendly staff. We thoroughly enjoyed the lounge amd pianist in the evening, ",5,2017,10,08
205,Not a blast from the past,"It had been a while since our previous stays at the hotel, our first was at the Four Seasons (the former) and our 2nd was only a few weeks after the change over to IHG. 
Room was really nice, junior suite, nice new renovated decor. 
 
Bar pianist at night was very nice, unfortunately he finished early and there was a noticeable void in his absence. It's a pity the hotel don't provide music a little later, even and hour later, as many of us in the bar were disappointed. We actually returned to our room. 
Breakfast continental buffet was as good as before, not the best Dublin hotel breakfast, but it was great. 
However, I was disappointed that the cooked breakfast was a buffet and not made to order. All items were quite cold. It was extremely disappointing to say the least. Nothing worse than lukewarm sausages! 
The swimming pool was also freezing! Again, in the past, the pool was an inviting temperature, but this was just freezing! 
Overall we were quite disappointed. Next time, I will definitely revert to a city centre more centrally located hotel, with a warm breakfast! We have young children and looked forward to the pool, but as it was so cold, I think we can overlook that as an essential next time.

205,Amazing hotel - would 100% recommend ,"Stayed for one night for work - tried to get two but fully booked . Amazing rooms , staff and service . Slight issue in the restaurant but didn’t bring my score down as it was a delightful stay. The beds are
Comfy , the rooms amazing and Next
Time I will use the spa. My new fave hotel in Dublin ! ",5,2017,10,08
205,Afternoon tea,"This hotel is really beautiful. Beautifully decorated and lovely, relaxed atmosphere. 
I came here with a friend to try their gin afternoon tea. It was really good value and very tasty. 
My reason for not awarding the 5 star is the service. I found many of them (particularly the senior looking staff) quite rude and impatient. Throughout the dining experience they were dismissive and when we finished they were clearly only interested in getting us out of the room (without offering to reserve an area in the bar for our drinks) they literally stood over us. For a five star hotel I felt disappointed with their manner. ",4,2017,10,08
205,Great Hotel,"We had a wonderful room, (minisuite), breakfast is stunning. The hotel is beautiful furnished, elegant classic  interieur, very nice and helpful staff. The bar is a very good place for a drink after sight seeing.  We will certainly be back.",5,2017,10,07
205,excellent facility,"Recently travelled to Ireland and Scotland.  This was the nicest place we stayed! The facility is older, but top notch.  very clean and well kept.  Employees there all very nice and welcoming.  Helpful and genuine.  Our room was a suite that had ample space for all.  Large luxurious bathroom, walk in closet, a terrce off the dining area and one off the bedroom.  So very inviting.  It was also my daughters 30th birthday and room service sent up a very nice birthday wish for her.  They set up our dining table beautifully, as we were too tired to leave the room that evening to celebrate.  Appreciated their kindness.",5,2017,10,06
205,What a Wonderful Experience!,"We love the Intercontinental Properties, but the Dublin Intercontinental hotel was exceptional!  Jane made our stay an unforgettable one.  Thanks for all your visit recommendations and special care.   The room was awesome and the breakfast was fabulous.  We even met the property manager.  He made us feel special.  Great job, we'll be back...",5,2017,10,05
205,Not Intercontinental like,"Slow service, bad breakfast including a bug on the ""Seasonal fruit plater"", a service lady had an argument with a colleague in front of the guests, most of the personal was unfriendly and not motivated, the fitness room is in need of renovation...we wilm never stay again i  this hotel...",2,2017,10,03
205,Dublin Overnight,"Traveled for a weekend with my daughter. Luxurious rooms, amazing breakfast buffet, great bar. One of the nicest breakfasts that I ever had.The bed was so comfortable, the bath wonderful, staff helpful. Expensive, but luxurious.",5,2017,10,03
205,Business Trip,"As you would expect for an expensive five star hotel everything was extremely good but I’m not sure that this hotel is really value for money, even by Dublin standards the bars and restaurants are very expensive.",4,2017,10,02
205,Good stay and friendly staff,"In general, my experience was good, the facilities are very good and elegant. The only complain is the reception staff made me wait three hours due before receiving my room. We customers and guests do not know local or hotel regulations and we should not be limited for that.",4,2017,10,02
205,This is not a Good or Better hotel; but it is the BEST HOTEL outside of Dublin,"What a great experience. The InterContinental Dublin is located just a short drive from the heart of busy Dublin, There is nothing to fault about this hotel but there is everything to PRAISE. The hotel is rather sizable but you would not know it because of the outstanding, friendly staff. The entire staff was extremely friendly and made you feel right at home. Looking for beauty and comfort then this hotel if for you. Luxury abounds. My room was impeccable and no detail was overlooked. This hotel provides the WOW factor. One person who should receive accolades was Jacqueline, or better known as Jackie. She was in command of the breakfast room. She greeted us, showed us to the table, ordered our coffee and personally guided us through the selection of foods...some of which I was not familiar. The InterContinental is now my hotel of all hotels in Dublin. ",5,2017,09,30
205,Excellent," I had Excellent service from both staff and Accommodation .  The check in and out service was easy.  The hotel is good for business and vacation.  Restaurant and meal was superb. I will visit again and recommend to friends and family. Keep it up!",5,2017,09,29
205,Preferred Hotel in Dublin,"Always stay here when in Dublin. Good location within walking distance of restaurants and bars in Ballsbridge and Sandymount. Rooms are spacious and clean, the bar is well stocked and I enjoy the pool/fitness center.",5,2017,09,29
205,Did Not Present a 5 Star Face to My Wife and I!,"We had prepaid 7 nights through Expedia for an Executive Room 1 King bed including breakfast.

Let me first say that I was remiss in not calling them ahead to say we would be arriving at noon and asking if a room could possibly be available earlier than 3 PM after an overnight flight from Toronto.

That being said the front desk clerk at noon took our luggage, signed us in with an imprint of our credit card and then informed us the room wouldn't be available until closer to 3:00 pm.  We returned from a rainy outing at 2:40 pm to be told our room would be ready shortly and watched like a captive audience from our seat in the lobby as other travelers just arriving were checked in and sent up to their rooms before 3 pm!

At 3:00 pm I returned to the desk and was told the room still wasn't ready and wouldn't be until at least 3:15 pm at which point I was joined by my wife who asked what was wrong with the room and perhaps we didn't want it as it was taking so long to clean and taking two people to ready it as we had just been advised!

At that point we were ushered away from the lobby and into the adjacent bar and offered complimentary coffee/tea (that's there for all guests)...Needing sleep we said water would be fine and then from behind us a waiter/bartender appeared offering complimentary beer and wine and moments later we were presented with key cards to a different room described as an ""upgrade""...Who in charge to make decisions rather than offering excuses had finally taken notice, remains a mystery!

My wife and I both retired, were in Dublin and Ireland to discover the city and the Irish countryside. I wear suits to weddings & funerals and not even formal night on a cruise! Golf shirts, jeans and waterproof walking shoes for a notoriously inclement Ireland! Perhaps we were out of place among the suited business folks and Delta Airline crews and had simply chosen the wrong hotel for a comfortable and casual vacation?

The hotel reviews we read in advance of our booking whether at Trip Advisor and on other sites consistently raved about the 5 star Intercontinental...a few lamented it was still not up to its previous Four Seasons past...perhaps we should have paid more attention to the latter?

Our introduction to the Intercontinental in Dublin had me recalling one time checking in at the Toronto Yorkville Four Seasons property on business many years ago where the front desk clerk apologizing that my single room not ready had been upgraded to a suite at no extra cost.  But back then I was a repeat corporate customer not perhaps as I was in Dublin, a one time now captive casual tourist?

Still the Intercontinental is a lovely hotel and room in the upscale Ballsbridge neighbourhood...kudos to their breakfast supervisor who went out of her way to accommodate two very early morning tour commitments.

But a morning newspaper that never appeared, an ignored written request in the room for coffee refills not to be decaffeinated, inconsistent room service including none on our last full day, a 4 Euro charge for a bagged continental breakfast instead of the full course prepaid Irish breakfast we didn't eat that morning and a 3 Euro charge for one local phone call to confirm our shuttle service...little things on top of a room that they simply seemed unable to get ready over 3 hours after accepting our luggage whilst other guests checked in early...I struggle with 4 Stars...the 5th definitely wasn't there!",4,2017,09,29
205,Brilliant stay,"Lovely hotel. Not central, but Aircoach from airport drops you at the corner of the road every half hour, and city is easily reached by regular bus services, or Dart suburban trains are only 10 minutes walk away. 
Very friendly welcome on reception, and upgraded to executive suite - comfortable, well equipped and impeccably maintained. 
Main restaurant not open Sunday or Monday evening, but good menu choice in the lounge. Attentive service, well presented food, good value. Excellent choice at breakfast also. 
Efficient check out. A very nice stay.",5,2017,09,28
205,"Stately, elegant, and amazing! ","This hotel is truly a gem. Our suite made us feel like the Kennedys. The suite was over 1k square feet. We had a desk, dining room, kitchenette with unlimited coffee, a living room, bedroom, and 2 bathrooms. Just the perfect room for a family. We slept amazing in the beautiful hotel. To top it off, the service equates to the elegance of the room. The staff is kind and attentive. One of the most wonderful hotels I have ever stayed in. Jackie made our breakfast amazing. She brought us Nutella pancakes for our kids and made quick friends with them. She brought them coloring books and attended to them. Really made us feel special and welcome. Great first impression of Ireland. I would highly recommend this beautiful hotel. ",5,2017,09,27
205,every detail done beautifully,We decided to backpack for out UK trip so we could get the chance to meet more locals. We stayed at air bandbs most nights and decided to stay at one nice hotel the last night to unwind. What a great choice. Desk was super friendly and the room was beautiful. Fresh fruit and water waiting for us and an extremly comfortable bed. Would definitly stay again.,5,2017,09,26
205,Nice relaxing break,"Brought my wife there for a romantic weekend away. We were upgraded on arrival which was nice. Service was excellent throughout our stay. I enjoyed relaxing in the lounge with the Sunday papers, while my wife went for a swim. Would definitely visit again.",5,2017,09,26
205,Best bed,Stayed here for work and Loved my stay in this hotel. Lovely bed and the shower. Would definitely stay here again. Very big spacious rooms with everything you need. Hotel staff were very helpful and breakfast was very nice. ,5,2017,09,25

205,Weekend Stay,"It was great from start to finish. Brilliant service and brilliant room. All staff more than happy to help. The spa and staff were also brilliant and the service here was also 100%.
I would recommend to anyone. 
I will definitely be staying here again as the location was perfect for popping in and out of Dublin City centre. ",5,2017,09,24
205,Bring back The Four Seasons.....,"Ever since The Four Seasons vacated the property I've been hugely underwhelmed ...
I know it's the same hotel and physically hasn't changed but it really has!!

Pros:
The hotel is still lovely, rooms are spacious & clean

Cons:
The staff need better training!
The porter was very slow to come over and take our bags.
The bags weren't in our room 45 mins after we arrived and we had to call down for them.
The barman scowled at me because I sat down after ordering some drinks and said 'I was looking for you' in an impolite way.

And one final moan ....
I never had to pay for parking when The Four Seasons were there.

It's such a pity, my wife and I used to love treating ourselves to weekend breaks there.
We only stay now if we're attending a function.

Their loss & ours ...!!
Bring back The Four Seasons!!",3,2017,09,24
205,Beautiful hotel beautiful location,"This is the nicest Intercontinental Hotel I've stayed in, apparently was a Four Seasons a few years ago and feels at that level of luxury. Excellent service from front desk to restaurant. Beautiful neighborhood to go for a run around the hotel. Short commute to most tech offices via Uber or taxi

I was upgraded to a jr suite which was very large and extremely comfortable",5,2017,09,22
205,Former Glory Totally Restored for 2017,"This hotel has a curious past, operated under the Four Seasons Brand in the early years. ( Spot the 4 seasons logo still visible on the gable end of the entrance) The hotel was the premier destination both for travelers and locals in the upmarket area of Ballsbridge. Located next to the RDS arena an conference centre , the hotel suffered from something of an identity crisis. What was inescapable was it offered some of the largest rooms and suites in the city, and beautiful public areas.  Jump to 2017 and after having spent over 80 nights at the hotel over the years,I can honestly say  it has now regained its crown as Dublins premier destination. The renovated rooms and suites are exceptional ( if you can excuse the small  hip baths ) 

Breakfast Buffet is much as you would expect from a 5 star hotel, with egg station, and a couple of nice touches like local breads , and white pudding. Room service is punctual and efficient, and the menu good, with reasonable prices.

The staff are well trained  and the service mentality is exceptional. The bar and public areas are upmarket and well appointed, although sometimes can be a victim of their own success and rather busy.  The indoor pool is a real bonus. 

The hotel offers incredible value if you want space, service, and appointments in what is rapidly becoming one of Europe's most expensive cities again. A personal thank you to Nicky, and the whole team for returning Dublin's finest Hotel building, to Dublins finest Destination.

There is currently no dedicated concierge which i am sure is something that is being addressed, and  there are big plans afoot for Seasons , the hotels premiem dining room.

The hedonistic and noisy evenings in Dublins Temple Bar are an easy 10 minute taxi away, but how satisfying it is to return to the charm and tranquility of Ballsbridge, and the warm welcome of Isaac and the Doormen at front of house.",5,2017,09,20
205,Mrs Jenn,"This is my favorite hotel by far! Beautiful lobby with fresh fragrant flowers 
The best beds ever ! I never want to go to work. I want to lay in that cloud for days!!
Helpful and happy staff that always greets you at the door!",5,2017,09,17
205,Outstanding property,Fantastic hotel. Used to be the Four Seasons hotel. Major refurb has been well spent. Dinner in the bar was good but tables too low which was uncomfortable. Breakfast Luke warm from the buffet and have to ask for it to be warmed up. (They remade it completely)Breakfast offering though is excellent and staff always go out of their way. Beautiful swimming pool and Spa which is worth a visit. ,5,2017,09,16
205,"Classy, luxury, great location","A stunning hotel. Beautiful big rooms. Great breakfast... so much choice. 
Location great if visiting RDS or Rolys bistro.
This is as luxurious as the shelbourne, but doesn't have any views to speak of.
",5,2017,09,16
205,Simply perfect ,"My partner and I stayed here for 5 nights during the horse-show in the RDS. This hotel used to be the Four Seasons which I was very familiar with but I must say that the Intercontinental Group have really upped their game here and exceeded its previous tenant. The service was impeccable and no request seemed to be too much. The main lobby area serves delicious food and although it is definitely 5 star prices, it is also most definitely 5 star service and food. There are some beautiful high backed couches in this area where you can manage to be totally private which I loved. Our room was beautiful, so spacious and a bed that almost enveloped you. Another little pet peeve of mine is rough towels that appear as though 1 million other guests have used them before me. Well here, in the intercontinental it was like they produced newly unwrapped towels everyday and they were so fluffy and perfectly white. Every amenity you may require is in the room, it's like they have thought of everything. The colour schemes are restful yet stylish. The breakfast which is in the normal dining room included everything you could wish for at a breakfast, whether you were a health food nut or a junk food junkie. It really was one of the best I have had, in fact it was a shame to be full ! There was a wonderful lady that greeted us in the breakfast room every morning and her enthusiasm was infectious. I really adored my stay here and I really hope to be back soon. ",5,2017,09,14
205,"Excellent hotel, exceptional service.","I would recommend this hotel when staying Dublin for the following reasons (in order of importance to me):
 1. Exceptional customer service provided in all aspects of our stay.
2. Well appointed and spacious rooms.
3. Great breakfast selection.

205,Champions weekend ,"Enjoyed super bar service, great bar food but on my second day my brunch experience in the bar was poor ! The service was terrible ! My order included tea. Now it took 10mins before anyone offered me a menu ! Another 7 or 8 mins before the order was taken, my tea arrived out immediately but my food took another 15 mins ! V disappointing ",5,2017,09,13
205,Dublin delight,"Superb hotel in great location, excellent staff , facilities a joy to be based there.nothing was too much trouble, knowledgeable staff, with both informative and engaging, so making a very pleasant atmosphere and memorable experience.",5,2017,09,13
205,Best Hotel in Dublin,"The Dublin Intercontinental is absolutely fantastic.  It was a Four Seasons until 2015 so you're basically getting a Four Seasons property for the price of an Intercontinental.  The public space is absolutely lovely from the moment you walk in the hotel.  The rooms are VERY spacious and have everything you could want - large comfortable bed, desk area with plenty of electrical sockets, and a great LARGE bathroom with separate shower and bathtub.  The rooms are VERY quiet - you never hear a door close or any street noise.  That's the benefit of being slightly outside the city center which we enjoyed since we got to have a 25 minute walk into the center and work off some of the delicious breakfast.  The staff are absolutely lovely and helpful.  For convenience there is a bus stop one block away for the airport shuttle and there's a Hop on Hop off stop directly across the street from the hotel.  This is definitely one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in and I've travelled all over the world for 25 years.",5,2017,09,13
205,Outstanding Experience!,"From the moment we arrived, the entire experience was fantastic. We were immediately welcomed by the front desk. Our room was very elegant yet comfortable. The room service staff members were friendly and paid attention to detail. I was extremely impressed by the fitness room's cleanliness and whole spa area experience in general. We also had great service and helpful conversations at both the lobby bar and Afternoon tea room. I would highly recommend the Intercontinental Dublin for both the hotel itself and the beautiful neighborhood where it is situated.",5,2017,09,12
205,Dublin Horse Show,"Location perfect. Hotel is less austere than in previous years - much welcomed.
The Ice bar is a huge hit.
Friendly staff, good food - Best breakfast in a hotel I've ever had.
Check in and out were well organised and concierge on the ball.  Will definitely be returning.",5,2017,09,12
205,Great hotel in a great location in the funnest city in the world !!!,We stayed for an extended long weekend this August and really enjoyed this hotel. The hotel is in Ballsbridge area and close to numerous pubs and great restaurants. We had a beautiful room with views of the Sea. It was large and clean with a massive bathroom.,5,2017,09,12
205,"Friendly and accommodating staff, but...",My wife and i spent 5 nights at this hotel recently.  The staff was fantastic and went the extra mile to make our stay extremely  pleasant and memorable.

205,Fantastic ,"Great to see the charm of the Four Seasons has returned.
Excellent service, food and standard of rooms.
A friendly smile and welcome from all areas, and the 'buzz' is definitely back. 
A great part of Dublin to be based in - if you're going for a wander there are plenty of local pubs to enjoy.

205,"""Not just a Hotel but a 5 Star experience ""","From the moment we stepped out of the car, the prompt, polite doorman opened the door, retrieved our luggage and escorted us through to the front desk passing by the most wow floral displays l have seen in a long time. 

We knew then this was going to be more then just a hotel stay, it was going to be an experience.

The front desk receptionist was wonderfully polite and welcomed us with a big smile. She advised us of all the various facilities on site, provided us with our room keys and directed us to the lift to our floor. 

We were advised that the room we were to staying in was one of the hotels newly designed Contemporary Rooms, which was just gorgeous and wouldn't look out of place in any top London or New York hotel! 
With a fab color scheme, top amenities, fluffy robes and the added bonus of full use of their amazing leisure centre including Swimming pool / Sauna etc. It was simply heaven!

During our stay we dinned in both the Lobby area, which is very luxurious but more of a casual setting then their main restaurant, Seasons. Both options were of a very high standard l thought, with excellent knowledgeable staff, who not only guided us through the yummy menus but also provided us with great Irish hospitality that this country is known for. 
We loved Seasons Restaurant too and ate their twice during our 4 night stay. It was nice to dress up and be treated like lords by the hotels brilliant staff. Great menu and and an even better wine selection. 

While there we also enjoyed the hotels Sunday Brunch, which had stunning food on display with everything from local seafood, various meats, salads, deserts on display and you could eat as much as you could fit! - plus a nice large glass of bubbles to wash it all down with! 

As mentioned this was a proper 5 Star hotel experience that l had to share with everyone. It was so good we have already booked our return trip to the Intercontinental Hotel for December this year, where l have been assured by staff the hotel gets a full Christmas make over and just looks magical to get you in the festive mood...Hot port by the fire anyone!",5,2017,09,08
205,Tourist visit to Dublin,An excellent hotel with great service. We spent two nights in Dublin and spent both days here. The hotel is a little away from the downtown Dublin but its about 15 minutes away by cab. Also if you are up to it there's public transportation available from just outside. It is worth the extra travel time because it is in a quieter location with some fine food places around.,5,2017,09,06
205,Best Service in Dublin in a Luxurious Setting,"As well as the luxury of the Dublin Intercontinental, this hotel boasts a wonderful staff of capable, friendly & professional individuals who provide the superior service that sets this hotel above the rest.
Shining brightly amongst this staff is the best waitress we have ever encountered - Ida. When Ida is on duty we know our visit will be perfect, as she calmly caters to all our little idiosyncrasies, and provides a service that displays her wealth of experience. Ida is a real asset to the Dublin Intercontinental team.
Thank you to all the staff, including the chef & kitchen staff for all the times we've gone 'off-menu', and a big 'Thank You' to Ida.",5,2017,09,06

205,Short stay ,"I arrived early my room was ready and I was able to check in. The hotel was lovely and comfortable it is off the busy streets so it is quite . The staff was friendly and efficient. One thing I like is when there is a bottle of water waiting for me . It makes a big difference. I had the breakfast buffet and it was better than expected. My stay was short and enjoyable.

205,Highly recommend!,"We stayed here for four nights mid July. I was a bit concerned after reading some of the reviews, but am happy to report that, once again, the IHG brand lived up to my expectations. 

Check-in: We arrived a few hours before the allotted time. So, understandably, our room wasn't quite ready. We left our bags and went for a walk. We arrived back to discover it still wasn't ready. The lovely lady at reception upgraded us rather than have us leave and come back again. 👍

Room: Ended up in a spacious suite. Loads of space with a wonderful view of the courtyard. No complaints!!  The bed was extremely comfortable and I wanted to take the pillows with me for the rest of our European vacation. (I am a very picky pillow person, so that says a lot!)

Food/beverage: We ordered room service. It came promptly, and was hot & delicious.  With so many options in Dublin, we chose to dine offsite for the remainder of our meals. 

Location: This hotel is close to Grafton Street and the Temple Bar area. But it's a cab ride not walking distance. The wonderful gentlemen at valet always summoned a cab for us with no wait longer than a few minutes. Calling down before we left our room ensured one was waiting as we walked out the door. 

Overall: I'm a traveller that values consistency and quality. This hotel checked all the boxes for me - friendly employees, comfortable bed/pillows, shower with great water pressure, speedy and tasty room service. Definitely recommend this hotel!",5,2017,08,30
205,Hard to fault!,"Excellent building in a great location.  The lounge/bar areas are plus.  The gym is excellent - loads equipment and I've never had to queue for anything (I've stayed here around 50 nights this year so far).
Brilliant staff - they all seem to be warm, they appear to care about guests, and they always go out of their way to help.
The room service menu is pretty good, food comes promptly.
I've not had many meals or used the bar much, but overall I love this place!",5,2017,08,29
205,Very Helpful,"I wasn't actually staying in the hotel but my shoe broke in the Ice Bar on a night out during the Dublin Horse Show. I went to the front desk to ask for glue or something to temporarily fix it as it was early in the night, and the people at the front desk called the handy man (at least I think that's who he was!?) and he glued it for me! They also gave me a pair of hotel slippers to wear while I was waiting for the glue to dry (which were so comfy!). They were so nice and helpful, lovely service, especially during a very busy week.",4,2017,08,24
205,Spacious luxury,"Stayed for one night at weekend.  It is a spacious luxurious oasis away form the hustle and bustle of Dublin city life.
Grand spacious rooms throughout the hotel.

Very comfortable furniture throughout.
Breakfast up to 11am - very appropriate.",5,2017,08,23
205,Gets better and better!,"A huge thank you yet again to all the staff at the Intercontinental in Dublin!
I need to give an extra special thank you to Michelle in the spa for giving me the best treatment with the Summer Bliss special. I was so relaxed and ready to face Tayto park with my hubby and 4 Kids the next day!
Keep on doing what you are doing",5,2017,08,21
205,Evening drinks,"This hotel was close to our B&B , lovely area staff friendly. Fantastic bar, charming piano player would stay and recommend to call in for drinks . 
Fantastic selection of gin and tonics 
Stylish hotel 
Great staff ",5,2017,08,20
205,Below expectations ,"Just returned from a one night business stay at the Intercontinental) ex Four Seasons ).
Check in was professional and friendly and I proceeded to my room which was nicely presented albeit slightly old fashioned in parts. 
The quality of face cloths and towels would be more akin to 3 star hotel quality.
I met some friends in the bar that evening and whilst table service was present I waited some time for my pint.
I ordered a second pint and when I tasted this I knew it tasted poorly. I handed it back and whilst they were apologetic I had to wait 20 minutes for a replacement .
Breakfast was poor also , the hot food was not hot and was just lukewarm 
Overall I didn't have a 5 star experience despite big price . ",3,2017,08,18
205,"Lovely hotel, slightly spoiled by guests","Stayed for two nights on a business trip. Room was newly refurbished from what I could tell, exceptionally large for a city hotel and very comfortable. The room was quiet despite hotels location on two reasonably busy roads. Check in was smooth, and all the staff encountered during stay were very friendly. 

The only negative for the stay was an experience in the lounge / bar. Long story short, there were some extremely loud and obnoxious guests in the lounge, who were drunk when I arrived and still being served several hours later. Everyone who came into the lounge migrated into the bar until the tables there were full. Staff were aware of the issue as they made several comments to me about it. Shame they couldn't deal with it to minimise the impact on the majority of guests, who were trying to enjoy dinner and drinks. 

I would absolutely stay here again - hopefully the other crowd won't be back!!",4,2017,08,16
205,Intercontinental Dublin,"All staff members except one at the Intercontinental were friendly, professional and more than accommodating to any questions/inquiries/requests during my stay at the Hotel.  Room very clean, fresh linens and spacious. Each staff member was well groomed each day.  Great bar area and the food from the restaurant very good. ",5,2017,08,15
205,"""One night only""","We just had one overnight and not a lot of time. The rooms were very nice and certainly very comfortable. We had room service as we were too tired to go to the dining room. Food was good and service perfect.
We found a little confusion with our booking at the reception desk and that was the only negative.",4,2017,08,14
205,Deserves the 5 *,"Stayed 5 nights during Dublin Horse Show, which is a challenge for any hotel... full house of guests plus overflowing restaurants and bars every night. I must say they handled it flawlessly!

Service in every area was outstanding. Hotel remained clean and tidy despite the crowds in the evening. Rooms and halls were kept spotless. Just careful, thoughtful 5* service all around and we appreciated it. You get what you pay for, and we did.",5,2017,08,14
205,A fantastic Hotel to stay,"A beautiful  hotel to stay i stayed for 18 nights and its definitely a memorable stay, the staff management were so wonderful that it becomes a beautiful family  to say, its in a wonderful quite location with a Spar and few nice restaurants near by i will definitely be back...",5,2017,08,13
205,One problem ,"This is a fantastic hotel and has the potential of being the best. But they need to pay more attention to there service and managing in the food and beverage side of the business. The staff in front house give 100%  5 star service and there colleagues in house keeping the same but food and beverage service for me and a few others on Sunday was a disaster even on Monday morning at breakfast no milk or sugar on our table we had to ask staff to bring us the basics we needed to have with our breakfast.
So the problems we had on Sunday ran into Monday. 
The hotel room was fabulous as was  our check in and out. Location fantastic. Food excellent. The concierge people very welcoming and helpful.   ",4,2017,08,08
205,Wonderful hotel,"I've stayed at the IC Dublin three times and it just keeps getting better (and it was excellent to begin with).  The service is outstanding - helpful, friendly, good humored.  I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Dublin.  

Plus the location is great.  Lots of good restaurants in walking distance.  It's a short cab ride into the heart of the city.  ",5,2017,08,07
205,Afternoon G&T experience,"Myself and my fiancé were warmly welcomed yesterday to a fantastic afternoon tea experience with a twist to celebrate our recent engagement. We both chose the crafted g&t cocktail which was served in a teapot accompanied by garnishes of apple, cucumber and a delicious ginger sugar syrup to start. The presentation wasn't just what you'd expect from a 5* hotel it was much more than that, with twists on all the classics adding character and giving the elegant afternoon tea a shake up and a refreshing relevance. The classic ham&cheese was served on tomato bread and topped with goats cheese & cucumber, the pork belly was phenomenal, there was a Caesar taco which both looked and tasted fantastic but the showstopper came in the form of a foie gras & white chocolate lollipop which was a taste sensation- a must try before you die kinda thing!! Sweet treats were equally as impressive with a selection of strawberry eclairs, salted caramel macaroons and ginger meringue cones but the gin infused panna cotta was the talking piece, served with tonic foam and cucumber caviar it took real will power not to lick the bowl!! 

As an overall experience can't recommend it enough, the manager Nicky(who took the time to congratulate us in person and offer us complimentary prosecco) and his team are doing a fantastic job. Our server Gabor could not do enough for us, he made us feel so special and really topped off what was an amazing experience overall. ",5,2017,08,06
205,The great place to stay in Dublin 4,"Returned to Dublin for a quick business / leisure trip and once again, the Intercontinental was a great place to stay. 

The hotel is bright, airy and spotless, and is classy without ever being over-bearing or uptight. 

The rooms are lovely, with great linens and toiletries. Wifi is good. Pool is great. Bar is small but good (and the good weather meant we enjoyed drinks outside) and the restaurant has recently revamped its breakfast offering which was already really good. 

Staff all seem friendly and open. Huge shout out to the lovely lady who greeted us for breakfast.",4,2017,08,05
205,"Excellent property, away from city center","If you're okay not staying in city center, this is a fantastic property. Very large, beautifully appointed rooms; excellent service and food; and a beautiful pool and workout facility. Would stay again. ",5,2017,08,04
205,Great Place to Stay!!,I stayed here recently for 2 nights and had a brilliant experience.The hotel staff were so friendly and helpful with recommendations etc. The rooms are amazing and the beds are so comfy. Could not fault anything with the stay and this is definitely my 1st choice when I am in Dublin. Thank you to all the team at the Intercontinental!!,5,2017,08,04
205,Simply Stunning,Stayed here for one night during a short trip to Dublin. Good location just a short taxi journey from the city centre . Staff were kind and welcoming and the hotel itself is just stunning. Beautiful rooms which are immaculately kept and breakfast had everything you could ask for including yummie pancakes. I only wish we could have stayed longer .,5,2017,08,03
205,The Best in  Dublin,"This hotel deserves a 10+ for its excellent customer service, overall  ambience  and a perfect meeting place for a conference.  The buffet breakfast was a treat with its offerings of an omelette made to your owns specifications, lovely fresh fruit, veggies and pastries.   It was a great beginning for each day we were there.   I'm ready for a return trip.",5,2017,08,02
205,Amazing hotel with top-notch service,"This was the perfect stay for our last night in Ireland before flying home the next morning.  The staff was very attentive and friendly.  Our suite was beautiful, spacious, comfortable.  We especially loved opening the balcony doors - it truly is an incredible place.

We also accessed both the gym and pool/hot tub and both were wonderful.

The Lobby Bar was bustling but the servers handled it very well and we felt that our service was very attentive even though they were busy.  The food was excellent!

I can't say enough about this place, I highly recommend it for a 5-star retreat while in Dublin.",5,2017,08,01
205,Five star from check in to check out,"Stayed one night recently in this elegant property.  Treated like royalty at check in.  Had booked an executive suite with separate living area, quite spacious and lovely views of the gardens. We dined in the Lobby Lounge and both the food and service were excellent.  Likewise at breakfast, great buffet in a beautiful dining space.  Loved the antiques and ornaments located in the public areas, especially the turtles! ",5,2017,08,01
205,Overpriced sloppy service,"Stayed for 4 nights for a mixed business and weekend break. The hotel has a great feel, and on first impressions at the front desk are very professional. The rooms are of excellent quality, you have everything you need. My problem with the hotel is it falls down with very sloppy service. We ordered room service on two occasions, and it didn't arrive, when you called to question, the line was constantly busy. Breakfast was dysfunctional it took forever for the staff to take your order, and when they did on two days running the wrong order was eventually delivered. Upon check out I was presented with a bill for 2000 euros, very expensive, I was asked if everything was OK. I clearly said no, and was promised a call back from the manager. A week later I'm still waiting. I've posted a review on the IHG website, where the hotel has an excellent score of 4.6 out of 5.0. My review was blocked. Don't stay unless you want an expensive hotel, with sloppy service.",1,2017,07,23
205,5 Star Perfection!,"We stayed at the Intercontinental Dublin for two nights.  The room was comfortable, spacious and luxurious.  Service was impeccable.  Our room wasn't ready, I think they just needed to put the rollaway bed in for my daughter.  It was maybe a 10-15 minute wait at most so we were given a drink on the house in the lounge.  Little touches like this really make the difference!  Loved the pool and spa.  

On a side note, the train station is a 3 minute walk and you can take the train into the city centre(short walk from station) and other locations.  We chose to take the train to the lovely fishing village of Howth which offered great hiking with amazing views.",5,2017,07,21
205,Amazing Hotel,"Just got back from two nights at InterContinental Dublin. We had a wonderful stay. Friendly staff, great Irish breakfast and very comfortable beds. I highly recommend this hotel. Although it is a bit far from the city center, but it's worth the distance. The area is plush, beautiful and very safe. Thank you InterContinental for making our stay a memorable one!",5,2017,07,20
205,The perfect example of a five star hotel.,"From the moment you step over the threshold you know you are in a special place... a place of luxury,  a place of  impeccable service, a place of tranquility. I thoroughly enjoyed my recent stay at the Intercontinental, no request is too much, the food and service could not be any better. Nicky Logue and his team do a wonderful job of making you feel welcome and spoiling you. I will be back. Thank you :-)",5,2017,07,20
205,SPACIOUS AND CLEAN HOTEL,"Clean and spacious rooms.Courteous staff.Lounge food was very good.
room service was prompt.Amenities  like swimming pool,suana and steam room was very clean.Hotel is located in nice neighborhood and within reach to all main tourist attraction.",5,2017,07,20
205,off the beaten path on Dublin's embassy row,"lovely hotel which used to be the Four Seasons. Great breakfast, well designed room with high quality bed. Not that convenient to centre city but still easily accessible to centre and airport. Decent wifi, cordial, knowledgeable staff. ",5,2017,07,19
205,Ideal for staying in Dublin with great service.,"Very clean and spacious hotel with great facilities - definitely try the Spa.  Rooms have great beds and are very well equipped and impressive.  The restaurant offers great food to suit most tastes.  We both enjoyed dinner and breakfast was a real treat.  This hotel is in a great location and is always good for celebrity spotting, if that's of interest.  Great staff especially Syeed and Nicky Logue (GM) - a real pleasure to meet them both.  They make you feel very welcome.",5,2017,07,19
205,great stay,"We loved our stay at this hotel. The property was amazing. The food was fantastic. The staff was beyond helpful. Housekeeping accidentally removed my wife's personal pillow.  They went above and beyond to return it clean and pressed. The only issue was our bed. There was a huge hump in the middle of our king sized mattress so my wife and I could not sleep next to each other. I asked the front desk and housekeeping to look into the matter on separate days, and they both promised to look into it. But it never was resolved and no followed up regarding it. Other than that issue, we had a fantastic stay.",4,2017,07,19
205,"Excellent. Good room, good gym.","I had a very short stay here, and it was wonderful.
I appreciate that it is not downtown. The train station is a 5 minute walk, it will take about 10 minutes or so to get to down town, or it is a 45 minute walk to Temple Bar.

Check in/out easy.
I normally do not really like the soft beds, however here, I did not want to get out of it. Wonderful.
A/C was cold enough and colder than a lot of hotels in Europe. Thank you.
Bathroom amenities were great.

Very nice gym set up, with a good variety of equipment to get a good work out in.
They also have a spa/sauna set up which I did not use.

Breakfast was good, (not fantastic) and reasonably priced.

Great service from all staff.

In short, great stay, repeatable.",5,2017,07,19
205,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed 2 nights.Lovely room plenty of space.The quietest hotel stay ever.Never once heard a sound from the rooms on either side or the corridor.
Had food in the bar both nights which was very good quality with enough choice for all 3 of us.Excellent choice at breakfast.",5,2017,07,18
205,A sumptuous hotel with first class service,"We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. I am Ambassador Member and we were upgraded to Junior Suite, the room was available from 12:30 as we arrived early. The staff were very friendly and efficient, the public areas are so elegant and comfortable, especially the Whisky Bar, and very spacious. All the furniture and flower arrangements all so tastefully chosen. Breakfasts offered plenty of choice including the omelette station. The indoor swimming pool was a good size, recommend to go after 6pm when it tends to be quiet. 
I would say that the room rates are expensive, much more so than, say Frankfurt Inter-Continental which is also centrally located, this hotel is a fair way out of the city centre, a good 45 minutes walk to Trinity College, otherwise there is a reliable and frequent bus service in to the city.",4,2017,07,18
205,Dublin,Great hotel.  Service in resterant and bar was slow but friendly.  My daughters and myself enjoyed the area.  Rooms and amenities were excellent.  In a great area and on the tour bus route.  Easy to get any where in the city.  Would recommend hotel and hope to return someday.,4,2017,07,17
205,Excellent accommodations and location!,"While I only got to stay there one night, it was really nice. The location is only a few minutes away from downtown, and the hotel staff and accommodations were very nice. From the time we pulled up, the bell hops were friendly and helpful. The front desk greeted us with a smile and hello. The room was more spacious than most European hotels, and it was clean and functional. ",5,2017,07,16
205,Upscale Hotel But Away From City Centre,"We just stayed here this past week while attending a conference and overall enjoyed our stay. The hotel's public areas and rooms are immaculate. Very professional yet friendly service. Enjoyable full breakfast buffet that is included in the price of the room. There were a couple of issues that kept me from giving it a rating of 5 especially when factoring in the cost of staying at this property. I was surprised by the lack of sound proofing between rooms. We could clearly hear everything the occupant in the adjoining room was saying as if he was in our room. He was on the phone talking at a normal volume. For me when traveling, location is key. Because of the conference held at the hotel, it made sense to stay here and if you are in Dublin for business, then staying out in Ballsbridge might be just fine. However, as a tourist, I would prefer to be in the city centre where everything of interest is to be found. It's about a 10-15 min taxi ride into town and would cost between 10-15 Euro. There is a city bus that stops nearby on the main road which was very convenient. Bus 4 or 7 takes you into the center of town at a cost of 2.70. There is also a DART commuter train about a 10 min walk away.",4,2017,07,15
205,Last time staying here.I am really annoyed with this hotel,Stayed last weekend for two nights (Eleven times I've stayed) now but this was not a great visit and paid over 800 euro for it.The room and bedroom were as always very clean but I had a huge problem with the air con like a previous reviewer.It would not stay on with the result we were awake half the night as the duvets were winter ones.I see no turn down service anymore(not a problem for me but just an observation)The breakfast is really substandard for a supposedly 5 star hotel.The toaster was a joke and not a raspberry or strawberry in sight...Cheap cheap cheap.You should visit my Bed and Breakfast to see a proper breakfast.At least Saturday morning had trained staff but it was all students  on Sunday who hadn't a clue how to serve....The  Bar staff were good ...I thought Two young ladies from Co Down and Tyrone were great ...were very pleasant My biggest gripe was the 11 Euro charged to my credit card after my departure...I phone Sunday night and was told it was something I took from the mini bar.I explained that I didn't go near that bar as I know how crazy the prices are.I was told Id be refunded immediately and that they would email me to confirm same Five days later ...NOTHING.Please people check everything before you leave.Im furious as It's the principal here. it's only 11 Euro but after all they got from me and I really did not use the mini bar.End of story and sadder still end of love affair at the once WONDERFUL FOUR SEASONS HOTEL.Dont be fooled that it is still 5 star.It is not,3,2017,07,13
205,Generally good with a few caveats.,"Stayed a few nights while attending a conference held in the hotel. Nice common areas and generally spacious, well appointed rooms. Somewhat outside the city centre which in theory did not matter in this case, however continuous drizzling rain and cold wind did not encourage venturing out. Pleasant and friendly attitude notwithstanding, it took over 20 min for the reception staff to find my reservation (not sure if the fault was with the event organisers or otherwise). Service in the lounge area could be slow and spotty. The spa seemed very popular with no availability for certain treatments without a reservation booked well in advance.",4,2017,07,12
205,Not a five star hotel,"Great location. Great room, really big bathroom - air conditioning doesnt work so if you want a nice nights sleep under a heavy duvet don't choose to stay in summertime. Hotel feels like it's in need of redecoration. Breakfast very poor standard as is the breakfast area and getting tea/coffee takes a while! Service in bar/lounge area very slow. Room rate too expensive, doesn't include breakfast and breakfast is too expensive for what's on offer. Not too impressed.",3,2017,07,11
205,Delightful Hotel - Smart & Elegant,"Visited this excellent hotel for an overnight while attending a concert in Trinity. The hotel is a €15 taxi drive from Grafton Street but worth the fare. The hotel is smart and elegant with quality furnishings and lovely circulation areas. The staff are welcoming and our executive room was spacious and very well stocked, with robes, slippers and fridge etc. The bathroom was also very spacious and the extensive breakfast was delightful with a chef to cook eggs/omelettes etc. Don't hesitate to visit the lovely hotel, it's a real gem! It's  a bit like old money versus the flashy nouveau riche and the old money wins hands down every time. Can't wait to return!",5,2017,07,11
205,Still great ,"I have stayed at this hotel in the past when it was managed by a different company and enjoyed many happy and successful stays over the years. I hadn't been to Dublin for a couple of years so had some reservations about what I might find on my return now that Intercontinental have taken it over. What I found was it's still a great property with some of the original staff still working there. Some aesthetic changes (decor) and updates (like improved wifi) and still relatively generously proportioned room sizes. The location works really well for me as it's close to the city Centre but still far enough away to enjoy the beautiful scenery in that neighborhood. There are some small issues to work on and improve but the staff that I worked with were very friendly, pleasant and efficient and they took my feedback and acted on it so I and my group left as  very happy customers who are likely to return. There's a great running circuit that takes you along the beach of Dublin Bay and through the local neighborhood with its diverse and impressive properties so if you enjoy a run, this is a great hotel for you. There are nice shops, bars and restaurants nearby so I really like staying here. I didn't eat in the restaurant but I heard good reports from my colleagues and the staff always went the extra mile so I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel. Great work team! ",4,2017,07,11
205,"Great Hotel, but a bit outside the city","The hotel was terrific (only complaint is a missed wake-up call).  We had 2 rooms (one king and one with 2 queens).  Both were large, bright, and comfortable (the King was huge with  3 sets of large windows).  The staff was excellent.  Breakfast was very good but expensive (28Euros/pp, kids were cheaper).  We used room service one night and it was pretty good.  
While the locations was not great (not an easy walk to anything) it was near city bus stops and there was a hop on/ hop off bus that stopped immediately across from the entrance to the hotel.  Cab fare was about 18 Euros to downtown.
A few restaurants in Ballsbridge were near the hotel, but the closest was about a 15 minute walk.",4,2017,07,10
205,Ireland ,"This hotel is very nice.  Room are larger than your typical European hotel.  Great location.  The hop On/Off bus stops in front of the hotel.  
My only complaint was my reception at the front desk.  One snobbish girl working the front desk was quite rude and unapproachable.  After waiting 45 minutes for our rooms everyone received their room except me.  I was asked to wait another 15 minutes.  
When you're tired and had a long trip you lose your patience.  But I didn't.  Her behavior is not acceptable, she will not take my joy for being in Ireland.  It's a beautiful Country and there are always something to be grateful even when you encounter nasty people.  
",4,2017,07,10
205,"Used to be great, now not so","I've stayed at this hotel before when it was the Four Seasons and I loved it, it was one of the best places I've stayed in. Since it became an Intercontinental, things have changed- most namely the attitude of the staff.
They used to be friendly and had a nothing was too much trouble attitude- not anymore. After going to a concert in town, my friends and I arrived back expecting to be able to order drinks and food as we had done previously. No such luck. We were told food stopped serving at 11 (despite this we saw other people arriving after us and still get food- does seem to be one rule for one and one rule for another) and then last drinks at 1- we had stayed up drinking much later than this previously. No lee way, no apology. It's meant to be a five star hotel- most five stars close the bar when demand dies down and demand was still there at this time.
The spa area has always been small but it's now getting to the stage when it needs a revamp.
Despite booking a room for three, we had to contact housekeeping several times for the third set of towels and for the third bed to be made up.
Breakfast is a redeeming feature as the choice is great and the omelette chef is amazing.
Will I go back? Unsure at the moment and until staffing attitudes are sorted, I wouldn't recommend it  ",3,2017,07,09
205,Luxury Hotel but not close to main attractions in Dublin,"The hotel was very nice and had all the ammenities that you would expect from a luxury hotel.  It was a  more than 2 miles away from Trinity College, so its a long walk to attractions.  Cabs and buses are readily available, but the bus routes are not well posted so ask at the hotel what buse(s) to take if you are traveling around.",4,2017,07,08
205,Fantastic hotel ,"Myself and my husband stayed at the intercontinental for three nights while attending a Bob Dylan concert. We got upgraded to an amazing, newly renovated suite, which we thoroughly enjoyed. The staff, as per usual with Intercontinental, were outstanding. I loved the location of this hotel, which is on the outskirts of the main hustle and bustle of Dublin but within easy walking distance. It is in a beautiful leafy area close to the big embassies and not far from the beach. This we took advantage of by going for a number of 5 mile runs. I would particularly like to thank one of the door guys (sadly don't know name but young and red haired) who was very friendly and had bottles of water ready when we returned to the hotel after a run. Yet again well done Intercontinental for a super stay. ",5,2017,07,07
205,A Perfect Stay,"We were in Dublin for one night and stayed in a beautifully appointed and decorated King Deluxe Room. As soon as the taxi pulled up, the door was opened for us and we were welcomed and greeted. I love a great bathroom, and this room had it. The first thing I did was get into a nice hot bath. The staff are very respectful, as you'd expect at a five star hotel, but I also felt a great warmth and friendliness from those we dealt with. I have the impression they really enjoy working here, which is a great credit to the hotel management. Breakfast arrived to the room at the precise time and was phenomenal - scrambled eggs, fluffy pancakes, fresh carrot juice, wholemeal toast, coffee. I can't wait to stay here again.",5,2017,07,06
205,"Nice folks, but TERRIBLE decorating in the rooms","I think they hired Liberace to redecorate this hotel -- after he died.  The rooms are completely over-designed with horrific colors and materials ... velvet chairs ... really?
I never felt comfortable here, and forget any idea of feng shui -- the energy is all off in the rooms.  My company booked me at this establishment -- never again if I can avoid it!",2,2017,07,04
205,Stay for best friends birthday !!,"My best friend and I booked in, they knew it was her birthday and gave us an upgrade to a newly refurbished executive queen room, it was gorgeous , spotless, beds and pillows were fabulous !!, the food was amazing as well, we have stayed before as well, one of the front desk staff Michelle was just the sweetest girl who was so attentive and was so pleasant at all times and was genuinely wanting you to have the most amazing stay, also Paul who was one of the front door men was fantastic as well, just so helpful and friendly",5,2017,07,04
205,Beautiful with problems,"Arrived on late flight. Night attendant didn't recognize the booking as I had made it and didn't want to look at my copy of the reservation. It was a cool start. My 10 euro tip to the baggage may have slighted him. He left without comment or an offer to explain items like the AC or other features.Most other staff were friendly and helpful, but the cleaning staff arrived after 5 pm, when we were returning from a long day. The main dining room was closed on Sundays and Mondays, changing my plans to invite guests to join us there. My worst experience was the brown ring around the top of the water in the pool and spa. Nice pool, otherwise. I had looked forward to a 5 star experience, but my 8th visit to Dublin became my least pleasant.",2,2017,07,03
205,Excellent All round!,"The staff at the front desk are possibly the most welcoming I have come across in Ireland. 

The hotel itself was very good and the suites are incredibly spacious. Perfect for a good nights rest and in a very good location.",5,2017,06,28
205,Excellent Hotel All Around,"One of the finest hotels I've visited amongst a fairly extensive variety of global experiences (over twenty years). Not a budget hotel by any means, but very good value for the price. 

Staff seems well equipped to handle all guests, even when special events like weddings are occurring. 

Location is fine. A couple miles from downtown but plenty of pub/restaurant options are close by, or a short bus/can ride takes you to the tourist areas.  

Their Irish breakfast is a bit pricey, but again, excellent. ",5,2017,06,25
205,Beautiful Hotel,"We had a spacious junior suite with a comfy bed, free Wi-Fi and very accommodating, polite staff. Daily breakfast in a bright spacious restaurant with many selections on the buffet and menu. Shout out to Jackie who was always friendly and cheerful.",5,2017,06,21
205,Weekend away ,Fabulous hotel in a lovely location. Would definitely stay here again. Beds amazing. Has breakfast here but had our evening meal out. About a 20 min walk into Dublin City centre or about €15 in a taxi. ,5,2017,06,20
205,Best Hotel in Dublin,I have stayed in Dublin before but thus time the hotel made the difference.  The Intercontinental was luxury plus it felt like home. The facility is posh and immaculate.  Service outstanding !!  The Ballsbridge area is good for restaurants and ease of location.  Cannot wait for my next stay here.,5,2017,06,20
205,Great Stay,"We stayed at the hotel in February 2017. It was a business trip. The hotel was booked prior and I should admit that the check in process was easy. Rooms was nice and clean with some good views. Good food , a excellent breakfast buffet.

Overall a great stay",4,2017,06,19
205,Great Hotel in an ideal location,"We have visited this Hotel on a number of occasions and have never been disappointed; it may seem a little expensive but we feel it is worth it,  the experience is very different to standard Hotels.

We are looking forward to going back again.   ",5,2017,06,14
205,Great Stay,"Great stay. Got bumped by another hotel and ended up here -- I am sure this was the better option! Really nice setup, close to cool things, and really nice staff. Check-in was really easy, we did not make it to the bar, but did manage to get some Guiness down the road        ",5,2017,06,13
205,"Lobby Lounge 1 *, Rest 5*","I stayed here with husband and daughter for one night this past weekend.  We had purchased a night with breakfast at a fundraiser.  It took 3 phone calls to get them to honor the voucher (no rooms available, can't find voucher code) but eventually this was rectified via the manager.  There were plenty of rooms available on the day via their website.  Our family live within walking distance so we use this hotel for family events and nights out.  Check-in was superb with excellent valet service and parking costing 25 euro per night.  Bags were brought to the room very quickly.  The rooms and lobby have been redecorated since the hotel was a Four Seasons and are much improved.  New soft furnishings and carpets were quite elegant.  The carpets in the  hallways are a little worn and are being replaced.  The rooms are big, comfortable and luxurious.  Could not complain or fault at all.  All toiletries were available as you would expect.  

As we were in Dublin to catch up with family returning from overseas, I tried to get a booking for 7 adults and 2 children in the restaurant for lunch or tea but they were booked out.  There was only a 5 top table available and this could not be converted to accommodate our larger party.  We were told we could order a la carte from the lounge menu.  This is where it all went wrong.  I approached a waiter and asked if it was ok to sit at a particular table and he just ignored me.  We sat there anyway and it took us flagging him down after 20 minutes to get a menu and an order in.  The kids were hungry.  The drink order then took another 20 min to arrive and lunch to be ordered.  Lunch took another 45 minutes to arrive and was incorrect.  I ordered pasta from the children's menu and it came plain with no sauce.  The pasta on the kids menu is ""penne with red red sauce""!.  The waiter then tried to tell me this is what I had requested.  He was unapologetic, borderline rude.  Needless to say we were there for the afternoon and each drink order took 20-30 minutes.  Ice in soft drinks was melted by the time drinks arrived.  We could see our orders sitting at the bar and my husband went up once or twice to bypass the wait staff.  I am not sure if they are understaffed, poorly trained or just indifferent.  Friends who live locally (walking distance) came to say hi and could not get over how bad service was.  They also complained independently of me.  

Overall the hotel is lovely but I will avoid the lounge in the future and book in a local restaurant of which there are nice ones aplenty.",4,2017,06,12
205,Excellent stay at Intercontinental Hotel Dublin,"We had a wonderfull stay at Intercontinental Hotel Dublin, the staff are very helpfull and friendly, the hotel is beautiful and well located.  The services provided were excellent.  As a Platinum Ambassador member we were upgraded to junior suite.  The spa was just what we needed after travelling for 5 weeks. Overall it is an excellent stay",5,2017,06,10
205,"Couldn't do enough for us, can't wait to go back.","From the moment we entered this hotel we knew we would be in for a treat. Dublin was the last stop on our two week trip around the Emerald Isle. Check in was smooth and we were told that we had received an upgrade to our delight. After we had freshened up we were lucky enough to meet Sorcha in the lobby area. She had extensive local knowledge, she spent at least 30 minutes with us helping us plan our last few days in Dublin. Thank you Sorcha for all your help. We didn't get a chance to sample the lunch or dinner in the hotel but we did get to have breakfast most mornings and it was tasty. The doormen were always available to help us with taxi's, Paul thank you. Well done intercontinental Dublin! We will be back!",5,2017,06,09
205,A lovely treat,"I had been promising herself that we'd visit the intercontinental for afternoon tea, for some time now. Last week I bit the bullet and booked. 

Now, it's not huge in terms of portions but as you slowly graze through the layers, it's surprising how full you begin to feel. 

The surroundings were opulent, the service was top class and the food was divine. I'd heard it's all about quality rather than quantity and despite my reservations, I quite agree. 

It was a delicious and elegant treat. I'd certainly return and as afternoon tea prices go, it isn't even expensive. ",5,2017,06,08
205,Gorgeous hotel,"My mum, dad and myself visited this hotel for a bite to eat whilst visiting Dublin for the day. We had previously stayed here before and thought it was great then, and we thought the food we had in the restaurant was gorgeous, and very reasonably priced. Myself and my dad had ribs in a barbecue sauce with chips; they were swimming in the sauce which was perfect, just enough.. and my mum had 'The Dubliner' sandwich which was ham, cheese and mustard on brioche bread with skinny fries. We all really enjoyed our meals and were very well treated by the staff - right from entering the hotel to leaving everybody was so lovely. 

10/10 - I would definately recommend and we will be back for sure.  ",5,2017,06,08
205,I could live here quite easily.,"I am lucky enough to have a long standing relationship with the InterContinental in Dublin (formally Four Seasons) over the past 10 years. We stay on average 8 to 10 times a year. We have tried various other Hotels in Dublin but none have lived up to the experience we have at the InterContinental. Initially with the changeover we really missed the staff that we had built up rapport with over the previous years but the new staff have filled some very big shoes very well.  The staff are exceptional, very attentive. 
When we enter the foyer, it just makes us extremely happy and you just know that the standard of service you will receive for the duration of your stay is going to be second to none. It's visually a beautiful hotel, the foyer with the fabulous flowers to the Lobby Lounge and the Reading Room. The perfect place to get comfy and just watch the world go by.
The rooms have been refurbished recently and on our last visit we were lucky enough to have the most amazing suite. Absolute class. The decor throughout is understated & elegant. It is thanks to this Hotel that I now have an addiction to all things Lemon Verbena :)  When we stay, we park up and never move the car until we are checking out, it's a real resort hotel to us, we dine, use the pool area etc and just savour all that the Hotel has to offer. We have been so lucky, we've had many, many happy times and celebrations here, and when our Family in Dublin visit us they always love the experience. It's such a treat. The food is delicious and the cocktails are amazing. We always go back, it's a well oiled machine and the new management are doing a wonderful job. 
I would move in in a heartbeat! Looking forward to returning soon. Keep up the good work.",5,2017,06,08
205,A little taste of heaven! ,"Where do I begin. We stayed in this beautiful hotel in March for the first time and was so impressed we returned this bank holiday Monday. Everything is 5 star from the moment you enter the hotel. If your looking for luxury in Dublin it's definitely the place to stay. The staff are so professional and friendly, they can't do enough for you. The rooms are spacious and clean with very nice soft duvets and pillows. Absolutely loved the marble bathrooms too! Breakfast has the best selection I have ever seen with a lovely blonde haired woman to greet you (wish I remember her name, thank you!) 
To the general manager, thank you for being a pure gentleman and looking after us. I cannot wait to return and hoping to book some spa treatments the next time! ",5,2017,06,07
205,Stunning Hotel with Fantastic Service,"I booked the Intercontinental for a special occasion last week. 
I haven't been to the hotel since it changed ownership from the Four Seasons - it has always been a top hotel in Dublin and the location was perfect for us.
On arrival, we were met by the concierge who were very helpful - inside, we were met by the most glorious huge bouquets of flowers in the foyer. It looks better than ever and am guessing has all been recently redecorated.
Ricardo in reception was efficient and very welcoming - they had taken note of the special occasion and gave their best wishes as well as giving us a complimentary upgrade which was unexpected and really appreciated. It's little touches like these that really make the experience so special and that kind of service is rare.
The suite itself was just beautiful - spacious, warm, welcoming and luxuriously decorated. It's definitely an upgrade from the previous Four Seasons decor.
Everything looked perfect and the champagne and chocolates we had arranged had been laid out just before we arrived.
The bed was huge, incredibly comfy and had the right mix of pillows to suit all needs.
The bathrooms were perfectly laid out and had so much space - the bath and shower were fab. Love also the L'Occitane toiletries, bergamot is a favourite of mine.
Breakfast was a wonderfully relaxing affair, again the staff and welcome were super and the dining room was beautiful and bright. We just went for the standard buffet and it was delicious.
All in all, we had such an amazing time and were spoiled rotten by the surroundings and great staff. We stayed in the Shelbourne recently enough and although that is another top hotel, the rooms and service didn't compare to that of the Intercontinental. Check out staff again were lovely to deal with.
Thank you so much for a wonderful stay - we will definitely be back and for a longer visit next time!",5,2017,06,06
205,Terrific Hotel !,The InterContinental was absolutely first class. The IC team was extremely friendly and helpful. They even upgraded our room to a two room suite. We stayed at several hotels during our stay in Ireland. The IC was our favorite! ,5,2017,06,05
205,Smooth sailing in Dublin,Had two separate stays here whilst in Ireland. Direct front desk staff. Rooms were very clean - no issue with 4th floor suite. Second floor suite had a cracked shower tile and some blackened grout/mold. Hallway on the second floor needs new carpet or repairs. Otherwise parking and doormen were very friendly and helpful. Convenient location within walking distance of AIB ATM (useful if you have a new chip) and many restaurants. Breakfast full Irish was satisfying and staff were attentive. Husband is a spire elite member so we were very happy with our accommodations. ,5,2017,06,05
205,Amazing & Relaxing time away ,"I stayed for one night with some family! It was excellent customer service from before we even arrived (every efficent in getting back to emails) to finished. Very professional check In from Michelle who was very helpful with questions I had, with all staff being so friendly. 

Easy access to the city centre and having your car in secure car park is a great addition. 

Can't wait to stay again! ",5,2017,06,05
205,A Big Step Forward,"The new management team has done an excellent job, since taking over for the 4 seasons group.  I have be staying at the hotel for two nights every quarter for the past 12 years and finally it is back to standards/quality I expect from such a property.  Well done.",4,2017,06,04
205,Enjoyable Evening Meal with a sting!,"We really like this hotel. We live nearby and are lucky to have such a venue on our doorstep. We had a lovely meal in The Lobby Lounge. Staff are pleasant, helpful and not intrusive. Having finished and paid for our meal we then had to pay for two hours parking.  It's not like we spent the evening there over a coffee. We had a meal with wine and tea. The venue isn't designed to be 'an eat & beat it' venue and to be advised there is 30 minutes complimentary parking is a bit rich. If one has a meal parking should be complimentary!",4,2017,06,03
205,Initially impressive but service inconsistent ,"We have been staying in Dublin for the week at the Intercontinental in Ballsbridge. This area is near the American Embassy and a long but reasonable stroll to downtown. The hotel has well managed grounds and most of the staff are polite and attentive although the service is very inconsistent. The hotel and rooms are nicely appointed. Unfortunately not all rooms have a great view of the gardens or grounds. Ours looked at the roof but at least we were on the go during the day. On entering the hotel lobby one sees the large tea room with a wonderful view of the garden. It reminded me of my grandmother's parlor with nice furniture. Most adults were enjoying tea, cocktails and snacks in the late afternoon. There was one family with two well behaved very young children. All was abruptly interrupted by two more families with young children. They were obviously to their children's behavior or didn't care. It must be against Irish law to tell parents not to let their children jump on the furniture and horseplay. At some point I thought the management would say something but to no avail. Moved outside to the garden but only to deal with the same issue. The bar area was quieter.
Overall a great location and well kept hotel except for the issues above.

",3,2017,06,03
205,Fabulous time ,"Stayed for the first time. Will definitely return. Had slight issue but with the kind help of Sorcha, it was taken care of quickly. Family friendly environment and staff were a delight! Spa is a must visit! ",5,2017,06,03
205,First Class ,Stayed for two nights on business and wish it could've been longer. A beautiful facility. Had a large suite with a balcony which was great in the evening. The gym and pool area was excellent. Enjoyed a sauna after the workout but the steam room could have been hotter. It's a long walk or a ride to the heart of the city but what a relaxing stay. I hope to be back.,5,2017,06,03
205,Fantastic ,"I have read some indifferent reviews and to be honest I cannot understand how this can be the case. The hotel is fabulous from the moment you walk in to the moment you leave. Food, service, facilities, ambience is superb. To give this hotel a 1  star is completely unreasonable and I would question what they were expecting.

The hotel is a definite 5 star there is nothing which could have been improved upon and I'll definitely return

Well done Intercontinental keep up the good work",5,2017,06,02
205,Consistently Great,"We have been enjoying little breaks here since it was The Four Seasons. You immediately are welcomed as old friends on checkin and it gets better with each staff member you meet. We met the new manager at breakfast one morning and our small man handed him coins for breakfast!😂 (his turn to pay) ! 
We will of course be returning as it's the finer details that draws us back each time!
Thank you ",5,2017,06,01
205,Wonderful and supper place,Fantastic staff and hotel.strongly recommended and sure I will not replace this hotel ever.you will not find better than this hotel in Dublin and the staff is too kindness and welcome. The location is very comfortable and accessible to all attractions.,5,2017,06,01
205,Bad experience,"I am not impressed with this intercontinental. I am actually disappointed. It started before arrival. I emailed the hotel just to get some info about the transportation from the airport to hotel. It took them 4 days to reply and when they did the info just didn't make any sense. So I replied to get some more specific and never received any response. 
We arrived after an overnight flight very tired and hoping to check in early. Didn't happened. Hotel was ""sold out"" so there is no room available. I got that. How about to rush a room for a gold member? No way. So we waited, made some calls, book some tours, hoping they might be more guest friendly and help us out with a room rush but obviously they don't really care. Front desk told us they will call when the room is ready. No one did. Or actually try did but we never received their call. We received all others except this one.  And back later in the afternoon to check in and find out the credit card I gave them in the morning doesn't work in their system so the hold what was made will sit on the add and I need to give them a different one. Now my money is on hold on 2 different cards. Luggage supposed to be delivered to our room prior checking in. Of course it wasn't. Bathroom is dirty, we find lot of hair all over which is disgusting. Bathtub wasn't cleaned for a while as hen you look at the top you cal literally see the dirt and dust. Now go and take a bath. NO THANKS. 
Security problem. St check in the front desk agent announced our room number loud. It not supposed to. They are only allowed to say the floor number. 
I was expecting more from the Intercontinental.",1,2017,06,01
205,Very enjoyable stay.,"Very enjoyable stay with the family. Staff are very attentive, breakfast was an excellent start to the day - tasty and healthy options, swimming facilities were perfect to splash away an hour. An easy going but very well run hotel.",5,2017,05,28
205,Very good hotel in Dublin !,Spent 7 days at Intercontinental to attend a conference. The hotel is located in a calm area of the city. The facilities are very food for business conferences or just for an extended weekend in the city.,4,2017,05,26
205,Not coming back!!!,"So this is the 4th time at the Intercontinental at Simmons's court, in each stay we have stayed for minimum of a week, each time we choose this hotel  because it's convenient to the meetings we need to go to, and it's good location, quiet and overall a beautiful property... however we have to say that the service each time we are back gets worse, it keeps going down.
Our first stay the hotel was under ownership transition from the ""Four Seasons"" to Intercontinental, so we were patient to some question marks over the service.

This year we stayed for a whole week again (May) , and we have decided it's time to look elsewhere.
The hotel seems under staff, in all areas, At breakfast it can be a good 10 min standing to be seated another 10 min to bring you the menu and another 10 min to get the food.
At the bar most nights there are at the most 3 people, to tend to the bar and lounge area, they are running off their feet.. and cannot keep up with orders of food or drink and naturally things are late or wrong..

During lunch time at the lounge things don't get much better... table unattended, tables waiting to be cleaned, and people waiting to be seated, once you are seated...arm yourself with patience, to order, then to get your food,  and to pay... the whole process is a game of trying to catch the attention of the running or non existence staff.

Housekeeping Department? NOT GOOD. they seem to do the minimum. Most days our room was serviced in the afternoon or not at all so i have to call after coming back at 4.30- 5 pm to request service. Many items do not get replaced (tissue- toilet trees etc) Used mugs and glasses are taken away but they don't bring clean ones,  so not a single cup in the room to drink water. The fridge is filthy (yes dirty, rusting away and puddles of brown water).
 The icing on the cake was when on my side of the bed a cut on my leg used some blood during the night, naturally the sheets have to be changed...so I left the bed open so the stained is clearly seen, we left for a walk we came back at 5pm, Room not done. I called housekeeping, they came, replaced towels and DID THE BED BUT NOT CHANGE THE SHEETS. At the end I gave up, I called for fresh sheets and did the bed myself.
Carpets look dirty, (they were renovating some of the rooms) so there bits of construction dust..that doesn't get taken care of for days... trays and dinners that I see on my way to breakfast waiting to be picked up outside on the corridor.. STILL THERE in the afternoon.... Again not enough people to tend to things.
At reception they have junior staff that don't seem to know what they are doing ever..
The old staff I recognized for the last 3 years are still lovely and trying their best, but they are doubling for 3 people running all over the place 

The Gym, hasn't been moped or dust for weeks... there are pretty big fluffy dust balls around and underneath each machine... so beware if you are allergic to dust.

Internet is very unstable, keeps logging off constantly.

Outside: the people to help you with your bags or get you a taxi are hit and miss....

It's such a shame to let go such a beautiful property, I hate doing such a negative review, but we have given it  enough tries and come disappointment. I hope the management can sort the HR issue soon, before it's too late.",2,2017,05,26
205,Home abroad,"One of the best city hotels I have ever visited. Luxurious with friendly and warm environment, the suite i have stayed in was amazing, well decorated and spacious. Nice breakfast with a lot of choices. For sure, I will be staying again once in Dublin",5,2017,05,25
205,Elegant,"If you are looking for a luxury hotel away from the crowded city, this is your place.  A fourty minute walk or 10 minute train ride will take you to the city.  Beautiful hotel, friendly staff and the surrounding area is just lovely.  I totally recommend this hotel.",5,2017,05,25
205,Beautiful room,"We picked this room when we booked with AAA, we got a good price & the hotel is beautiful.  The staff has been so helpful & friendly the only problem is we are just here for one night before we start a tour & I wish we were staying longer.",5,2017,05,25
205,Torn between 4 and 5 rating - a little bit worn here and there,"Good location, friendly welcome, nice big rooms with all the expected facilities for this * of hotel. Internet was tricky to log into but eventually got it. Excellent show shine service BTW! Only real gripe was the worn carpet on the way to the room - I was a long way from reception and couldn't help noticing the carpet joints being worn along the corridor. You just wouldn't ever see that in a Four Seasons for instance. The rest was very nice and the staff I interacted with were great but in a hotel like this the bar is high and things like this show. ",4,2017,05,23
205,"Luxurious Hotel, Great staff","a luxurious hotel with all the amenities available
very polite and helpful staff, spacious room, big flat screen tv, very comfortable bed/matress/pillow
the location is not very close to the city center, but it is in the most elegant area of Dublin
free wifi",5,2017,05,23
205,Short stay in Dublin ,"What a hotel, the attention to detail at this hotel is second to none. You just get that special feeling the min you enter. The Hotel itself is in a great location if you are visiting the RSD. I will for sure return again when back in Dublin. ",5,2017,05,23
205,Family occasion lunch,We were at the intercontinental last weekend for a family lunch for 22 including 8 kids. The staff could not have been more helpful or more welcoming. The food was really good - even the kids were impressed! It was a great. Highly recommended.,5,2017,05,23
205,Hospitality that cares,"This hotel ooozes hospitality and combines it with quality in all areas of your stay; including  bedroom, food, and bar facilities. Fantastic staff. A great location in leafy area of Dublin with access to park, public transport, etc",5,2017,05,23
205,Intercontinental Dublin,"Have visited here a few times now and each visit has been very enjoyable. Traditional and solid building and each bedroom I have stayed in has been very generously proportioned and well furnished.

Very handy for the Aviva stadium

Will happily revisit this hotel",4,2017,05,22
205,Couldn't have been better,"This was my third or fourth visit? I was upgraded to a most magnificent suite, huge living/dining room, bedroom, 2 bathrooms, even a kitchen, all just for me. Well, not cheap, but total luxury. 
All the staff were extremely friendly, efficient and helpful. Lovely food in lobby bar or room service. Easy free wifi, onsite parking. 
Not central, good for South Dublin area, RDS. 
Intercontinental has not lowered the Four Seasons standards. Congratulations!  
Only quibble- air con in my suite has a mind of its own !",5,2017,05,21
205,Classy hotel great location for the RDS but not cheap,"Stayed here whilst visiting the RDS which is next door to the hotel whist attending a conference, the hotel is classy and refined but you will pay 300 euros plus per night.
Breakfast is extra at 28 euros buffet style.
The rooms are nice with coffee machine and large shower and bath.
I ate in the restaurant but the service was slow but food was nice .
Bumped into Mark Owen from Take that who were all staying at the hotel for their concert show, 
The staff were great and a punctual alarm call was appreciated would stay here again",4,2017,05,18
205,Another wonderful visit,"It has to be said again that The Inter Continental Hotel Dublin cannot be surpassed for style, comfort and professional service.
The staff are professional and efficient and couldn't do enough for us during  our stay.
Second trip and hopefully many more to come.
Thanks a lot",5,2017,05,16
205,My mother said it was better than a facelift,"Just back from a relaxing weekend here with my mother. Mam said she looked in the mirror as she left and she looked 10 years younger. She did. From beginning to end, it was a lovely experience. On Friday we just had something light to eat at the bar and listened to the very talented piano player. 

The pembroke suite is fab. Really spacious with everything you might need. Normally i wake up in the middle of the night but i didn't here. Just so comfortable .The two bathrooms is a nice touch. We ate in Seasons on the Saturday night. I am still thinking about the oysters. I would highly recommend the wine matching.

Breakfast is very good too. The Lobster eggs benedict is one of the nicest breakfasts that i ever had. Service is friendly but unobtrusive.

The swimming pool was lovely and not too chlorinated. Mam and I both got massages which were great. Mam's maseuse was very kind and made sure that she was comfortable as Mam has a damaged hip.

We were late checking out but the reception staff were nice about it. one thing was put on the bill by mistake but taken off as soon as i explained.",5,2017,05,14
205,Hen party ,"Recently stayed in the Intercontinental hotel in Dublin for a small hen party. 
Have mixed feelings about this hotel. The building is very grand, the lobby and restaurants are fab, the rooms are dated, with small things like chipped doors and paint. We were staying in a suite which was very spacious and perfect for a group as we had a balcony and so all of us gathered there for pre drinks before heading into the city. 
The king size bed was amazingly comfortable, with clouds for pillows. The room toilettes also had conditioner which u would expect from a 5star. The correspondence was 100% prior to my visit, always got back to me and very polite however when we got there it was a bit all over the shop and what really annoyed me was that afternoon tea, spa treatments and brekkie was included in a package, however I just felt they were trying to catch you out for more adds on at every turn. Breakfast is included in the room rate however the menu supplied in the morning features a range of amazing choices but are all supplemented...I just thought it cheapened the whole 5 star experience. The afternoon tea was lovely, but again they gave us two options but only one was included in our package, which left me having to ask which one was included. I didn't like that as I felt like such a cheap skate having to tell everyone oh ye can only have option A ... The pool area is small but it was quiet so it was fine... overall I thought it was a lovely option for a short visit to dublin without having to stay in the middle of the city where hotel room rates have just gone crazy... 
Oh before I forget, Bruno mars was staying there and one of the girls met him, the first thing she said when we asked what he was like was that he was very short ha but apparently when big musicians play a gig in Dublin they either stay here or in the Shelbourne! Tip for ye ;-) 
So would I stay here again, ya I would, the staff were all lovely, the service was ok, the bed was great, just make sure to know what is actually included x ",4,2017,05,14
205,Excellent,"Hotel is amazing, room was really big. Spotless clean. Staff very friendly, great breakfast - buffet or can order from menu. Convenient for city centre. Parking costs €16 overnight. Would highly recommend and will stay again I hope",5,2017,05,11
205,Amazing stays thanks to Lauren!,"I recently stayed at the Intercontinental on Saturday 6th May, I couldn't of faulted this hotel in any way! I would like to say a massive thank you to Lauren for our beautiful upgrade as I had booked this hotel for my boyfriends birthday and Manny who had checked us in when we arrived at the hotel. The customer service was outstanding along with the food which we had of the lounge menu. Friendly staff throughout with everyone smiling. I look forward to returning to the hotel and I have recommended this hotel to everyone I have bumped into! 
Thanks again for our most amazing stay at the hotel and see use all again soon :)",5,2017,05,10
205,Surprise wedding anniversary stay,"Big let down. Very poor manner by reception staff (Alix) who behaved like a rude robot. My husband surprised me with a night away, the delight and anticipation were quickly wiped out by a very un-customer oriented staff member. It was a ""no can do attitude""!!! Takes the good out of the trip and don't really want to stay here now!! Pay a lot to stay here so deserve to be treated like we matter!! This is not how you treat a regular, repeat customer. Also no room ready at three, the check in time!!",2,2017,05,06
205,my 50 birthday,"It was the best night of my life My sister brought me there for my birthday 
We dressed in ball gowns went into the lounge had drinks had our dinner in the dining room

The staff were excellant

It was a while ago but I still remember it soo well thank you all soo much",5,2017,05,04
205,Beautiful Property you and the flies will enjoy....,"The Intercontinental is a beautiful hotel strategically located next to a conference center in the District 4 of Dublin. The property is nice, and the hotel management need to pay more attention to certain details that would be important to the guests staying there. The places where guests will relax and plan to spend time after a hard day of work are in need of help. Let's start with the bar area which also is supposed to serve food, during my stay there was one bar attender working like crazy and obviously looking stressed out which made a few guests give up on staying longer in the place, also, it should be unacceptable to share your drinks and food with flies of any kind on a bar or restaurant in a so called 5 star hotel, and unfortunately i had to waive flies away from my drinks so we wold not enjoy a good beverage together. One more thing is the fact that some of the front desk employees displayed some sort of a rude attitude if a question or request that is out of the ordinary is made to them, i had a guest with me and the guy asked for a parking stamp which he had the day before and he thought it was a normal practice while visiting a guest, and he was treated with rudeness as if he was trying to still 6 Euros from the hotel, i was with him and i was embarrassed, i told the front desk person to just bill his parking to my room and then they saw i was an Elite Member of the IHG program and with no apologies they offer to stamp his ticket but not before giving him a lecture. this kind of attitude may be a reflection of how the hotel management may be treating  their guests. In the restaurant, the large one, which is very nice, and it has plenty of people to serve a nice meal, we could have a great review, except for the again flies in the buffet area during breakfast. My review is 3 stars until we solve the pest control problems, and train the employees to better treat the people approaching them in the front desk. Honestly, in the current setting, the only reason to stay in this hotel is convenience to attend a trade show around the corner, other wise, i would go downtown where you find better hotels, less expensive, and in better location.",3,2017,05,02
205,Comfortable,"The hotel has everything you need. Restaurants, pool, spa in a comfortable setting. The rooms are not spectacular although certainly fine. It was quite cold during our stay and we were grateful to be able to spend quite a bit of time in the hotel which had everything we would need. The staff at the Intercontinental is almost always top notch and their Dublin location staff was wonderful,",4,2017,04,27
205,Excellent Meeting Place,"Lounge area great place to meet someone for a catch up or meeting. Easy to park. Very friendly & attentive staff. Good menu, recommend the wrap.
Good value for money, nice buzz and mix of people about. Great alternative than meeting in the city centre
  ",5,2017,04,27
205,Pleasantly surprised,"We spent 5 days at the Intercontinental Dublin, over the Easter weekend.  This was our first trip to Ireland, and we were overall happy with our stay and pleasantly surprised. While the location is out of the city centre, and we spent a fortune on taxis, it was very beneficial to be a quiet neighbourhood.

The good things: 

1)This was a former Four Seasons, so you can still see and enjoy the benefits of the large bathrooms, nice linens, etc. The executive rooms were newly updated and spacious for most of the room, however, the chair area was a bit congested with three chairs crammed into a small space. Oh, and it was super quiet most of the time.  
2) The staff were all very courteous and pleasant. 
3) High tea was a really lovely experience, and we received excellent customer service from Grainne. 
4) Bar staff were great and friendly. Thanks to Zvjezdan and Roza. 

The things that could be improved:

1) Lots of unattended children over the Easter break. A girl rolling around the lobby and dinning room with roller skates on during Easter Sunday High Tea.. front desk staff didn't say a thing. Kids literally climbing up on the bar, only to be rescued by a random customer (not staff). Parents not really paying much attention to the misadventure of their children and this was a theme. One of our five nights was ruined by two excessively rambunctious small boys placed in the room next to us.  This could have been prevented if there was consideration to placing families in a more considerate way. We lost sleep due to this family.
2) We ate in the main lounge several times. Service seemed to suffer a little each day, with too few staff to cover the amount of people. The staff worked very hard, and should  be commended for their efforts.  Managers should schedule more staff to cover peak times like Easter weekend. 
3) Bar menu was really below par.  Cold and inedible steak and calamari.  Think this was an issue with the number of people, and the inability of the food runner to get the food out quickly enough.

Overall, the staff were friendly and tried very hard, the rooms are great, high tea is excellent.  Adjust your expectations for the dinner menu, and be careful of holidays and peak times.",4,2017,04,26
205,Very disappointing for five star hotel,"Given this hotel was previously a Four Seasons, I expected a much better level of service than what was provided.  While the common areas are decorated to a high standard, the rooms are a bit tired, as a number of other reviewers have mentioned.  However, the biggest issue by far was the quality of the wait staff in the restaurants. Every meal was a frustrating experience as although most (but not all) of the staff are friendly and appear well meaning, they are just overwhelmed. The first day we ordered lunch in the lounge area as the main restaurant is not open for lunch and despite ordering just two bowls of soup and a cheese plate, the soup for one guest arrived twenty minutes before the other and required no fewer than requests to three staff members.  Breakfast the next morning was chaotic; coffee had to be repeatedly requested, toast arrived without butter, silverware was missing-all in all, not a five star experience.  Unfortunately, breakfast the next morning was even worse, with a twenty minute queue to even sit down despite the number of empty tables. The wait staff take an order, and then return a few minutes later to ask again what you have ordered.  Others run the food in from the kitchen, clueless as to what orders go to what tables-the guests actually have to identify their meals.  A bagel with smoked salmon and cream cheese was 6.00 euro on Friday and 13.00 on Sunday, and the bagel was cold, soggy, and with only a trace of cream cheese.  Although we were offered breakfast on a complimentary basis after commenting on the wait, we would have much rather enjoyed our meals and paid for them.

 All in all, I have stayed at four star hotels across Ireland with much better service and food than the Inter-Continental.  The service in the rooms was only marginally better-although clean an opened, half-empty bottle of water remained on top of my minibar from when I first entered the room until I checked out.  There is little to no attention to those little details that make a stay at a five star hotel so special.  This felt like an experience at a mid-range chain that could be located anywhere.",3,2017,04,24
205,Good but not great !,"I have stayed here on a few occasions previously (even reviewed it once before) all while under the four seasons name. The hotel is much the same, room decor has been updated in places with large bed heads and colourful arm chairs etc, all very pleasing on the eye. So what was it about this stay that didn't match up to previous ? The lack of that 5 star customer service which has always been fantastic here previously, no offer of assistance with bags on check in, no turn down service and having to pay for parking (never had to previously !). Great hotels are made so by there attention to detail and outstanding customer service, if the intercontinental wants to remain in this league they need to pull up there socks I m afraid. ",4,2017,04,24
205,Pleasant first class hotel,"We very much enjoyed our four-night-stay in this hotel - pleasant atmosphere, helpful staff and delicious breakfast. We also enjoyed the small pool and jacuzzi particularly since the weather in Dublin was a bit rainy during our stay. The room was comfortable and relatively quiet except some noise from the neighboring room - however, we travelled with kids so I'm sure we produced some noise too...  The hotel is situated in a quiet area (only a limited amount of restaurants nearby) and easily reached from the airport even by bus. It's also easy and recommended to walk to the seaside, Sandymount - at least we enjoyed our stroll there.",5,2017,04,24
205," What a Wonderful hotel","On embassy row,  so it's a bit away from city centre.    It's a beautiful, elegant hotel,  excellent food,  lovely,  mostly young staff and we love our room, big, beautiful bathroom and the most comfortable bed  I've ever slept on. Easy transportation to downtown. ",5,2017,04,21
205,We found our 'pot of gold',"I just returned from our company conference in Dublin. We had the pleasure of staying at the Intercontinental Dublin. This is a 10 out of 10 property!

From the moment you pull up to this property you know you are in store for an amazing experience. This is truly a Five Star property.

You are only about a 9 minute cab ride from the centre of the city, with the Temple Bar being only 15 minutes away. The location of this hotel is perfect, set in the Ballsbridge area.

The rooms are spacious,modern and clean with a separate walk in shower. The lounge is very relaxing and the bartender will show you how to pour the perfect pint of Guinness.

The staff is very friendly....very much like Canadians...but with an accent!! It all starts at the top with General Manager Nicky Logue. Talk  about a 'roll-up-your-sleeves' individual.

Nicky was ever present, ensuring that our conference went off without a 'hitch' even assisting when my wife's bag was...delayed. By the way, airports never say they 'lost' your luggage, it is always 'delayed'.

He has assemble a proactive Team that is schooled in service. This was evident with Nick Hall, Management of Lunch and Dinner Service. He was the person behind both our successful welcome luncheon and farewell dinner.

Kudos to both Syed Rizvi (Food and Beverage Director) and Bob Spillane (Restuarant Manager).

Also, a big thank you to  Gaurav Joshi (Front office) for the help to get our Team settled after a long flight from Canada.

And of course, Katherine Oliver, the meeting and events coordinator.....who had day-to-day responsibility for the smooth flow of our meeting/trip agenda.

I was pleasantly surprised with this hotel as well as the weather...I didn't rain at all when we where there!! Talk about luck of the Irish.

If you are ever considering a trip to Europe, consider Dublin....and if you do, stay at the Intercontinental Dublin. Tell Nicky that Rob sent you and I am sure he will buy you a Guinness...he may even let you pour it!

205,First Class Hotel in great location,"This hotel lived up to the Intercontinental name, and provided high levels of service and quality througout our stay.  The location of the hotel is right in Ballsbridge, which offers a wide variety of shops and restaurants.",5,2017,04,21
205,A Lovely Hotel ,"A beautiful hotel located in a great,calm part of Dublin. The service was exceptional. The only blemish was the very slow service in the lobby lounge on Thursday morning. Not helpful for staff member Ida to blame ""new mgmt"". 

Other than that impeccable.",5,2017,04,20
205,Fabulous,"Everything about this hotel is top class from the minute you drive in the building is so beautiful, staff everywhere to help you with luggage doors, etc... Check-in was quick and easy. Our room was beautiful with a huge bathroom and excellent powerful shower. Normally I don't sleep very well in hotels as I usually find them noisy (I'm a light sleeper) I had the best sleep! No noise, such a comfy bed, with luxurious duvet, no housekeepers knocking on our door. Breakfast was delicious the next morning, our server was super friendly. We just loved the whole experience.",5,2017,04,20
205,"""intercontinental at Dublin""","We were absolutely amazed at how we as a family were treated at this wonderful hotel
As we were fortunate enough to have stayed at this property in the past when it was Four Seasons we decided to return to see if it could be as good.
We were not disappointed from when we arrived until we left our family had a truly enjoyable stay made possible from all the wonderful staff employed there. 
The rooms allocated to us  were ""stunning"" recently re designed and luxuriously
finished 
Service at both restaurant and bars were faultless  total professionalism shown by all staff in which we met
So if you have not yet stayed at the ""Intercontinental Dublin"" its definitely worth doing so.Great selection of food and drinks available very competitively priced.",5,2017,04,18
205,Fab hotel rude staff with communication difficulties ,"I will start off with positive! And this is going to be long. And please know that I don't come on and give so much negative comments I just feel so upset with how the staff was with us.  I had really high expectations for this hotel we would normally stay at powerscourt hotel for Easter but this year we decided to come here. 

Myself and my husband stayed here for two days over Easter. Hotel is fab looking room is beautiful and bed is so comfortable food is stunning we had afternoon tea which was lovely. 

On checking in at the desk the reception girl was lovely very pleasant and polite but when we asked a few Q's she did not know the answers. we wanted to have afternoon tea and I had booked in for a wash and blow dry at 330 we arrived at the hotel at 230 we where told that afternoon tea was finished at 4 but it was actually finished at 5 so we rushed the afternoon tea. I just think that if the receptionist knew the times of things it would be much more comfortable and this is down to management and how there communicating with there staff!
In the evening we went down to the bar and they had a special cocktail the Cadbury creme egg which looked fab in the pic so I'm a lover of cocktails I was really looking forward to that one so I ordered it. oh god where do I start. with the bar staff the boy was so inexperienced behind the bar that he should have not been there. anyway we ordered and he brought down my drink in which he knocked the whole drink over my mobile phone he quickly took the drink back and made me another one and when he brought it back over I did not get an apology or is my phone working nothing! And the drink he gave me resembled nothing like the pic of the cocktail I wanted so when my husband asked if it was that cocktail he replied there too hard to make and we have no eggs left to stick on the side of your glass we have been busy making them all day we have no eggs left which was a blatant lie!!!! I was then so upset to see a lady behind the bar making the cocktail I had asked for and making it correctly and with all the trimmings like the egg the bar man said there was none left (angry face) 
This comment is so long needless to say the staff seem to not like there jobs and they all seem to hate one another because they where all bickering at the bar it was so uncomfortable. 
The next morning my husband went to get us some more teabags for the room there was no one at the trolley but when she came out of a room her rudeness to my husband when he asked if it was possible to have some teabags for the room to which she literally barked at him holding her hand up in a stop sign saying wait there I will get you some she went into another room and took some and wen she handed them to my husband she asked do you not have any teabags in your room?! 
This stay would have been so much better if the staff where so much more pleasant I really do believe that the staff are that way because there is no proper communication. 

I think if someone goes and stays a night in the powerscourt hotel and take note of how there staff treat there guests then this hotel would be onto a winner!!!

205,Outstanding hotel in a quiet location,"The hotel is in a quiet location away from the center of the city. We easily traveled to the city center via bus and this location enabled us to get a break from the hustle and bustle of the city when we wanted to.

The hotel property is beautiful and the staff is knowledgeable, helpful and friendly. Our room was spacious and comfortable.

We enjoyed our short stay and definitely recommend it for a comfortable and luxurious experience.",5,2017,04,16
205,Outstanding hotel,"A superb hotel set in a very quiet part of Dublin but only a short journey to the city centre, coastal areas or the beauty of the Wicklow Mountains.  The close proximity to the DART system and the regular route buses means little is inaccessible.  Very highly trained staff who ensure a trouble free stay.",5,2017,04,14
205,"Really nice hotel, would definately return","A quick overnight stay for 2 escaping parents in need of a break. We stayed in the hotel briefly before heading out for dinner, than checked out early to explore Dublin, so didn't really avail of the spa or restaurant facilities. 
We had stayed previously when the Hotel was still under the Four Seasons name, and the hotel has changed a lot since then. 
Furnishings and fittings of very high quality, and our room was great.
We did order some drinks off room service, which arrived quickly and we charged to the room. A slightly panicked phone call was made to the room at 11:20pm from room service as we were not asked to provide any payment details at check in (room was pre-paid), and I was asked to phone reception immediately. I asked could it wait until morning, but was asked to call now. Called reception, was fine, and told I could settle in the morning. I understood the situation, but didn't appreciate being woken by the phone call.

Anyway, wouldn't be enough to put me off, as the hotel was lovely and staff were excellent. Look forward to returning for a longer stay at some point.",4,2017,04,14
205,Very nice,"This is a well kept property with excellent service. Our king room was spacious and the bathroom was gorgeous with a separate shower and soaking tub. We had a nice harbor view and the room was very quiet considering how busy the street can be. 

The location is good, but not really walkable to downtown. There are pubs and restaurants nearby, as well as a pharmacy, etc. The Dart station is very close and offers easy transportation into town. We walked to Sandymount village, which is lovely.",5,2017,04,13
205,Quiet Perfection ,"The hotel was lovely. Large room, nice amenities. A spa was available if you so desired. A sitting room for drinks and dining as well as a proper dining room and bar. The service especially nice and prompt. The bathroom was very spacious with separate shower and tub. Would definitely stay again. ",5,2017,04,13
205,Excellent Hotel,"We had a wonderful stay whilst at the InterContinental, staff were very friendly and the rooms were excellent. The area in which the hotel is situated is a perfect location, close to Dublin city centre but also outside near some wonderful cafe's/bars. I have stayed at a number of the hotels in Dublin and feel this one is at the top with great amenities. Would recommend a stay here for sure.",5,2017,04,12
205,Much improved since Four Seasons days,"I was hesitant about staying at the much hailed refurbed Intercontinental Hotel, my experience of the previous foregoer was to put it mildly not great, a marathon 2 hours and 45 minutes for dinner, really poor customer service, food overcooked, and so forth. 
It didn't start well, when the hotel is busy the car park is full, and a staying guest I had to go round and round the car park for about half an hour before I got a space, surely priority should be given to those overnighting? Fearing the worst, I was pleasantly surprised from there on in, the refurb was clean, contemporary yet tones of traditional, the rooms were great, super comfy beds, lined luxurious, proper shower, a real treat. The customer service was much improved, and I was really impressed with the food, and despite we were a large group were all served despite christmas busy period, were served in a short time frame. Yes it can be a victim of its won success, what Hotel isn't? But give them the opportunity to look after you and they will, well done all at the Intercontinental.",4,2017,04,11
205,Afternoon tea ,"Had afternoon tea here with my sister last week. Excellent and reasonable rate €30. Afternoon tea is something I love and aware it's a treat. Great scones and little wraps and desserts.
Friendly staff. Nicky the new manager who has taken over in the past few months was very good and a lovely atmosphere.  ",5,2017,04,11
205,Superb,"A beautiful hotel with very welcoming staff.  The rooms were large and spacious and the hotel itself is vast yet it feels homely.  The SPA and facilities were excellent.  It took us about 30 minutes to walk to the city centre and it's only 10 minutes in a taxi which cost us €13

We would most certainly recommend. ",5,2017,04,10
205,Lovely Hotel,"I recently stayed at the InterContinental after attending an event in their ballroom. Great bedrooms - comfy bed, big shower, lovely breakfast. The reception staff were very helpful. 
The food on the night was lovely & the setting is beautiful. However the event staff weren't great - the dessert plates were left on our table for over an hour, I had to ask someone to clear away all the empty glasses & when I went to the bar for a drink the bartender served several staff members before even glancing in my direction.",4,2017,04,09
205,Exquisite Stay in Dublin,"I recently stayed five nights at the InterContinental Dublin in preparation for a July conference. The location is wonderful, near the Aviva stadium and Sandymount, a little village walking distance from the hotel. 

The room was well appointed and the staff very accommodating and friendly. I had an issue with my corporate credit card and had to return daily to see if the charge would run. The front desk staff were always ready to help.

Breakfast each morning in the Seasons Restaurant was wonderful. I ordered off the menu as well as had the breakfast buffet which has a great variety and was plentiful. The traditional brown bread was delicious and the selection of pastries was almost overwhelming! My colleagues enjoyed the scrambled eggs with salmon a couple of mornings and the portion of salmon on the plates was unbelievable! 

My only criticism (minor at that) is that was no way to use the hair dryer in the bathroom. I had to plug it in by the desk which put me just a bit further from the mirror to make the process of drying and styling my hair easy 

I didn't take advantage of the spa or fitness center on this trip but I plan to when I return in July. I'm excited to return to the InterContinental!",5,2017,04,08
205,Changed for the worst,"This was a great hotel but not anymore.  Totally different from what it was.  Cheap linen/towels, skimpy breakfast, impersonal service and too expensive for what it is.  How a place can change when they forget it should always be about the customer.  So sad.",2,2017,04,08
205,Great Experience,"Very nice experience in Dublin with my stay in Intercon Dublin. Very good service, clean rooms and very friendly staff as well. Well served hotel with many facilities like gym, spa ..etc. Its location is good where it requires only 15 min by car to down town like Trinity area. I highly recommend this hotel in Dublin.",5,2017,04,07
205,Good hotel but...,"Check in was quick and very pleasant. Reception staff and doormen are lovely. The room was extremely large with a lovely bathroom (with bath and separate shower). The location is very good. Tea/coffee facilities are provided but coffee packs provided are cheap and weak. Decor is starting to fray around the edges. All pillows were feather pillows which is appalling - the thought of how they were made is disgusting (hence 3 star review rating), i was so tired that i only realised when the quill part pricked the back of my head. Alternatives are available on request. There was a constant humming noise outside (like AC perhaps) so I had to wear ear plugs to get to sleep but heard no other noise throughout stay. Unfortunately I didn't have time to use any other facilities. ",3,2017,04,06
205,Lovely hotel in nice part of Dublin,"We had a brief 1 night stay here recently and wished we could have stayed longer! Big spacious bedroom, large bathroom with separate shower and bath. All the facilities you would expect from a 5 star hotel. Nice views over the front of the hotel and also the neighbouring Clayton Ballsbridge Hotel.
Staff all very pleasant.
Nice swimming pool, if not very big. Good changing rooms, very clean.
Hotel allowed us to check in very early which was a real bonus as we had travelled overnight and needed some rest.
I would certainly stay here again if visiting Dublin.
It was our first experience of a InterContinental Hotel and we were not disappointed...",5,2017,04,05
205,Beautiful Hotel Classy Hotel,"I stayed here during St Patricks day celebrations and our stay was very pleasant.
Location is not too far from the Temple Bar about 10 mins by cab (10-15euro).
Beautiful entrance with a bar with piano.
There were a lot of festivity people while I was staying there but was really nice and classy.
rooms are well sized.
They have a nice indoor swiming pool and spa which I recommend you to check out.

Guiness pie at the restaurant is delicious and staff are friendly.",5,2017,04,04
205,Wonderful place to stay in Dublin,"The beds were very comfortable, the amenities in the room and bathroom could not be beat.  View of garden and the little bit of the ocean was fantastic.  I wish we would have stayed her our whole 2 weeks we were in Ireland.  Clean, Clean, Clean, comfortable, quiet.  My husband stated the spa/pool area was great as well but I did not go down.",5,2017,04,03
205,Stunning hotel with that wow factor,"One of the most luxurious hotels I have visited. Decadent rooms/restaurant, bar, sitting areas, beautiful cherry blossom gardens, great staff and one of the most stand out swimming pools/spa. Really enjoyed this stay with a young toddler. We got a roll out bed which was perfect. Room very large and offered an extra fridge. Would recommend this for a family stay as Dublin has so much to offer as part of a short family break.",5,2017,04,01
205,Classy,"Spent three nights here on a business trip and loved it. 

In terms of location, the InterContinental Dublin is ideally situated in the heart of Dublin 4 - within 5m walking distance of the RDS and 10 mins from Lansdowne Road etc. Saturday was a lovely sunny spring morning so I walked from the hotel to the downtown area and Trinity College and that took me a little over 30 mins. (Of course, cabs and Ubers are available!) 

The hotel itself feels five star - beautifully decorated with large floral displays. Staff were friendly and knowledgable. 

My room was spacious with a view overlooking the RDS. Bed-linens, towels etc. were top class - what you'd expect from an InterContinental.

The lobby area was busy and full and life (the InterContinental Dublin is used for weddings and proximity to RDS and Lansdowne Road means that it becomes a hub on match days).

Food was good, bar area was great - big shout out to Chris, the bartender and an honourable mention to Sali who worked his socks off ALONE in the bar on Friday night when there'd been an international on at Lansdowne Road - that's my only complaint, really,  - they needed more staff on busy nights!

Throw in a medium-sized swimming pool and a great spa and it's one of those hotels where you think: ""I could live here...""",5,2017,04,01
205,Special venue,"I attended a large business function here and the food was excellent with invisible service, very accommodating of special dietary requirements. The only downside with this venue is that the smoking area is some distance from the function room, so you can end up with a significant portion of the guests spending the evening there. Good choice for a function overall. ",5,2017,03,31
205,Two nights at the Intercon.,"This was five star all round. Room, food service were all first class. The only  glitch was the ice machine on the third floor was not working. This was reported and a bucket of ice was delivered to my room within minutes. Great service.",5,2017,03,31
205,"Top Notch Hotel, but a little isolated","The Intercontinental is a great 5 star hotel.   It features nice big rooms, a memorable (for all the right reasons) breakfast and attentive friendly staff.   Its situationed in a quiet part of town which is good from a noise point of view but not so good in terms of the money you'll be spending on taxis getting in and out of the centre of dublin. 

If you're looking for somewhere quiet and luxurous then, I would recommend it, but if you're going to be spending time in the middle of Dublin, then I would suggest booking something on St Stephens Green which is much more central.",4,2017,03,30
205,"Great location, great service! I would definitely recommend it.","Great experience of good quality service, great location. The check in experience is one of the best, made us feel like the guests are the most important. Rooms are very comfortable and clean. Congratulations to all the staff, that is the way to make guests feel at home..",5,2017,03,28
205,Enjoyable and Pleasant visit,"Stayed at the hotel for a special birthday with friends, all the staff from the moment we checked in was very nice, helpful, and friendly. Always on hand for assistance and pleasant to deal with.

The rooms are spacious and in good condition. We ate lunch in the lounge bar and the food was very nice.  I would definitely stay again. Thank You.",5,2017,03,28
205,Great location for the Aviva,"From the moment we arrived until we left we were made to feel welcome,Excellent spacious room, bonus that the spa and fitness centre had no restrictions on children so we made full use of both, grounds were beautiful, great hotel to people watch!!",5,2017,03,28
205,"Great hotel, but noisy above ballroom","Excellent location for the Aviva stadium, nice grounds, quiet neighbourhood. Friendly check-in had kindly upgraded room to a suite. Pay for breakfast at check-in to save €10 a day. Good bathroom with bath and shower. Very comfortable bed. Breakfast is well done, good choice of hot and cold buffet plus a la carte (Ballsbridge eggs Benedict were excellent). Friedlt service throughout. Second night disturbed by wedding disco music til 2:30am. However following complaint the room was discounted for the night which was a satisfactory outcome. Would stay again but ask for a room away from the functions suite. ",4,2017,03,26
205,Still feels like the Four Seasons,"I was disappointed when the Four Seasons left but in fairness to the InterConti group they have really kept up the standards in this lovely hotel. Looking at the fellow guest the hotel seems to service the old school rich of Dublin. The only reason i don't stay more often is its not close to town centre as its set up to service the RDS. You creational get what you pay for and the service, rooms and Bar are superb.",5,2017,03,26
205,Lovely Hotel,"Upon arrival we met the concierge who explained the price between valet and parking. 
Reception is stunning and the staff are all very friendly, our room was ready so we could head straight up. 
Entering the room we noticed that it was very spacious and clean, the bathroom was lovely and again very clean. 
We went to the ice bar and had a drink which was quiet and nice. 
Due to medical requirements I needed to eat early so we pre booked a table in the lounge, my wife ordered the fish and chips, I decided on the burger. They arrived and presentation was very nice, it's a shame the food wasn't the same. My wife's was warm but cold peas and my burger arrived freezing, I ordered a side of onion rings which also arrived freezing. I mentioned to the manager whose name I cannot remember but he was such a gentleman and took my burger to re-plate as it was cold. When it came back, it was the same burger just heated and it wasn't as fresh. 
To be fair they took them off the bill but I was still hungry which was a shame. 

All in all this is an amazing hotel and I normally would stay in the Clontarf castle when I am in Dublin, but I am thinking of  staying here during my next stay in June. 

It is just a shame that you have to book through other websites to get the best deal. 

Location is great and very welcoming to families.

205,Fantastic Hotel,"As you drive up to the hotel the grounds are beautiful-abloom with daffodils and crocuses. The doormen are always attentive, calling you by your names,and hailing you a taxi in a flash! The check in was fast and the  front desk personnel are very helpful in answering your questions and making suggestions. We had the concierge make dinner reservations for us, some within walking distance, and they were all fantastic. Also within a short walk there is a street with pubs and good restaurants. Our room was spacious with 2 views, and nice amenities. The bar and lounge are very comfortable with excellent drinks and friendly waitstaff. Frankly, everyone at the hotel is so nice and helpful and really make you feel welcome. If in Dublin, I would stay here in a heartbeat- everything was top notch.",5,2017,03,23
205,Delicious cocktails!,"Stayed on a Saturday evening and would absolutely recommend it. The lady on reception was lovely, the room was very opulent & pillows amazing! Great atmosphere in the lounge with pianist playing, perfect while enjoying the delicious cocktails!
A lovely breakfast was served to the room the next morning.",4,2017,03,23
205,Good in places,"Stayed on Sunday night with partner to celebrate my birthday, asked for upgrade which didn't get, which considering it was a Sunday I was surprised couldn't be arranged. There was a happy birthday plate in the room which was a nice little touch. Staff seemed very young and quite inexperienced in places. Dinner was nice although room was so dark we had to move tables in order to read the menu and people on next table had to use their phone torch in order to read it. Spa good, breakfast mediocre.Not enough wow to justify being just out of town. ",3,2017,03,22
205,Brilliant Rugby Weekend ,"I stayed here over 3 days for the England v Ireland game as for St Patrick's Day . You couldn't fault the hotel in any way the rooms were superb with amazing lunch and dinner menu as will as being one of the most busy times of the whole year the service was also great . The spa is superb and is well worth a stay for anyone heading to Dublin 

I will be going back 😀",5,2017,03,21
205,Great time and amazing hotel,"This hotel is great and one of the best breakfasts I have ever had in a hotel.  The spa and pool were great, the Jacuzzi was very big.  Staff were very polite and would do anything they could to help.  A bit out of the city so you have to take a cab/bus into the town center but I think that just makes it even better! The concierge was great and got us a pocket map and drew on all the places to visit. Lovely and will certainly come back!",5,2017,03,20
205,another rugby weekend,"has to rate as one of the best in Dublin in every respect, from arrival until you leave everything is catered for in the best possible fashion. the staff were tremendous, friendly, couldnt do enough for you, bedroom and especially this time the airconditioning was just perfect",5,2017,03,20
205,The building is impressive:The staff even more so!,"This hotel has a large imposing architecture,marble and chandeliers abound , which could overwhelm a mediocre hospitality team .However the opposite is true of this hotel. The staff compliment their surroundings effortlessly and the overwhelming experience is one of 5 Star luxury.I stayed with my husband to attend the Opera. My stay at this Hotel was the highlight.
From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty. Check in was quick and friendly. Our room was very large and spacious with everything you could possibly need. We had drinks in the lobby lounge and the staff there was efficient and accommodating (thanks Linda ,who checked on us regularly to ensure impeccable service ). There was a subtle but definitive manager presence throughout the hotel. We spoke to Robert and Sorcha, who were readily available to recommend some fantastic bars and restaurants. The spa had a lovely tranquil atmosphere and was spotlessly clean as was the entire hotel a bug bear of mine I'm afraid.
This Hotel is old fashioned 5 star luxury and everyone working there seems to be aware of this. Only sorry we couldn't stay longer.
We would 100% recommend this hotel. Can't wait to go back.",5,2017,03,11
205,"Good location, reasonable service but overpriced","Was here for a regional meeting and was surprised that the rate was a tad high, compared to other places I have been before.

The location was convenient for evening walks to restaurants and the meeting rooms were good. 

However, service was not attentive, even at breakfast, where requests for the 1st cup of coffee had to made more than once.

Food in the hotel was ok, but like the rooms, not the best value for money.

Overall ok, but will think twice about coming back.",4,2017,03,11
205,Five star quality!,"A wonderful hotel on the outskirts of Dublin City. This hotel will deliver much more in terms of bedroom size than the other city center five star hotels. Service is impeccable throughout the hotel and breakfast was excellent. 

The location means that you can take a leisurely walk into the center of Dublin and a taxi back for about €10. You will have the benefit of access to a number of parks adjacent to the hotel. Ideally located for access to the Aviva Stadium or the RDS.",5,2017,03,10
205,Secluded tranquility ,"Although easily accessed via bus or train, there really isn't anything nearby. However we enjoyed a quiet weekend here with almost everything needed. Rooms are beautiful and service excellent. The pool is big and also has a hot jacuzzi. Too bad the saunas weren't working. Breakfast was plentiful and the lobby bar also serves great dinner or coffee and cakes at a reasonable price. They even had a live pianist, which was brilliant! Our welcoming letter mentioned a free payperview movie, but they didn't actually have any, which was too bad as we already had planned on a movie evening. Otherwise I would definitely recommend this for a weekend getaway.",4,2017,03,06
205,Trip to Dublin,Easy access to central Dublin and parks. Handy for RDS and Dart.  Comfortable large room with minibar and large bathroom with bath and seperate shower. Tea and coffee tray. Free WiFi for one guest which is unusual used to free WiFi in hotels I have visited all over the world.,5,2017,03,04
205,5 STAR PLAIN DUBLIN HOTEL,"5 star hotel which lacks a cosy,friendly feel,long corridors,rooms are big,but not sure it works for us compared to other Dublin 5 star places too stay,the lounge/bar menu is far too short in its offerings,service at times can be pushed to be fair,but as a customer it's not my problem,so I would vote too stay at other hotels that offer quicker,livelier service but that's my opinion and maybe not for us but maybe for you ",5,2017,03,02
205,Lovely hotel in leafy Ballsbridge.,"This is a lovely hotel which gives excellent service. The bedroom was huge, bed was really comfortable and amenities good. The public rooms are large and luxurious and the breakfast was very good, with a designated egg chef. Just the right way to start the day.

We stayed on business and needed to go the RDS. This hotel couldn't be better situated for this and parking was reasonable for Dublin.

If you want to spend time in central Dublin all the time, this hotel is about 30 minutes walk, but it is on a main bus route.",4,2017,03,01
205,Is the service starting to slip?,"I have stayed in this hotel many times. The rooms are very spacious, comfortable and with excellent bath and shower facilities. The gym is well equipped and there is a good sized pool you can do lengths in. The meals in the lounge area are reasonable but I noticed on my last visit that the service appears to be slipping. There seem to be fewer staff than before and those that were there were very busy and therefore were struggling to give the diners adequate attention. I had a considerable wait before I could place an order and even longer one to get the bill. To be fair the meal was produced promptly. ",3,2017,03,01
205,Top Notch Stay in Dublin,"We were in Dublin for my father-in-laws birthday and had the pleasure of staying at the Intercontinental. We stayed in a Jr. Suite that was the size of an NYC apartment. The bed was super plush and we loved the over sized bathroom as well as the bath products; you can never go wrong with L'occitane bath products. We enjoined cocktails at the library bar and and I had my first real tea service with an amazing selection of teas and delicious tea sandwiches and pastries. Wish we were there more than 2 days, but we're already planning a return trip and will most definitely be staying at the Intercontinental.",4,2017,02,27
205,Loved  This Hotel,"Great hotel with the best staff we have come across. Nothing too much trouble, cheerful, friendly and helpful . We stayed here the Friday of a rugby weekend. The hotel was busy but this did not take away from the fantastic service.",5,2017,02,26
205,Weekend ,"Great hotel with excellent service.  Staff are very nice and very helpful.  Food is very good also and hotel is in a lovely part of Dublin.  I would highly recommend it here for family, romantic weekends or even business.  Room are very payed out with lots of space. ",5,2017,02,24
205,Fáilte,"So if my Irish Gaelic is correct -  Fáilte means ""Welcome"" and in one simple word this is how I felt during my stay at the Intercontinental Dublin.  Actually VERY Fáilte.

From my initial arrival, then each and every time I went out of the hotel and returned, to ALL the staff that I came into contact with during my four night stay - I was made and felt very welcome.  From the front desk team, the door men, the serving staff in the restaurant and bar - everyone was polite, efficient, friendly and welcoming and all are great ambassadors for the hotel and the IHG/Intercontinental brand.  Well done to the hotel team. Your positive, friendly attitudes made my stay.

So, on to other points of my stay:-

The hotel is classically styled and the decor very reminiscent of the previous hotel brand franchise.  

My suite was large and spacious, although the decor was I thought rather Chincy and somewhat dated.  That said it was spotlessly clean and the housekeeper did a great job of making the room look fresh and welcoming each day.  I understand that the rooms are being refurbished and my room may have not made the renovation schedule yet. 

I ate in the bar area on two evenings and found the menu varied and the two meals very tasty and good value.

For breakfast, in the restaurant,  the choice is either a buffet or you can order from the menu.  I fortunately had a room package with the breakfast buffet included.  I believe it was €30 per person otherwise and whilst the buffet was nice it was no way a €30 value.  I did wince once morning when a family with two teenagers turned up knowing that they were going to drop €120 for their breakfast. Yukes!

Location wise the hotel is south of the city.   I took the Dublin Bus into the city on one morning - the bus stop is close by on the main road outside the Clayton Hotel. Buses frequent and cheap.

The same stop is served by Aircoach 702/703 which I used for my return to Dublin airport on the last day of my trip.

Closest railway station is Sandycroft and just a 5 minute walk from the hotel.  I came back from Dublin city on the train.

There are a few restaurants and pubs about 5-8 minutes walk from the hotel and a local Spar convenience store the same distance if you need snacks/drinks etc.

All in all I had a very enjoyable stay at the hotel and would certainly return providing the rate was reasonable.",5,2017,02,24
205,"Very fancy, although...","The rooms and hotel were very nice. The rooms were clean, the staff was cheerful, and the hotel offered several great amenities. The rooms were also a lot larger than rooms I've had in London and Paris. The one draw back is that hotel is a bit older and it shows a little in the rooms. All-in-all, great hotel and a short ride to the heart of downtown.",4,2017,02,21
205,Meeting,"This was my first time to this hotel.
We were there for a meeting and all I can say is it was fantastic.
All the team that we met were very friendly and polite and had lots of information for us.
Our meeting room was very clean and all our refreshments were lovely.",5,2017,02,21
205,Lovely Hotel But.........,"We have a lovely stay here, rooms and staff were lovely. But the breakfast was Shocking especially for the price we paid for the night. We didnt get to sit in main breakfast area and were told we had to sit in lounge and have a make shift buffet breakfast...only 2choice of cereal, no juice or water, puddings and sausages were not cooked. It was very very bad for this Hotel.",2,2017,02,19
205,Afternoon Tea,"10 out of 10 from start to finish. We were greeted within minutes and shown to our lovely table with a view of the patio walled garden. The first thing that struck me was the pristine presentation of the table in the beautiful room just off the lobby lounge. I think we were lucky to have had a window table but it's clear to see that any table in the room would have been a treat to occupy. The crisp clean table cloth was set up with the beautiful crockery as we awaited our afternoon tea. We were spoiled with some delicious Valdo prosecco. When our afternoon tea arrived, I was beyond speechless. The unusual afternoon tea stand presented the array of beautiful sandwiches. It was so nice to see a colourful selection of sandwiches prepared on different types of bread. Above this tier of savoury delights was our selection of desserts. A crisp but soft eclair topped with fresh strawberry and chantilly cream, vanilla panna cotta topped with a thick, sweet mixed berry compote, beautifully presented with viola flower garnishes. Along with these beautiful desserts was a vanilla macaroon. Which in my opinion, was the cherry on top. I am not the biggest fan of macaroons but this home made treat was a pure delight. Not to mention our beautiful fruit scones accompanied by an array of preserves which included (classic jam and clotted cream) as well as a creamy bitter lemon curd and a mango chutney. The jars were left clean by the time we were finished with them! We were looked after mainly by Antonio, a very professional and friendly welcome to the lounge. The service was exceptional on his behalf and we were grateful to have been so well looked after and made a fuss of. 
Cannot recommend the Intercontinental Hotel enough for their outstanding afternoon tea experience. ",5,2017,02,19
205,Loved it:),We stayed her for a birthday treat last weekend and loved it. Lovely chocolates in our room on arrival which was a lovely surprise. We ate in the bar and the food was excellent as was the service from all the staff from check in to check out. Room was beautiful & Beds are so comfy had a great nites sleep only wish we didn't have to leave but will definately be back:) ,5,2017,02,15
205,Amazing experience!,"Stayed at the Intercontinental for 3 nights in Dublin and it is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in for the price paid. On arrival we were greeted by reception with the following information ' there were no double rooms available so we have upgraded you.........twice'

We ended up in a sumptuous suite with super king sized bed, dressing room, large luxurious bathroom and immaculate decor. The staff couldn't do enough to help, the food was fabulous and the hotel itself is really smart and impressive. Felt spoilt from start to finish and we definitely want to come back. The perfect stay! 

Really near the bars and restaurants of Landsdowne Rd and easy accessible Dart station around the corner from the hotel.",5,2017,02,15
205,Lovely visit,"Was recently at a meeting in this Hotel and stayed for some lunch. The hotel is beautiful and the staff were so friendly and helpful. The food was super and location is perfect , I would definitely recommend this Hotel.",5,2017,02,15
205,Weekend break,"Overall we found the hotel to be very good. Location was great close to the city & to the coast. The room was spacious & comfortable and was well stocked with amenities. 
The breakfast on both mornings was of a good standard. Sunday morning was a bit chaotic as it seemed everyone arrived to breakfast at the same time from 10.30am onwards. Grainne was very helpful & professional as she tried to smooth everything over & maintain good service. Dinner in the bar on Saturday evening was lovely, the food was delicious & the pianist playing added to the ambience. The service from all the lounge/bar staff was excellent. Check in & check out was also first class, the staff were courteous and friendly. Despite the couple of maintenance issues in the room I would definitely stay here again. ",4,2017,02,14
205,At Home in a Hotel,It was very nice to spend the weekend at this hotel. Mr Ricardo is a perfect host and he really made us feel at home and not in a hotel. If you stay at the Intercontinental ask to meet him at teh reception and I am sure he will warrantee the best hospitality the hotel can offer you and you will make a new friend in Dublin. THANK YOU RICARDO!,5,2017,02,13
205,One of the best hotels I've ever stayed in,"I brought my husband here as a Christmas present. 
One of the best decisions I've ever made hotels wise. 
The staff were all very friendly and courteous. We arrived a little before the stated check in time but they had a room ready for us. 
Nothing is too much trouble for the staff here. 
The room was lovely with a huge bathroom and separate toilet. 
There was a mini bar and tea/coffee making facilities in the room. 
Lovely fluffy robes and slippers are provided for your comfort. 
In my opinion the bed is one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in.
We did not eat in the hotel so I cannot comment on the food, but we did have drinks in the ""Whiskey bar"". 
The cocktails were excellent. 
I will definitely be making a return visit here in the future. ",5,2017,02,13
205,"Delicious breakfast, spacious rooms, good evening entertainment","Hotel has spacious rooms with massive bathrooms. Hotel was nicely decorated before Xmas, and there is a relaxing wellness area as well. Only downside is the hotel is slightly far away from central Dublin, but you do have the DART nearby which is quick and very easy to use.

Best breakfast I've had in Dublin with huge variety and great service. Delicious smoothies, chef custom makes Omelettes, and there is plenty of fruits and vegetables including avocados. The Irish soda bread is the tastiest I've had in Dublin.",5,2017,02,12
205,5*,"The Intercontinental was once the Four Seasons and has inherited the grand decor, large bedrooms and luxury marble bathrooms from that top end brand. Guests are maybe less pampered now, but the service is still very good, breakfast ample in the lovely dining room, drinks and more casual food in the very pleasant lobby bar with live piano at the weekend. Excellent room service. Super power free wifi, very quiet rooms. Only problem for some, not centrally located. ",5,2017,02,10
205,Great Hotel,"Cant believe some people are saying the staff are unfriendly, they were absolute stars before and during our stay. The hotel itself is beautiful and highly original, the bedroom was divine, very comfortable and the breakfast is incredible. Thanks to all the team for making our stay very special, we will return. The pool and gym are also a big plus.
",5,2017,02,07
205,Function & Overnight,"My wife and I attended a business lunch in The Intercontinental and stayed overnight, from the food to the staff were excellent not to mention the service, which I think was the best I've experienced in years. Happy to recommend for all occasions.",5,2017,02,07
205,Excellent if expensive hotel,"An excellent and even palatial hotel. What   You get is what you pay for . The staff are nice but maybe a little over the top. The food was good for our business lunch and the room service food was also good. 
Rooms are large . Can really recommend this hotel if someone else is paying! ",4,2017,02,06
205,Stunning Hotel with exceptional standards,We really enjoyed this fab hotel where they really get everything right! The only problem we now have is that we don't own the bed we had in the room (King size) which was sheer bliss. Have to say the staff were super friendly and really looked after us! Definitely 5 real and well earned stars for this hotel.,5,2017,02,04
205,Amazing Service,"What a turnaround! I am very impressed with my recent visit to Intercontinental. My previous visit for a conference two years ago was less than impressive to say the least but credit where credit is due, on this occasion I was blown away by the unfailingly high consistency and standard of service from the moment I walked in to the establishment. The concierge took my bags from me immediately after my drop off as he could see I was under a bit of pressure with them. Check in service was flawless and fast, I was greeted with a very warm smile. I had a meeting scheduled for the following morning in the Hibernia Suite so a refreshing night's sleep was paramount. I was upgraded to one of their recently refurbished rooms which was very well decorated and exceedingly comfortable. As they knew I was attending on business they had placed the latest paper and Business magazine in the room which I though was a fantastic touch. The meeting I had the next morning couldn't have run any smoother. The A/V manager popped in to ensure that all the equipment was working correctly well ahead of schedule and gave me clear instructions on how to operate the lights, sound and heating. Ania, the meeting and events manager was a pleasure to deal with and checked up on us regularly throughout the day. Lunch was delish and Nicky (the general manager) even popped over to say hello and ensure everything was running smoothly. I really cannot recommend this venue highly enough for the professionalism and service.",5,2017,02,02
205,Lovely hotel but more like a good 4*,"Stayed here when it was the four seasons me loved it. The standards have dropped. 
Slow checking in and then I had to ring down for bag to be sent up as I was waiting for 30mins or more.
I rang down to the bar to order a drink. I wanted it left on a table in the bar as a surprise for my father in law when he arrived as the stay was a surprise for him and my mother in law.
Phoned the bar twice but no answer, then rang reception and asked them to look after it. They transferred me to the bar and again no one answered. 
Ran down to order at the bar. Went back up to change and when I came down the drinks weren't there so the plan to surprise was a little bit disorganised as they arrived while I was ordering. 
I asked for natural fevertree with the Hendrick's and they provided a Schweppes . I asked again but they didn't understand what fevertree was and that the alternative at a minimum is slimline tonic!!!
There was a couple of little issues over all that took away from the 5* experience.
Rooms are tired and need a re vamp. 
Good location as we were in Roly's for dinner.
",4,2017,02,01
205,Luxury in Dublin!,"We spent three glorious nights here and should we find ourselves back in Dublin, this will be the place to stay, no need to try another place as this hotel has it all.  Classy with a warm atmosphere, our room was great and the breakfast is probably one of the best in the city.  The staff was all very courteous and helpful.  Since we were here in late November they had just started to put up Christmas décor and I would love to have been here for December 25th as what we saw was just the start of their holiday décor and it was truly wonderful.",5,2017,01,31
205,Your perfect 5* hotel in Dublin,"This hotel is located in Dublin 4 (north of the city) and is just perfect. It a old, nice historic building, very well kept. Everything is up to the Intercontinental standard. Rooms are very nice and very big. The bed, sofa, pillows are so soft, it's 100% guaranteed you will get a good rest. Breakfast is just perfect. Wifi works very well. Nice piano bar in the lobby. Very elegant and classy. It also has a nice gym, spa and pool. Good value for money. Will definitely stay here again.",5,2017,01,31
205,"STAFF EXCEPTIONALLY FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL, LOVELY HOTEL","room was lovely, requested a room with a balcony to which the hotel accommodated, spa and pool are amazing.  Staff at the reception couldnt do enough to help us out, door men were very mannerly and friendly",5,2017,01,30
205,Brunch,"Excellent brunch at Intercontinental Dublin today. Wonderful atmosphere, fabulous food and first rate service. Thanks to everyone at Intercontinental, we were very impressed at every level, well done. Best in Dublin. ",5,2017,01,29
205,Sheer luxury,"Beautiful rooms with ample space,clean and tidy and nicely decorated. Very good service with very helpful and friendly staff. Beds turned down each night, newspapers each morning. Even an expert piano player in the lounge! Excellent breakfast choices for all tastes, cooked as one wanted, buffet, continental and oriental.",5,2017,01,28
205,Really nice hotel,"Spent one night here recently and it really a luxurious establishment. The room was very spacious and comfortable. Service in both the reception, bar and later at dinner was excellent.

Food and its service in the restaurant both for dinner and breakfast was first class
Hopefully we will be able to return again.",4,2017,01,27
205,Lovely people and lovely place,"I lived nearby and used this place as my second home, the food was good and the staff lovely. I feel for the staff that joined when this was a 4 Seasons and now feel like they've taken a step down, however they operate the place like it's still a 4 seasons. So hats off to them",4,2017,01,26
205,Excellent Honeymoon ,"I am writing to express my appreciation for the quality of the service the hotel Intercontinental provide to my husband and I in our honeymoon day, during our stay at the InterContinental. 

I would like to comment how pleased we were with the service provided to us by front desk staff Ricardo. He were very helpful and deserve a great deal of praise for their excellent customer service, making our day even better and contributed to the excellent reputation of the Intercontinental Hotel. I don't believe we could experience better service in any hotel in Ireland. From start to finish – your staff Ricardo were exceptional, his really showed what's the extra mile about. I work with the public and am very aware as to how challenging it can be at times! and how you always hear complaints rather than compliments. I would not hesitate in recommending the Intercontinental Hotel and I thank you most sincerely for giving us treasured memories of this important day in our lives.
Everything was perfect! The reception, the room and the amenities in the room, the fantastic dinner, the amazing breakfast and the late check out. 
We really appreciate it.",5,2017,01,25
205,We always want to stay here when in Dublin,"Stayed here first when it was still a Four Seasons and they blew us away with every aspect in particular the front desk service. 
Have stayed three times since and it still excellent. 

Rooms are extremely spacious and comfortable, even the smaller ones. 

Breakfast is good although huge queues at breakfast post 10am on rugby days.  They should expand the area out into lobby on such days. 

Great location in nice part of Dublin, 8mins walk to the Dart which will take you into town or off to the coast.  
",5,2017,01,24
205,What a relaxing night ,"Last minute stay but what a gorgeous evening
Not used to staying solo but felt very comfortable dining and relaxing with newspaper 
Radomir at reception was very helpful and Carlos in the lounge was helpful and guided me to the perfect comfortable spot 
What a treat 
",5,2017,01,22
205,Pure luxury,"This is certainly pure luxury, the room was fab the restaurant was really good, the whole ambience lent itself to a relaxing break. The location is in the leafy Dublin 4 area right beside the famous RDS, just a short hop from the city centre.",5,2017,01,17
205,If you can please me you can please anyone,"Everything was terrific. I stayed at the Intercontinental in connection with a seminar I was organizing. The hotel is incredibly well run and everything happens like clockwork, largely due to the professional support provided by Katherine, the hotel's meeting and events manager. Nothing was too much trouble. It didn't matter what was needed, you asked and you got it. I think had I requested a Martian bearing a specialty dish from his planet then one would have appeared. If anything fazes them I didn't find it.

I can also recommend the afternoon tea, which was an indulgence my colleague and I felt we deserved. It was beautifully presented and our seminar meal was delicious also.

Although out of the centre of Dublin, for business purposes it is ideal as it has easy car parking for visitors.  So if you are considering the Intercontinental for a business event I can highly recommend it.",5,2017,01,17
205,The best bed I've ever slept in,"I travel a lot for work and leisure and this was the first time I've not wanted to get back to my own bed.  Just as well as we were there on our ""mini-moon"" a short (6 night) break immediately following our marriage.  The Intercontinental is big but friendly; ""cool"" but utterly warm in terms of the welcome and service; and stunning stylish with an ambiance of understated elegance.  If you like to be fussed over every minute this isn't the place for you; but if you need something sorted the minute you ask - then this is the place to be.  The spa and pool are lovely - world class; we really didn't want to leave.  The staff seem pleased to be there and genuinely friendly.  We'll be back!",5,2017,01,17
205,Excellent Throughout,This hotel offers high quality accommodation and is located in a great location. The staff are extremely friendly and efficient. The welcome we received upon checking-in was very warm and professional. The room had recently been refurbished and was very spacious and quiet. The bathroom was of a similar high standard. I would definitely stay at this property again and would recommend without hesitation. ,5,2017,01,17
205,Just a great upmarket hotel that delivers on its promise,"This was my first stay at the InterContintal in Dublin. While I stay in Dublin hotels on my monthly visits, the InterCon was always outside my price bracket (personal rather than a corporate expense !!). However it was January and prices reflected the seasonal quietness. 
I was so glad I decided to give the hotel a chance. Just a great place. The location is the beautiful suburb of Dublin 4. The exterior of the hotel is palatial and opulent. From the moment you enter the hotel you know you are somewhere special. The smiles and the greeting of the reception/check in staff was completely in keeping with the my initial impression. Broad smiles and a very warm willingness to help. 
Due to my Ambassador Club membership I got a room upgrade and was that another lovely surprise. Everything about the room was just fabulous. One of the cleanest, most comfortable and spacious rooms I have experienced in hotels around the world.
While I did not try the dining room, I had a number of casual brunches where the service, food quality and pricing all added to a feeling that you were getting excellent value. Just not what I expected as hotel food, in my experience, never tends to be as good as you would like. 
I did not want to leave after three days of 'wonderfullness'. I will definitely be back. Hard to pick the main reason but I think I will give it to the homeliness of the staff at the reception desk.",5,2017,01,16
205,Lobby food excellent ,Visited the hotel on Christmas week to catch up with a friend and we decided to eat in the lobby area rather than the restaurant.   The lobby was beautifully decorated for Christmas and staff were attentive and plentiful.   We had the burger which was fantastic.  Well presented and the best chips I had had in a long time.  We had two glasses of white wine expertly chilled.  Could not fault anything and will definitely visit again soon. ,5,2017,01,11
205,Average,"First stay at this hotel and quite disappointed. Being fortunate to stay in a number of five star hotels for work purposes, I really felt this fell short on a number of matters.

First of all I find paying for parking at such an establishment completely unacceptable. This is simply profit mongering. 

The breakfast service while friendly was under par, with a wait to be served tea and coffee and no clearing of crockery throughout a 45 minute breakfast. The self-serve coffee machine was out of service and took over ten minutes to be re-filled by staff.

The bar area is not pleasant, with tables not being cleared and a long wait for service. Christmas is of course a busy time but staff shortages, or inefficiencies, really were apparent.

Bedrooms were suffice, big bed and large bathroom. Cleanliness was fine except for an awful greasy window where the previous guest had had a field day drawing faces across the panes! It was hard to miss so a real fail for the cleaning staff not paying attention to detail.

Spa was nice but very few chairs surrounding the pool. Most likely a nightmare during busy times.",3,2017,01,10
205,Most Cosiest Bed Ever 🛏🛏🛏,"We booked to stay for three nights with breakfast included. Travelled down on train from Newry to Connolly Dublin. Train tickets booked online at £25 return. There is car parking at the hotel for 16 euros per night, so all in all train for us was best.
We got the dart from Connolly to Sandymount. Its 2.20 euros single journey or roughly 6.85 for two return.
Sandynount dart was literally a two to three minute walk to the InterContinental. 

On arrival you will appreciate the beatiful fountains and actual building. All very grand.
We were welcomed by Manny, he was very helpful and friendly.
Our room 309 was really lovely. Very very clean with a balcony looking on to the front of the hotel.
I must give credit to housekeeping. I think sometimes they get forgot about. They did an impressive job everyday..folding clothes..tidying up. Real five star treatment. 

Only one very small niggle, there was no turndown service in the evening. That would have been nice and added to the five star experience.

On the first night we dined in the lobby. I had a nice chicken broth and delicious rye bread.
Chris served us in the bar. He made great efforts to chat to us each evening and made our stay more enjoyable.

The first morning we were welcomed by Jacqueline. A real five star hostess who explained the buffet. There is a great selection on offer with delicious home cooked omelettes. The sausages and bacon were also first class. I asked for the rye bread and on the last morning Shannon kindly give me a loaf to take home which really pleased me.

The bed was so cosy..I did not want to leave. We slept very well. The hotel was peaceful at night time.
This hotel is not too far from Dublin. We got the dart to Pearse Street and walked to Grafton Street. One evening we went to Brookwood for dinner, which I have also reviewed and got a taxi back which was 9 euros.

One thing I really loved was the gentleman playing the piano in the lobby at night time. He was excellent and very relaxing to listen to.

We also went to the pool and used the jacuzzi.

The staff here are all very friendly. Carla on the breakfast team also gave excellent service. I can't remember the ladys name who checked us out. It began with J. She was very professional.

Thank you InterContinental for a lovely relaxing stay. I hope we return again this year.",5,2017,01,08
205,Good stay,"We booked directly with the IHG website for one night stay with breakfast for a special occasion, there was no door man to  open the door as we had a buggy and a small luggage.
We were greeted and checked by Tara in the reception and I must say she did a good job in explaining everything, she just did what she is trained to do.
We were allocated initially beautiful recently renovated room in the 3rd floor 
The hotel is under going some renovation (rooms only I believe) so there was intense loud noise , then were allocated a junior suite while it was specious the furniture was really outdated and very old, that being said we enjoyed the stay and it didn't impact our stay at all.
I was actually glad that IC finally said good bye to the Agraria amenities and the it was replaced with L'Occitan  bergamot & Orange amenities .

The breakfast is nothing to rave about and it's not to be compared with IC in Asia for example , but it was sufficient and you won't leave hungry as it included everything, staff were mostly nice at the breakfast , Now the negative point at the breakfast was the muffins are not home made they were individually wrapped commercial ones, you don't expect that quality to be presented in the IC , I'd suggest it's better to be removed from breakfast as it was not fresh and it really breaks into pieces when you try and eat it.
Check out was done by Robert who was also very professional.

In conclusion we enjoyed our stay and would stay here again ",4,2017,01,06
205,Good stay - mixed experience at the rest,"I just spend few days with my family at the Intercontinental Dublin . We have stayed there previously and always left with good memories. However, this time around it wasn't as good as we expected. On Wednesday we went to have breakfast at Seasons restaurant. The place was completely full , line outside the restaurant so long that it took 30 minutes to get a table . After we were seated we checked the buffet which was extremely untidy without much food left . 

  Most of the staff that we remember from our previous visits has left the hotel . We saw a lot of other staff wearing black uniforms, however, they looked lost , confused and unwilling to help with anything. When asked a question , no knowledge about the buffet or if menu was available. Total shock . 

  On Thursday we decided to have breakfast in Sandymount which was a lot more relaxed and no drama . We decided to return and have our last breakfast at Seasons on Friday . The place was extremely busy once again , however , this time around we were able to see few familiar faces . It made a such a huge difference. Reika , Andrei were absolutely flawless . No matter how busy it was it seemed they were always around clearing , serving and taking orders. They had the time to say hello to us and still keep an eye on other guest . 

  We also had a chance to meet Sam who was like a speeding bullet . He was everywhere and always smiling . Shannon was amazing with explaining the menu options and the buffet . 

  Thanks to them we left the restaurant with a smile . We were also given few warm croissants fresh from the oven to take with us to the airport .",3,2017,01,05
205,Dublins Less well known Grand Dame,I normally Stay at the Shelbourne in Dublin but due to business reasons stayed here this week.  Excellent reception Staff and very helpful.  The room was of excellent quality and made an overnight night stay a pleasure with great sleep.  I look forward to staying here again.  The location is more out of town than I am used to but a short 20 minutes gets you into the city,4,2017,01,04
205,Never a 5 Star,"Stayed here for one night with my wife and 3 children. Staff were very welcoming and polite. We got a junior suite which was quite a large room and were accommodated with an additional roll out bed. All-in All a good start. We had lunch out and decided to have dinner later at the hotel.
Food menu was fairly standard. Food quality was acceptable but certainly not of a 5-Star standard...
My wife and I slept in the main bed. I travel a lot work wise and I can honestly say that it was the worst nights sleep that I had in any hotel in over 12mths. The main bed was made up of two single beds which made the centre very uncomfortable.

I did mention it on check out and the receptionist did apologise and say that this is not their usual standard.

I would give it another try. The pool and gym were a great addition and we certainly enjoyed both.",3,2017,01,02
205,Lovely stay,"Enjoyed a NYE trip and stay. Will definitely return. Only loses one star because breakfast not included in room rate and very overpriced. Would prefer if rate (not cheap) was bed and breakfast. The spa is incredible and reasonable. Staff all so friendly and helpful. Didn't bring kids on this occasion but have done in past and will do in future.
",4,2017,01,02
205,NYE Break,Another great stay at the Intercontinental in Dublin. Staff as usual were so friendly and helpful. Room was very comfortable and the restaurant service was very efficient. Always look forward to staying at the Intercontinental when we are in Dublin.,5,2017,01,01
205,An Amazing Experience!!!,"We stayed at the Intercontinental Dublin for two nights from the 29th until the 31st of December 2016. This was a treat for my wife as we were celebrating our first wedding anniversary. What a choice!!.... This hotel is stunning, from the minute we arrived at the hotel doors, up until we pulled our car out of the car park, we were treated like royalty!! The christmas decorations all around the hotel make for a very warm atmosphere. Our room was massive with a very comfortable bed. The attention to detail in the bathroom included l'occitane shower products as well as dental kits and a shaving kit, which I was very impressed with!! A visit to the hotels spa and leisure centre is a must. The gym is really well equipped and the pool and hot tub offers a great place to relax. Both the male and female changing rooms boasts their own sauna and steam room. Lounge chairs to read the morning paper while drinking green tea or sampling a complimentary bottle of water which is also on offer are available in the changing rooms. We also had food in the Seasons restaurant. The service here was second to none. The food was amazing.  I had the venison for main course, while my wife had the beef. It was mouth watering. The attention to detail in the restaurant is again very evident with silver cutlery and china tea sets. 
This hotel made for a very memorable first anniversary. A visit here is highly recommended. I would like to thank and wish a happy new year to Ronan, Colleen and Michael on the door and to all to all the other staff we met during our stay!!! ",5,2017,01,01
205,Luxurious Hotel,"Luxurious hotel in a great location we were able to get a cab (right outside) or take the bus (on main street less than 2 min walk to bus stop) to the city center.  You could walk to the city center but it would take a bit of time.   The room was spacious with a comfortable bed.   Hotel is family friendly.  Service was great except for check in.  We arrived mid-afternoon and were told to wait in the lobby for our room and that they would come get us, we waited for over 45 minutes then went to check and the room had been ready; the girl that checked us in stated she looked for us which there is no way she could have since we were sitting in plain sight and did not leave the lobby. Other than check in the service was impeccable, with the staff always willing to answer any questions.   ",4,2016,12,30
205,Excellent hotel ,"Stayed for here for night before Christmas. Very impressed, not much parking available, to say you are charged 16 euro per night to park. 
Rooms have recently been re decorated.
All 5 star quality. 
Breakfast is highly priced at 30euro per person. 
Usual hotel standard, so didn't really feel like value at that price. 

Over all very happy with our stay. 
Staff were excellent as well. ",5,2016,12,30
205,Disappointing for an Intercontinental,"We had a fairly poor experience here albeit on a very brief one night stay.

We had a restaurant reservation which although they found in their diary they still told us they were full and suggested we might eat in the bar instead! Resolution with the host was not possible but after escalation to the F&B manager it was resolved satisfactorily.  The meal itself was disappointing and it felt like the kitchen was just under severe pressure. We ordered a deconstructed carbonara dish as a starter and the quails egg came out cold and hard boiled as it if there was no check prior to sending the dishes from the kitchen pass.  Main course and dessert were equally mediocre.

The rooms were very dated (they are in the process of refurbishing and we unfortunately were allocated an old room) but the age is very much showing.

Overall we just felt this wasn't up to the standards of an IC hotel.

In fairness, the clerk at checkout asked if we were happy and the duty manager then refunded the cost of the valet parking. A nice gesture but overall not somewhere we'd return to.",3,2016,12,29
205,Pre Christmas Break ,"The ideal base for meeting friends and shopping in the city.

Everything about this hotel stay was perfect, from the warm welcome to the final check out. The service was as always top class. 
Definitely the best hotel in Dublin. ",5,2016,12,29
205,Christmas Holiday ,"Lovely Hotel 
Very pleasant staff
Great value as a package 

Downfall 
We were not offered to eat in the main restaurant. We booked online and when I phoned up to book our table in the main restaurant I was told that there was no table available for us and that we had no choice but to eat at the buffet. We were then told that there were very limited times available to eat at the buffet, therefore we had to eat a 4pm.
As a result of this late dining the full selection of food was not available.

When I asked as to why no one had been in contact with me about where we wanted to eat, I was told that they had no contact details for me as I made my booking over the internet!! 

Would I return next year, yes but only on the condition that we could have our Christmas dinner in the main dining hall ",3,2016,12,29
205,Great stay ,"Came over for a wedding with family, was a lovely experience and stay, staff are amazing and the food is great. Fantastic hotel. If anybody is looking to book a wedding they are done amazingly here. Great Christmas venue. 
",5,2016,12,28
205,nothing to fault,"This hotel is a little bit further out of the city which means that one really needs to have a car to be able to see the city. Parking though is not free for guests but cost about Euro 16 per day - something to bear in mind when choosing whether to rent. Having said that just outside the hotel is a hop on and off bus tour so its still possible to get around. Having said that, I would recommend renting a car if staying here. The hotel itself is extremely nice. The lobby area is spacious. There are two restaurants - Seasons and the Lobby Lounge and also an indoor spa. The rooms are comfortable and the service staff friendly. The main issue would be the location.",5,2016,12,27
205,Christmas visit,We arrived Christmas Day and left 27 Dec .. this hotel has such potential and the rooms and atmosphere is amazing .. so beautiful but the service just is disappointing .. had to ask repeatedly for service at breakfast .. staff so nice but it seemed like there was no system .. no collecting dirty plates or offering tea or coffee .. the highlight was the kids club this year .. an outside company .. this is our second Xmas staying there and that was the only improvement .. still love the hotel it's just the service that needs to improve .. well done minderfinders for the amazing service they gave our 7 year old .. she loved it,3,2016,12,27
205,Nice hotel but far from the city sights,"Stayed at the InterContinental Dublin for a work event for a week.  Property is all you would expect from any InterContinental.  Nice rooms, great service and food, etc.  Location was ideal for the Congress which was a 5 minute walk around the corner.  A few pubs and such nearby as well.

The location is not ideal if you are visiting Dublin for pleasure.  At least a brisk 30 minute walk towards the city sights such as Trinity College.  I would not recommend if your trip is for pleasure.  Just too far to walk to enjoy the sights.",4,2016,12,27
205,Made to feel welcome as we arrived.,"We had a one night stay for a mix of business and leisure. On arrival we were greeted by the staff and assisted with our luggage, check in was fast and we received detailed information on hotel facilities. Our room was beautiful and we had breakfast in our room which was delivered on time and was delicious. We loved our stay and will definitely return to experience it again.",5,2016,12,27
205,Excellent service,"Just spent a fantastic two days here whilst exploring the beautiful city of Dublin. 
Although slightly out of the centre, the quiet location was fine for us. 
The rooms are very spacious and comfortable.
What made it was the excellent attentive staff. From the moment you walk through the doors the staff were welcoming, friendly and helpful. 
In the evening it was so relaxing to listen to the piano music in the bar area.
A very enjoyable two days and one I'm sure we will repeat.",5,2016,12,27
205,Very Disappointed,"We've just spent 2 nights at the Intercontinental and have been left very disappointed with our stay.

My wife and I stayed at the hotel 2 years ago and had a great time but it was very different this time.

We paid €180 each for Christmas Lunch which consisted of lukewarm soup, turkey and roast beef. It's totally disgraceful that they can justify charging such an extortionate amount for a sub-standard buffet. 

On top of that, we were quoted €90 for 2 hours of babysitting for our twins but the hotel, for some reason, didn't tell us that there was a free kids club on at the same time.

To make things worse, when we checked out this morning we were told the babysitting charge was actually €120 as this charge included the taxi.

I understand that it was Christmas Day and travel is expensive but they shouldn't have told us the cost was €90 over the phone and then added on an additional charge.

The hotel is very nice and I couldn't fault the breakfast on both mornings but I was left with a bad feeling and won't be back as a result.",1,2016,12,26
205,Royalty couldn't possibly have it better,"Simply incredible! Each & every staff member treated us as if we owned the place. 
We couldn't have been treated any better. 
We came as a Christmas/Graduation gift for our daughter and WOW, what an amazing experience for us all.

Not only would I recommend it, but I'd live here. wink wink, and Im sure they would let me if I could afford it. haha 

Just Super!",5,2016,12,25
205,Excellent,"It has exactly what you expect from a hotel of this category. The staff is very helpful both in reception and in the restaurant. The  gym and the pool are great for a hotel, you really feel like doing exercise. Deco is brit typical for this stablishments; a little bit to much for me, that I'm more a ""new design"" person. They upgraded me, and the room was fantastic!!! Definetly a place to go back!!!",5,2016,12,24
205,Superb,"We loved this hotel!  Our suite was large and exquisitely beautiful.  The staff was extremely welcoming and attentive to every detail.  Two staff members in particular, Bratislava and Radomir, generously took care to make our stay absolutely perfect.  The public areas are elegant and the setting is lovely.  The hotel is a very long walk or short cab ride from the city center.  This was really appealing to us and we did manage to walk the distance each evening back to the Intercontinental, but others would probably prefer a cab.  The area around the hotel has its own restaurants and some businesses, but it is generally a quiet, welcome respite when there aren't events at the stadium nearby.  The Cityscape (yellow line) hop-on hop-off buses stop right across from the hotel.  (The red and blue lines do NOT stop here.)  Our first morning we were able to catch the bus right outside the hotel and conveniently tour many of the major attractions in Dublin.  Our stay was so perfect that we were really reluctant to leave.  Highly, highly recommended if the distance isn't a concern.",5,2016,12,21
205,anniversary well spent...,"One of the best hotels in Dublin.. We enjoyed our stay.  Friendly, warm staff & great service. Spacious & elegant room & bathroom. Comfortable bed. Nice indoor swimming pool. The bar is very modern and refreshing. We're definitely going back.",5,2016,12,21
205,Festive afternoon tea,Myself and my daughter had afternoon tea here last week and it was so enjoyable plus the Hotel was decorated so beautifully it really had the Christmas feeling. The food was amazing and well worth the trip. Highly recommend it even after the Christmas season try an afternoon tea here.,5,2016,12,20
205,One of the best in Dublin,Stylish hotel with great service and spacious rooms nicely fitted out. Lounge and restaurant are good combination of quality and efficiency. Staff nicely assisted with early check in. Always a doorman to help with a taxi. The gym is quite good and easy access. Overall this hotel is probably the best I have stayed at in Dublin and compares quite well on price at the same time.,4,2016,12,19
205,Xmas nite in city,Just back from a lovely xmasy nite in the intercontinental.. First time staying here and hopefully will be back again soon. Thanks to Miss Deidre Purcel for organising our special night.. Everything was fantastic.. The atmosphere and food..and the staff were excellent...very enjoyable. It was a lovely start to the Christmas run in. It's very central to the city centre also..great 5 star❤️❤️,5,2016,12,19
205,Best hot chocolate great service food ok,Had food in the bar/lounge area one Saturday evening . Great atmosphere . Service and the hot chocolate was the best ever . The bar food was nice . Expensive for the amount and quality . If they could improve on this the whole place would be a winner.,4,2016,12,19
205,Beautiful hotel,"This hotel is located in the Ballsbridge area. It is about 10-15 minutes cab ride, approximately 12-15 euro to city centre.  We got dropped off 2 blocks before St.Stephens green. 
That's the reason 4 star and not 5.
The hotel itself is quite elegant. I wish I tried the Seasons restaurant. Very large rooms by any standard. Very clean. Complete with robes and slippers. My colleagues raved about the spa and breakfast. Beautiful spacious lobby and reception area. All staff was extremely professional and courteous. Just one tiny thing I might add. I thought the carpet could be redone. The color was strange and dated. The decor old fashioned, but clean and nice. 
The bathrooms though were the highlight. All marble, huge soaking tub, a shower, separate toilet closet, and lots of sink/counter space. I would highly recommend staying here. I would love to stay again and next time I'd eat at the restaurant there and go to the spa.",4,2016,12,14
205,Great weekend,"I stayed last weekend and I had a great experience, great size room and a very confortable lounge but above all was the attitude of all staff, what made the whole family have a great time at the hotel.",5,2016,12,12
205,Christmas break!,"Can't fault the hotel at all. Stayed Friday and Saturday night. The suite was superb and the staff were very attentive. Had no issues whatsoever over the weekend. 
Had breakfast both mornings. The selection was good. I would recommend the eggs benedict. No complaints and all and I'm looking forward to returning!! ",5,2016,12,11
205,Lovely stay in gorgeous surroundings,"We stayed in the intercontinental for a night last week. The location just outside the city centre means it is great for a quiet nights sleep. The rooms are very large , comfortable and quiet. The hotel staff were all attentive and efficient and breakfast was delicious. The hotel is beautifully decorated for Christmas and there was a lovely buzz around the place. Overall a lovely experience.We will definitely be back.",5,2016,12,10
205,Excellent Stay ! ,"Stayed in the InterContinental Dublin for one night this week. Excellent service from the staff, (Irish ) Colleen and (American) Colleen on the front desk were really friendly and helpful. Tara was also very helpful. 

Aaron in the lobby / bar gave excellent service when we went for dinner. 

The room was by far the largest Intercontinental hotel room I've stayed in, very spacious and high quality finish. 

Went for breakfast in the Seasons restaurant the next morning, the hostess Jackie was really friendly and explained the breakfast buffet. 

The only criticism I would give the stay was the hot aspect of the breakfast. It really was not up to the standard of the rest of the hotel. The hot food really let the breakfast down. The continental breakfast was superb though.  I wouldn't let that stop me from returning in the future. 

Thanks a Million! 

John Farrelly ",5,2016,12,10
205,Average,"On arrival staff were extremely pleasant and helpful. We were there for a function that was being held in the hotel. We checked into our room ( we had booked a triple room ) on going up to the room we realised the extra bed had not been put in the room as requested in booking having being advised on check in that it was already in the room. However once we phoned reception it was put in promptly. We had a sit down meal at the function the food was beautiful and the service was top class. After the event had finished we decided we would finish the night in the residence bar...big mistake, on arrival to the residence bar we were asked our room  number which was not an issue, quite understandable that residence only could use the bar! However when ordering drinks one of my friends whom was sharing the room with us was told she could only get two drinks as there were only two people in the room that we were staying in. She advised there were three in the room but she was buying a round of drink for friends (whom were also residents) and would require more than 2/3 drinks to do so but the manager was having none of it and 3 drinks was the max she could purchase. I arrived in the residence bar shortly after this and went to order myself a drink and was told no you cannot have a drink as the girl you are sharing the room with has used the quota for your room so take it up with her. The manager was quite abrupt and to be honest extremely rude she kept on speaking over me and just told me to take it up with my friend. In the end I just asked for a water to which she practically slammed on the counter in front of me. I was so annoyed that a hotel of this calaber would treat guests in this manner that I left and went to bed. The room was lovely and spacious and beds extremely comfortable.  The next morning we had a man (staff member) walk into our room at 10.50 unannounced and we didn't hear the door knock. I heard the door open and jumped up to see what was going on, he ran out of the room with no apology. We went to check out and the girl on reception was extremely polite and customer friendly, we were not going to complain about the events of the previous night however when the bill was produced there were two rounds of drink on the bill from the residence bar and from my previous comments...We could not get more than 3 drinks!! So it was inaccurate.  My friend only signed for one lot of drinks which she had a receipt for. We then proceeded to explain to the receptionist what had happened in the residence bar.  She was extremely apologetic and called the duty manager. The duty manager was also very apologetic and advised that it was not their policy to only serve a limited number of drinks per room in the residence bar and that she would look into it. She took the drinks off our bill. The hotel is a nice hotel with a good location to Dublin and the majority of the staff are extremely friendly however after my experience I would give it an average rating.",3,2016,12,09
205,Cannot fault it! ,"From arrival to departure this hotel was flawless. They offer a valet parking service so we were able to quickly drop off our car and check in. Check in was quick and painless and the the receptionist was very helpful.

The hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas and there was a fantastic atmosphere in the place. Every staff member we met was friendly, helpful and professional.  

The room was lovely with a very large bathroom. The shower was nice and powerful. There was a few nice touches eg shower cap with hair tie (women will appreciate this), complimentary bottle of water etc.

We a had dinner at the hotel and the food was simply lovely. The service was quick and staff very friendly. 

We had breakfast delivered to the room the next morning for a small extra cost. This took about 20 minutes to come from phone call to room. Breakfast comes on a handy table so no need to transfer if from cart to table, just pull up a chair! Apart from the toast being cold breakfast was very tasty!

Check out was nice nice and quick and the valet delivered the car quickly to us.

I couldn't fault the hotel, it is well worth the money.",5,2016,12,07
205,Unparalleled 5 Star Service!!!,"We were upgraded upon arrival to a suite that was spacious enough to live in for a month.  Breakfast dining and afternoon tea were superb. Tara, Jane and Carla were classic customer service experts.  Mark Flynn handled one minor issue with truly 5 Star attention!  We had traveled throughout Europe for six weeks; this was one of our best stays.",5,2016,12,05
205,Meticulous Service ,Loved the experience from check-in to check-out. From the minute you enter the gate you know you are about to spend a great time. The rooms are spacious and very tidy. I liked the complimentary hot choclate idea. It helps in a cold weather. The only take on the experience is that it is far from city center and main attractions. ,4,2016,12,01
205,Not a 5* experience :(,"I booked two twin rooms for myself & 3 trips going on a one night escape to Dublin. We have previously stayed in the Shelbourne & the Westbury. The Intercontinental is not a patch on either. The common areas are beautiful & have that luxury feel & the staff we encountered were lovely. However our room was horrendous, really dated & cold (no luxury feeling & no ambience whatsoever). We called housekeeping who said the heating was broken & couldn't be fixed, so they brought us a small plug in radiator. It was freezing getting changed for dinner. We went to our friends room & theirs had been renovated & was much much nicer AND they had been left fruit & chocolates on a slate, which we didn't get !! - & we were the ones with the old fashioned room with no heating !!! the difference in the 2 rooms was shocking & they were booked at the same rate but we didn't have the same experience -far from it. Breakfast was good (no a la carte though which I would expect from a 5*) I wouldnt stay in an unrenovated room, not worth the price. Last but not least we had pre dinner drinks in the lounge, drinks were slow to come & when we gave our server €50 for the €42 drinks bill he never gave us any change, perhaps he thought the €8 (20%) was his tip but that was our decision to make surely? On check out we weren't asked how was our stay but I mentioned we were horrified with our room & she said she would make sure we got a renovated room next time. In the Shelbourne/Westbury/Merrion you get the top class luxury, the service, the feeling of being a valued customer, can't say that about this stay I'm sorry to say. Yes it's a bit cheaper but there's good reason for that.",4,2016,11,28
205,Beautiful hotel but dining room has lost its way.,Arrived at the hotel and we were upgraded to a suite which was fantastic. Everything was first class until we entered the Catalina dining room for dinner on saturday night. We had invited a Company Ex. and his wife  and a solicitor and his wife. The meal was booked for 8.15pm but the hotel had lost the solicitors suitcase and therefore his wife was unable to change her dress for dinner. She waitied until 8.30 and arrived in the clothes she had been wearing at a rugby match and they got no words of apology. We ordered drinks and the meal. Wine arrived but no meal. At 9.45 we still had no meals and after asking for the manager who was useless she laughed as said the chef was under pressure. It took 4 hours and 30 minutes for the meals to be served in full. Totally disgraceful especially with invited business guests. The bill had been adjusted slightly but we were very unhappy and refused to leave until the bill was adjusted to our satisfaction. The whole experience just spoilt the whole goodness and beauty of the hotel itself. I would not recommend eating in the restaurant.,3,2016,11,22
205,First class hotel,"This hotel was everything I expected. I was upgraded to a large suite. The bed was amazingly comfortable and the room very spacious with an excellent shower. 

The whole hotel was immaculate with stunning Christmas decorations. 

Service was polite and very efficient. I ate dinner in the bar which was very good and served in comfortable surroundings. 

I even bumped into a major celebrity in the bar during dinner!",5,2016,11,18
205,Outstanding customer service and quality!,"I love this hotel. We stayed here for Halloween night, which happened to be the night before the Dublin marathon and a Leinster game so it was full.

On check in we were given a warm welcome and given our room fairly quickly. However when we got to the room we found it was still under renovation and hadn't been blocked off on the hotels system. We went back to reception to let them know that the room was unusable - a slight worry as I knew the hotel was full. The problem was sorted swiftly and we were given the only available suite in the hotel, the crown suite. This made our trip and only wish we could have stayed longer.

I want to thank Harry on the front desk that night for sending up anything we asked for, Paul at the concierge desk for his endless efforts to find a package for me and also in tracking down a taxi to the airport the next day when none were to be found. These staff are a credit to the hotel. Mark, the hotel duty manager runs an excellent hotel and should be credited too.

Thank you so much for a pleasantly surprising stay and we will be back anytime I am in Dublin.",5,2016,11,17
205,5 star hotel,"Stayed here for the weekend and it was a lovely stay. We got upgraded as Saphire members and the room had a lot of space and great furniture.

Location is super good as is close to the down town. Great for a walk but if too cold you can hail a cab for around 10 euros.

Definitely recommended and looking fwd to come back.",5,2016,11,15
205,5 star hotel but not enough staf around at breakfast time,I've stayed here many times before and since its acquisition by Intercontinental Group.  I stayed the night of November 12th.  It's still a nicely appointed hotel but was a little surprised to be given a token for breakfast when I checked in.  Not what I expected of a 5 star hotel.  Next morning the token wasn't needed - so even more surprised.  We arrived for breakfast at 10.20 am and had to wait 10-15 minutes for a table - even though there seemed to be tables available.  Staff very helpful and pleasant but not enough of them were on during the breakfast shift.  Breakfast when it arrived was good though,4,2016,11,15
205,Girls weekend in Dublin,Hotel was previously a Four Seasons. Great location. Service and staff friendly. We had a great afternoon tea.  Public area look great. Bedrooms a bit old fashioned and dull. Had expected more stylish decor.  ,4,2016,11,12
205,Great Hotel,"We were very pleased with the Intercontinental.   Staff was extremely friendly and helpful; our room was clean and nicely furnished.   The bathroom had a very large, open shower. You must use your room key to operate the elevators - we liked that extra security feature.  The breakfast buffet is very nice and reasonably priced.   There is a very nice outdoor courtyard, though it was too chilly while we were there to sit outside.   The bar is cozy; the lounge next to it has a variety of different types of seating and very attentive staff.   The hotel is very convenient to a light rail station and also buses.   There are several very nice pubs and restaurants within a 5 minute walk.    Getting to downtown, center city Dublin, is about a 45 minute walk.   We chose to taxi instead of making the long walk.",5,2016,11,09

205,Dublin at its finest!,"Beautiful hotel with an excellent staff who provided the best of service.  Rooms were well appointed and very comfortable.  Located just south of the Georgian area in Dublin, it was within walking distance of Merrion Square and the museums.  If you don't like to walk, the ""hop on, hop off"" bus stop was directly across the street from the hotel for easy sightseeing, and the train was also within walking distance for areas outside of Dublin.",5,2016,11,04
205,Amazing Weekend,"Had the pleasure of staying in the hotel for the weekend .....  I love this hotel ....  It is only 10 mins outside the city centre and the perfect spot to be  staying  when visiting the city. It a nice little bit of luxury and calmness away from the bustle of the city centre. We used it as our base for the weekend as we were attending a friends wedding. The rooms and bathrooms are the biggest in the city. The staff were super efficient and really friendly. We ate in the lobby lounge and had drinks in the Whiskey Bar. The spa is also a nice addition with pool , hot tub and relaxation areas.  The best way to spend a holiday weekend in Dublin :-)",5,2016,11,03
205,Beautiful Hotel,I stayed at the InterContinental Dublin (Formerly The Four Seasons) in October 2016 for a business conference and vacation.  The hotel is beautiful with an old world charm. The rooms were spacious and beautifully furnished and the bathroom was  marble.  Everything from the room to bathrobes and slippers to the staff was top notch.   Located in the upscale Ballsbridge area with wonderful grounds.  My room was located on the front of the hotel and I had a view of Dublin Bay in the distance.,5,2016,11,02
205,short return visit,"Having travelled by rail from early morning I arrived at the hotel about 9.30am to a warm and gracious welcome by the door and reception staff.When I requested a room near the lift because of my walking problems they allocated a room right beside the lift lobby. Could not have been better.The room itself was as usual,large, newly decorated,well furnished with sufficient room for a working desk.The bathroom is on a grand scale with sumptuous towelling and luxurious toiletries.After a very long day I requested a late checkout and was told 2pm,Great!!  In room breakfast was excellent.The bar staff and security were as usual very discreet and extremely helpful.",5,2016,11,02
205,Another impeccable stay,"Again another fantastic stay at my favourite hotel. 

Special mention to Issac, Joana, Michelle, Rodimir and also the new girl on the front desk whose name I cannot remember (starts with a C though). They made our stay a great one. 

Beds super comfy and nothing is too much trouble for the staff. 

Compliments to the Chef as the burger I had in the lounge was the best I have ever had, it was incredible! 

The new floral display in the lobby area is just beautiful! Really sets of the reception area. 

Cannot wait to return!",5,2016,11,02
205,Fantastic stay,"We stayed here as a family of four in an executive twin. This hotel is most definitely 5 star each member of staff are so helpful, so polite and a special mention to Isaac the Doorman who made our stay so much more enjoyable with his enthusiastic welcome and smile and is a complete credit to the hotel. His greeting and farewell each was just so lovely and he was super with our kids. We hope he is there for our return trip. The pool is brilliant and there was a wonderful selection of breakfast. We can't wait to return ",5,2016,11,01
205,Lovely Hotel in Embassy area of Dublin,"Hotel is beautiful and the staff are friendly, helpful and efficient.  Rooms were spacious and bathroom was well appointed.  We had several meals at the hotel along with afternoon tea and after dinner drinks.  Eggs benedict for breakfast were delicious.  They also offer a breakfast buffet that appeared well stocked but I did not partake.  Hotel is not located at the city center but cabs were reasonable and cabbies helpful. It was probably 10-15 minute ride to city center. Bus service is also available.",5,2016,11,01
205,Sisters Graduation ,"A very beautiful and modern hotel, professional, tentative and courteous staff, food is delicious and the facilities are spotless. 
If travelling from Dublin Airport, the Aircoach is €14 return on the 702, it stops right outside the hotel, the journey is only 25 minutes and it's the cheapest purchase you'll probably have. ",5,2016,11,01
205,Amazing,"Wonderful hotel. Definitely 5 stars. Great breakfast. Rooms are spacious and clean. The location is not in the city center, but in the safe and nice area. Good transport links. Would definitely stay again.",5,2016,10,31
205,Nice but food and bar expensive,"We had a three day meeting in Dublin in October 2016. The rooms were very nice. The banquet food was very good. The breakfast buffet was very expensive . There is no sundrie shop on premise.
The people were very nice for the most part",4,2016,10,29
205,Amazing stay in Dublin,"In October I have stayed 4 nights in the Intercontinental Dublin, Formerly known as the Four Seasons hotel. The hotel is absolutely amazing! from chandeliers to beautiful wall paintings. Everything in this hotel is stunning. 

We were checked in in a deluxe room located at the first floor overlooking the inner garden. The vibe that the hotel gives is .. a king in his castle… at least this is how I felt during the entire stay. The room is large, including a huge bathroom with a bath and shower. The only negative thing about the room is that the shower mount is way too low attached to the wall, I am 6ft ;) 

The hotel is approximately a 30 minute walk from the city centre, which is quite far if you walked around the city the entire day however hailing a taxi is quite easy and the public bus transportation system is very easy and the stop is in front of the hotel. 

For breakfast there are 3 options, A la carte, Irish and Continental. I chose to have a continental breakfast every morning . The buffet is not as extensive as other intercontinental hotels however it had everything I wanted and left me with a full tummy every morning which gave me enough energy throughout the day. 

Take some time to relax next to the fireplace in the reading room with a hot chocolate or coffee in your hand, super cosy ;)  Dinner in the hotel is delicious and surprisingly cheap! You can eat at the lobby lounge or the seasons restaurant. We chose to eat at the lobby lounge every night as we were so impressed by the service and the quality of the dishes!

One Negative thing is that the Food and Beverage staff added a wrong menu item to our bill (€40) If we wouldn't have noticed it during check out we would have paid more than we were supposed to do. 

Overall the hotel was amazing and we would recommend it to anyone we know.",5,2016,10,27
205,Great Hotel -- Nice area of Dublin -- Close to the Metro Line into the city,"Like many others, you can tell this property has been treated well (former 4 Seasons) and the service staff continues to deliver excellent customer service.  We had a standard room which was more than adequate for our 3 night stay.  Breakfast was excellent and we had cocktails and light appetizers one evening.  It's a 5 minute walk to the Sandymount DART station where trains leave every 15 minutes or so.  Also very close to some nice pubs/restaurants and safe neighborhoods to walk about (or as they say there, to ""ramble.""",5,2016,10,26
205,"Nice hotel, location a bit out of the way.","We spent a week here and overall enjoyed our stay. The hotel used to be a Four Seasons, but in the last year or so switched over. The hotel itself is nice, with a nice spa and ample grounds to not feel to ""locked in"" like many city hotels might feel.

The food was pretty average. We ate breakfast and dinner there once, as well as ordered room service. It was passable, but not what I would have expected.

We upgraded to a Junior Suite, on a suggestion, and we were glad we did. Large room, with awesome bathroom. All the rooms seemed updated.

Service was excellent. We had a couple fumbles at check-in, but they worked quickly to correct those.

Overall, I would recommend the hotel understanding that you have to walk along way or cab to most everything near city center.",4,2016,10,24
205,Faultless from beginning to end.,"It really is hard to know where to begin to explain how fabulously well we were looked after whilst staying at the Intercontinental Dublin.
Our welcome at check-in was warm and friendly and our room was very well appointed and spacious. 
We simply loved everything about this hotel from start to finish. Most especially the staff who were absolutely incredible and who had evidently been expertly trained.
The food was fantastic and the breakfasts were honestly the best I have experienced in any hotel I have stayed at - and that is saying something!
The Intercontinental is not inexpensive but it exudes quality at every turn and is worth every penny. Unfortunately I didn't have time to explore the spa, but will certainly make sure to indulge on my next visit.",5,2016,10,23
205,Beautiful weekend break,"Beautiful hotel, came for a night last year. Would defiantly stay with this chain again. Fantastic staff who even helped us with deciding where to go for dinner in town. Breakfast was relaxing and decedent. Defiantly would recommend to everyone! Can get regular buses from just round the corner to town. ",5,2016,10,18
205,Need to pay attention to detail,"Parking in this hotel is very tight due to location. Check-in was a breeze. Upon going to our room, noticed the hallway rugs were threadbare and ripped in areas. Room was spacious, well furnished, and plenty of outlets for electronics. Bathroom very well done-toilet separate from sink and bathing area. Had both a shower and a separate tub. Tried the food in the pub-excellent, and great gluten free options. Servers in the pub were very attentive. At the breakfast, hot water for tea had dirt flakes come out of the cauldron. Poor flow to the breakfast choices, and needed better gluten free options.  The servers were not the ""A"" team, and felt more like a cafeteria experience. Disappointed in this part of our stay, as we were looking forward to our last breakfast in Ireland. ",4,2016,10,18
205,A 5 Star Hotel,"This hotel is definitely upscale.  We spent three nights at this hotel in a lovely, very comfortable one bedroom suite.  
We felt like we were treated as ""royalty"".  Anything we needed from the front desk, concierge and restaurant staff was handled quickly and always with a smile.
Because the hotel is located a bit out of the city, it was more convenient to dine at the hotel.  We thoroughly enjoyed having dinner in the Lounge area every evening where a gentlemen playing the piano entertained us.  We even treated ourselves to breakfast every morning with room service.
The whole experience staying at the lovely hotel (which is probably a ""jewel"" in the IHG portfolio) was a sheer delight!",5,2016,10,18
205,Great stay,"Good hotel, comfortable beds. The hotel was under renovation during our stay,but for all practical purposes we did not even notice it. The rooms are spacious and the bathrooms are well appointed.
I have two gripes, 1. The food,is fair to middling, certainly well presented and  looks better than it tastes.
2. Hotel is a bit far from downtown( about a 12euro ride)

Overall our stay was thoroughly enjoyable.",4,2016,10,17
205,A true 5 star,"My wife and I travel quit a bit internationally and prefer to stay in four and five star hotels. We find most places are over rated, I know that makes me sound like a jerk, but it's true. However, in the the case of the InterContinental Dublin, the earned every star. This is truly a first class, five star, luxury hotel. The staff was impeccable, professional, and friendly, they went out of their way to make us welcome. The rooms were spacious and well appointed. The beds were comfortable, the linens perfect, the bathrooms marble and fantastic. 
I do not have a single negative thing to say about this hotel. In fact, it has now become what I judge other 5 star hotels against. We can not wait to return.  
I will note that my wife is a IHG rewards member and the Intercontinental Dublin truly knows how to show their appreciation.",5,2016,10,17
205,"Great service, good location","We stayed for 3 nights.  I had emailed ahead to see if 4 of us (parents + 2 small kids) could stay in one room and they were able to accommodate us.  The room was spacious even with a roll away bed.  The bathroom was huge.  There was a nice pool that the kids enjoyed.
The hotel location is close to a bus stop but still a little far from the city center.  It's about a 5 minute walk to a strip of restaurants if you choose not to eat at the hotel.  It's very close (less than 1 mile) to Aviva stadium which was the main reason we chose this hotel (Go Jackets!).",4,2016,10,17
205,5*,"The Intercontinental was once the Four Seasons and has inherited the grand decor, large bedrooms and luxury marble bathrooms from that top end brand. Guests are maybe less pampered now, but the service is still very good, breakfast ample in the lovely dining room, drinks and more casual food in the very pleasant lobby bar with live piano at the weekend. Super power free wifi, very quiet rooms. Only problems, not centrally located and I couldn't cope with the air con controls. ",5,2016,10,16
205,This never happens for me,"I am a diva.
There, I admitted it.
I don't believe in 5 star ratings for hotels. I have given them out, but usually it's under very particular circumstances. The Wedgwood, a Relais and Chateau ranked hotel in Vancouver is one of the few 5 Stars I have given out and it was very much deserved. I am picky when it comes to them. It tells me that I am suggesting the hotel has nothing they can improve upon.
But the truth of the matter is that the intercontinental did it all. Every member of the staff went above and beyond. I remember names of staff members, even now a week later—also a new experience.
I believe luxury hotels should offer the home away for home, but only better. I believe this because you are paying a high price to stay and when I pay top price I want top experience. The Intercontinental delivers.

Let me get to it.

The good.
Where to start?
Valet was wonderful. All of them were a little cheeky and very funny. They knew sites and advised us on driving to places. Very wonderful group of guys.
Concierge was top notch. You want for any single thing, it is delivered with a smile. Directions, cabs, a car rental, that sweater you lost the night before in Temple Bar, anything. Every demand is answered with speed and efficiency and the belief they care about that sweater you lost.
The hotel is stunning. Well-appointed and luxurious. The quiet, peaceful lounge, the traditional bar, the breakfast room, and the dining room all feel like they are yours.
The spa, I can't even with this spa. It's perfection.
The rooms, very well done. They have that feel of cozy Victorian, which we all want, without all the dated crap. No heavy and dusty curtains or fabric headboards with old stains. The rooms are lovely and the bathrooms are sheer perfection. The shower and separate bathtub was a nice touch. Both were sizable.
Housekeeping was top notch. Clean as a whistle at all times.
And the continental breakfast was over the top. There was an actual honeycomb. Fresh honeycomb. The only thing missing was the bees.
The coffee was delicious, a must for all North Americans. We do love our coffee. 

The bad.
The showers in the spa are creepy. There is a subtle odor, I didn't love it. But the rest of the spa makes up for the dodgy showers. You can always go to your room to clean up.
Location of the hotel is not prime. You are a 10-minute drive to the action, but maybe that is a positive for you. Maybe you want the quiet retreat this hotel offers. For us it was a cab ride two or three times a day, so maybe a bit annoying. But then again, cabbies in Ireland are half the entertainment.

The ugly.
I had to come home. I miss it already.",5,2016,10,16
205,5 star comfort,"We arrived after a flight from Liverpool and our bags were promptly taken to our rooms. We had just signed up for the loyalty program which guarantees an room upgrade. This one did not disappoint. We had a two room junior suite, which was perfect for a couple who has one spouse who's an early riser. The bathroom was spacious, clean and had most every toiletry your would need if you forgot anything. The Seasons restaurant for breakfast was lovely. The flow of the breakfast buffet was a bit awkward, but the food was still good. All the staff at the front desk were very professional and courteous. Well worth the money spent. When possible, we will make this our go to hotel.",5,2016,10,16
205,5 star service,"About 15-20 min walk from city center, but in a nice, quiet area of town. On one of our walks back from town we stopped at Mary Mac's for refreshment   :)
Everyone at the hotel provides the highest level of service. We arrived very early and they took our luggage for safekeeping and got us fueled with some coffee and provided the latest newspapers. 
In the Lobby Lounge, Chris is ever available with wry humor and 1st class service. 
The breakfast buffet is excellent. My wife was impressed with the honey still in its comb.
Would surely choose the Intercontinental again.",5,2016,10,12
205,3 star rooms with inflated 5 star prices.,"The quality of the room was a major disappointment and I can honestly say that compared to other 5 star properties I was at best a 3 star standard. 

The staff on arrival were average with little in the way of a warm greeting at check in. We appreciated that it was new years eve and the staff may be tired from the busy day and thought no more of it. 

When we checked in to the room we were instantly disappointed with the quality of the finishes. The decor while not to my taste would be fine except for the fact it was very old and in need of refurbishment. The level of comfort of the bed was poor also. 

We ordered some room service and were both let down by the quality of the food. It was very poorly presented also. Overall not appetising and certainly not 5 star quality. We also had breakfast the following morning which was again grossly overpriced for the below grade fry up. 

Alas on check out we were really disappointing with our stay and we informed the staff member on check out who did give me the email of the manager to be fair to address my concerns which I unfortunately misplaced after check out. 

Overall I believe this hotel really should take a look at itself. The exterior looks reasonably well as well as some of the public areas of the hotel. Beyond that the hotel rates are not justified given the low quality of rooms and food. I think the hotel is perhaps surviving due to its prime location in Dublin and star rating. I won't be returning again and would advise anyone looking for a 5 star experience to look elsewhere.",2,2016,10,12
205,Fabulous lunch in Lobby bar,"We were hoping to try the Seasons restaurant for lunch but it was not available for casual diners and we were directed to the Lobby bar. What a wonderful experience.
The ambience and high ceilings were welcoming and we were seated next to a window and it was so quiet and relaxing. The menu though was surprisingly delicious and the wine list substantial. Warm bread was fresh and healthy, above average.
Mains of organic salmon seated on barley with beans was fabulous and the side dish of quinoa salad complemented the mains perfectly. We could not fault the food and our shiraz wine from Barossa valley went down well.
Only negative was our wine waiter seemed a bit out of his depth.",5,2016,10,11
205,InterContinental Dublin,"Up until 6 months ago this was a Four Seasons.  We stayed here as the first stop in an 8 day tour of Ireland.  We found the staff to be friendly, the food and service in the lobby lounge to be quite good and our room to be quite large and accommodating despite showing some wear. There is a 3 lane lap pool and the gym is small but well equipped.",4,2016,10,09
205,Birthday Weekend,"I stayed here in August with my wife and three kids to celebrate my wife's birthday. We really enjoyed the hotel, it is grand enough to provide the feeling of a special occasion and the deluxe suite that I booked was plenty big enough for a family of five. 

The hotel has a nice lobby and bar area with a pianist late afternoon to provide some upbeat ambience. The pool and gym complex offers a quality environment inn which to exercise or just chill out. One particularly convenient aspect about the hotel is it's proximity to the DART railway system with a station a few minutes walk away, we found this by far the easiest way of getting around with some nice destinations at Howth and Bray being half an hour away.
",5,2016,10,05
205,Best experience ever,"I stayed in the executive lounge this weekend while visiting family.  Room was great, good facilities, but what's more impressive is the service.  House keeping team was amazing, they helped us with all types of demands (providing baby stuff, cutlery...), I can't describe how they made my stay unforgettable, but I am sure I will definitely visit again!",5,2016,10,02
205,"Good rooms, shame about restaurant service","This hotel was the Four seasons until about a year ago. I spent a week here for a conference.
 It is still being renovated, some rooms completed. I was in an older style room. Very comfortable with an ample  bathroom, which features a large bath and separate shower. Plenty of wardrobe space. Bed very comfortable.
Front office very friendly, especially Riccardo.
However, not that efficient-when I checked in early, my room was not ready, so I gave my email and the room number of a friend who had already checked in. After several hours I called down and my room was ready, but they had not bothered to contact me. They could not tell me which terminal I needed at Dublin airport. 
The main problem is that  the formal dining room is open for breakfast, but only sometimes for lunch and dinner. 
Another bar/lounge that is open for lunch and dinner .No other dining options.
This is not enough for such a large hotel. Also service is very inefficient and slow. Tables left for ages before being cleared, many people waiting. Very long waits even to order. Staff need a lot of training.
We stayed in this hotel as we had meetings inside and at the RDS, which is close by (although  its important to know which RDS building as some are quite a walk). 
Close by, some good restaurants, but not much else. 
Its a good 30-40 minutes walk into Dublin centre. A taxi would be around 10-12 euros and take about 15 minutes depending on traffic.",4,2016,10,01
205,"Business hotel, nothing more","The hotel is located pretty well with some restaurants in wLking distance. It is very clean, and my room has been pretty large (40qm) despite being a standard room. However, hotel is little ""dusty"", with some refurbishment would help. For me the main dislike is the service and missing customer focus: i) Hotel room has not been ready at 3:00pm as promised, ii) Waiter threw a large dirty spoon on me which ruined my trouser and he did not offer to let it clean, iii) room-service did not clean my room before 2:00pm. So, all things what are easy to fix.",3,2016,09,29
205,Excellent except answering phones,"This hotel is excellent & does everything right except they need more staff to answer their phones for general info, room service, concierge, etc. The rooms are beautiful & luxurious. Food is wonderful. ",4,2016,09,28
205,Good - even while sligthly dated,"The hotel is good - even though rooms etc. are slightly dated and could do with a makeover. I arrived late and the restaurant was full - however the bar had menu and I would say that the ""superfoods salad"" was good - and the salmon/quinoa was also better than average bar food. 

there is also a good running track where you can run 6,5 km and loop by the sea - good and recommended.",5,2016,09,25
205,Make sure to ask for a renovated room and check A/C!,"We were really looking forward to our stay at the Intercontinental. My husband is a Spire Ambassador member at IHG and we usually have great experiences. However, this was an exception. I had read on trip advisor to ask for a renovated room which I did and was confirmed for a king contemporary room. However, when we got there we were ""upgraded"" to a king junior suite. Would have been nice if it weren't for the stains all over the carpet, the dingy furniture and the view of a parking lot. I specifically asked for a room with a nice view and was told that we were getting a room with a lovely view of the gardens. When I called the front desk they moved us to a renovated room but it was hot. They said the A/C had been off and it should be cool by the time we got back from dinner. So we unpacked and went to dinner. Got back. Still hot. Front desk said that it was a new a/c system and that the engineer wouldn't be back until Monday to work on it. This was Friday. So they moved us again, to another unrenovated room because they said that was all they had that they were sure the a/c worked in. So we unpacked our things for the second time. But guess what? The a/c never cooled there either. So they brought us a portable a/c unit that we had to refill with ice every 3 hours or so which wasn't that easy since the ice machine on our floor was broken. We made the best with what we had the rest of our stay and were never contacted by the manager or offered anything for our trouble.
The only reason I gave the hotel any stars is that it is a beautiful building. The lobby area is gorgeous. And there is a nice little area within walking distance with some nice restaurants and bars. I wouldn't stay there again until their renovations are complete!",3,2016,09,24
205,Salubrious surrounds,"We enjoy a pleasant meal here every so often. The latest was for a   fine breakfast. 

It's buffet style with a comprehensive selection, both hot and cold. Plentiful staff are on hand to see to one's every culinary need. 

The dining room is grand, and roomy with lots of space between seating areas. We were a lttle late taking our seats but the staff reassured us to take our time, there was no hurry.

Afterwards we repaired to the attractive lobby lounge with a coffee and cappuccino to  peruse the morning papers for a while.",5,2016,09,21
205,AMAZING! ,"We've just come back from a stay here and I cannot express how fantastic it was! It truly is a 5* hotel with 5* staff. Michelle at reception was wonderful, a true asset to the hotel. All of the staff were so welcoming and friendly, from front of house to housekeeping to maintenance. The hotel itself was perfect. We stayed in an executive suite which was the nicest hotel suite I've ever been in. There are so many nice touches and the stay was made to feel so personable. The spa facilities were second to none, with friendly and helpful staff. I cannot wait to return. *****",5,2016,09,20
205,Beautiful hotel on the outskirts of Dublin,This used to be a Four Seasons hotel. Intercontinental have done a lovely job with it - classic styling with modern amenities and great conference space. Warm snug bar with an old world feel. I didn't eat in the restaurant so can't comment on the food. Rooms were nicely appointed and the air conditioning good.,4,2016,09,20
205,A little disappointing,"As the InterContinental is a 5 star hotel charging premium rates, I had certain expectations and was a little disappointed with my stay. 

Starting with the good things, the lobby & reception areas are beautiful. Reception staff were welcoming & warm. We were going to have dinner in the city centre but read the 3 Course Special Dinner Menu on the reception desk & booked this instead. 

We had drinks in the hotel bar, which is lovely, & again staff were great. There was a door leading to an outdoor seated area however, which kept banging as staff & hotel guests came in & went out. 

Our room was large and comfortable but I have to say that I have stayed in rooms which are equally as nice in other Ballsbridge hotels & they cost far less.

Restaurant staff were polite but for some reason, my partner's dinner order was mixed up, twice. First, he was brought the wrong starter, which we sent back. When his actual order came out, my scallops had clearly been sitting under the lights for some time. His dessert was also inexplicably wrong. He ordered a Blood Orange Soufflé (which we were told would take 20 mins & we didn't mind the wait) but he was served some sort of Chocolate Fondant with ice cream (which wasn't even on the menu)! On paying for our bill we were told that we were not given the 3 course special menu which we had booked & were charged a la carte prices. Given the disappointing dining experience, this was a further letdown.

Lastly, there is a charge for parking. I know this is quite common for centrally located Dublin hotels but given that this is a 5 star prestigious hotel, I wasn't expecting to have to pay for parking as a hotel guest.",3,2016,09,18
205,Beautiful Hotel,"Recently spent one night at the beautiful Intercontinental. Have been to some other Intercontinentals and this truly is one of the best. Rooms were very spacious and bathroom was huge. Both decorated beautifully. View over the pretty garden was lovely as well. If weather is nice, grab a spot of tea or beverage of choice, and head to the back garden. Didn't eat here, but enjoyed a drink at the bar.",5,2016,09,16
205,Brilliant 21st Birthday Present,"I stayed at the InterContinental Dubin with 6 other girls as a 21st present for two nights. The hotel is absolutely beautiful. Working as a hotel receptionist myself, the rooms are immaculate, the service is 5* and the location is great - just a 5 min taxi ride from central Dublin. 

We ate breakfast in the hotel which consisted of a massive buffet of everything you can think of from salmon, to healthy fruit smoothies/juices, to a big full Irish. Loads to choose from and you could eat as much as you wanted. They knew it was my birthday, so they thoughtfully left a happy birthday written sign with 7 chocolates on to share with me and my friends. 

The spa was the best part of the hotel. You get your own locker which includes a towel and slippers. There is everything you need down in the spa - if you're thirsty there's water, if your hungry there's a bowl of fruit. There's even mouth wash!! It was SO relaxing and Shona at the reception was really helpful and super friendly. 

Isaac stood out the most who was so helpful in regards to recommending places to eat and booking taxi's for us when we needed to go straight into Temple bar for nights out. He was just generally lovely to talk to and up for a laugh!!  

This hotel is fabulous. :-)",5,2016,09,15
205,"Great 2 night stay in quiet, beautiful neighborhood","Was in town for the U.S. college football game and wanted to be walking distance to Aviva Stadium (this hotel is).  There are also a handful of pubs and a nice seaside town called Sandymount within walking distance.  I had stayed at the property previously when it was a different brand and it is mostly the same.  Entire staff was first rate from check in to good bye.  If you are not looking to be in City Centre, Temple Bar or St. S Green, then this location is great.  Will definitely return!",5,2016,09,14
205,Absolute 5 star experience,"Last weekend we had the privilege to stay in an amazing Suite at Intercontinental Hotel Dublin.
We were lucky enough to stay in a new refurbished room. As soon as I entered the room and checked out the room, I knew this would be amazing. The bathroom was the nicest one i've ever seen and I normally stay at luxurious hotels. 
The staff were very helpful all the time, and the Afternoon Tea was one of the best experiences we have ever had. Definitely check out the spa :) Thank you all!",5,2016,09,13
205,Home away home .. Excellent Hotel,"I stayed here almost for more than 2 weeks over a business trip. I would say that its a pleasant experience and can forget the experience. The room is spacious and fully equipped, the bathroom is clean. Room service is excellent. The dining room offers a variety of wonderful flavors. The staff is courteous and helpful.Location is good.",5,2016,09,13
205,Amazing hotel,"I stayed here for 3 days, and it was probably one of the finest hotels i have stayed in. The room was excellent it had a shower and a tub separate. Good space at bathroom. The bed was excellent. Also the service was top class. The swimming pool and the spa area was perfect together with the fitness room. The breakfast was superb. If you want to be treated good at a hotel go to Intercontinental Dublin. It costs but you have only good memories after.
Thank you for a excellent stay!",5,2016,09,13
205,Disappointing Experience for a Luxury Hotel,"The first thing we noticed about this hotel on arrival were the missing letters on the sign outside the hotel.  Not good for a hotel that has only been open for a limited amount of time.  Unfortunately, our experience did not improve. When we checked in our room was not ready so the hotel offered to store our bags and deliver them to the room when ready.  After having lunch we were advised that the room was ready and that our luggage was in the room.  Unfortunately, when we got to the room, someone else's luggage was waiting for us.  We eventually did get our luggage. Because we had been traveling for two weeks and I could not recall if breakfast was included in this hotel, I asked at check-in if our room rate included breakfast.  The receptionist checked and told me it was not.  However, at breakfast the next morning, after ordering only oatmeal and toast, we were told that we could have enjoyed the full buffet breakfast because it was included in our room rate.  I then went back and checked my paper work and discovered that I had indeed reserved at the bed and breakfast rate.

The first night that we stayed at the Intercontinental we returned to our room late and when I closed the door, the handle fell off the inside of the door, rendering me unable to exit the room.  I called the front desk and they sent an individual to the room to fix the door.  Upon entering the room with his key, I realized it was the bellman from the lobby and he indicated that he did not have the tools to fix it.  He left and I received a call from the front desk indicating that the door handle could not be fixed that night and would have to wait until the morning, and an offer to move us to another room for the night. With all of our luggage spread out in the room and the lateness of the hour, I declined the offer, worked on the door myself and found a way to open the door from the inside using the deadbolt lock.  The next day, I stopped at the front desk to make sure they would fix the handle and no one there had any record of the problem.  Finally, the morning we were to check out, I went to open the closet door and that handle came off in my hand.  And alas, my pet peeve in many hotels, the drain plug in the bathroom sink did not hold any water in the basin.

For the cost of the room in this hotel, I expected a much better experience and much better service. The room, an executive king, was nicely furnished and large, but there was no view to speak of, the closet doors were hard to open, the sink would not hold water, the front desk was ill informed, and overall, we did not have a good experience here. My only other comment is that this hotel is not near any of the major sights in Dublin.  It is in a very quiet neighborhood which is lovely, but it is an approximate 25-30 minute walk to get to central Dublin.",3,2016,09,12
205,Gala Dinner,"Excellent venue for a large event.  Plenty of knowledgeable, discreet and well trained staff.  Good food even for large groups, well stocked and served bars with little queuing time.  Slick operation all round.",5,2016,09,11
205,The best hotel and great service ,"The best hotel and the most incredible helpful staff ever. Room was ready before check in time, clean. Great choice of drinking at bar and amazing breakfast, the best hotel I have ever stayed. I will be back very soon for sure. ",5,2016,09,11
205,"Excellent service & hotel, gorgeous room!","We were upgraded free of charge to an executive suite, which was enourmous and beautiful. This is the first time I've stayed in a 'luxury' hotel and I did not want to leave. Huge bed which you sink into, shiny marble bathroom (a phone in the toilet), free water and fruit. We phoned to order an extra duvet and one was brought to our room in 5 minutes. The staff are wonderfully welcoming and friendly. The duty manager helped us by carefully checking the CCTV when we noticed some damage to our hire car. All round stunning hotel and experience (though I did not pay) I would come back!",5,2016,09,11
205,Attend an event plus overnight,"Have to say that the service and the food at the function I attended was exemplary - it's a skill preparing and serving for 400 and the Intercontinental banqueting team have it. The service in the hotel was less good I'm afraid, slow and predicated on the belief that the guest shoukd be grateful to be staying at the hotel and not the other way arround. The bedroom was large and well furnished but with an extensive view of a flat roof which was dissapointing. For the price / performance mix of the accomadation I don't feel it delivered value and I will revert to The Conrad.",4,2016,09,10
205,Comfortable,"A very comfortable and well finished hotel. The hotel was very roomy as was our room. It was fitted and decorated to a very high standard and the cleanliness was excellent. 
The staff were very friendly, down to earth and helpful. The hotel was well located and was within walking distance of the nearest DART station. The only negative thing was the size and layout of the pool and health suite. The locker rooms and sauna etc were quite a bit from the pool and meant a walk through reception in swimwear or s robe. Otherwise it was an enjoyable facility. 
We didn't eat at the hotel but the coffee and drinks were good albeit a Guinness was a touch expensive at €6.50. 
",5,2016,09,07
205,Overnight stay five stars for service,Our stay in the intercontinental was a joy they upgraded us to a lovely suite on arrival all the staff were very friendly. I would like to send a special thanks to one of the concierges Michael who was on hand to attend to us & went the extra mile I can not rate Michael or the hotel highly enough. I will be booking in for Xmas again this year & I look forward to it.,5,2016,09,07
205,Calm Modern Understated Luxury/Business Hotel,"The Intercontinental Dublin met and satisfied my expectations for a clean, comfortable, modern luxury hotel in Dublin.

Enjoyed the hotel as a romantic and classy base for a Dublin city break visit.

Location: Set in a calm wealthy residential and embassy area just outside the very center of Dublin, transport by taxi was easy and practical across city, and the peace and calm was present.

Building: A rather new and modern purpose-built hotel building, the Intercon' Dublin does not have any particular depth of historic character, which other Dublin hotels may better suit a guest with such priority.  However, for the business traveler looking for function, sophistication and good service, the Intercon' is a good choice. 

Room: Very large, thanks to being in a rather new purpose-built hotel building outside the confines of a historical center building. Furnishings were quite neutral, dare I say unremarkable, but its true.  The bed was excellent, firm, high quality linens. 

Room Service: Excellent high quality breakfast in room. 

Bar: Friendly bar tender, good selection of beer.",4,2016,09,05
205,Great Property not your typical European Hotel,"Stayed at the Intercontinental for a night and was very impressed with the size of the rooms. Most European hotels squeeze you into their rooms but the I was pleasantly surprised at the size of our room. Great amenities and the bedding was some of the most comfortable I've felt. Front desk staff were especially helpful and friendly when we asked for locations to get late night/early morning food. The Valet driver even came out to my car and delivered free bottled water as I waited for my girlfriend to come downstairs. My only complaint was with the shower head as it was frustrating to keep in a steady location, but this is likely isolated to my only room, however I have had similar troubles with these detached shower heads that are common in Europe. 
Overall highly recommended property!",5,2016,09,04
205,We liked it,"First night of our Ireland holiday. The hotel is five star from the guys greeting you on the door to the reception desk and the lovely lady managing the breakfast room in the morning. Breakfast was high quality as you would expect in a hotel like this one. The room was great with massive, very comfortable bed, lovely fixtures and nice shower room. Not cheap but actually price compared well with other top hotels (The Gibson). Need a taxi to get into town but the hotel arranged this for us. Would happilly stay there again.",5,2016,09,02
205,Nice hotel in a quiet area of Dublin,"We had a 3night stay here. Service was GENERALLY great. There is renovation going on on the 3rd floor so we asked to change our room to a different floor and got a very large suite on the 2nd floor (IHG elite member). Nespresso coffee maker in the room is a plus.
Doormen were all very friendly!
Breakfast buffet was excellent too. 
Only thing that I did not like was the room temperature.
Somehow we could not make it warm so the whole time it was quite cold.",4,2016,08,28
205,Great Place to Stay in Dublin,"We like to stay when possible in quiet more upscale areas when staying in cities.  The Intercontinental in the Ballsbridge area of Dublin was the choice.  Close to city center but in area of all of the embassys.  The hotel was a Four Seasons until a year ago.

The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  The room was outstanding, and the attention from housekeeping was really good.

The workout facility, spa area and pool were wonderful.

 There are really fine restaurants within walking distance.

I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,08,28
205,Fantastic,"Myself and my wife stayed here over the weekend. It is a wonderful hotel, staff were very helpful, room was lovely and the food was exceptional. Being a 5* hotel it is a bit expensive but you have to expect that. There was a problem with the shower but was fixed promptly once told about it. We checked out the spa, pool and fitness centre but didn't have time to use any of them but they all looked very good. Car park is very convenient but a bit expensive at €16 a day. ",5,2016,08,28
205,Very nice hotel,We stayed here our last night in Ireland and got in late in the afternoon.  We didn't use much of the facilities but the room was beautiful and the bed was very comfy!  It was only a short walk to nice pubs and restaurants if you want something more relaxed than the hotel restaurant.,5,2016,08,27
205,Excellent accommodations,"We had a double queen room, which appeared to have been recently renovated.  The staff was very accommodating.  We had a family of five, and the staff quickly got us a cot upon request. The lobby, restaurant and bar were very nice.",5,2016,08,26
205,Beautiful Hote....Not Loyalty Oriented,"I booked into this beautiful hotel for 24-27 August...having just spent 4 nights at the Intercontinental O2 in London....all booked via the IHG Rewards Website (my bookings were cash, not rewards oriented.....their ""best price"" guarantee is a joke...as much better pricing via Kayak....my Dublin booking turned out to be Euro 260/ night...I decided to extend my stay in Dublin by 3 nights and asked them to extend my room and offer me the same rate....they refused, jacking the price up to Euro 363/ night...not impressed...particulary given my total spend...I was told we only have 2 rooms left and therefore the price is Euro 100 more/ night....bad business practice...they should be more accommodating to biz travelers like me who stand to give them a lot more biz.....but I won't be staying again....or permit any of my executives to do so.",2,2016,08,26
205,A real 5* hotel,I stayed here 6 nights. It's an amazing hotel! It's a very elegant property. Breakfast is excellent and it's been served in a very elegant and sunny hall. My room was spacious and very clean. The only negative issue about this hotel is that is not close to the city center is really far by feet! You have to go by taxi or by bus ! and it's about 20min.,5,2016,08,24
205,Just gorgeous ,"I was meeting friends in Dublin so decided to treat myself. The room was just gorgeous Ive never had a better nights sleep in a hotel. The pillows were amazing I wish Id asked where they were from. 

The bathroom is very well appointed as youd expect. 

The bar was very busy but the staff were attentive and friendly

Reception were professional and courteous 

I really enjoyed my stay and will definitely be back ",5,2016,08,23
205,First Class,when you pulled up you knew it would be a great hotel.  the lobby had fresh cut flowers all over.  our room was beautiful and recently remodeled.  bathroom was large and perfect.  definitely felt like a rock star staying here.  spa is attached and is great.,5,2016,08,23
205,Wonderful,"This is a superb hotel, well run and in a lovely part of the city with a very walkable distance to the DART train to the city centre and the pubs and coffee shops in Ballsbridge.
The facilities are excellent, the food and drink we had were all of a high standard and the spa facilities more than adequate and what you would expect from an Intercontinental.
If we return to Dublin then we would stay here.
Taxi from the airport is €35, avoiding the city centre.
We had a King Room (436)which was a very good size and extremely quiet.",5,2016,08,22
205,What you expect from a 5* Hotel,"Great experience, Large spacious room.  Friendly and helpful staff.  Breakfast was great each morning.  We used the pool/spa area too and genuinely was as it should be!  Would highly recommend and go back again.

We had a car, so having to validate your ticket every time you went in and out, rather than just buzz your room key was annoying.

As others have said, there was work going on in the hotel, so it had its fair share of noise.  I don't recall being told about this at booking - but would likely have stayed here regardless.",5,2016,08,22
205,Good but not perfect,"We booked into the Intercontinental for a special weekend away. On arrival the porter quickly helped us with our bags. The receptionist was polite and helpful on check-in. Our room was very nice, spacious and nicely furnished. Probably one of the better hotel rooms we've stayed in. The ensuite was also quite nice with large separate shower and bath. Unfortunately builders were carrying out work on the ground floor and we could hear drilling all afternoon in our room on the first floor which is not an ideal 5 star experience. We had dinner in the restaurant that evening. The formal restaurant area is quite pleasant and we enjoyed a three course meal with wine. The service at dinner was very good, the time between courses was perfect and we did not feel rushed. We also received a complimentary sushi taster dish while waiting for our starter. The food was good, nicely cooked and presented well but it wasn't special. In a 5 star hotel and for the price I expected a little more. Overnight our room was quiet and we had a comfortable stay. The next morning we went downstairs for a quick breakfast before checking out. Unfortunately we were left waiting for 15 minutes before anyone asked us for our order. We then ordered coffees and croissants which took another 15 minutes to arrive. The service was extremely poor and unsatisfactory and the food/beverages were significantly overpriced. Overall it is a lovely hotel and we would probably stay there again but we were very dissappointed with some aspects of our stay. It was good but not the perfect experience that a 5 star hotel should provide for its guests.",3,2016,08,21
205,Wonderful Experience,"We recently stayed at the Intercontinental Dublin and couldn't have had a better experience.  After arriving from the US, we checked in and used the pool while we waited for our rooms to be ready.  The beds were the most comfortable of our entire trip to Ireland.  Our rooms were beautifully  decorated and spacious.  The bathrooms were elegant and up to date.  The rooms were also very quiet which is sometimes hard to find. The staff were amazingly helpful, especially the doorman Issac.  The only negative I would mention is that it is a bit far from the downtown area of Dublin.  We had a large range of ages in our party and after a long day of sight seeing, it would have been nice to have been a bit closer to the sights.  A cab was not that expensive, but it would add up if you were going back and forth.  There was a bus not far from the hotel, but we never used it.  I would highly recommend this hotel for a relaxing luxurious stay.",5,2016,08,21
205,First Class Hotel,Travelled for a weekend break with young children.  All the hotel staff were wonderful/friendly and even took time to chat to the kids.  All staff very helpful.   Breakfast menu has lots of choice. Rooms are really spacious and beds were very comfortable.  The hotel had free internet in all areas.  Wide range of facilities offered but the kids especially loved the pool and were made very welcome - no time restrictions.  Within easy access to Dublin city centre and Dublin Zoo.  We will definitely return to this hotel when back in Dublin.,5,2016,08,21
205,Honeymoon Heaven,"My husband and I traveled to Ireland for our honeymoon recently and could not have chosen a better place to stay. Everything was so neat and pretty. All staff from the front desk, to the spa, to the dining area, and the bar were all so amazing and helpful. Our couples massage was everything I wanted it to be and we felt so relaxed afterwards. The heart of the city is just a short cab ride away, but there are also some great pubs and restaurants around the corner. Dart train is also a short five minute walk away, which was very convenient. We can not wait to come back!",5,2016,08,18
205,Excellent Service,"Courteous, friendly and welcoming staff.  The restaurants have excellent food and service.  The rooms are spacious and comfortable with modern facilities and high quality finish.  Will return to this outstanding hotel.  ",5,2016,08,16
205,Welcoming and spacious hotel a little out of town but easy access by taxi.,"The hotel has a good range of facilities with gym, spa, hairdressers all provided. It is a larger hotel with comfortable beds, our suite was spacious and well equipped. 
The only negative was the service at breakfast. We arrived at different times over our stay and still encountered disorganised seating(we found we had been given someone else's table when they came back with their cooked breakfasts as I finished my cornflakes...awkward but should not have happened, especially when presented with the other diner's bill)
Tables were not cleared, ordered drinks etc did not come and it made for a disappointing experience.
I'm sure this could easily be improved as the food was good with a wide choice including gluten free options which was much appreciated.",4,2016,08,13
205,A Hidden Gem,"A hidden gem just away from the city centre. An older, but still very classy alternative to Dublin city centre hotels.The executive room was very spacious and has what is probably one of the biggest and best bathrooms I've seen in (Irish) hotel rooms. The breakfast was also first rate. The staff at both the front desk and the restaurant were very friendly, helpful and efficient.
The hotel is also conveniently located a short walk away from a number of restaurants and bars. The Aviva Stadium is a brisk 15-20 minute walk away as well. There is a parking lot attached (with valet parking available).
You really couldn't ask for much more.",4,2016,08,12
205,A Wonderful Place to Stay in Dublin,"The room, bathroom, breakfast, concierge service, gardens, and everything about this hotel were wonderful. It was tasteful, elegant and a perfect location from which to explore lovely Dublin. I would definitely stay there again on my next trip to Dublin.",5,2016,08,12
205,Poor breakfast,"An overall nice stay. The food in the restaurant in the evening was great and we enjoyed use of the pool and spa. About 10mins taxi out from main Dublin centre.  However for a 5 star hotel the breakfast was shocking. There was not enough staff and those that were there seemed very flustered. There was often people waiting to be sat for a long time and it was commonplace to have to ask 2 or 3 times for drinks or food that had been ordered. There was no toast machine so any toasted items had to be ordered, we waited 30 mins for some toast that arrived lukewarm and then there was no butter on the table and nobody to ask for some. Both days the porridge that we ordered came warmish it had obviously sat in the kitchen a while and we watched the food we ordered being delivered to different tables. We felt the breakfast system needed drastic reorganisation as it let down the rest of the stay.",3,2016,08,11
205,Dublin Horse Show Bliss,Absolutely gorgeous hotel with spacious rooms to relax and unwind. In prime location of you are visiting for the Dublin Horse Show with easy access to the show grounds. The staff are helpful and polite which adds to the pleasantness of your stay. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.,5,2016,08,10
205,Great Hotel - No Complaints,"Had a nice stay in May, no complaints. The hotel was clean and the rooms were functional. Nothing too over the top but the hotel was definitely charming and the staff was friendly and helpful.

Recommend the whiskey bar downstairs, they made me a great custom drink and the bar area is really elegant (dark wood, plush seating).",4,2016,08,10
205,Fabulous ,"Came here with my family after the Dublin horse show, great atmosphere, fabulous cocktails and delicious food. We ate at the lounge area and found the staff very friendly and attentive. Prices were a bit steep for the portion size but the quality of the food is superb 👌🏻",5,2016,08,09
205,Luxury,"I had a really lovely overnight stay at this wonderful hotel the staff are so nice and we had a light meal which was really good, the quality of the bathrooms is excellent as are the beds so comfy, the swimming pool was so relaxing I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and hope to stay there again.",5,2016,08,07
205,Sets the bar! A luxury experience.,"We stayed here for the last three nights of a four week vacation and the hotel and its staff exceeded every expectation from the moment we arrived. The hotel lobby, casual dining area, hotel room and fitness facility and locker room were beautiful and the staff was warm, welcoming and helpful at every turn. Gavin provided outstanding service when we dined at the Lobby Lounge and made excellent recommendations on our menu selections. Our meals were delicious. And Reuben was enthusiastic about introducing us to the fitness center, pool and hot tub, and offered to partner with my husband so he could warm up for his workout with MMA exercises. Although this was outside the city center, we enjoyed our stay here and would highly recommend.",5,2016,08,07
205,Nice hotel 10mins from city,Stayed in a good room with all extras included. Thought the good in the restaurant was expensive for the standard but over all nice. The swimming pool is small and and not what I expected but overall a good hotel for a weekend in Dublin. Next time I'll stay closer to the center ,4,2016,08,06
205,Beautiful 5 star hotel,"Had a wonderful stay here for my partners birthday. The beds were really comfortable, the room quaintly decorated and the staff were trained to such high standards. Nothing was too much to ask for, even leaving a lovely ""happy birthday"" plate of treats waiting in the room for our arrival. 

The hotel is not in central Dublin, but we made good use of the DART train from Sandymount station which is a short walk from the hotel. Also useful to note that the airport transfer (included in Dublin Pass) drops you conveniently right outside. 

We honestly had such a lovely stay in this hotel and would recommend for anyone looking for a luxury stay in Dublin. Thanks everyone at Intercontinental Dublin!!",5,2016,08,05
205,classic luxury. ,"beautiful luxurious hotel lovely rooms a little remote quiet located away from the happening places but it is a short drive to where ever specially that Dublin is not a huge city. 
the staff and services can be improved but overall ok.
the breakfast is superb and the service staff there is absolutely hospitable.
the food is quite good but late night menu is very limited. ",5,2016,08,04
205,"Old School property, staff look bored","I am IHG Platinum and have stayed at many Intercon properties from Tokyo to Melbourne to the middle east to Europe.  This property was the Four Seasons and the overall feel and look to it is very much Four Seasons. Little has obviously been spent to bring this property into line with the brand. The property is in a good location it is quaint. But it is not what a person who stays at Intercons expects. Overall one night here was enough . I saw no smiles , the staff disengaged. Would have been better suited to staying at 3 star.",3,2016,08,03
205,A very good option in Dublin,"We were a group of 6 friends on a weekend trip to Dublin and we had a lovely stay at the Inter Continental Hotel. We had requested, and got an early check in which was great. Our rooms were large and comfortable with great bathrooms and windows that opened on to a small balcony - nice to be able to access fresh air.

We had cocktails in the bar prior to going out to dinner which were a bit pricy but worth it!!

The hotel is walking distance into the city centre (about a 30 minute walk) and well located in leafy Ballsbridge.

The hotel was bust the night we stayed and there was a bit of a queue for breakfast. The pancakes I ordered were great but the hot food didn't look appealing at all and there were delays in replenishing stocks. it looked like the hotel wasn't used to being that busy.

All in all we had a lovely stay and will return.",5,2016,08,02
205,Very nice,Beautiful hotel...wonderful breakfast and staff.  Spacious rooms with great views.  Close to public bus routes to city Centre.  Would highly recommend ....well done intercontinental Dublin. Thank you for a very satisfactory stay. Will definitely be back,5,2016,08,01
205,Night in Dublin ,Stayed here last night. Beautiful hotel and very comfortable. Staff very helpful. Bedroom good size with very comfortable bed. Great nights sleep. Will definitely be back.  Not far into city centre €10-€12 in taxi or bus runs frequently on main road outside hotel or brisk 15 min walk. ,5,2016,07,31
205,Good stay,"Stayed here for one night with dinner package. Room was v nice. Dinner in restaurant was good. Had lovely treatments in the spa and got hair done in salon - would def recommend. We were a little disappointed with the hot food at breakfast, expected better from a 5 star hotel. That said, I'd still stay here again. ",4,2016,07,30
205,Lunch at a function last week,"I have been to the InterContinental hotel many times in Dublin and its pre-deccessdor the Four Seasons - the decor in this hotel is lovely and they didnt change much when it was taken over by the IC.  The bar to the left of the reception is very airy and bright and there is a lovely garden that you can sit out in if the weather is nice.   We had our own private room for the function and the food was delicious 3 choices of main course was hard to decide but I had the beef it was done to perfection, the starter was one of my all time favourites lots of meats (chorizo/salami) with smoked salmon and a smoked salmon mousse.  Dessert was a selection of cheesecakes with a few other little bites.  All accompanied by a lovely white wine.   The InterContinental has a great standard the rooms are airy and spacious when I stayed there 2 years ago at Christmas it was beautifully decorated complete with a gingerbread house.......",5,2016,07,29
205,Lovely hotel and staff,"I'm becoming more and more of a fan of Intercontinental. The beds are suuuper comfortable and the rooms here are a good size with beautiful bathrooms (mine had double French doors and a tub separate from the shower). 
As if it needs to be said of the Irish, but the staff is very friendly and helpful. The gym is decent and the pool looked well kept, though I didn't go in. The hot tub looked enjoyable as well. Everyone seemed to enjoy the food also! Great stay. ",4,2016,07,22
205,New experience worth the money,"Staying in 5* hotels is definitely not my thing considering price you have to pay. However, once in a while it's great to treat yourself so we did. We decided to visit Dublin for family trip and main purpose was sightseeing so we didn't spend to much time in a hotel. However every minute spent  there was worth the money. From start, once we arrived there was no problem to check in before 3. Jane, on check in very helpful and welcoming. Room was immaculate! Design is definitely not my cup of tea but change is good sometimes. Beds are extremely comfortable. I had the best sleep ever! Having diner in a restaurant was also great experience. Collen and Gabor are really hard working and extremely helpful people. Such a bonus for company. Nothing was too much trouble for them, thank you! Also, gentlemen on check out, I do apologise but I don't remember the full name just initials R.I (from my invoice)Wednesday morning was really professional and although we had a slight issue with the bill, he sorted this out very quickly and in very positive manner. Great leisure facilities. The only downside to be honest for my taste  was slightly boring terrace menu. However it is also worth to mention that beef burger was definitely one of the best my fiancé, who is biggest fan of burgers, ever had. Although hotel is located about 1,5 km from the city centre, walking in this area is a real pleasure. I would highly recommend this hotel as a treat for yourself. ",5,2016,07,20
205,"Nice, well appointed hotel, great service - but they messed up the bill, again!","From the bulk of what I experienced I would have been happy to give this place 5 stars - the rooms are spacious and clean, the public spaces very nice, and the staff at the front desk, bars, and elsewhere professional and obliging. A few things are starting to get a bit tatty (e.g. menus in the bars could do with replacement, or at least a good wipe down), but all in all we had a very enjoyable stay.

But then later I find, for the second time in as many stays, I've been overcharged - and now, with the error acknowledged, I am told it will be 5-10 days for a refund! What's worse, on check-out the bill looked about right, only to find later that it omitted the final night, which was charged after I checked out (ironically, if not for this I might never have found the error). The whole thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth, as well as a costly waste of time to get to the bottom of. It also lets down what is otherwise a very good hotel, and makes me seriously ask whether I want to risk a third time.

So, while this is a lovely property, I advise seriously checking your room charges match your reservation (or if using a site like Expedia you aren't charged a second time, as happened to me the previous time).",4,2016,07,19
205,Disappointed,"Ok so the good news . The reception staff were excellent . We were upgraded to a large room ,  the hotel wasn't busy . 

We had a drink in the bar before going out . Not as I remember it when I stayed before. 
Bar Staff whilst ok were slightly disinterested. No decent drinks menu was available. 
Breakfast was....not good. Completely disorganised and poorly stocked . 
A large tour group had just left ..so maybe they cleaned them out.!
I was also body checked by a guy intent on wiping up a minor spillage . 
The floor staff were doing their best but they seemed under terrible pressure. 
On our second night we arrived back having had a busy business schedule all day . My wife needed a sandwich . We ordered promptly with a very pleasant waiter..only to have another waiter come up ..take the menu from my hand and inform me ""The kitchen is Closed"". I laughed ( i didnt want to entertain the alternative)  and got the first waiter's attention. He apologised for his colleague's behaviour and said the order was in. This  boorish behaviour is unacceptable in any hotel least of all one that is an aspirational five star. 
When the food came it was very tasty. 
And to cap it all we were woken by a car alarm in the hotel car park  which went off at 7-15 am . I made an enquiry(brought it to their attention) and the staff didn't know whose car it was. It was a nice Loud car alarm 
For the above reasons we will not be going back.",3,2016,07,19
205,Luxury and Romance,"There is no doubt that this hotel is lavishly decorated, the entrance lobby is grand and this flows throughout the hotel. The staff are fantastic. The breakfast is fabulous. We stayed in an executive room which was lovely, lots of space and a great bathroom. The only reason that it is not a 5 in the review is that there could be some 5* trimmings like a chocolate on the pillow,and you have to pay for parking as a resident!",4,2016,07,19
205,Lovely ,This is a really lovely hotel. It's in a very quiet nice area. It's a long walk to the city center but walkable! The rooms are super large and spacious! And the bathroom is very large. Very much enjoyed the robe and slippers too. Front desk staff was very nice and helpful! Great hotel in Dublin! ,5,2016,07,18
205,Family break,"This is the best family hotel we have stayed in Ireland. The junior suite was very spacious. The little extras provided, especially for the kids made a big difference. The leisure facilities were very luxurious and we all enjoyed it tremendously. The staff were very helpful and we'll be back",5,2016,07,17
205,"Luxury hotel, first class","We stayed at the Intercontinental for a week in May. Charming hotel, luxurious rooms, excellent breakfast, afternoon tea, spa and pool. I heartily recommend this hotel. The only negative was the charge for the car park, but I would definitely stay there again. ",5,2016,07,16
205,Somewhat different,Of course you expect luxury. Luxurious surroundings but very strong damp smell in corridor but we were assured by management that renovations are in place and this problem would be resolved.   Management were extremely keen to please.  Would return upon improvement,4,2016,07,14
205,Loved this luxury hotel!,"Our 2 week vacation to Ireland was amazing and we spent our last 4 days in Dublin at this gorgeous hotel.    The lobby lounge area is very large and inviting where we were treated to a lovely piano music on Saturday night and delicious food from their special menu ...very relaxing atmosphere 
There is also a restaurant where we enjoyed breakfast a few mornings.   The staff are very friendly and helpful.    The best part though were the beds which were so comfortable - we slept great after long days walking & touring.    Definitely would stay here again.   ",5,2016,07,13
205,Good hotel for older people.  ,Nice but old.  Not quite keeping up with modern times.  Far from all the sites but there is a yellow tour bus that will come around.   Staff is friendly but the service wasn't really 5 star it seemed like there a bit of snobbishness that went along with the hotel.  ,4,2016,07,12
205,My new favourite Dublin Hotel,"Booked in here for a one night stay . Was taking my sister and daughter to the Beyoncé concert and had honestly struggled to find a hotel in Dublin that night that wasn't extortionately expensive . I usually stay in the centre of town but it was a very busy weekend in Dublin . This is a really lovely hotel and probably because it is not in the centre it has a lovely calm atmosphere . We arrived at 10 am and knew our room wouldn't be ready , reception organised for our bags to be delivered to the too when it was available . We headed off to the bus stop , ( 2 minutes down the road ) but then realised you need coins to get on the bus they don't accept notes and we only had notes !! So decided to head back to hotel to order taxi by which time too was ready !!! We had been upgrade to executive suite !! And very nice it was to !!! Big living room and huge bed room with great sized bathroom, great space for the 3 of us ! Nice coffee machine as well !! Just wished we could have spent more time in the hotel but with a teenage daughter keen to hit the shops and the concert to go to that was not to be !!! Breakfast the next morning was delicious with lots of choice and the roomin which we ate it was beautiful !! All the staff we dealt with were very cautious and couldn't do,enough to help you . I was worried about the location but this hotel is on a great bus route (remember to get coins ) and a taxi to centre of town was on average between 10 and 12 Euro . Actually it was rather nice being out of town it was nice and peaceful . I just wished I could have spent more time here and we all agreed that our stay was too short !! Thankyou Intercontinental for our upgraded room you mad our sy at even more special and we will be back !!!",5,2016,07,11
205,"Great beds, great service, big rooms and minor areas of improvement","I just returned from a weekend in Dublin. Explored multiple hotels and chose the Intercontinental since it offered a very competitive rate for a weekend when most hotels were sold out or charging premium rates. 

Location is great, away from the hustle and bustle from Temple Bar area but still a comfortable 30 minute walk to the city centre. As reference, the taxi from airport took 30 minutes and paid 30 euros. 

I am currently spending 3 weeks per month travelling for business or pleasure and I must admit that the Intercontinental was a very pleasant surprise since it has a true luxurious feel to it. 

Service was excellent, from front desk, restaurants, bars, chamber maids, etc. 

Rooms are huge, with big closet, an oversized bathroom with bathtub and separate shower. WC cubicle is within main bathroom but separated for added privacy. 
Highlight in room was the exceptionally comfortable beds with great pillows and duvets. I had one of the best night sleep in the last month in the hotel. 

Public areas are quite refined and elegant, and there is a modern gym in the basement with a small pool with swim lane and a spa. 

Few areas of improvement based on my experience: 
*Room sound-proofing could be improved. Walls seem to be quite thin and if you have noisy neighbors you can literally hear their conversations. I had to be changed from my original room for this reason. 
*While breakfast experience was very pleasant (loved the egg station and the dark bread with dried fruits), I had dinner in the lobby bar (very nice area) and the recommended burger was sincerely bad: Cold and charred bun, thick dry and clearly overcooked beef patty with lumps of hard meat inside and mushy fries. It may just have been bad luck but an area to improve. 

Overall an excellent experience with minor areas of improvement. Certainly recommended for those looking for a more upscale experience while visiting Dublin.",5,2016,07,10
205,Perfect,Quite generous space wise for rooms with very comfortable beds. Exceptional and spatious bathroom and very decent. Excellent for those seeking quietness as it is outside central Dublin. Enjoyed the swimming though pool is small. Appetizing food and best bar tenders,5,2016,07,09
205,Disappointed,"On the surface a lovely hotel, nice surroundings, good food well priced however bedding was not fresh, feather under blanket made bed smell stale, mattress dipped terribly, no room turn down either night. Secondly my bedroom door was left open, I think most of the day! I left for a meeting at 9.00 leaving a please service sign on the door, and came back at 4.00 to find door ajar, very disappointing! Such a shame as I was terribly looking forward to my stay!
The staff were not overly friendly other than the doorman who was terribly helpful when I arrived!
Would I stay again? No, better hotels in the vicinity.",3,2016,07,07
205,"Great property , trifle far from city center ",The property is beautiful . We had a junior suite which was roomy and large . The staff is pleasant but not very efficient. For example they didnot call us when our room was ready for checkin despite promising to do so ( we are IHG gold members at that ) Similarly we had to follow up twice to get our dinner reservations . Finally we called the restaurant directly only to be told that Intercontinental had already booked on our behalf but no one ever told us. Conceirge desk stands mostly empty with the front office staff doubling up as the Conceirge and depending on their mood and the busy hour you will get a service which can range from completely indifferent to extremely helpful . Breakfast is very good and the service is attentive. The hotel is located in an extremely pretty neighborhood . The bus stop is two minute walk from the hotel but the service is every 10-15 minutes . The city center is 11-12 euro cab ride away. ,4,2016,07,06
205,Amazing Spa - DVD Player,"I travelled to this hotel away from my normal ""home from home"" I thought the staff were all lovely.  The spa facilities are excellent with a lovely large Jacuzzi and swimming pool / outside terrace and separate woman's sauna and steam room. 

It was great as I could recharge after work with pure relaxation, unwind and rebalance. 

The room service team were brilliant allowing me to pick off menu options, it really helped me having home comforts.  Also my room had a dvd player which was great for catching up on my box sets. 

Only downside was IHG don't offer status match so along time to accrue points and I thought breakfast and parking were over priced - €28 for breakfast and €16 for 1 nights parking.",4,2016,07,06
205,Fantastic Hotel,"My husband and three children stayed here, we had two rooms for three nights.  This was a wonderful hotel with fantastic food, service and the rooms were of high standard.  The ambience and overall feel were so good we hardly wanted to leave to explore Dublin.  Lee who was a young waiter there, really engaged and nothing was any trouble.

At night from 7-10pm there was a delightful older man on the piano who entertained in a most enjoyable calming manner.

The Salon was also really good, I had my hair coloured/blow dryed and nails done, great service and terrific job by staff at Blow Salon.

I also left my brand new Chanel sunglasses in a case in my room and yes they found them and are posting them.

I would fly to Dublin just to stay in this hotel again, comparable quality to Bellagio, Vegas without too many people.",5,2016,07,05
205,Special Spa day !,"3 of us spent a splendid day at the spa in the international continental hotel in Ballsbridge.  Great gym, sauna and steam rooms. Fantastic ambiance  and very relaxing escape.  Nice friendly touches from staff- water delivered to us at the poolside and plenty tea, coffee and fruit. Our treatments were amazing and I have to say that Eunice and Christine our therapists were super and looked after us all very very well.  They are trained to deal with recovering cancer patients too - one of our group was very impressed with this aspect.",5,2016,07,04
205,Superb hotel & friendly welcoming staff. ,"From the very warm welcome to the food, drinks and room and amenities.. I loved every moment staying here! The staff make you feel like a superstar with a big smile & greeting you hello as well as the doormen always opening and closing the front hotel doors for you. My only complaint I have is, I wish I could of stayed longer. Thank you to everyone at the hotel for a truly wonderful stay. I shall return!! ",5,2016,07,03
205,Flawless,"A perfect hotel, lovely and clean, can not fault this place. I have stayed here several times and every time has been outstanding. The grounds are also superb with staff on hand to help with everything.",5,2016,07,02
205,Faultless ,"Stayed here for a long day and night in December 2015. I'd rang ahead and said I'd be very early, I was totally accommodated on arrival and upgraded to suite.

Room was one of best I've ever stayed in - almost four rooms in one. Room was very well serviced and superbly stocked. 

Lunch was excellent as was breakfast next morning, service really attentive.

Overall this is one of best hotels in Dublin, possibly Ireland . Sets a standee and has held it for years. ",5,2016,06,27
205,Luxurious hotel just a bit away from city center,"Formerly a Four Seasons Hotel, Intercontinental took over in early 2015.  Nicely appointed large room and bath.  Outstanding staff and service.  The breakfast was just fine as well. We enjoyed our stay here.",5,2016,06,26
205,"Fantastic Staff, Hotel and Location","I wanted to share what a terrific experience our family had here. First, the hotel is beautiful and the staff exceptionally warm and helpful. Special kudo's to the front desk staff Michele, Lily, Rad and Siobhan. The doormen were also very helpful in constantly flagging cabs and scheduling cabs for 5-6 people, special thanks to Aaron, Isaac and Blad.

The food was terrific - everything from breakfast at seasons, to the lobby lounge with all kinds of light and heavy dishes. 

The location is a bit outside the heavy traffic Downtown Dublin - but that was a positive for us as it was quiet and peaceful at night, easy walking distance to Merrion Street with lots of restaurants, shops etc - and an inexpensive 10-15 minute can ride to virtually anywhere in the city. 

Plus, the city scales hop on hop off bus tour was literally right outside the hotel's front door! 

Highly, highly recommended for family stays.",5,2016,06,23
205,Afternoon tea ,"Hi went here for my dads 80th sadly he's very unwell and is on permeant oxygen. However I booked afternoon tea and explained all of this in an email to reservations. 

From the moment we arrived the staff were outstanding from having a wheelchair ready to placing us a nice quite area. The staff made us all very welcome. The hotel is beautiful and the afternoon tea was lovely. Thank you all very much for making it a stress free afternoon. ",5,2016,06,21
205,"Check-in Bad, butu much improved once we made it to room.","Check-in was a mess.  5 guests randomly stood waiting for one check-in staff with no line, no check-in area for Ambassador or IHG members.  Another person did show up and we got started.  They took my card and decided to bill me in USD, which I said I did not want to be billed in USD.  She said then hit the red button.  She then gave me the receipt to sign still in USD.  I told her I did not want to be billed in USD.  She told me it did not matter.  I really do not like it when people tell me how I should think and feel about spending my money on my credit card.  For those of you that do not know if you convert the currency back to your home currency when traveling abroad you are charged a 3% exchange rate fee from the actual exchange rate. This is to make up for most cards no longer charging the 3% fee they used to bill on all foreign transactions.  Anyway, once we got the key the room was very nice, the staff we met were very nice and helped to correct the attitude of the check-in experience.  Hopefully check out will be good or I will come back and update this review.  Location is quite good, fairly easy to walk to Trinity and the downtown financial area if the weather cooperates.",3,2016,06,19
205,Not one negative thing to say or item I would change,"Everything from the bell men, front desk, wait staff, housekeeping and all the amenities…..nothing could go wrong at this hotel. We slept like a baby every night! The breakfast buffet was above average and all the fruit was as fresh as fresh could be.",5,2016,06,12
205,"Fantastic hotel, decent location ","Hotel is a wonderful accommodation. Upscale, well appointed, very comfortable - cozy bed, cozy towels, even a soft cozy rug underfoot! Rooms are sizable and come with a separate shower/tub. Staff is friendly and accommodating. Has a great tea room, two hotel bars and a restaurant. Food is genuinely delicious.  Hotel also has a very well appointed gym (several cardio machines, reasonable selection of weights) plus a lap pool and hot tub. Also a spa, with separate men's/women's locker rooms with steam rooms and sauna room - which hotel guests may use without spa appointment.  The entire spa is well taken care of - it feels luxurious

Overall, a remarkable stay - alone which deserves five stars.  I am giving four stars for the location. It is just adjacent to Royal Dublin Society and other businesses, so this may be perfect for some.  For my recreational travel, this was a touch out of the way for my liking. It is still very walkable - about 30 min to St Stephens Green on flat roads - and from there you can get most places of interest in 2-20 min walking.   There are bus lines near and a DART station near, usable to head the direction of city center.  Taxis are also abundant All the same, I'd prefer to be about 10 min walking from city center for ease and as walking is my preferred mode when traveling. 
",4,2016,06,12
205,The best of the best,"This hotel was by far the finest I have ever had the pleasure to have stayed.
From the front doormen to the opulent main entrance and dining hall this hotel in Ballsbridge is the in best area/location and makes all feel welcome.",5,2016,06,10
205,lovely hotel,A classy hotel on the outskirts of Dublin and within 5 minutes walk of the train. The hotel is large but the staff are brilliant and all extremely helpful. Room was lovely and big and the bed was really comfortable. Nice and quiet with a good nights sleep. Would definitely return.,5,2016,06,09
205,Excellent Hotel,"We were staying in InterContinental Hotel during our business trip for airline convention few days ago and can easily highlight the professionalism of the hotel personnel that performed high quality customer service. Very elegant interior, nice, clean and fresh. Hotel has great a location with easy excess to the city. We would like to thank InterContinental team for a comfortable and relaxing stay. Definitely recommend everyone to enjoy this experience.",5,2016,06,08
205,Excellent Dublin Hotel,"We stayed here for one night on our anniversary and loved the experience! We were upgraded to a suite upon arrival and the front desk staff were very friendly. 

The room was amazing with all luxuries you could want, including an Nespresso machine, minibar, multiple TV, balcony, an excellent shower and very comfortable bed!

Given it is a 5 star hotel, expect to pay 5 star prices, two cocktails came to €30😞 breakfast was extra for us at €28/person, but it was fab too be fair!

If highly recommend friends to stay in this hotel ",5,2016,06,05
205,Classy classic,Nice performance by the staff. The hotel offers comfortable rooms in a classic style. Nice bar. Good gym. Pleasant outdoor space. Great venue for large functions. However the neighborhood is not particularly interesting and it is a walk to the true downtown. ,4,2016,06,04
205,One of the best stays ever. ,This hotel is elagant and comfortable with some of the most solicitous staff I have encountered. The facility and grounds are beautiful and meticulously maintained.  The food was fantastic. We especially enjoyed the Florida interns working there.  The location is excellent for walking around the old city center. ,5,2016,06,04
205,"Four nigths at a convention, at the location","The room is very comfortable in size , lay Out and facilities....special working desk w/ conections for usb and European system 
Bathroom facilities also very confortable and w/ a very good space. Shower in separate compartment as well as toilet",4,2016,06,04
205,Exceptional Hotel & Wonderful Dublin Oasis!,"Beautiful property, lovely gardens, stunning reception rooms, yummy dining & great rooms = Intercontinental Dublin. Had an easy check-in, recognized IHG membership & was assigned gorgeous suite overlooking gardens. Enjoyed every minute of my 3 night stay. Appreciated cheerful & efficient service by all staff. WIFI was fast & free for IHG members. Bed was a joy to climb into each night; so comfortable! Would definitely return & have already recommended to family & friends!",5,2016,06,03
205,Suburban Dublin comfort,"The hotel as reviewed many times on TA provides a comfortable and relaxing contrast to the bustle of the Dublin City Centre. The suburban location creates a helpful buffer from the traffic in the Centre, which is probably best avoided by using the local DART metro to enter or transverse the city. In the hotel itself, the service and attentiveness of the staff tick all of the important boxes. What is most distinctive is the calm atmosphere of the main central area of the hotel and the ability to sit and enjoy a coffee or something stronger in the interior atrium/conservatory area outside the restaurant/bar. The rooms and corridors are slightly prone to noise on account of the concrete frame, not a big deal, but you may wish to go higher rather than lower on the floor level for your room. All in all a very comfortable choice if you are combining a relax with something energetic in Dublin itself.       ",5,2016,06,01
205,Excellent,"A superbly located big chain hotel which still manages to deliver very good levels of luxe and service. This property was previously a well worn but opulent 4 seasons - the intercontinental has taken over in the last 2 years and in my view and actually brought the hotel on to a different level. 

Room - large. At least 50% bigger v london. Well appointed, modern without being all shiny and tacky. Bathrooms are super - all marble and mine had separate shower / bath.  We had in room breakfast - my usual poached eggs / toast and coffee. ( actually quite tough to get perfect by the time it arrives in the room - especially if I'm demanding runny eggs and crunchy hot toast ) Well - it was faultless making me think the eggs were actually poached in the corridor outside the room! 

Location wise the hotel is located in Ballsbridge. Leafy and super safe its 10mins to the city centre and about 40 mins to the airport. I like the area. Theres some decent jogging routes in the area too - the coast is about a 8 mins run from the hotel and herbert park is a 5 minutes run. The hotel has a narrow pool / decent hotel gym etc. 

Price wise - its on par with other 5 stars in the city but i think a little nicer than most.",5,2016,05,31
205,Spa perfection,"From your arrival at the door to your exit, this is a wonderful quality of service. It's the best you can get.
In particular, the Spa is restful and provides all you could wish for. Not many use the pool,plenty of loungers to rest on.
The bar is a wood and brass zone with busy and efficient staff.Great Irish sized measures from the well stocked spirits display. Good bar food and beautifully presented sandwiches.
Clients have accents from around the world and it's comforting to know that this is a hotel with the highest standards. Definitely a place to return to.",5,2016,05,31
205,Another brilliant stay,"We stayed at this awesome Hotel last year when our son got married to an Irish girl and we had a fantastic stay so we were keen to stay again this year while visiting our son and it was as great as ever !  Fantastic hotel with great service all round, amazing rooms with very comfortable beds and fantastic food ! As an IHG Platinum member and avid travelers we always stay in Intercontinental's and this Hotel would rate at number 1. Wished we could of stayed longer !",5,2016,05,29
205,"The best in Dublin, but no loyalty privileges","I would love to give this hotel 5 star rating, but reserving one star for lack of any loyalty benefit they offer. Hotel is truly royal, grandiose, and luxurious. Doormen are super courteous and helpful and you get the best first impression. Rooms and facilities are good too. I stayed there for 4 nights last month, and I booked executive room. I am a spire elite member, which is the highest level of IHG rewards program. Yet, I was offered probably the worst room (of course no upgrade, no corner room yet far from the lift, no view whatsoever, and no welcome amenity). It was facing back road, and in the night there was constant noise at a high decibel of car alarm blaring. I just couldn't sleep. No room preferences were honored. When I checked hotel website and saw the room photos, I realized I was given classic room instead of executive room, which means I was actually given a downgrade! I was upset and called up hotel front desk. Duty manager apologized, and they moved me to another room in the middle of the night, which was a suite. It had no view, but the room was amazing with a huge bathroom. Next day morning, Mr. Bob sent me a souvenir and a note apologizing for the incident.

While I truly appreciate this gesture, this could have been avoided at the time of check-in. Spa and fitness facility was good too. Breakfast was very normal though, no vegetarian options except yogurt and granola. 

Overall I liked the stay and would come back.",4,2016,05,28
205,Adequate. Beware of thin walls. ,"I stayed at the Intercontinental for 3 nights to attend business meetings on-site. The experience was okay, if unexceptional. 

+ it was quick to get around the premises, with hotel rooms in close proximity to the restaurant and meeting facilities
+ it is located in a nice, seemingly safe neighbourhood for jogging
+ it takes 10 minutes by cab to get to the city centre (eg St Stephens Green, Grafton Street)
+ free wifi
+ curry for room service was quite tasty (but order a side of vegetables with it)

- the walls are incredibly thin for a hotel of this caliber; I could clearly hear the entire conversation between the American man next door and his family, from the beginning of his FaceTime session to the end
- rooms are medium sized; mine had a view of nothing in particular
- room service was a bit pricey, especially for breakfast (about €20 for an egg white omelette and a grapefruit juice)

Whilst the Intercontinental was fine, there are alternatives in Dublin that offer a better rate and are in the city centre that I would prefer. 
",3,2016,05,27
205,superb property in an excellent location.,"previously an outstanding Four Seasons hotel it is now an Intercontinental work in progress.This is my second visit  and I found them greatly improved.The staff are more relaxed and very friendly,and are extremely helpful. The bar , the lounge area and the pool are all as usual, excellent. These are some of the best bedrooms in dublin city,both for sleeping or dining.It was nice to see the Dublin famllies using the facilities
for special occasions.It always brings life to the property.",4,2016,05,23
205,A Dublin Delight,"This was our first stay at this hotel.  The first impression was really good and the receptionist who booked us in could not have been more helpful and polite. We felt welcome from the moment we entered the hotel.

Our room was of the quality you would expect from an Inter Continental and super comfortable. The room we had was classed as a Junior suite and had a good seating area, a well equipped comfortable bedroom and fantastic en suite,

We also used room service which was quickly provided and was very tasty.

The spa facilities are also first class and on the morning we used them not too busy.

Love this hotel we will return.",5,2016,05,20
205,Gorgeous hotel,I have stayed here several times on business. It is a beautiful hotel. Formerly a Four Seasons Hotel now operated by InterContinental chain. It is about a 25 minute walk from downtown Dublin or a €10 cab ride. Very luxurious rooms with spa baths. Hotel also has a Spa and lovely restaurant. I highly recommend. Not cheap!,5,2016,05,18
205,Disappointing ,"After staying in this hotel many times before we were really looking forward to our night away. Check in was efficient, lobby decor was nice. Our room was fine but decor was outdated but clean so that was fine. I always look forward to a bath when I stay in a hotel but was disappointed as there was no bath, a fine big shower but would have preferred both. We ate out & returned to the bar where we met a very nice barman who chatted with us, he then left the bar and the other barman was rude & complaining to his supervisor about having to stay late as he was in again early in the morning, they had 2 different functions that night, not enjoyable to hear the staff arguing in front of guests! Breakfast was tasty and the omelette chef was lovely. Overall this hotel is not a patch on what it was before (previously the Four Seasons) and as a result I will not return as the price does not justify the experience. ",2,2016,05,17
205,Always Brilliant ,"If you want to stay in a 'proper' hotel then this is the one for you. Classy, impressive with great food and drinks. 
A favourite of mine where I have stayed many times, this recent trip I was upgraded into a magnificent suite, huge!! 
A firm favourite for my Dublin business trips. ",5,2016,05,17
205,Great hotel let down by indifferent service,"A beautiful hotel which is reasonably central, upgraded to a suite which was nice and the check in was good but the service beyond that was all over the place. In the bar the staff kept disappearing and some were happy to pass through with out offering to serve and at breakfast it was worse. Toast ordered never turned up, coffee was Luke warm, Bill brought for signing and no pen left. The restaurant was not particularly busy but the staff seemed confused and disorganised.  A taxi booked by the hotel to the airport bizarrely meant you were committed to pay by cash!",4,2016,05,15
205,beauitul hotel but missing attention to detail,Stayed her in December with my 2 sisters. We booked one room for the 3 of us. We checked in and there was only 1 double bed and amenities for 2 people. We were going out and mentioned it to reception. They got the sofa bed made up and it was lovely. Then they forgot to give us another towel etc. Beautiful building,3,2016,05,13
205,Beautiful Hotel,"The hotel was farther away from downtown attractions, so keeping that in mind when looking for a hotel close to those attractions.  Our room was a suite, and gorgeous and comfortable.  I loved the soaking tub and loved the robe available for guests.  The classic and elagant decor is amazing as there seems to be quite a few hand blown chandeliers that were just gorgeous to see.  A more pricey hotel, and offers a spa for those wanting a little more pampering during their stay.  ",5,2016,05,06
205,Five Star all the Way,"The InterContinental  is a beautiful, bright, sparkling, clean, luxurious 5-star.  Exactly as expected - and the location (Dublin's Ballsbridge) is in one of the poshest parts of the city.  A particular highlight was the huge bathtub in the room!",5,2016,05,05
205,Fantastic Stay,"I stayed in the Intercon last Saturday the 23rd April 2016. 

Before I had even arrived, Lynda in reservations was so helpful and kind that I had a good impression of the Hotel. 

Our room was stunning and the staff were all very helpful, particularly the doorman who told us an interesting story about the ducks who have been coming to the Hotel entrance for years.

10/10 - thoroughly enjoyable visit! I will certainly be staying again.",5,2016,04,29
205,Embassy district-Ballsbridge,"The location, very close to the American Embassy and most of the others, was very lovely, but still a 10 minute cab ride to the center of town.  The rooms were nice, and the service throughout the hotel was excellent.",4,2016,04,28
205,I really good 4 star hotel,"This hotel has a really great location and the building is great, good pool, large size room and wide passages.  However, the service levels are now beginning to show signs of severe strain and disappointment.  Waiting time in restaurants is growing, food quality is deteriorating and signs of overall staff fatigue and disengagement are showing through.  The only thing that is not travelling south is the price...",3,2016,04,28
205,First time in 5* was not disappointed,"Brilliant hotel located in an afluent part of Dublin with frequent buses to the city centre. The photos posted on this site don't quite do it justice, throughout are very well presented rooms and communal areas.  Although we didn't use the spa or pool we were impressed with our first Five Star experience. Dispite being over €170 per night in a standard double room, breakfast wasn't included and was €28 extra per person per morning. Personally I would stick to more moderately priced accommodation but if your budget allows then I would highly recommend.",5,2016,04,25
205,Lovely hotel and spa close to the centre,"I arrived for a 3 day conference in the city and found the hotel a nice relaxed place away from the hustle and bustle closer to the river. The 3km walk from the CCD centre (next to the Liffe) is straightforward and doesnt have any hills or too many obsticles and nice to do on a good day. Luckily I had a couple.
As for the hotel.The bar and lounge areas are great and the Irish coffee one of the nicest I've had. Breakfast was good, though I did expect more choice to be offered considering the price.
I was fortunate to be upgraded to a suite which was huge, though didnt spend enough time in to make the most of it.
Some of the public area carpets are starting to look a little old, but I'm sure that will be addressed in the near future.",5,2016,04,25
205,Would stay again,"5 star quality as expected. Staff were very friendly and couldn't do enough for you. Hotel room was spacious and very comfortable. The hotel itself is lovely. My only grumble would be with the spa as the changing rooms are situated where you have to walk down the corridor in your swimwear, I would have thought that they would have had the changing rooms in a position that you walk straight out into the pool area. Hotel is situated within 5 minutes walk to the train station.",5,2016,04,23
205,Not the Four Season anymore,"We stayed at the hotel before Easter and What a change from 4 Season . The service was poor and slow. Especially in the restaurant and the lounge - they simple forgot our order ! The waiting time was very long and uncoordinated. 
On the up side was that the rooms are still Nice and the Spa. Also the receptionists are helpful.",3,2016,04,21
205,Great hotel ,Visited intercontinental last weekend and stayed one night. Lovely hotel and staff are very friendly and attentive. We ate twice in the bar and the food was very good. We also had a lovely breakfast. I would return without hesitation on my next visit to Dublin.  ,5,2016,04,20
205,Not quite a five star.,"I treated my mum to a night away here for her birthday in January. She was so excited as she has always wanted to stay in the former four seasons. Unfortunately we we're very disappointed with the outcome of the stay. We have spoken to management already and everything is sorted. The team there are lovely and represent the intercontinental brand well. We also enjoyed our meal we had in the lounge that evening, the breakfast was excellent as well.
I would be lying if saying they are still a five star, they still have a long way to go.
Thank you !",4,2016,04,20
205,5 star relaxation as expected,"Stayed for a weekend, hotel was everything you would expect from a hotel of this class. There was a function on the Friday night and although the lounge was lively, nothing at all could be heard in the rooms. All the staff very polite and helpful, but the waiter Joey was very informative without being intrusive. The hotel is in a quitter area in the south of the city with a few quality restaurants and bars near by, which are far superior and better value than the centre. I will certainly return.",5,2016,04,19
205,Great location and wonderful restaurant,I stayed for one night while on business in the Ballsbridge area and was super impressed by this hotel. The new Season restaurant has a marvellous menu and is very reasonably priced. I especially liked the spa and treatment area.,5,2016,04,17
205,So relaxing!,"This hotel is top notch! From the decor to the friendly staff you feel like royalty. The rooms are huge! The sheets are a high quality, so soft and comfortable. Bring your bubble bath with you to relax in the inviting bathtub.  The hotel has a spa which you don't want to miss pampering yourself some. It's easy to catch a quick train/bus to the city center temple bar area. What a great stay!",5,2016,04,17
205,Visit for a U2 concert,"We stayed at the InterContinental because it was part of the U2 package that we purchased.  We booked a couple of extra nights on our own as we were staying a bit longer.  The hotel was fantastic!  The service was excellent from all the staff we encountered, the room was delightful, extremely spacious and very clean.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin City.  The only drawback would be that it is a taxi ride or bus ride to get to the city center, too far to walk.",5,2016,04,14
205,An upgrade from heaven!,"If anyone gets curious and reads my reviews, he/she knows that sometimes I just feel like treating myself...my employer pays for basic accommodations when traveling on business, and any upgrade would be at my own expense.  So, as I had read that this hotel was pretty spectacular, I decided to experience that.  I was so happy I did that. 

Firstly, it's important to know that any room at this hotel will be nice.  I took the liberty of wandering the halls a little after I arrived and peered into any room that a maid would let me look at (they were careful to show me only vacated rooms).  So, if and when I come back, I will gladly accept the rooms my employer has chosen to pay for.  However, I will say that I felt almost royal in getting the 2-room suite.  It was lovely, large, and had great views.  I was not on the top floor, so didn't get a direct sea view, but it was an open look towards the coast with a glimpse of water.  It had a huge master bedroom with its own luxurious, marble-trimmed bathroom, with tub separate from shower and water closet.  A sitting room with desk led to the bathroom, and the walk-in closet was incredible.  The separate living room, complete with balcony, could convert to a second bedroom, as it had a full-sized pull out couch bed, its own closet, and even it's own bathroom, desk, and table!  The bed in the master was super-comfortable, with luxury linens.  The bathroom was outfitted with high-end amenities, including toothbrush and toothpaste, as well as luxury soaps, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, etc.  And, of course, there was a plate of chocolates on the desk - what could be better?  The staff is super-attentive and very accommodating.  The parking is paid parking, which is on normal days ample, but can get very busy on weekends during special events.  There is the valet option, as well.  Remember that parking in Dublin is never cheap or easy, so I didn't find the hotel's rates unreasonable by that standard.  I took one meal in the bar, which was just fabulous even though it was just toasted sandwich with fries (the ingredients and prep were top-notch), and enjoyed the ""craic"" with the bartenders (even though they were ultra-busy, they still had time to chat). I had the Sunday breakfast buffet, very decadent.  This is a world-class hotel, without doubt, and I'm very happy my employer found it!",5,2016,04,14
205,Exceptional and Exquisite Grand 5* Hotel in Ballsbridge,"Recently went to Dublin on business and I stayed for two nights at the InterContinental Dublin (formerly known as the Four Seasons). The hotel is located in the heart of Ballsbridge which is a very upmarket part of the City where most of the international embassies are located. It is also quite conveniently located to a number of local shops, cafes and restaurants. The walk to my client offices was 20mins from the hotel and it offered as pleasant daily walk.

First impressions were that the building is grand, magnificent in stature and magnitude. From the moment you walk into the lobby, you feel like you have been transferred to a different world. The lobby and reception area was beautiful with great attention to detail. The check-in process was swift, helpful and smooth and the receptionist was extremely helpful. The room I stayed in on the third was floor was very comfortable and large in size. The bathrooms was layered in marble with a large bathtub. The guest WIFI was also good so no complaints there. The bathroom and walk-in closet on either side of the entry 'foyer' were huge! The front desk staff were extremely gracious and helpful as well in answering any queries that I raised. Breakfast was included in my room rate and it was okay. The service is good but the selection is somewhat limited in my honest opinion. When I recently stayed at the Hilton and DoubleTree Hotel around the corner, I have always found their breakfast buffer to offer a greater variety. Overall no complanints, its a lovely hotel and it is located in a good location. ",5,2016,04,14
205,Beautiful hotel with lovely service,"Though we were on just a quick overnight business trip, I would have loved to have stayed longer at this lovely hotel.  The lobby and beautiful garden-type breakfast/lounge area featured gorgeous chandeliers and comfortable seating.  Service was top-notch and unobtrusive, whether a guest wanted a lovely cup of coffee or tea, some food, or just a quiet place to relax.  The guest room was extremely large; the bathroom and walk-in closet on either side of the entry 'foyer'  were huge!  The front desk staff were extremely gracious and helpful with directions to the very close bus stop, where we caught the bus to Trinity College.  Lovely, lovely place. (note: though on the SE side of Dublin, we weren't too far from anything.)",5,2016,04,13
205,Relax in luxury ,"The interContinental hotel Dublin sets the standards for other hotels to follow. From the welcoming front of house staff to the excellent room design and layout this hotel truly offers a ""home from home"" feeling.
This hotel is well placed for a weekend visit to Dublin or for the business traveller wishing to relax after a hard day in the office. Excellent gym and pool, suitable for family and the travelling business person.
",5,2016,04,11
205,Wonderful Experience.  Outstanding tailored care!,"Our family had an absolutely amazing time during our two-day stay in April 2016 at the Dublin Intercontinental.  Despite it being a heavy tourist season, we were greeted by a friendly and patient front desk staff and given a large room with two very large and extremely comfortable beds; this was perfect for the four of us.  The Spa was welcoming to children and the pool was great fun.  The staff there was simply superb.  Of most note and importance to our family is the manner in which the food and beverage staff responded to the fact that our young son has food allergies.  This limits his ability to eat with the family in restaurants and he is THRILLED beyond words if he can ever eat 'just like everyone else'.  I informed the hotel of his allergies and I immediately received an email from the food and beverage manager that he would personally see to it that our son would have the food he wanted during meals at the hotel.  Given that we had paid for breakfast and dinner as part of our hotel package, I was happy with that news.  The reality frankly blew us out of the water.  Not only was our son able to order whatever he wanted, but he was made to feel special and his food was brought out in 5 star plus presentation to much fan fare.  As a parent, I cannot tell you how much I appreciate what the food and beverage staff did for my son, and therefore for our family.  A hundred thousand thank you's and I will definitely be staying there again and again.  I highly recommend this property!",5,2016,04,11
205,Absolutely fantastic!,"Our three night stay here was absolutely amazing. The staff is really polite; they helped us with finding good local restaurants and places to visit. The room was quite big and the bed was really comfy. The breakfast was the best of it all. There was a big variety of food in the buffet, but you can order other things like pancakes from the breakfast menu. The hot chocolate with marshmallows was a must-try, especially if you are into these type of drinks. The cappuccino was great as well. Overall, we had a great time here and it was absolutely worth it..",5,2016,04,09
205,Great staff,"Stayed here recently for two nights for a family break..and loved it. Have stayed when the four seasons were the owners, and can say found the staff a pleasure to deal with. There was a couple of niggly problems but nothing major. Staff on reception,lobby bar and breakfast were excellent. My 6yr loved it and was treated with great kindness. Will stay again.",5,2016,04,07
205,Place to relax and unwind.,"Was here recently on a quick business trip for one night, Have stayed here when it used to be Four Seasons, so didn't know what to expect. The decor has not changed much, there were a few new faces in the staff. The check-in was smooth, few staff who knew me from my previous visit recognized me and were very welcoming. I stayed in a standard room on the 3rd floor and found the room was spacious and well appointed. The bed was so comfortable, I had a good night sleep.
Didn't get to use the restaurant or bar on this visit but had a quick dip in their indoor pool in the morning before I checked out. I used the room service for dinner and breakfast and the food and service was good.
The check in was smooth, the Indian gentleman at the reception (I think his name was Garav) arranged for my transport to the airport was chatty and helped me print my boarding pass.  
I would definitely stay here again on my next visit.",5,2016,04,03
205,Lovely Hotel,"Great hotel for family vacation. Beautiful decor, quiet, and very clean. Loved the lobby bar. Excellent staff at front desk, very helpful. Close walk to transit - The Dart and double decker buses. Good restaurants and pubs nearby.",5,2016,04,01
205,2016 rugby weekend,"stayed here before when it was 4 seasons, almost as good, a few annoyances
the place was clean, the staff excellent, the food brilliant, the place was buzzing even on Friday afternoon when we arrived. the room was beautiful but air conditioning was not working, heat was on so we didn't get any sleep the first night even with the glass external door open, the receptionist was apologetic but that was it, disappointing, great venue for Aviva",5,2016,03,29
205,Wonderful hotel,"This hotel is wonderful. The location can't be beat. It is in a quiet neighborhood and just a very short train ride to City Centre. The rooms are very clean and a great size. The staff is courteous and very helpful. We loved the breakfast, especially the omelet bar. A++ to the chef. We highly recommend a stay here. ",5,2016,03,27
205,"Quieter location out by the embassies, great property, good service","It was a quick night in Dublin and the Intercon doesn't forget what's most important....a great nights sleep.  The rooms are oversized, the curtains shut closed for perfect darkness.  The windows open if you want cool air and no AC.  The front desk is fast.  Things move at a great pace, and the hotel delivers.  Peaceful setting outside downtown, so not walking distance to major sites.  If you want to go for a jog, great paths around the hotel.  You can walk to some restaurants and pubs, but this is a quieter area of the Dub.   Great, solid option if you want service, peace and comfort.",4,2016,03,23
205,Terrible customer service and poorly informed staff,"booked this expensive hotel as a Christmas present for our son and his girlfriend,we paid for one night including breakfast,embarrassing when they arrived for breakfast to be told it was not included,hotel manager apologised when we complained and promised their accounts department would refund 40 euro ( cost of breakfast for two ) on our credit card,now ten weeks later and still no refund or reply to our latest email,would not recommend anyone to stay at this hotel",1,2016,03,19
205,LOVE IT,"I have stayed at numerous hotels throughout Dublin, one being the Shellbourne (which everyone raves about). Well I don't think THAT much of it.. Now this hotel is amazing.. it is large and grandios.. The rooms are very spacious and very comfortable... The location is not in the center of town.. however, you can get there by DART in 7 minutes... and the little vilage/town area that it is in is beautiful and comfortable.. With lots of restaruants and pubs. Best hotel in Dublin",5,2016,03,18
205,Delivers a standard of hospitality others can only aspire to...,"The InterContinental Hotel in Dublin is quite simply an oasis of calm, luxury and friendliness in the busy, bustling city. I go there frequently to hold business meetings and always, always, the service is impeccable, the food fantastic and the general ambiance is relaxing and friendly. I highly recommend the food, in both the restaurant and the bar / lobby area. There is also plenty of parking, a real blessing in Dublin these days.. Overall, in my opinion the InterContinental Hotel has a standard other hotels can only aspire to.",4,2016,03,18
205,"5 Star Luxury, 5 Star Staff","Stayed here with my wife on the occasion of our anniversary. All of the doormen were excellent and the front desk so welcoming and professional. A special thanks to the Front Desk Manager for his personal attentive service. Super room, super service. We will be back.",5,2016,03,16
205,More of a luxurious home from home ,I honestly couldn't speak more highly of a hotel. A very warm welcome was received before the incredible facilities were even apparent. The staff are only too happy to help. The food is also just gorgeous. The hotel is located in a lively part of Dublin whilst not being right in the centre.,5,2016,03,15
205,Weekend in Dublin ,We stayed in Dublin as we had booked tickets for the Adele concert - the hotel was very nice with a bus stop nearby to get  into the city  2.70 Euros cash each way - no change given - you are a little too far out so I would recommend a hotel which was closer to the city - you could walk into to town but it's a good 45 - 60 minutes.  The taxi from the concert to the hotel was reasonable only £12 euros but make sure you eat prior to going to the venue as there isn't much at the arena ,4,2016,03,14
205,Very elegant hotel & friendly staff!,"I really enjoyed my stay here.  The room is very nice and big,  .  Even the bathroom was very large!  Separate bath tub and shower.  The room and bed were comfortable and had everything you would need.  Contrary to some other reviews, I thought the staff was wonderful.  Everyone I came into contact with was friendly and helpful.  Had dinner at the hotel.  It was very good and the atmosphere was lovely and very relaxing.  The spa is delightful with a indoor pool and jacuzzi, sauna, fitness center etc.   The only downside is that the hotel is not in the city center.  But it is about a 30 minute walk or there is regular bus service directly outside the hotel.  Also there is a train across the road from the hotel which takes about 7 minutes (3 stops).  Overall, a wonderful hotel!",5,2016,03,10
205,Memorable weekend ,"Just back from intercontinental,good service and very friendly staff ,food is reasonable priced for 5 star hotel and very good quality.Also they were very helpful at reception desk.
i would highly recommend this hotel.
I am looking forward to our next visit...
Thank you guys..",5,2016,03,09
205,Service is back!,"This is the first time in a couple of years that is happily say my family and I didn't have any faults with the hotel after our Christmas stay. I don't think it's quite the same standard as the Four Seasons had been but, the staff were great and very helpful and Christmas dinner was delicious! Good job guys",4,2016,03,08
205,Private function,"We held our daughters christening lunch here last Saturday. The day couldn't have gone better. We booked a private function room with a buffet lunch. The service, food and room itself were excellent.  I would highly recommend this hotel for private functions. The event staff were extremely helpful and organised leading up to the day, so we were confident the day would go well. ",5,2016,03,08
205,Hit? or Missing something?,"Although this was Mothering Sunday weekend we booked a long weekend in Dublin to celebrate an occasion for my husband.
We’re no strangers to Dublin and have previously stayed at the Merrion and the Shelbourne and in this very hotel three or four years ago when it was the Four Seasons.
Now it’s the Intercontinental, IHG’s 5 star and premier brand so there should have been nothing to disappoint. The Taxi driver asked ""how is it?"" when he dropped us off after our last trip out towards the end of our four days,  I replied there was nothing to shout about and I’d be unlikely to choose it again. The Intercontinental was very much just OK rather than in anyway special or worthy of its 5 star banding and our average €350per night spend, shame!

Where it went wrong was in the detail. The room was well appointed , large, quiet, dark at night and comfortable. Housekeeping did a good job, everything was replenished and cleaned daily. I also found the doorstaff courteous and “on the ball”.
When we checked in we were asked if we’d like a newspaper to our room as we are IHG rewards members (having stayed at a few Crown Plazas), we said yes please…. but we didn't we receive one, not even once. Of course you say, you should’ve asked, we did, twice. On Sunday our 3rd morning I was certain this would have been rectified- no it still wasn’t. We joked maybe on morning 4 we’d get one but we departed too early to find out!

There was a nice magnifying back-lit bathroom mirror , excellent I thought, only to find the light didn’t work. I let reception know on Friday but it wasn’t replaced during our stay.
Now for meals- on our first night we had a meal in the lobby bar with live piano music, very pleasant, good fish and chips but would’ve benefited from a drop of vinegar which wasn’t offered and couldn’t get anyone’s attention to bring it.
Breakfast ,in keeping with the lack of condiments, I couldn’t get any brown table sauce and again it wasn’t offered or visible (I’m not adverse to borrowing from another table or helping myself from a service table if it had been in view) Neither were we offered any toast nor teapot refill. Day two breakfast I wised up- I asked for toast- it arrived after my breakfast and was burned black and without any butter - so I had to ask for that too- as well as a teaspoon ours weren't alongside our cup and saucer, these are simple things which make the difference between average and great.
Room service Saturday supper was actually faultless (well except for no vinegar for the chips but hey ho maybe that's a British thing) the burger was good.
Sunday breakfast I got my brown sauce but it took 3 days to realise you absolutely have to ask for anything not already on your table because it won’t be offered. I didn’t bother asking for toast or butter or a tea refill and true to form nothing was offered
Our final meal in the restaurant was Sunday lunch which I’d booked ahead as it was Mother’s day. We chose a late, 2.30pm slot but we found ourselves still in the city at 2pm so we decided to waste our return dart tickets and jump in a cab costing €20 in order to be back in time. We needn’t have bothered because although we sat down at exactly 2.30pm our starter arrived at 3pm (with an apology ""the kitchen is busy"") My main course roast beef arrived without yorkshire pudding which should’ve been an accompaniment according to the menu, considering there were only 4 main meals on offer, and presumably the waiting staff know what they should look like, such oversights shouldn’t happen. I felt my meal lacked something other than a yorkshire (see photo)- I didn’t get offered horseradish (I’d simply lost the will to ask) but I daydreamed that a roast potato or some traditional veg would have been nice.

My husband’s fish wasn’t cooked in the middle and looked lonesome on his plate it came with pea puree and not much else. Finally dessert arrived without the little black Intercontinental gift bag I’d noticed every other female in the room seemed to have received with the pudding course but I wasn’t offered one. I left empty handed (there was no-one to mention it to when we exited). 
Finally checking out we left 20 minutes to do so to be in good time for the airport bus which stops nearby outside the hotel grounds- neither hotel printer appeared to be operating and the cheap at reception was flustered so we left without being asked ""how our stay was!"" and without even sight of our bill although it was in my email inbox by the time we arrived home. So you see its more about what you don’t get than what you do. If you’re 5 star in name and price then it’s fair for customers to expect that “little bit extra” or at very least what they pay for. I didn’t feel we received either but I never let anything spoil my enjoyment of our valuable weekends away. We will likely now stay at the Shelbourne or Merrion again on our next visit to Dublin in 3 months time.",3,2016,03,07
205,Totally Disappointed ,"I was excited to be staying at the Intercontinental this weekend and now feel totally deflated after the stay. 
Firstly we went to the whiskey bar to have a few drinks and it has to be the only hotel bar that can only serve one gin before running out of dingle gin! The breakfast was totally disappointing and the spa wasn't much better. We ordered room service and reception were to get someone to phone me, I had to phone three times to which they weren't friendly nor helpful when it finally came an hour later it was cold and tasteless. I feel this hotel has gone totally down hill and I'm totally disappointed. 😂
",3,2016,03,05
205,SineadO'Sullivan ,I would like to say a big thank you to your reception staff who were on duty Tuesday 2nd march in the morning.  I needed details of flights sent to your hotel downloaded and printed they were so helpful in assisting me they just made something that could have been so difficult so easy so a big thank you. SineadO'Sullivan ,5,2016,03,03
205,Seasons Dining,"I dined in Seasons as part of a group and would highly recommend the restaurant. From the ambiance and the staff to the food, all was superb! The knowledge of the wine menu and the suggested wines were also well suited to the dishes.",5,2016,03,02
205,Seasons restaurant,Had dinner in Seasons with some work colleagues and was pleasantly surprised with the experience. Not one for eating in hotel restaurants I was not overly excited. However the restaurant in the InterContinental has been revamped and looked amazing.The food was not only visually stimulating but the taste matched and the fact they change their menu monthly means it should be worth a visit again.   Waiter has a great knowledge of the wine menu and my colleague who was driving did not feel left out as they surprised her with a virgin cocktail.,4,2016,03,02
205,Great again,"Stayed for another night, arrived at hotel early so our room wasn't ready which was fine as we left our bags and headed for town. Checked in by Andrea who was very helpful and got us the correct change for the bus to town. Room was very comfortable & clean. Great size and really lovely bathroom. Breakfast the next morning was wonderful, hot buffet and omelette made to order which I would highly recommend. Very friendly staff. Would recommend.",5,2016,02,29
205,Flawless,Stayed here at short notice due to a family funeral. I could not fault the service and room and food was excellent. The mattress must be most comfortable I have slept on in a very long time. The bus stop for the airport is just across the hotel on Merrion Road opposite the Clayton Hotel and they run 5 minutes to the hour - cost €8.50.,5,2016,02,27
205,Nice property,"The intercontinental hotel Dublin sits on a very nice property with the Dart station only one block away.  The station is Sandymount and it is very convenient.  I spent a whole day in Howrh using the Dart.  The hotel staff on this particular morning was very helpful; she even taught me to properly pronounce ""Howth"" which is quite important to me.  My room was very spacious compare to the hotel I previously stayed here in Dublin.  Wifi signal was excellent.  The staff was friendly and I enjoyed my stay.",4,2016,02,25
205,Superb refurb,Arrived to find our room had beef double booked to total shock from the receptionist who was very apologetic however we were upgraded to a junior suite which was superb very well decorated lovely furnishings and the bed was the most comfortable ever the hotel was reasonably located for the city which was fine because public transport is one of the best I know off get a leap card for €20 it last for 72 hours and is well worth it they can be bought at the spar in the airport on way out,5,2016,02,22
205,Romantic City Getaway,"Had a lovely romantic overnight stay here. The Suite was fabulous & the staff couldn't have done more to accommodate us. We felt pampered & cosseted! The whole Hotel  
has a lovely relaxed air of luxury to it, not at all stuck-up. We are happy to stay in IHG Hotels around the world- fantastic customer service!",5,2016,02,21
205,Weekend stay,"My first time here and I must say I'm very pleased with the Hotel. Stayed here for two nights in December 2015 Hotel was lovely. Room was top class, clean and bed comfy. Breakfast was good with wide selection. Will stay again",4,2016,02,19
205,A seamless transition from the renowned four seasons ,"This is my third visit to the new Intercontinental Hotel and each time has been very good. I've come with family to dine formally, friends more informally and now for a business meeting.
It's a more utilitarian exterior & foyer but dining/ sitting and meeting areas are still very high quality.
Food has been consistently good.
Staff are very pleasant, attentive and efficient.
I like the less pretentious ambience here a lot and would definitely recommend coming here to friends, family & business colleagues.",4,2016,02,19
205,Not the 5 star service at all!,"The best thing was definitely breakfast. Fantastic buffet choice, freshly squeezed orange juice and nice coffee. Breakfast team however looked as they were not too happy to be there. Not very friendly except for one of the guys [don't remember his name - very tall, in glasses] that was very professional, attentive and helpful.

Hotel itself is nice with big rooms and very comfy beds but with a bit dated décor as for my liking. Personally I prefer more modern style.
If you plan to spend a lot of time in the city centre I would not recommend this particular hotel unless you're willing to pay 15 euro for a taxi each time you travel. It takes a while to get to the centre of Dublin by bus however is doable.
I've rated 'average' for cleanlinesses - in general clean but the night we've arrived there were some pubic hair left on the toilet's floor :(

The biggest let down was reception staff. You'd expect in the 5 star hotel staff to be polite, attentive and the most importantly knowledgeable. Well, not in here. Some of the previous reviews mention that most of the reception team were behaving as if we didn't exist and that's exactly the impression I've had.
On the check out we've asked receptionist [who looked as a senior staff] if he knew where was the next stop for the airport bus as the one opposite the hotel was 'not in use'. First of all had no idea the stop was not in use and secondly he directed us to wrong bus stop [the one for drop off people who has arrived FROM the airport].
As a result we've obviously missed the bus and as they are not very frequent we had to take a taxi in order to be on time for our flight! [that's additional 30 euro from the budget]

Again, as mentioned in one of he previous reviews, maybe bus to airport was not posh enough for the staff to be bothered...",3,2016,02,18
205,If you wish to enjoy Irish hospitality don't come here,"We stayed here for 2 nights whilst visiting Dublin for the first time and were surprised by the poor service this hotel provides. Working in the travel industry I have the chance to stay in many wonderful hotels and unfortunately I have to say that except for the young man who checked us in at night ; the rest of the reception team behaved as if we didn't exist; not even a hello when we walked in, the waiters at breakfast(except for Tiago who was very kind and helpful ) were no better; one of the waitresses at breakfast literally barked at us when I asked if we could move tables as she put as next to the buffet  (the breakfast room being quite empty as we woke up pretty early to make the most of the day). Overall we felt completely ignored. Being a young couple we felt that they probably had more important guests to take care for and cherry on top of the cake, after checking out we asked one of the receptionist where was the nearest station to take the bus to the airport  (I know not posh enough??) and he kindly told us to ask the porter outside  (as he was too busy talking to his colleague ) I must say that for a 5 star hotel even Ibis has more professional and friendlier staff. ",1,2016,02,15
205,Another great stay!,"Stayed here in the past and the hotel appears to have really improved under new management. Really love the newly refurbished areas and all the employees were incredible friendly and attentive. You could really feel a strong management presence and we were personally attended to by Ronan the rooms director who always seemed to be present around the reception. 

We will certainly be back. ",5,2016,02,13
205,Even better then before,"We have stayed here several times before when it was a Four Seasons and we always loved it. So we were delighted to realize that it was better than ever. We arrived very early as we had some business in the morning. As expected at that time our room was not ready. We were happy to leave our bags and get on with it but the young gentlemen who handled our check in really went out of his way to get us a room available and had us checked in in no time. The hotel looks great, thanks to all the new refurbishments. We had an excellent breakfast the next morning where a young manager Mark really took care of us and made sure we had a great experience. During check out we were greeted by the director of rooms which was a really nice touch. He went out of his way to make sure we were really looked after and it makes the difference when your staying in this class of hotel. Thank you Ronan. We will certainly be back when we visit Ireland again. It's a great hotel but it really is the people who make it. ",5,2016,02,13
205,Wonderful,"This property is simply wonderful, you'll feel like royalty and sleep like a baby.  There is so much going on here with great lounges, restaurant, bars, spa and pool that you don't even need to go into Dublin to have a great time.",5,2016,02,10
205,Favourite hotel,"I first stayed here when it was the four seasons and we have returned several times since it has changed hands. My husband and I love this hotel and we stayed here over the new year with our 5 month old baby boy. The service is faultless with the staff always ready to help and offer their assistance. We got a cot for our baby and it was spotless, he loved sleeping in it and it was home from home. We ate in the bar on New Year's Eve and it was a lovely way to bring in the new year with a lovely relaxed atmosphere.
The only thing that I was disappointed about were the chocolate muffins at breakfast as they were pre-wrapped and appeared to have been previously frozen. Other than that the hotel deserves 10/10. Hope to return soon.

205,Top Shelf,"Just outside of downtown Dublin. Easy access via DART train or bus to Grafton St. And the Temple Bar district this is a bona fide great hotel. You'll pay for it but nothing is left out. Large. comfortable rooms, incredible linens, and unlike most European hotels - room temp is controllable and not stifled by management! Great for special occasions or to impress someone.",5,2016,02,07
205,A lovely Hotel in a beautiful setting,This hotel was a Four Season property before being bought by Intercontinental . The rooms are large and our suite had a balcony that looked over a beautifully landscaped garden with a fountain.You will have to take a cab or train into the main area of Dublin but the area of this hotel is surrounded by stately manors and and a large sprawling park with lakes and streams. There's also a small downtown with great little pubs and restaurants within walking distance.The hotel bar is fabulous and offers seating in the handsome wood paneled bar or in the garden. Very popular with local businessmen.,5,2016,02,06
205,Perfect Stay,"Have just returned home from a fantastic first trip to Dublin with my boyfriend for his 30th birthday.  We were lucky enough to get a great deal on 2 nights here and I cannot fault the place. The staff worked extremely hard to make sure everything was spot on - everybody we encountered was friendly and professional and couldn't do enough to help us.

We stayed in a deluxe room with the most beautiful bathroom I have ever seen, a huge comfy bed and enough space to swing several cats! They even left us a plate with Happy Birthday on it along with fruit and chocolates. 

The hotel is situated in the quiet residential area of Ballsbridge, just 5 mins ride to the city centre on the buses that pass by right outside every few minutes (number 4 and number 7). After we'd been out one night we took a taxi back which was €12. On one occasion we even walked it (20-30 mins). It also means you get a good nights sleep without constant city noise outside. The immediate area itself is lovely with plenty of nearby pubs and restaurants.

Spa facilities are some of the nicest I have ever seen. Thank you to all the staff for making the trip so special. We will be back!",5,2016,02,05
205,A little magic has left this hotel.,"I used to absolutely love this hotel! It was my favourite hotel in Ireland. A guest would want for nothing and have all their needs catered for plus more. 
This is no longer the case. My husband had been in contact with the hotel reservations department and had agreed a rate and number of rooms as we were visiting with our 4 young children. Upon arrival we were greeted by a less than friendly receptionist who had a full blown argument with my husband over our room rate when he asked to see someone more senior she said that she would have to pay for the difference in the rates! 
I'm sorry but when you arrive at a 5 star hotel you do not expect an argument in the foyer with a receptionist. It was highly embarrassing. 
We checked into our room which was dusty I have included pictures.
Service in the lobby was slow and they only had 2 yes 2 cocktail menus. Service at breakfast was worse! We asked for toast at least 3 times. 
We would usually not venture outside the hotel during our stay but we couldn't wait to visit a local restaurant. The management team has obviously changed over the past 6 or so months and the staff have been replaced with students/less experienced staff. The professionals are noticeably absent. I am afraid we will be looking for another family friendly hotel for our short breaks.  ",3,2016,02,05
205,Could be a lot better - poor service,"I am a little shocked by this hotel. I checked in here yesterday and went to my room - I had booked a deluxe double. I was really disappointed by the room, it was really dated. I called down to reception to make sure I was in the correct standard of room and she confirmed I was. I told her I was a little surprised as I felt dated and tired and I was expecting something a lot more for a 5* hotel and paying €225 for the night. Her reply was, ""yeah, some of the room have been done up but yours, not yet. Would you like to speak to the duty manager?"" I replied saying ""no, I am sure there is no point"" and the call ended with her saying ""ok"". I felt as if she didn't care. 
The bathroom was really nice though - that's the only positive from the room. 
I went for lunch in the lobby and it was ok, can't really go wrong with a toasted sandwich. 
Later that night I went to the bar for a drink, there was one guy behind the bar and he was under pressure. I asked for a bourbon and they only had two available, Jack Daniels or a basic Jim Beem - very disappointing for a ""whiskey bar"". I ordered an Old Fashioned and it was of poor standard, wasn't mixed, lack of spices and tones of ice. There was also 2 other people getting annoyed as they wanted to order a drink and there was no one else behind the bar to serve them. 

This morning I went to the fitness centre and pool area and I have to say that this was amazing. The place was spotless, plenty of gym equipment and the changing area was super cool. The steam room was fantastic and the chill out area was really nice. The pool was so nice and I have the entire space to myself - just perfect. The facilities are the best I have ever experienced - top class. 

I went to the bar area for lunch, the service was beyond poor! I had to wait 20 minutes for my food and 10 minutes to even order the food. The girl that served me was lovely but she was all on her own and had orders coming out her ears. This is really bad form, where was the duty manager? This hotel really needs to improve on this service. At the moment it does not deserve a 5* rating. It's more of a 4 star. 

I really hope it improves.",3,2016,02,04
205,Bare Bones,"I have stayed at this hotel when it was The Four Seasons.  Doesn't even compare.  Upon arrival the bell boy (man) didn't even approach me to help with my suitcase.  Then as I was checking in there was only one person and when I asked to exchange dollars to euro I was asked to come back later as there was a line. The residence bar was always open to residence as long as someone wanted to be served, we arrived back to hotel round 11:30 PM thinking we could have a drink in the bar before returning to our rooms but it was closed.  In the morning I called for coffee and a pastry basket for something to eat, but they arrived with 4 butter croissants, no pastry, no muffin nothing that should have been included.  As I was leaving there was no one outside to call a taxi or help with baggage and it was 10 AM, not so early that it wasn't feasible to expect someone out there, but it was deserted.  I was lucky as someone was being dropped off by a taxi so I jumped in.  My last and constant complaint is that when we are coming to Ireland and arriving in a beautiful and HIGH END Hotel in the middle of Ireland it would be wonderful and so welcoming to have Irish people greeting you and helping you with their beautiful Irish brogues, but I had to decipher the many other accents, and barely English speaking people that they hire, sooooooo disappointing!!  I would hardly know I was in Ireland!!  I have stayed here, The Shelbourne and The Merrion and we chose to come back here as we were always so cozy and happy.  Will not be coming back as the other hotels are in town and this one offers no experience anymore.  VERY SAD!!",3,2016,02,03
205,Lovely hotel ,"What a great hotel. beautiful building and very smart lobby and lounge. 
Staff are terrific. Super polite and attentive and always happy to help. 
By modern standards the bedrooms are huge with beautiful beds and linens. Bathrooms are bigger than most hotel bedrooms and well appointed with great showers.
Restaurant is lovely and the full Irish is very good although I'm never convinced about a buffet breakfast at a hotel of this quality. 
",5,2016,02,02
205,A welcoming change from a local hotel.,Was staying at another Dublin hotel and visited the InterContinental for drinks and food. We could not speak highly enough of the food and drink and staff were fantastic. If you can afford to stay you will not be disappointed. 5*,5,2016,02,01
205,A grand hotel,"We booked this as a little weekend trip away from London City on a Friday night and were pleasantly surprised by just how lovely the entire hotel was. It was a 30 min cab ride from the airport (about €45 inc tip) and about a 10 min cab ride from the main city centre (about €12).

The hotel used to be owned by Four Seasons and you can still appreciate the grand old feel of the place, where no expense was spared on decor and fixtures and fittings.

As an Ambassador loyalty guest (worth paying for btw and the cost is recouped on a single stay like this), we were upgraded to a junior suite which was a huge room and with a super kingsize bed that was just so comfortable, we found out the make and had to get one ourselves for home. Such a perfect nights sleep!

The plan for the weekend was to do a bit of sightseeing around the city, but we ended up sleeping in too late and then spending nearly 5 hours in the Guinness storehouse, which meant nothing else was seen. Still it was a very relaxing time, using the pool and hot tub, chilling out in the bar area and having afternoon tea all made it a worthwhile getaway. I can imagine that in the summer time, being able to make use of the lovely garden area would be amazing. 
Book ahead if you want a spa treatment though, as it's get booked up quickly.

I must add that the staff are all wonderful, very helpful and efficient. If they say breakfast will arrive in your room at a given time, it will be spot on!

We'll be back in the summer to see Dublin proper and will of course be staying at the Intercontinental !!! Superb!",5,2016,01,31
205,"Lovely, quiet, and great service.","Our room was very large by European standards; clean, comfortable, beautifully decorated. I can't say enough about the service in this hotel. We enjoyed the restaurant and bar very much too. It's outside the city's core so you either need a car or you need to be willing to take cabs or transit, or enjoy long walks. If you have rewards points, treat yourself to a stay at this fine hotel!",5,2016,01,28
205,I would stay here again.,"This hotel is now exactly everything I look for in hotels.  I stayed for a couple of nights in December 2015 and found the staff helpful, the service fantastic (early check in, room service), the food really very lovely and actually quite well priced for what was on offer, The room (although slightly dated) was just brilliant - it included a free shoe shine overnight and a good wi-fi connection. The spa, which has a swimming pool, hot tub, steam room, sauna and treatment rooms, as well as a gym, is free to use how often and whenever you like during the day. 

It is the only hotel I have mooched in for an entire day, and although you pay for the room, it is nice to stay in a hotel where you don't feel like they are trying to maximise the value of your stay but instead are trying to build the value into the room through excellent service standards.

Apple on the reception is an asset.",5,2016,01,28
205,Happy Wife," I enjoyed a delightful afternoon tea at The Intercontinental Dublin with my Wife, before Christmas. An exquisite setting,great service by our host Seán Foley and  most delicious afternoon treats and copious amounts of tea makes this,by far, the best Afternoon Tea around. All too often Afternoon tiers are filled with soggy cucumber sandwiches and lack lustre desserts. As impressive as the open brown bread sandwiches was the price! Quite simply excellent!",5,2016,01,28
205,Great,"Great staff, lovely food, good location, huge rooms - or is that just me having Ambassador status with this hotel group.
Excellent breakfast, however I would have like to see more items on the buffet such as a greater selection of bread, pastries, cold-cuts, cheeses
Lovely setting and building.",5,2016,01,26
205,Mr w hickey ,"Just a quick word on my recent stay 23/1/16. From the moment of my check in it was excellent and Sean Foley met me at check in what an absolute gent, he had a welcome drink left in my room on my arrival and my room was upgraded to a suite which was huge. It was my best hotel stay in Dublin in a long time and as always the breakfast is delicious can't wait to stay again.

W Hickey",5,2016,01,26
205,Classic elegant hotel,We took an unplanned long weekend in Dublin.  I had visited the InterContinental the year before when it was called the Four Seasons and had been impressed with the service and accommodation.  The hotel had not lost anything by changing management. The pool area is one of the best that I have seen in a hotel.  The staff were extremely helpful and professional.  Dinner in the hotel was a delight.  The hotel is a brief taxi drive from the downtown area - a little too far to walk - which is its only down side.  This is a classic elegant hotel which is worth visiting.,4,2016,01,24
205,ONLY AN OVERNIGHT BUT SO REFRESHING,"We were in Dublin on business and decided to stay overnight and enjoy a glass or 2 of wine! We were driving and were greeted on arrival by two very cheerful and helpful porters who took the car and our luggage.  On to reception another smiling face. Our room was an executive room with lovely large bathroom and very cushy king size bed. We had thought about going out for dinner but the bar and staff were so inviting we ate in the hotel another 5 star. Up the next morning it was a toss up to breakfast in bed or go down to the lovely Seasons restaurant. I have to say that the room service menu was excellent I have not seen so many choices for room service breakfast, another 5 stars in my opinion. On to the Seasons Restaurant and again what an amazing sophisticated selection for breakfast. Including little Bircher Muesli already made which was delicious or you could make you own with 3 types of yogurt and fruit purees, nuts etc. I was most impressed with the honey which you served yourself straight from the honeycomb from the hive. It was only an overnight but it felt longer as everything was so perfect. There was also the Spa and pool which we didn't try maybe next time.",5,2016,01,17
205,One of Dublin's finest hotels...!!!,"Though a business trip, my wife and baby have always accompanied me during our stay at the Intercontinental.

We have stayed in nearly every hotel around Ballsbridge and the Intercontinental is by far the best!

The ambience of the hotel and design is impressive. The rooms are large - standard as well as exec suites. Staff are very courteous and helpful. They go the extra mile to recognise guests by name and remember their favourite items too. 

Every weekly trip between June to Nov at the Intercontinental has been special and memorable.

Missing our stay at the Intercontinental, highly recommended..!",5,2016,01,16
205,Wonderful Christmas Day,We stayed at the Intercontinental for three nights during Christmas. The room was large and well furnished with a lovely bathroom. The service throughout the hotel was exceptional and the staff were attentive and very friendly. The buffet on Christmas Day was held in the ballroom of the hotel and was beyond our expectations. It was fantastic!  I would definitely return and not just for Christmas. Thank you to all the staff for a memorable time.,5,2016,01,12
205,Outstanding property and location,"During a weekend escape to Dublin i joined a friend who was staying at this property for a business conference. 

I joined her and I'm so glad i did... Dublin is a great city and staying at this property although a bit off the beaten path, it's a great hotel. 

I won't take but a few minute cab ride to get to downtown dublin.  It's even a walk that with good weather can be done at a leisurely pace.  Our first day we sat at the bar / eating area and had a wonderful lunch, food and service wise. 

Rooms were very comfortable, well accommodated, and upto date.  Definitely worth the price and distance from downtown.  

The staff was outstanding and truly 5 star service from everyone.  Not one person let us down at all.",5,2016,01,11
205,Could be SO much better...,"A famous landmark and fantastic heritage from the 4 Seasons brand but now seems have moved very happily in family hotel land with all parts of the hotel experiencing children out of control under the new InterCon brand.
The special touches are no longer there.
Even the newly furnished rooms have pretty average zip together beds now.
The spa previously enjoyed as a quiet space had children everywhere (playing with the swimwear dryer,spraying water from the steam room or fathers quite happily letting their naked female children wander around the male only change room and spa!!) 
C'mom guys. Get your act together!
The initial test is the phone call to the hotel...I wonder if you manage 3 calls in succession that actually ring out to ...no where...?!
Now don't get me wrong...it's not a disaster. if you want a family hotel ...great . if you want a luxury hotel with some peace and order ...it's not the place to be.
Since when is it acceptable to let children run and scream around the foyer?
All in all. It wins on location as it's easy to get and out of but it's losing ground overall.",3,2016,01,11
205,Four Seasons.... Intercontinental,"Intercontinental Dublin offers consistently good service, a very good hard product, the Executive Suites are massive, almost the size of an apartment. The rooms are slightly dates, but still well kept. The bathrooms are good sized and comfortable. The breakfast at the restaurant consists of a good spread, buffet. The staff front desk, bell desk, restaurant, housekeeping staff are very helpful and professional. This is the place to stay when in Dublin. 5* on stay quality, comfort. Dublin downtown is a 15 min drive or a 15 Euro. The hotel is close to the US Embassy and an excellent Indian restaurant, a favorite (Ravi' kitchen).",5,2016,01,09
205,A good choice ,"Have stayed here a few times and the quality is consistent. The service although sometimes slow is good. The deluxe rooms are very nice and come with all the extras you can expect. The food is good too, The only niggle would be it can be expensive. ",3,2016,01,06
205,First night Luxury,"My first night in Dublin was spent in this wonder of Dublin. The staff was very compassionate after traveling all night and getting there much too early to check in. I wish I remembered all their names.
The hotel in fresh, clean, warm and well lit. Parking was easy.
In the hotel restaurant, he food very filling and presentation was gratifying.
I can't think there is a bad room in this hotel, but we did look south and had an amazing view of the river and morning traffic.",5,2016,01,02
205,What happened to the 5 start hotel I once knew?,"I have been a regular user of the Four Seasons hotel for a number of years with no issues. The hotel staff were excellent. Then it was taken over by the Inter Continental Group and things began to slip, staff disappeared and existing staff started to look unhappy.
It all came to a head when we booked our Christmas break with the highlight being our Christmas lunch in the hotel. This was done a few months before Christmas and everything was set until my wife got a call from the Christmas coordinator a month before Christmas requesting 100% payment of the lunch before Christmas, She would not accept a deposit nor did it make any difference that we were going to be residents in the hotel. When my wife stated that we had paid our hotel bill in full the Christmas Coordinator said “I think you will find you haven’t” this made my wife feel like she was being called a liar so she decided to cancel our lunch there and then.
My wife then rang and talked to the General Manager and explained to him what had occurred and he said he was sorry but that that was the policy. It might be a good idea for the hotel to explain their polices when booking. My wife then told him that she had cancelled lunch.
Two weeks later my wife received an e-mail from the Christmas coordinator even though we had cancelled now requesting 50% deposit. I then took over and contacted the General Manager (Clement Gaffney) directly and after a long talk he insisted that he wanted to meet with me face to face on Christmas day when we arrived at the hotel. I agreed with this. We spent four hours on Christmas day in the lobby watching the world go by and to this day Mr Gaffney has not made any contact with me.
It can be clearly seen that standards are slipping fast and that the staff are under pressure to keep the place running. It is in my opinion not a nice environment to be in.
We will not be returning to the Inter Continental under the present management as we feel that this is not a 5 star hotel anymore, maybe a 3 star at best.  I do not like any place where we feel we are being called liars and I also do not like places where people state they will do things and then do not follow up.",1,2016,01,01
205,The best hotel in Ireland,"We stayed in so many hotels in Ireland but from our experience Intercontinental Dublin is the best of all hotels we stayed in Ireland. Intercontinental Dublin was the Dublin Four Seasons
If you are a member of IHG and became an Ambassador status you will be upgraded to a beautiful room
The hotel staff are very friendly mainly the Concierge , the waiter ,the welcoming people, the room service ,the operator  and the Bell boys 
We will be back",5,2016,01,01
205,Very Comfortable Hotel with Great Staff,"My family stayed here one night on the way into Ireland.  The rooms were comfortable and about as you would expect for a hotel of this price point.  

The staff was helpful in arranging various activities in and around Dublin.  We had something unexpected come up and the concierge was very, very helpful.",5,2015,12,30
205,An ideal Christmas Location.....,"Having just spent Christmas there, I can heartily recommend this property as a Family Friendly location for a Holiday period such as Christmas or Easter. Traveling with three children and flying TransContinental, I arrived with trepidation mid morning, would they permit early check-in? Would they be 'Four Seasons' like?

Checking in was smooth, having flown overnight, they allowed an early check-in and facilitated us with adjoining rooms. The rooms are large and ours faced the front of the Hotel probably meaning better light / View. The lobby is spacious and they are tolerant of children climbing over the furniture, service is fast in the lobby restaurant and hugely flexible, breakfast items could be ordered for jet lagged kids at midday as could off menu items. Credit to JJ, Jane and all the lobby lounge staff. Front desk staff are always charming and helpful, one Laura was a fantastic babysitter also - our kids loved her!

The pool / Spa is great for kids, irritating that it was closed for Christmas Day, not as if there was a lifeguard anyhow. Taxis can be hard to get and do not always come even when booked. Hard for the bellman to control this but the business traveller should be warned to book a hotel car for his important appt.

However, the restaurant is great, the bar is warm and welcoming at any hour. The gym is excellent and best of all the staff are like 'Four Seasons' staff and trying hard to anticipate every need of every guest. My son described it as the best hotel he had ever stayed in, the location is great and pricing is fair. Clement Gaffney, the GM has something good here, all Dublin visitors should want to stay here.",5,2015,12,28
205,room for improvement,"I stayed at this hotel in December 2015.  I left a feeling a little disappointed.  The room I was given was very spacious but the decor was a little tired and dated.  The food at dinner was fantastic but when checking out the next morning, I waited for 20 minutes before someone offered to help and there was only one couple ahead of me!  It was early on weekend morning (7am approx) but the staff didn't seem to be either attentive or very organised.",3,2015,12,28
205,Opulent,"The former Four Seasons is an Expensive but nice place to visit.  It's location is in a nice area and handy if you are going to one of the local games/functions in the adjacent RDS or Aviva.  The IC is opulent, a nice treat, service is good, staff are visible, function space is good, food is nice.  ",4,2015,12,23
205,Excellent hotel,"This is an excellent hotel with the only disadvantage - its location. It is very far from the centre and also from the airport. So for only one night I would suggest something else, for two nights it is a question and for more nights it is worth the hassle.
P.S. I had a bit of luck to get a large luxury apartment for a price of a normal room :-)",5,2015,12,22
205,Corporate Christmas Party,"Venue is lovely and convenient.  Conceirge/Porter service was very pleasant and helpful.  
However, the meal was a complete rip off - budget hotel quality at 5 star prices.
There were 3 serving staff for 15 tables of 10 pax with obvious results.  The white wine was replaced by a cheap vile tasting one as our second serving.  When our party complained to the Manager, he replied that ""some water had dripped into the wine bottles from a shelf above""?  He then produced the proper wine to the complaining tables.  The now miraculously efficient staff repeatedly removing our drinks from our tables when we got up to dance.  
The bar tender was the laziest person we have ever encountered at a corporate function.  He suddenly found supplies when he was challenged with a complaint. He just couldn't be bothered - I felt we should have handed him a nail file and chewing gum to help while away the hours until home time! 
Overall, very disappointing.  Not a patch on the old Four Seasons management.
Would NOT recommend.",1,2015,12,21
205,Gorgeous Hotel - A Bit Far from the Center of Town,"The hotel is stunning.  The location is a bit far from the center of town.  But the service and the professionalism of the hotel cannot be beat.  I would be delighted to stay here again, but if I wanted the very best experience in Dublin I would stay at the Westbury. ",4,2015,12,20
205,How to get there?,"Arriving at the airport follow the signs for 'busses'. Take line 702 and, 35 minutes later,  take the busstop in front of the Clayton Ballsbridge hotel which is next door to the InterContinental. The bus leaves only once an hour (at :35). If you missed it you might consider bus 747 to the station an travel onwards by DART to Sandymount station and walk for 3-4 minutes to the hotel. Walk down Sandymount - Avenue to the main road (Merrion). The hotel is on the opposite of the road. Round ticket by bus 702 is Euro 14; it leaves from the Clayton only once every hour (at : 54). Bus 702 will not appear on the busstop signs, but there is a small dark sign on the fence behind the busstop. Do not worry, the bus will be stopping here. 

We asked the hotel staff 6 times where the busstop would be, when the bus would be leaving and what the price would be. And we did get a different answer 6 times. No, the bus is not leaving every 15 or 30 minutes; no, you do not need to walk all the way up to the RDS. 

And that is what went wrong during our stay. Only a few well trained staff members from the Four Seasons (go for the friendly lady from Shanghai at reception!) remain. The rest is trying to get to know the location and the InterContinental itself. We were not recognized as Ambassadors, so were not offered the membership amenities (fruit, miniral water, newspaper, late check-out). But they gave us a beautifully refurbished suite. Comfortable and stylish (classic but not old like the non refurbished rooms) with plenty windows to open. Enough to rate the full 5 stars. We also liked the Occitane stuff and hope the hotel will stick to this brand and will not change it for the brand InterContinental normally offers you. Breakfast was very nice but very expensive; try to find a package rate to enjoy the chique restaurant.  

For tourists traveling without a car, this might not be the best location. The Merrion, The Fitzpatrick, The Westin, The Shelbourne and The Westbury are all right in the small center. But they all tend to be more expensive. The DART will bring you in just a few minutes to Pearse and Tara stations (Euro 2.20). The trains leave every 15 minutes on weekdays, but be aware, on Saturday only every 30 minutes. So you might want to check the schedule first before waiting on a cold and windy Sandymount platform.  

I hope the next time the staff will understand the city and/or InterContinental brand a bit better. And I hope we will be greeted upon arriving. The staff was fully focussed on the large cars arriving and ignored us (arriving by public transport) completely. This is not Moscow guys!",5,2015,12,19
205,Used to be four seasons,"If you visited it before when it was the four seasons you will find that it lost most of its luxury and the professional service.

Staff became small number which affecting the service level and the response time.

If you are new to the hotel you will find it very good.",3,2015,12,18
205,Beautiful hotel but missing some of the 5* touches,"I stayed for 2 nights with some family. We arrived to a warm welcome from a smart and friendly doorman. The girl that checked us in was quite cold and unfriendly but the other front desk staff that I met during my stay we're very nice. 
They left some lovely baby products in the cot for my daughter, which was a lovely touch. 
The rooms we're spacious and really nice. 
We ate and drank at the hotel and used the facilities as well as the spa while we stayed. It was a quiet, relaxing place. 
The spa was nice and the staff we're very efficient and friendly. 
The Bar/ lounge  staff were again very friendly but I found the service quite slow. I sat more than once with an empty glass for 20 mins plus and lengthy waits to order food. Great value in the lounge food menu and great tasting food.
I really missed the fact that there was no turn Dow service which I have had in any other 5* hotel I've stayed in. The housekeeping staff were very accommodating and friendly in fact they would be fantastic front of house!
all in all, a nice place to say.
",3,2015,12,16
205,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful service","We were given a room larger than what we had booked. Big bedroom, huge bathroom. Tub and shower. It was busy in the bar area, but the staff  seemed to handle the crowd well. Breakfast was very busy. Some parties had to wait for tables. The staff at breakfast worked very hard, but looked to be understaffed.",5,2015,12,12
205,Missed the mark but still nice,"We visited what was then The Four Seasons a couple of years ago for brunch. The hotel was so fantastic that when we needed to visit Dublin again recently, we decided to book for a night.

The hotel has all the remnants of The Four Seasons but it just seems to be of lower quality these days. The hotel itself was beautifully decorated with Christmas decorations and the reception staff gave us a warm welcome, there was a buzzy feel to the place.

My biggest gripe was the service for the rest of our stay. We went to the main bar in the afternoon and in the evening and both times service was really slow. The staff are very pleasant but waiting 15 minutes is too long for a drink in a 5* hotel. We also didn't realise the hotel is family friendly so were shocked that there were lots of young children running around in the evening right through til late (they also enjoyed running up and down the corridors outside our room at 11.30pm). Nothing against kids but it was impossible to relax in the bar when there are gaggles of them running all over the place.

Our room was spacious and well equipped with everything that we needed. The decor is perhaps a little tired but immaculately clean.

The best part of the hotel is the spa. Very luxurious and great facilities. The steam room wasn't working which was a shame, but otherwise our experience was faultless.

For what we payed (we got an offer rate), I can't really fault our stay. Be warned though, that this is not uber luxury and the cheaper rates is apparent when you see some of the guests (one table were pretty much still in their slippers and PJs at breakfast- not good!) 

We stayed at the Westin last time and I would book back there when we next visit Dublin.

205,Excellence as standard,"Just back from a wonderful weekend break at the Inter Continental Dublin. The location of the hotel is in Ballsbridge area just about 10 mins by taxi to the City Centre. The hotel is elegant and grand with beautiful large bedrooms. We where checked in by a lovely, friendly professional receptionist called Apple. The rest of the front of house team if found more standoffish and not so friendly, but overall excellent stay and totally recommend the hotel.",5,2015,12,09
205,once lovely hotel now suffering from under-staffing,"i have stayed at this hotel in the past when it was the Four Seasons and it was a perfect 5 star experience.  unfortunately standards have slipped and this is entirely down to inadequate staffing levels in the bar and restaurant area.  it is simply not possible to provide the level of service that is expected in this type of hotel while cutting staff numbers.  we stayed on the weekend of /Dec 4-6th 2015. there was one barman on duty who was working heroically but simply could not keep up with demand.  on the Friday evening dec 4th we ate in the Seasons restaurant.  we waited approx 40 minutes for our food order to be taken and finally the wine waiter took it,  the result was we ate some hour and 20 minutes after being seated.  the staff were clearly under pressure and doing their absolute best but there were simply not enough of them! on Sunday morning we were obliged to queue for breakfast - it was busy but clearly staff had difficulty to handle the situation.
i have to say housekeeping were fantastic, especially Monika who looked after me very well,
it is such a pity to see a once lovely establishment being allowed to run down for lack of sufficient staff.",3,2015,12,07
205,"Great Conference, location and beautiful setup","i'm doing this on behalf of my wife who attended a conference there for 1 week from 14-20 Nov 2015.  The first thing she said was how great the location was, how quaint and cozy but how beautiful the interior was.  She was impressed with the size of the standard rooms.  The conference setup made it easy to manuever between rooms.  The good was quite good.  And the spa, she told me about ""Rueben"" who she thought was just about the best customer service she'd experienced.  That made her come back again for a treatment! her only recommendation was the size of the small bar - even if it extended out 5 feet it would make a difference especially if the Intercon plans to cater to conferences like her size (+150).  
Overall, this was a beautiful hotel, the service was amazing and staff throughout the hotel were very hospitable.",5,2015,12,07
205,Good choice for overnight break,"Very friendly, helpful staff in all areas of the hotel. Room was very spacious and bathroom lovely. Everything you would need. Didn't eat in the hotel. The Ice Bar is a great place for a pre/post dinner drink. The only negative was the lack of spaces in the car park.",5,2015,12,06
205,Just perfect for a romantic weekend,"Conveniently located in a quiet area of the city off the most beaten path, we found it ideal to spend some lovely time together. City centre is not difficult to reach and the spa is simply what you need after a day sightseeing (and drinking). Do try to make it down for breakfast, as it is simply to die for! Beds have got be the best in Ireland",5,2015,12,01
205,Love this place,"Visited many times when it was Four Seasons. It is still a very nice place to stay. Partly because of location but also room size, ease of parking and generally good staff. We took a package that included breakfast, room upgrade and free parking with 2pm checkout. It compared favourably to any offer in town this weekend. One small bread and butter issue, there is none of either bread or butter in the breakfast buffet ! On both mornings we had to ask for both with breakfast and often breakfast was finished before it eventually arrived. Please put a toaster beside the breakfast buffet and a basket of bread beside it. Otherwise all good.",5,2015,11,30
205,Gorgeous Hotel,"This place is lovely and only topped by the wonderful staff available to its guests. Our room was large and high enough so we could see the port from our window. The bathroom was large with a shower separate from the tub and a closed area for the toilet. Robes and slippers provided. Because it is located away from the city center, it's a very quiet hotel as well.

The only drawback of this hotel is its location.",5,2015,11,29
205,Heloful,"I visited Dublin recently by myself. Being a young female and this being the first time i have travelled alone,the staff were very helpful when I needed suggestions on what to do or where to go. Transport was made a breeze and all my awkward questions where answered . I never felt like I was bothering them and they seemed like they were happy to help. I Would 100% stay here again. Special mention to Apple who answered all my questions when checking in and to Manny for helping me look things up! ",5,2015,11,27
205,A Great Stay,"I stayed here for four nights in early November and it was excellent. I had stayed in the hotel before when it was the Four Seasons and I had read some reviews saying the standards had slipped, I did not find that to be the case. Even though the hotel was very busy for an event, I found the service was great, the staff were friendly and helpful. I stayed in a suite and I could not fault it in anyway, I wish I could have stayed longer. I will be back!",5,2015,11,24
205,Excellent Business Hotel,"This is a great place to stay on Business or a family vacation. The ambience , rooms & service is very good. Breakfast & Bar is very good. Food options are limited , but very nice restaurants in the vicinity. Location is far from the business center of Ballycoolin. Overall recommended a little pricy.",5,2015,11,24
205,Beautiful hotel,"I stayed here on business last week for a couple of nights.  Booked through this site, received a great deal and stayed in an Executive Suite that was just beautiful. I could have stayed for weeks. Hotel oozes class and every member of staff was incredibly helpful and friendly. Will return on business soon and hopefully fit in a family leisure trip and stay there too. Be back soon, Paul !",5,2015,11,22
205,Enjoyabe,Room was nice and relaxing. Room service was exceptional. Was a stone throw away from the RDS so it was perfect for the event I was attending that weekend. Evening restaurant food nice too. However it does get a bit confusing trying to navigate the floors to get to the ground floor.,4,2015,11,18
205,Grand but a bit stuffy,The Intercontinental is a beautifully ornate though a bit stuffy hotel. It’s a great place for a meeting in the lobby in the big comfy couches though the wifi is a bit slow and flaky. The menu was a bit small in terms of libations and the beer selection was nearly non-existent. The wait staff was very professional though a bit lacking in personality. The couches are quite nice for a meeting or even sitting and getting some work done outside of the room.,4,2015,11,15
205,World Class - Best Hotel in Dublin (Bar none),"Hat's off to all the staff in the Intercontinental. We have stayed in most of Dublin's best and can confirm this was undoubtedly the best. The breakfast was the BEST we ever had. The service, staff, accomodation, spa were all superb and we are already looking forward to a return visit. Thank you for a memorable weekend.",5,2015,11,15
205,Beautiful hotel but not 5 star service ,"When we checked in the staff were very helpful. The room was beautiful. However, there are a few things that we felt weren't 5 star. Firstly, we rang room service for some cutlery, it took three phone calls and over one hour before this arrived to our room. We arranged to meet friends in the bar. It's not cheap so you would expect impeccable service, unfortunately we were left waiting for drinks and it was difficult to find staff. We left to go to a bar with better service. When we arrived back at 4am there was no security and no one on reception to check that we were actually staying there. This morning, we had to queue to be seated for breakfast, I took a picture as I was so shocked to see this in a 5 star hotel. The buffet was also busy. I picked up a plate, it was dirty. Also we had to inform staff that they were out of certain things in the buffet. The late check out is great, but room service knocked twice loudly on the door before 12. Over all it's beautiful and a great location, but when you are paying to stay in a luxury hotel you expect a certain service and unfortunately the InterContinental Dublin didn't deliver this weekend.",3,2015,11,15
205,Disappointed ,"A pretty surreal experience from check in when there were more people decorating a Xmas tree than apparently thinking about desks. Lady at reception was totally disinterested in the extent she pointed me in the wrong direction for the lift. On finding the room I found the no lights on other than in the bathroom (dark outside) and the only way to get them on in the main room was to find the individual switches for the standard/bedside lights in the dark. I rang room service and asked what vegetarian meals were available. A sandwich was the only option but after pushing I also got offered a pasta 'with vegetables'. He insisted the restaurant had no other options but after going downstairs I found it had plenty and had one delivered. That this point the room was still freezing cold and the room service man called the engineer. It took him around 30 min to fix at a time that I was really wanting to relax. In the end I moved rooms. Decor was modern but some significant changes needed to make this a top class hotel. 

Sent from my iPhone",2,2015,11,14
205,Thank You,We booked a junior suite and stayed for a week. All the staff were most helpful. I just want to say thanks in particular to Ida in the restaurant and Rory at Reception. Your helfness and kindness made all the difference to us.,5,2015,11,14
205,Perfect weekend break!,"My wife and I were visiting friends back in the UK, and decided to pop to Dublin for a weekend.  We were very impressed with the Intercontinental.  Set in expansive, leafy grounds in the quiet suburban Ballsbridge area of South Dublin, the Intercontinental is perfect for that weekend break.  It’s set in a traditional-looking brown-brick building, with lots of elegant touches.  Staff are warm and courteous.  Hotel rooms command views of landscaped gardens and fountains, and the decor is comfy and refined.  The marble bathroom was the best place I’ve ever sat and read the morning paper in, and the bath is big enough to properly lay down in and sip a glass of single malt in the evening if you decide not to sip in the refined environment of the in-house Whiskey Bar.  The garden courtyard outside the splendid Seasons restaurant was where we enjoyed our first guinness of the weekend – and it was merriment all round from then on in!  Highly recommended.",5,2015,11,12
205,Wonderful,"Fantastic hotel, fantastic building.  Great location away from the more touristy Temple Bar area.  I would stay here every time I come to Dublin for the service alone.  Great staff who were attentive to us the entire time.  My cousin, who I was traveling with, had just graduated college and they sent up a Congratulatory platter.",5,2015,11,12
205,Nice hotel,"Spend two nights in this nice hotel. The rooms are large and have a great bathroom. Staff is very helpful! The breakfast is top class, really really good!
The only negative thing I can say is that the guest internet connection is prehistorically slow.
The Whiskey bar is a good hangout (if you're into this drink) good food, good vibes!",4,2015,11,09
205,Luxury at it's Best,"We booked an executive double room and was offered an upgrade to a junior suite for an extra £136 which as it was our first weekend away together and a double birthdayy celebration, we took them up on it. The hotel stands in beautiful surroundings and is easily worth it's 5* rating. The room was beautiful and the staff were welcoming and friendly...The only grumble I have is the 30 euro additional charge (each) for breakfast...although nice...for that price it has to be out of this world and unfortunately it simple wasn't. The food/drinks at the hotel are very very expensive so would be my advice to avoid at all costs if you are on a budget - I don't mind paying if it's worth it but did feel like I was being ripped off with the bar/breakfast bill. I think the prices at this hotel are on par with The Dorchester in London so be careful! Quite far out from The Temple Bar area also and the taxi's a fairly expensive too! Would return definitely.",5,2015,11,09
205,Is this perfection?,"Nearly!
My wife and I decided to start our holiday in Ireland with a few days at the Intercon in Dublin.   From the outside the hotel is extremely impressive and nothing changes when entering the lobby.   Check in was very smooth and we were upgraded to a suite.   The room was huge although the only view from the window was of a rooftop.   Breakfast was adequate and if anything was the one point that detracted from perfection.   The choices on the buffet could have been better.
Throughout our stay the staff were very attentive, but not overly, and helpful and did everything they could to make our stay enjoyable.
Get the breakfast right and this hotel would be perfect.",5,2015,11,02
205,Not up to their own standards!,"We went for an overnight treat and this was suggested to us. We had use of a corporate account so thought a bit of value luxury was going to be on the cards. Just the two of us. Firstly we had to book a deluxe room but when we arrived they kindly upgraded us to a suite. It was huge! Now that might be wonderful but someone had swiped the furniture! There was hardly a stick in it! Empty. In some modern places that might be called minimalism but not here; the furniture was just gone. The bare yellow walls had barely a picture relieving the acres of wall space and you could see the foot prints of the departed furniture on the carpets. There wasn't even one of the usual hotel magazines or restaurant guides on the lonesome coffee table to relieve the emptiness. When the porter came with the bags we looked longingly at his trolley to see was a a couch or sideboard or a few tables in it but alas no! I've been in youth hotels with more furniture. The bed was huge but the mattress had trenches in it from age so rolling over in the bed was a bit like trying to roll up hill. I had stayed a month or so before in the Intercontinental in Warsaw and it was fab. All whizz-bang modern, shiny, beautifully kitted out and faultless. This hotel is a tired old hulk. Now a tired old hulk has its uses I'm the first to admit, but not a premium priced hotel. There are lots of better places to stay for a lot less money. The staff were fine and we can't comment on the breakfast as we were going to a lunch and didn't need it.",1,2015,10,30
205,Fantastic stay - will be back!,"Booked a room at this hotel due to great rates online. We had a junior suite which was very spacious and had plenty of room for my kids to play in. The staff was very friendly and accommodating to children, in particular Apple at the front desk who was so kind and pleasant. The kids were offered ""gold coins"" from the treasure chest upon arrival and had their very own mini plush bathrobes to use. My only complaint was the cost of breakfast (we did not have breakfast included) which was 28 euros for the buffet - quite steep for what was offered. Roly's down the street is a nice breakfast alternative if you're looking for a lower cost alternative.",5,2015,10,29
205,New rooms delightful ,"Stayed in room 322 last weekend and it is one of the newly refurbished rooms, without any doubt it is going to set a very high standard of room for other 5 star hotels to follow in dublin. The hotel still remains by far the most wonderful all round experience for food, drink, leisure facilities and customer care service. Why it is 21st on TA maybe something to do with reviews from disgruntled former employees!!!!!! ",5,2015,10,27
205,Well done,"We spent four nights in this first class facility.  Considering the facilities the price was very reasonable.  The rooms were good, meeting rooms great and the service excellent.  I would expect no less and was not disappointed. 

Our room came with a breakfast package.  The meals and service were great.  You can either order from the menu or go through the buffet.",5,2015,10,24
205,Quick Meal,"Was in the area for a exhibition and headed to the intercontinental for a drink and eats.
Decided to eat in the bar, had 3 starters between us and a glass of wine and beer, starters were sliders, ribs, bread and oils/pesto
Enough to fill us, atmosphere and service were good and the usual standard of the IHG Group Hotel.
Total bill was €44. Great value for the money and quality of food.
Will call again",4,2015,10,24
205,We keep coming back,"The Intercontinental (previously The Four Seasons) was never really my favourite Dublin Hotels. 
For me it lacked the more comfortable public lounges of The Westbury or The Merion for that level of hotel. 

However the more I stay there the more I get to like it and find myself wanting to go back.
The rooms are spacious and bright, with the Junior Suites a big jump up.
We were very lucky last time to get upgraded to a Landsdowne Suite - incredibly big and comfortable, great for a family stay.

The main lounge area is a bit open and lacking character I'm afraid but step to the left into the small bar and it's a bit more like home. 

Staff are most helpful and nearly invisible until you need something when all of a sudden there is plenty of help.

Value for money? For sure at the moment the rates are very attractive.
The transition between the two hotel brands may be taking a while so my advice is try it out while the rates are good. 

",4,2015,10,21
205,A magnificent hotel,"Intercontinental Hotels are among the best, and this is one of the best of the best.  We enjoyed our suite and all the amenities which came along with it.  The rooms are large, quiet, and comfortable.  The bed is fantastic. Its a short walk to some of the best restaurants, too.  Try Roly's Bistro just about three blocks away over the bridge.",5,2015,10,18
205,Elegance just outside the city center,We stayed here for a few nights to explore Dublin. It was a beautiful hotel and the service was impeccable. Our hotel room was gorgeous and the amenities fabtastic. The restaurant was delicious and bartenders fantastic and fun. We enjoyed the spa while waiting for our rooms to be ready. Our only wish was that it was closer to city center so we could walk vs taxi. ,4,2015,10,12
205,Grand Hotel with Good Service,The staff here was friendly and efficient.  The level of service is great.  The hotel property is grand but dated. The hallway on my floor had an odor of 'old' - such old carpet. My suite was pleasingly spacious but lacked a contemporary feel.,3,2015,10,06
205,Lovely stay,"Stayed for one night, arrived at the hotel around 1pm not expecting to get checked in but we did and got to our room which was a really lovely big room with 2 double beds. The beds & pillows are so comfy. Room was so quiet. Breakfast the next morning was really lovely, had omelette which was freshly made and pancakes which also came from the kitchen. Would recommend this hotel.",5,2015,10,05
205,lovely hotel ,"great hotel and location with Dart train station nearby. had a really peaceful sleep in the world's biggest bed. breakfast was good too. staff were helpful and friendly. ..would definitely stay here again 
happy days ",5,2015,10,04
205,"Super hotel, great staff.","Located in the leafy suburbs adjacent to the RDS the InterContinental is a ideally located close to cultural, conference and sporting venues and close to the public transport links to the city centre.  From the moment I arrived until my departure 36 hours later I met nothing but friendly, efficient and engaging staff. The hotel is modern with spacious accommodation and on-site parking. But everything comes at a price and it certainly isn't for the budget conscious. Do I have any complaints? The bedrooms overlooking the service area do suffer from noise.",4,2015,10,02
205,Terrible atmosphere now. Sad dublin,"Staff are totally withdrawn. They look seriously peeved. Half hearted attempt from a bar man to make a drink. It all felt very sloppy. I Thought the wine list by the glass was a rip off. 
Staff were fake, disinterested and arrogant since its been taken over. The tone is totally different. The Lobby was like an old folks home.",1,2015,09,29
205,Nice service but an overpriced mediocre lunch experience,"Had a very disappointing, underwhelming lunch experience here recently. Ordered the soup/sandwich combination which can only be described as bland, boring and the ultimate bitter pill too swallow , expensive and bad value for money",4,2015,09,29
205,A beautiful stylish hotel which makes its customer feel valued and home-like,"As a consultant in a FAO team of experts I participated in a symposium in Dublin back in 1984 and felt in love with this wonderful capital and whished to be there again with my husband, who had never been in Ireland yet. So my dear husband regarded this visit to be the most perfect birthday present for me to enjoy together.
He offered me to choose the hotel I prefer for our stay in Dublin, so being an IHG Rewards Club member and after reading a lot about Dublin hotels in the internet - mostly on Tripadvisor –, my choice felt on the InterContinental Dublin. And I could not have made a better choice! 

We enjoyed such a warm welcome at the reception by Mr. Clement Gaffney General Manager and Mr. Roory Roony Front Office Manager that we could feel ourselves as very important guests and it was a real heart warming beginning of our splendid stay ( 10-15/09-2015) in the beautiful InterContinental in Dublin. I do appreciate this fine gesture which makes us feel like valued customers.
By the time we had a delicious snack and coffee in the lodge our very pleasant, huge and luxury suite was ready. We were upgraded to a King junior suite nr 419 on the fourth floor facing to the main entrance of the hotel with a nice view and free Wi-Fi in the room (much needed to reply to all the birthday greetings!) as recognition for IHG Rewards Club Member. 

We were very pleased with the spaciousness of our wonderful suite furnished in traditional style, many lamps on many different places in the room, which made it possible to arrange so pleasant and romantic effects for our pleasure. We had a very comfortable real King sized bed, we could sleep so fantastically well. We liked the big walk-in closet. The bathroom itself was huge, too, with a big tube, a large shower cabin and a separate private area, all decorated in marvellous marble. The toiletries were L'Occitane, the bath and bed linen were top quality. What we enjoyed best was that not a door bang, rumbling suitcase or stiletto click from the room above or lift noise was heard during our 5 nights stay. This was the most quiet hotel we have ever stayed in. We had another very pleasant experience that “invisible persons” made our suite every day: there was never any problem whenever we left or arrived back, we found everything in order and spotless clean. We liked very much that we did not need to use the main hotel entrance when we returned from our sightseeing tours and excursions but  had a separate entrance (just besides the main entrance) for the guests living in the residences, which could be opened by the room-card. The same card needed to activate the lift, too. By this way we felt ourselves in en excellent security in the hotel. The spa, gym and pool were great as well.
It was a lovely surprise when I got a very special elegant chocolate arrangement to our room accompanied with a birthday card with compliments of the hotel management on it. Thanks InterContinental Dublin!
We had breakfast in the fine restaurant twice. We had the buffet, it was adequate but not as well appointed for us as we would have liked for its cost. We did not eat lunch or dinner at the hotel, but after dinner in the city we returned to the stylish bar for our Irish Coffee. Sorry to say, but we had consumed much better elsewhere in the city.

A special mention for the excellent service we received at the concierge especially by Oliver. We got several good tips to our Dublin visit. The hotel´s location is perfect. It is in one of Dublin`s nicest residential areas, near to the American and British Embassies, very quiet, relaxing, far from the busy touristic part of Dublin but it is well connected to the city centre, with easy walking distance to bus stops (4, 7, 8). The bus cost was 2.55 Euro and it took only 7-10 minutes to the centre. Just on the opposite side of the hotel´s main entrance one can catch a hop-on, hop-off bus, otherwise you can have a walk (20-25 minutes), or take a taxi (for about 20 Euro). There are restaurants within short walking distance, too. The hotel is about 25 minutes from the airport in a taxi and we paid 27-30 each way.

The InterContinental Dublin is a very large hotel, beautiful, stylish and elegant. The property is very impressive and comfortable.  It is not a bargain hotel and probably does not have that as a goal. If you wish an amazing hotel with good service and you are ready to pay for it, this is your place. From the moment we arrived it was nothing but 5 stars treatment but what we priced so highly was that the InterContinental Dublin has managed to make us feel home-like and that is not something one can experience at every five star hotel.

I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,09,29
205,Oh gosh What have you done to my fav hotel,I really feel the need to write another review of this hotel.I will keep it short if not that sweet.We were here for a weekend in August and were so excited to return.We went to reception to check in and since we were early we understood that we had to wait 45 minutes till our room was ready but when we were informed that it was ready we didn't expect to see our main window drapes lying on the floor.Half an hour later we phoned to see where our luggage had gone and were told  that they were very busy (They certainly were) and that it was on its way .Ten minutes later my husband looked outside and it was still where we had left it outside so we ended up just getting it ourselves.The bedroom was simple but the bed and  linens top quality.Pity the new owners have cut out the top quality bathroom products though.The biggest change is in the staff.There are not half  enough of them and the ones that are there are overworked and very unhappy. The last time I stayed here I raved about one particular member of bar staff.Even he was totally different this trip...No happy faces anymore.Breakfast was a total nightmare...No end to the queue and short staff.At our table we had no milk or marmalade and very difficult to try and attract staff attention as they were run off their feet as they were.Also it was very intimitading eating knowing that there were people staring at us from the doorway to hurry up and let them sit.When 4 seasons owned this place one would be offered coffee in the bar until a table became free.We paid 600 euro for this well below par experience.Will I stay again...Id need to read a lot of rave  reviews before doing so... last comment .The uniforms the ladies were are hideous....Like halter necks with white tops underneath...yuck,2,2015,09,26
205,Downhill all the way,"I've stayed twice in the last 2 months. My family and I stayed during the horseshow week. Our check-in, room and sleeping experience was fine. We had dinner and drinks all ok. I saw staff were very busy and were working hard to keep up with guests. We were waiting for our second round of drinks, when we couldn't find a waiter, we noticed that staff were focussing on one group of guests. The group were extremely drunk, staff were doing their best with this group, but one gentleman in the group was being obnoxious. When we finally got served, i asked the waiter if the group were in the hotel a lot? He smiled and told me that they were and they were the owners. I cannot believe that senior Intercontinental people would act like that in their own hotel. 

My second visit was this week, it was much quieter and i was staying on my own. The service levels have definitely dropped since the Four Season days. 

There are much few staff than before and you couldn't get a smile from staff. I asked if someone had died? The manager said no, but he said everyone was struggling with their work. I asked how things were going, he talked about hours worked and then tried to balance it by talking about the new restaurant opening. 

I pointed out that he would be then busier, he smiled and said that he'd keep doing his best. 

The in room experince was good, i wish the great in-room experience could be replicated downstairs",1,2015,09,25
205,Wonderful luxury hotel!,"We stayed for two nights earlier this month as a wedding gift from a family member.... and loved the hotel. Our room was fantastic, the decor was elegant and understated, the bed was super comfortable (so much so that we overslept and missed some tourist things we wanted to do!) The staff we spoke to were very helpful - both in person and by email and we were able to arrange an early check-in and late check-out to fit in with our flights with no problem at all - people couldnt have been more helpful. There is a bus stop right outside for the hop-on/hop-off tourist bus which we used to travel around sightseeing and you can catch the aircoach back to the airport further along the road. We also waked into the city centre - maybe a 40 min walk but through a lovely area, passing a park on a sunday which exhibits local artists.  This is a beautiful luxurious hotel and we would return in a second if we had the chance!",5,2015,09,23
205,Beautifully decorated spacious room,"Our corner room was very generous in size with Juliet balcony to one side and large, wide bay windows overlooking the RDS and beyond to another. The marbled bathroom also had beautiful bay window and was large and well equipped. Bed was extremely comfy especially the pillows which I've been trying to source since! 
Cocktails in bar and dined in the restaurant. Service was excellent. Much improved on previous visits when owned by the Four Seasons group. Will certainly return. B&I",4,2015,09,23
205,Outstanding Hotel,"When visiting Dublin, this hotel has it all. Attentive and knowledgeable staff, quality amenities and good location. It is an easy 30 minute stroll into city center or it is serviced by many different city bus lines. No need for a car. It is in an area called Embassy Row because of its proximity to several embassies, one of which is the United States Embassy. 

We will definitely stay here again. ",5,2015,09,21
205,Great stay,"I stayed here for 3 nights for a conference in September 2015. 
My corner room on the 4th floor (433) was very spacious with great views of the city.
The room design is traditional, but comfy, everything was spotless clean. Great bathroom with good amenities.
Staff were friendly and efficient, good service and a great experience throughout my stay.
Depending on what you're planning to do, the location may not be ideal (the hotel is a short cab ride away from Temple Bar area) but it was perfect for us.
Definitely worth considering when planning your next Dublin trip.",4,2015,09,19
205,Downward Spiral,"Clearly no longer the 4 Season's standard.  I was able to enjoy room's 411 TV through the middle of the night, unfortunately the low batteries prevented me from watching TV in my room.  The mattress was so worn that the middle of the mattress was at least 3cm higher than either side.  Other than that the room was clean, and as always the Wfi always requires a call to the front desk for the code. If I was in Dublin for other than business, I would stay else where.",3,2015,09,19
205,Average stay at the suite,"My wife and I got upgraded to a suite when we checked in.
Unfortunately there is no executive lounge...

Place itself looks very luxurious. Room was big and had a lot of space. Good for a big family, but since we were just a couple, it was too big for us.

There is free parking available as well.

205,outstanding and quiet,"stayed 2 nights in the former Four Seasons hotel, it has everything you would expect from 5* rated top hotels : clean, top service, big rooms with big comfortable beds, big variety for breakfast. Close to downtown.",4,2015,09,17
205,Fantastic!,"Having never been to Ireland I wasn't sure what to expect so we decided to stay at the Intercontinental for our first night.  We were greeted by Rory who was incredible, his ability to immediately make you feel comfortable and welcome was amazing.  From there we met with Oliver the concierge to ask for some recommendations.  Not only did he provide that, he also went above and beyond and provided thoughts and suggestions on our future stops, he was also so incredibly kind and helpful.  This stay began a wonderful 10 day adventure and the inviting and caring team members made our first impression a very positive one.  I highly recommend staying here.  From beginning to end it was a wonderful experience!  The rooms are wonderful, the bathtub is fantastic and the location is nice and quiet. ",5,2015,09,16
205,Fantastic ,"This hotel rivals the Intercontinental Singapore for service and style. Staff were absolutely fantastic, especially Laura at the front desk.

We couldn't have dreamt for a better experience. Our request for dry cleaning completed and back in our room within 3 hrs. Service and food in the casual dining area was wonderful. Breakfast buffet was amazing, so many options and lots of healthy alternatives!!! My husband (scrambled egg connoisseur) said they were the best scrambled eggs he's ever demolished.

The hotel decor is just gorgeous, I wanted to stay another couple of nights but unfortunately we had to leave!!

Would definitely recommend to anyone heading to Dublin.",5,2015,09,14
205,EXCELLENT,"Just back after a short stay in the Intercontinental  - second time staying since Intercontinental took over.  We had a beautiful refurbished room.  Everything was just perfect.  Lovely to see many of the Four Seasons staff all very attentive.  Reception was very efficient.  Had dinner in the lobby which was lovely and of course breakfast great as usual.  Love the new décor in the Restaurant also, well done.   Looking forward to a return visit.",5,2015,09,14
205,Beautiful night,"this was the old four seasons hotel, still in the middle of a soft refurbishment. We had an old room but I just loved it. Please don't make it too modern! Property is just lovey, staff efficient and friendly. Had supper in the bar after returning from the theatre and the atmosphere was lovely. Could have sat there all night. Can't wait to go back, thank you.",5,2015,09,12
205,Nice but not exceptional ,Stayed here for 2 nights. Reception staff were very friendly and the reception area was nice. The room was a little dated and bare. Not overly impressive and didn't feel five star. Loved the bathroom - nice deep bathtub but overall not really worth the money. Nice location though. ,3,2015,09,11
205,Just what was needed!,"We only stayed for 2 days but like it so much we went back the following week before we flew home.  The beds are so comfy and the bath was amazing - it had arm rests!?
The staff were very helpful, lots of advise from the concierge as it was our first trip to Dublin",5,2015,09,10
205,Our Cab Driver Did Not Lie,"On our cab ride from the train station to the hotel, our friendly cabbie, (is there not one in Ireland?), told us that the IC was one of the nicest hotels in all of Dublin.  (Would he say otherwise?)  But based on our 3-night stay, we can confirm that he told the truth.  Lovely and well maintained property, very large and quiet rooms with a wonderfully sized bathroom and all the amenities you would expect from a 5-star property.  Staff was very friendly including Front Desk, Concierge and all the servers in the restaurant and bar.  Food was great and of a high quality and an abundance of options.  As mentioned, the location is a little ways from the city center...which we enjoy while traveling...and we chose to walk into town each day and/or we took the DART train or bus in one direction.  Very easy.  Great neighborhood restaurants near-by as well.  All in all a very pleasant stay and would return again next time we are in Dublin.",5,2015,09,07
205,Lovely Bubblin! (Prosecco),"I haven't stayed here but have visited a few times as in the local area. Having been to Intercontinental in Dubai - I didn't know what to expect. The entrance is grand, and it has a really nice feel about it, something very special about the place. 
Its not the most up to date furnishing wise, but its comfortable and traditional in its environment. I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys a quiet drink. The service was 5 star, and the guy remembered us (and our drinks( the second time we went! Will definitely be coming again. By the way the Prosecco is the most delicious Prosecco I have ever tasted.",4,2015,09,07
205,Short but very sweet,"We only had a very short stay at the intercontinental as we had an early crossing at the ferry port booked. Sadly we did not have time to eat in the restaurants, use the Spa or pool. The bedroom was lovely. Traditionally decorated and spotlessly clean. The bed was the most comfortable I  have ever slept in. The soundproofing was amazing we did not hear anyone else at night. 
We will definitely stay again. Thank you",5,2015,09,06
205,Really great experience,"Attended a gala charity event here - the whole experience was really good the staff are friendly, the food was exceptional and the drinks service was very good all in all an enjoyable evening  - would recommend to anyone hosting any large corporate or charity event",5,2015,09,06
205,Superb,"Take no notice of any negative reviews about this hotel its first class !!! Friendly staff from reception through to the concierge.
Room was fabulous yes we were upgraded due to my IHG status it was huge, evening turn down service also offering more towels and bottled water, Internet free for IHG guests and pretty quick too.
The pool and spa is excellent ...plenty of towels free lockers with bags for your costumes and waterproof flip flops. Free coffee tea and fruit too.
Continental breakfast was great and hit the spot.
We walked into the city very flat but it isa 45 min risk walk no problem for us we walk everywhere. We were told anything from 20-45 !!!
Overall this is the best hotel we have stayed in",5,2015,09,06
205,Very Nice,"When we stayed at the intercontinental, I was blown away! The bathrooms were very nice and ""posh"" so where the rooms. We had a suite with was good with 1 double 1 single and a double sofa bed.It was very expensive, so eat out for tea and breakfast. But over all a really nice hotel.",5,2015,09,05
205,Good Hotel,"Good hotel. Large room, good condition, friendly staff. Generally quiet apart from some minor internal upgrade work underway in Sept 2015. Additional charge of 11 euro per day is a bit much for a 5 star hotel... would have expected that yo be in the room price",5,2015,09,04
205,Very pleasant suprise,"I didn't know that Intercontinental had a property in Dublin. Arrived very late and left very early so did not get to explore much of the hotel. What I saw was impressive, room was good size, location is great for RDS and Aviva and restaurant facilities within walking distance. Not there long enough to test food on site or the gym but will definitely go back to try these out.",4,2015,09,03
205,Good Hotel but Very Dated Room Decor,"We stayed at the Intercontinental Dublin in August 2015. Overall the hotel is very good and we would stay there again. The rooms are large and very spacious and the main areas of the hotel are very nice. The bar is particularly nice with wood panelling and a great selection of beers, spirits and cocktails. The restaurants are very good and the breakfast is excellent. They do a very good buffet and an a la carte menus. They also have a good selection of Gluten Free options. 

For us, the main problem was that the rooms have a very dated decor which really lets the hotel down. It was a little like staying at my Granny's house! Our room was had yellow walls, with thick flowery curtains and very dark furniture. It felt tired and old fashioned. If they spent some money updating the rooms this could really be a fantastic hotel. Apparently they are current undergoing a 5 year upgrade plan and hopefully the rooms will be soon on that plan!

Either way, still a great hotel and we would stay there again.",4,2015,09,01
205,"Good accommodation, good location but poor services","As an Ambassador member (which costs money) I was expecting a room upgrade and a Club lounge neither of which was offered. Room was very nice and clean but staff could have been more helpful. No restaurant and food was served in the bar. No explanation was given to us about this on booking or arrival and staff were defensive when questioned - I feel that they are unsure following the recent change to Intercon and, I understand, a more recent change of ownership. The hotel did eventually give me a small refund to compensate for the lack of room upgrade but this was only after quite a few conversations about the situation during our stay. 
On the whole I would say a beautiful hotel with really nice rooms in a prime location. My own criticism because of no recognition of my Ambassador membership and poor restaurant facilities. It would have helped if we had been advised of this when booking or even at our arrival at the hotel.",3,2015,08,31
205,Excellent stay,"Just spent 4 days and had a great time. A good property with well sized & well furnished rooms. The staff was ever so helpful. The amenities were good. Though the restaurant was under refurbishment, alternate arrangements were convenient. The location of the property is also great as it is well connected to city centre. We would recommend this hotel to those visiting Dublin.",4,2015,08,29
205,"I would be lucky to come back, fantastic","Long weekend away with my man.
Pluses;
Huge bedroom and all very posh, 
Extra polite staff,
The gardens and grounds are stunning,
Restaurant food was all fantastic.
Minuses;
I had to go home
This is a serious hotel and I would be lucky to go back.
Five star in all ways.",5,2015,08,29
205,Beautiful hotel however slightly disappointed.,"I was sent here through business as a sister-company I work for holds an account here. I was thoroughly looking forward to my visit as I had heard great things about the hotel. Upon pulling up to the hotel in a taxi the door-man was very welcoming and helped me with the small luggage I did have. Upon walking into the hotel I went left to what I thought was the reception desk. I stated I would like to check in and the lady behind the desk simply looked at me as if I was stupid and mumbled and pointed ""reception is over there""...When I reached the reception desk however the young gentleman behind could not have been more helpful. He seemed genuinely interested in my reasons for being in Dublin and cheerily pointed out things to do had I time to visit. My room was very grande and the beautiful was simply stunning. I ordered room service and the gentleman who delivered my food was ever so nice. My room overlooked a horse jumping arena, I horse jump myself and decided to ring downstairs to inquire was the arena anything to do with the hotel as I would like to book a session upon my visit. Unfortunately on the other end of the phone I once again got the lady who 'greeted' me upon my arrival...she once again very bluntly pointed out the arena was nothing to do with the hotel and hung up on my phone call while I was still mid sentence. I had to once again phone downstairs to the not so pleasant as my television remote control did not work, and could not watch it otherwise, upon waiting an hour after I first telephoned, I had to ring again as no-one came to look about it, 3 times I telephoned and still no-one...so I simply gave up. Everyone has bad days - so I overlooked the situation but this one lady has put me off returning to the hotel again, and as a result I have not and have stayed elsewhere in Dublin.",4,2015,08,28
205,Beautiful hotel,"Beautiful hotel lovely restaurant good food the downstairs area is lovely however the bedrooms although clean could do with updating.All the staff where lovely.Everything you needed was in the bedrooms and we where given a free upgrade .
",4,2015,08,28
205,Excellent hotel in Ballsbridge,"This hotel was purchased from Four Seasons, didn't stay there when owned by FS so can't compare. The hotel lobby area, sitting areas, bar, restaurant and breakfast room were all well appointed. The first person you meet on arrival if driving is one of the fellows who helps with your car and he was great, directed me where to park and pointed out that self parking was about 20 feet away from valet parking, so it was an easy choice and savings. Some have commented the hotel is somewhat out of the way, I suppose it would be a 10 Euro or less cab ride up into Temple Bar/Trinity College area but plenty of decent restaurants and pubs within walking distance. It is a very spacious hotel so you have a feeling of lots of room unlike some of the other properties. The Herbert Park hotel as an example is maybe 2-300 metres closer to town so its not like the Intercontinental is that far out of the way. Just a little trouble with the GPS locating the hotel entrance, but once located that was all fine. Definitely would return. Very nice breakfast in the morning, would recommend taking that as part of the hotel reservation.",5,2015,08,26
205,So disappointed,"I was extremely disappointed. I have stayed there when it was still owned by the four seasons and was so impressed, this time , unfortunately, my experience was completely different. Guests now have to pay for on site parking. It's €11 to park it yourself and €20 for valet parking. We checked in and when we went into our room it was the WRONG ROOM. Somebody else's clothes were scattered on the bed and belongings on the table and in the bathroom. Luckily for all involved the residents were out. We went back to check in, they apologised, sorted our room out and told us that a manager would be in contact. We were never contacted. When we got to the right room I was very disappointed to note that they have stopped supplying high end L'occitane products and now offer some generic brand. We unpacked and decided to shower as we had early meal reservations. There were no shower caps in the bathroom. I rang reception requesting two to be sent up (I was with a friend not my husband). Fifteen minutes later I had to ring back asking them again. The following morning I decided to contact the manager myself. She was extremely apologetic and offered a free upgrade on our next visit, it will take a lot more than that to entice me back, we saved for five months for this night away. I requested that they offer us a complimentary breakfast and she did. I was told at check out that I would receive an e-mail from the hotel with my offer of a free upgrade. So far I have not. ",1,2015,08,24
205,"Good, but slipping a little","A very nice hotel with well-appointed rooms. However, it is slipping in the details - things like complicated sink plugs that don't drain properly. Nice bar, but on the night I was there it was plagued by a drunken regular, who the staff seemed to have no interest in moving on. Seems to have slipped a bit since it moved from being a Four Seasons to an Intercontinental.",4,2015,08,22
205,Very nice hotel!,Stayed here recently for four nights for business meetings.  Very nice facilities and friendly staff.  Morning hot breakfasts were delicious.  Was very convenient to transportation and to the city.  Would definitely consider staying here again.,4,2015,08,19
205,Great Experience,"We stayed here for a conference and booked in the last night of the horse show that was held just next door.  The hotel staff had to be exhausted after the busy horse show but their service to our group did not reflect it.

The room was large.  The bed was very comfortable.  The bathroom was huge, separate toilet room inside the bathroom.  Separate shower and double sinks.  Very nice lighting in the bathroom and full size hair dryer.  Also very spacious closet area and lots of hangers.  

Our room overlooked the front entrance although it was quiet.  We had a little balcony and French doors that opened.  

Ronin, the bartender in the bar off the main lobby, made excellent cocktails: cosmos, manhattans, and White Russians.  The staff who serviced our day meetings and evening cocktail reception were also very professional and attentive.  

The Dart train station was just five minutes from the hotel.  We rode it several times on our trips into The city center and out of town to Blackrock and Houth.

We greatly enjoyed out stay at the Intercontinental.  ",5,2015,08,18
205,"Lovely hotel, would go again!","Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the intercontinental hotel before an Ed Sheeran concert, everything was nicely done there, the beds were very comfy! The pool was really nice, probably the best hotel I've ever stayed in, apart from one downside, the prices. The breakfast isn't included, and even the food in the mini bar we had had to be paid for, but other than that, we had a very lovely stay!",4,2015,08,17
205,Top hotel,"Stayed here while attending a black tie event last year while it was still known as the four seasons.  Still one of dublin finest hotels. Typical four season interior , luxurious. Would love to try it again for a couple of nights to get the real experience.",5,2015,08,17
205,Very disappointed ,"Just home today after a three night stay at this hotel formly known as Four Seasons. My mum and aunt stayed here last year and loved it so much that I booked it for me and them this year again. As it was very hard to get booked in I had to settle for stay only no breakfast as the company didn't include breakfast.So also requested three single beds. We got to our room and it was two beds and one camp bed !! Only two cups supplied for three of us. Requested another cup and got it only to when they took them away after cleaning room we had to request for more cups, requested more teabags which we never got so we bought our own. I wanted to get ice in ice bucket and when I opened it there was steal milk in it and the smell was awful SO I give it to one of the staff and asked for a new bucket for ice AND yes i never got one !! Tea was 6:95 a cup per person , a sandwich was from 18:95 per person and I ordered a glass of Chardonnay  and when I went to pay for my one glass of wine I was charged 14:80 euro !!! Which I discovered later the waiter give me Chablis which IS this price AND NOT Chardonnay !! Breakfast was 30 euro a person !! So we went down to Sandymount and ate in a fantastic wee place called Browns !! Absolutely first class food. Finally wen we were checking out the guy wanted to charge us AGAIN !! Only we had our reservation printed out and with us !! So I will b double checking my bank account to make sure wer not charged Twice, I am so so dissappointed in this hotel !!! We go to Dublin every year and have been to alot of hotels and never ever experience anything like this. Thankfully my sister and her family were staying in The KClub and we went out there to spend our last day ,, and let me tell u it WAS UNBELIEVEABLE !!! Intercontinental Hotel I am so so annoyed and dissappointed with our stay , Teresa ",3,2015,08,16
205,peaceful and beautiful.,My husband and myself had one night stay here this weekend. It is a beautiful hotel. The room was spacious with a huge comfy bed. I cannot fault this hotel at all. All the staff are charming from the doorman to the guy who cleaned the ashtrays outside. Really friendly. We had a meal in the restaurant it was delicious. The pool area is very nice with a huge hot tub. Spotlessly clean. We walked into dublin and back. It takes about 35 minutes at a normal pace and is a straight road in past the American embassy and a lovely park. We got a taxi back from near the gaiety theatre and it was roughly 12 euros. Once again I cannot say anything unpleasant about this hotel it is lovely.,5,2015,08,16
205,"Nice Hotel, Needs an Update","We visited Dublin right after Easter and not too long after this hotel changed from a Four Seasons to an Intercontinental. It still has the fusty old look of a Four Seasons and is in huge need of a redecoration.  The public areas are lovely, but need some care and maintenance.  While we were there they were doing some work on the bar and I hope that indicates that they are going to be getting the rest of the hotel into shape too.  It looks like the Four Seasons had really let the place go, honestly.  Our room was good sized and had a very nice, big bathroom (probably the only part of the hotel that seemed like it didn't need to be re-done) but the bed was horrible.  The hotel might have been out of date looking, but at least it was spotlessly clean.

Our rate included breakfast which was quite nice.  They have a decent selection on a buffet and then you also have the option of ordering off the menu.  The staff there were friendly, even when we had an issue with the bill (see below).  Since the location is not the most convenient for popping out for something to eat, getting breakfast at the hotel is the best option, so I would suggest a room rate that includes breakfast is a must here.  There are some fairly convenient public transport options but otherwise you will have to walk, 15 - 20 minutes, or take a taxi to get to the heart of the city.

At the point that we visited they were having some definite changeover issues with anything involved with the computer system.  They kept trying to charge us for breakfast, even though that was included in our room rate, and it was a big hassle every morning to get it fixed.  Then on checkout they couldn't print or show us our bill at all so we had to wait for it to be sent via email.  There was still a mistake but they were very quick to handle the refund and get it straightened out.  

The staff were friendly and tried very hard to gracefully deal with the issues with the computer system.   I would probably stay here again because I have status at Intercontinental but I am hoping that they make some updates to the furnishings and the appearance of the hotel soon.",3,2015,08,12
205,A nice room.  A friendly and attentive staff.,"The room was nice; well-furnished, fairly clean, and had nice linens and towels.  We did have trouble with the shower draining. and it took two calls one day apart to get it resolved.  It had a huge mass of hair and other gunk in it.  The reason it wasn't resolved quickly because engineering did not feel it was their job to take care of, so they ignored the order placed with them (Ah, unionistic socialism!) Otherwise the stay was nice.",4,2015,08,11
205,One of the best!!!!,"I stayed in this hotel last September when it was still the Four Seasons, and I imagine it is still the same. It is one of the best hotels I have stayed in over the entire world. The staff is flawless, and the rooms are beautifully decorated and very quiet. It was off season, so we also got a a very good deal on our rooms. We got to the hotel way before check in time, and they not only cleaned our rooms so we could check in, but they also upgraded us. We will most definitely stay at this hotel again.",5,2015,08,11
205,Great Job,"No complaints here. Room was spacious and clean. All details were covered. I will say that the breakfast wasn't great. Your only options are the buffet and menu items. I'm a light breakfast person and really only need some eggs and coffee. Not a 25 euro buffet or 15 euro full plate. Coffee service in room was good. I was so happy when they were aw to bring me a curling iron because I forgot mine at home. Pool area was super relaxing and very clean. Will come back if I'm ever in Dublin again. Also, hotel is in a really nice area of the city and just a short walk away from a tram station so it is safe and easy to get to the city center. ",5,2015,08,11
205,Shocking!!!! Never again!,"I was absolutely shocked at the poor service we endured at this hotel. Firstly I was told the car park is ""first come first serve"" and ""you will have to park on the streets surrounding the hotel"" really??? This hotel is claiming to be 5 star!! 
Then the breakfast. We had a 20 min wait to be seated. Then we had a ""waitress"" literally bark instructions at us, then asked ""what do want, tea or coffee"" i understand the drinks order needs to be taken but one expects a friendly manner at least. So the hot breakfast is not hot. It's barely warm 
We when asked for toast...the cold toast arrived and was dumped on the table, no butter and no staff near to ask. We finally got butter for the cold toast and the sauce we had also asked for but it was to late we had finished out warm breakfast before it got colder. 
I felt we were ignored and the staff couldn't be bothered with us!! 

On checking out I asked if I could leave my car while we went out for the day. The reception nicely said yes of course you can and you can also leave you bags. I paid my bill and even asked is that everything included to which the receptionist said yes. 
When I returned to the hotel I had just spent over €400 euros in I handed over my parking ticket and was literarily ordered to go to the reception and pay €25. As I had asked for the parking to be included I was a little confused. At the reception I was assured that everything had already been paid. But when i returned to my car a ""gentleman"" who did not introduce himself told me whilst holding on to my keys that I had been given the wrong information at the reception. At this point I actually said that I found his manner intrusive and confrontational. I went back to the reception and paid €20 for parking. 

The girl on the reception was rude and barley looked up and when I said I was disappointed and would not stay in the hotel again ... NO. Answer. It was almost like we have your money now...we don't care! 

Needless to stay I won't stay here again nor would I recommend it. 
The shelbourne is much nicer stay there. Or better still go to wicklow the powerscourt is a fabulous hotel.",1,2015,08,10
205,"Still fab, just missing that Four Seasons extra mile we are used to, but it is now an Intercontinental..","A great stay here once again for the Dublin Horse Show, loved it, but it just isn't quite as good as it was when it was run by the Four Seasons Group. The staff are still as lovely and incredibly helpful, but the Hotel just lacked the lustre we were all used to and so you leave feeling the slightest tinge of disappointment when being charged the same prices, charge us at standard Intercontinental rates and our expectations will pitch in at that level. To explain: The breathtaking and opulent flower arrangements that used to adorn the entrance hall and reception area are no longer evident, flowers are still there but they are standard; the bathroom toiletries, no longer luxurious, again nice, but standard; the turndown service, no longer evident at all - no special Horse Show chocolates left on the bed - just one of the ""extra specials"" that the Four Seasons used to do. It just felt that every single little extra that went before has now been removed or ignored. I am sure it is a cost cutting exercise, but to me that extra mile really matters when paying for a Hotel of this nature for this event, we all know the price at least doubles for Horse Show week, so give us back that little bit more and we will thank you for it. Many guests here, at this time, frequent world class hotels on a regular basis, so even if just for this week, raise the bar. That said, our stay was still fab; the room & bathroom, clean; the beds, comfortable; the breakfast, delicious; the dinner, superb; the hospitality, warm. I will come back when next I am in Dublin.",4,2015,08,10
205,LOVED this place.,"My husband and I arrived, very sleepy, at 6:45am local time.  Check in wasn't for hours.  We thought we'd ask if we could store our luggage downstairs and check in later.  When we did, we were told that a suite was available and it was ours.  It was an ENORMOUS, beautifully appointed room, with a fabulous bathroom.  We went out sight-seeing, came back and crashed.  Everything we wanted was immediately attended to--batteries for the t.v. remote, dinner in the room, breakfast in the room the next morning, help with printing out documents--just grand.  It's not smack in the middle of everything, which was nice.  We took a quick bus ride into town, or grabbed cabs when necessary.  The staff was beyond terrific.  Would stay here again in a heartbeat.",5,2015,08,09
205,Fabulous hotel,"We stayed in a suite in this hotel during the RDS.
Room was spacious and spotlessly clean. Although the hotel was full and busy due to the show, the room was lovely and quiet.
 Staff are friendly, helpful and courteous. 
Room service was efficient and the food was hot and tasty.
We will definitely be back to our favourite hotel",5,2015,08,09
205,Lets be clear,"To start with, of course you cannot expect the same levels of service and dedication you will find in a FS... reason? It's not a FS anymore. 
The rooms, no change, same old granny looking quickly ageing bedrooms this building used to have back in 2003 when it opened. The deco of the rooms may have looked dated the day after it inaugurated... imagine 13 years later
The food experience has dropped dramatically, the service is trying to resist, but you can tell there is fear in members of staff. After talking with a few of them, nobody knows if they will have a job after the busy Horse Show week, apparently the plan is to become ""efficient""
The building has changed ownership, the service has changed management, the soul of this once well orchestrated operation has changed for good.",2,2015,08,06
205,Good - Could be Excellent,"Would not hesitate to book here again but after 4 stays would think someone would say ""Hi"".

Great Airport hotel with very comfy rooms and nice location.
Food is good and the staff try hard  - but I now expect some (minor) issue every time I book.

The Bar is very good at night.",4,2015,08,05
205,Fabulous Hotel ,"Returning visit to this lovely hotel. Pleased to report its in v good order and well kept. Pool & spa luxurious. Rooms are a beautiful as ever and stunning bathrooms. The only thing we could fault was the food which was not up to par with 5* standard. The menu is lacking in choice and the food was at best bizarre! Avoid the crab on the lounge menu which is deep fried mini crabs, legs attached with not any crab meat! Flavourless & scary to look at! The hotel lacks atmosphere also with no music at all even on horse show week! Everyone sitting around looking bored. Pity as other 5* hotels provide some kind of entertainment",5,2015,08,04
205,Beautiful room,Hotel is beautiful and so was our room and the staff was great.  Food in the restaurant was not as good as expected but that was our only complaint. It is not located in easy walking distance from downtown Dublin but there are restaurants within walking distance.,4,2015,08,01
205,End of an era,"Have stayed here regularly over the last 5 years usually in a family suite or executive suite and have always loved my stay as have the family. Was there over the new year holidays when it changed branding but noticed for the first time on our 1 week july trip the slight slide in services. The property itself is very comfortable and impressive although probably in need of a refurb in the next year and is well situated for anyone with business on the south side of dublin. Although there are no more town cars on the property which were great to whizz you in to town quickly and comfortably so a hit and miss taxi is your only option.Food menus are getting a little long in the tooth, room service is taking longer and there are now little mistakes with the orders which seems to be down to not enough staff on the service.  Staff are as friendly as ever throughout the hotel but are not happy with the new management and it shows. The gym is drastically in need of a refurb and there was generally only 1 treadmill working from three when we were there . Prices have gone up by over 20 or even 30% bringing it into direct competition with a top more centrally located hotel in the center of the city. Still a good hotel but it feels like price/ value ratio is slipping ",3,2015,08,01
205,4 Star Luxury set in leafy Dublin suburb,"Hotel is located in Ballsbridge Dublin 4.  Bars and restaurants are located approx 1 mile from the hotel and it is a 10 minute taxi ride to Dublin City Centre a bus stop located outside the hotel will also take you into city centre.   Hotel is located right beside the RDS (Royal Dublin Society) where the world famous Dublin Horse Show is held annually and this venue is also used for  many other shows/concerts throughout the year.  Rooms are large and luxurious with big marble bathroom with shower and bath beds are big and extremely comfortable with excellent bedding.

Nice wooden bar and large lobby area with lots of soft comfortable seating.  Outdoor seating is plentiful in a very relaxing environment.  Restaurant is off the lobby area and competitively priced serving good quality food with excellent service. BE SURE TO BOOK when checking in as this is a small room and is booked up quickly.  Same food is also served in the lobby area.  Good function rooms for meetings, parties etc.  Charge for parking and charge for WIFI in rooms.",4,2015,07,28
205,"Deserves 5 stars, for rooms and staff. 4 for location.","The room we stayed in had a spacious bedroom,enormous living room, walk-in closet, marble bath with shower AND tub, a small bar area, and a large-enough workspace with desk, charging stations, and decent lighting. Two TV's, two sets of working French doors for good ventilation, And QUIET.

As for the staff, need to post some mail?  No problem, we can bill it to your room.  Need to run across the street to an ATM machine? Oh, Madam, it's raining, just go to the desk where you can exchange a small amount (€100) on your room charge. Quite accommodating in a direct, non-obsequious way. 

To make up for the edge-of-town location out by all the embassies, there's an hourly shuttle in to the city center.  Decent equipment in the fitness room too.  I have not yet eaten here, except for breakfast. So can't offer an opinion.",5,2015,07,28
205,Fantastic Stay,"We loved our stay here and we found everything to be up to the usual InterContinental top notch standards. The service from check in to check out was fantastic, we were upgraded to a junior suite because of being platinum ambassador member and the room was huge and very luxurious !!  We were also impressed because we booked two rooms that they upgraded both rooms, we usually don't find this to be the case so it was much appreciated. It was a short taxi ride into central Dublin so didn't find the location a problem and we were able to walk to a great restaurant called Rolly's. When we return to Dublin after exploring Ireland we will be staying at the Westin but can't imagine how it could be any better than this great hotel !!",5,2015,07,28
205,Stayed on the same floor as Taylor Swift,On arrival the check in process was slow even for an Ambassador Member so I dreaded what other disappointments I would be in for but I must say this is a really high quality hotel with wonderful rooms and quality food.  The staff are friendly and talkative which made you feel welcomed and on my floor I had to get past some bodyguards only to find out Taylor Swift was my neighbour.  The hotel is a little away from the main centre but if you are going to order a taxi give it plenty of time as on one occasion I had to wait getting on for 20 minutes.,5,2015,07,23
205,Enjoyable Stay,"We stayed at the Intercontinental Hotel of Dublin on our first day of our Ireland trip. 
Thw hotel deserves its 5 star status. 
It's located in Ballsbridge of south Dublin, an accessible and a central area of the capital. 
The service was excellent and staff helpful. 
the food was of excellent quality. 
the hotel is clean and bright. I would stay in it again on my next cisits to Dublin",5,2015,07,19
205,Business trip,"During my recent business trip I stayed at the intercontinental in Dublin for one night only. 
I suppose nothing to complain about - clean, comfortable, with helpful and polite staff, pretty good breakfast
well earned 4 star",4,2015,07,17
205,Truly amazing hotel and staff,"I was in Dublin for business at the American Embassy, so the location of this hotel was perfect for me.  A quick walk to the embassy, and Aviva stadium and the RDS Center are close by.  My wife travelled with me, and it is a bit outside of the main shopping and tourist areas of Dublin she was interested in.  A taxi to O'Connell St/Grafton St/Trinity College was about 12-15 Euros.  Taxi to the Airport is about 30 Euros.
The hotel itself is amazing.  Truly beautiful inside and out.  My wife and I had a double room with a king bed.  The room was very large with a very nice bath, closet, and mini bar and fridge.  The room had a large TV, desk, and sitting chair.  We ate breakfast in the hotel every day, and the food and service were excellent.  The bar is open late and a nice place to unwind with drinks or dessert after a night out.
The best part of the hotel is the service.  I cannot say enough about the staff.  Everyone from the valet, housekeeping, concierge, front desk, bar and restaurant staff were amazing and first class.  They understand customer service, and went out of there way several times during our visit to help us and provide top notch service.  I highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for first class accomodations in Dublin.",5,2015,07,17
205,Intercontinental Dublin ....not on a par with the former Operator - The 4 Seasons!,"Whilst on a business trip I recently stayed at the intercontinental in Dublin, having enjoyed the 4 Seasons (same hotel - different Operator) on dozens of occasions. Some reflections to share -
Whilst some of the original staff are still there and are incredibly helpful (in particular an Irish  gentleman and lady at the check-in – whose names I can’t recall!) , the Intercontinental appears to have employed some staff who do not have the 4 seasons customer service mentality. (for example the lady at the concierge was quite gruff when tasked with a simple request.)
In general, there appears to be a lot more employees whose attitude and command of the English language is below par.
Conclusion: Worth visiting, but do not expect 4 Seasons quality.",3,2015,07,12
205,Birthday Trip,"We stayed in a lovely suite and was welcomed by a lovely host who was extremely helpful 

The food is great and my partner was always in the whiskey lounge lol 

The pool and spa area are first class and the staff make you feel so very welcome 

If you want a wander down to other restaurants just come out of the main entrance turn left then left again and after 10 minutes you are in restaurant and pub heaven 

Oh and the beds are sooooooo comfortable ;0)",5,2015,07,10
205,Nice ! Real nice !,"This was our first stay since the departure of the Four Seasons and arrival of the Intercontinental hotel group , no big changes here , so if you loved the old group don't see any reason not to love the new arrival , the staff are vibrant, helpful , polite, and from all nations , they were all helpful to above the call of duty , rooms and bed really nice with some choclate s on arrival , bed super comfortable , had a few drinks in the bar which was probably the most relaxing place in town or at least that's how it felt , I was really sorry to see the old group leave but having sampled the new I don't think fans need worry , it's a beautiful building , with some lovely touches , great location and great staff , can't wait to go back.",5,2015,07,07
205,stay at four seasons,"the hotel was wonderful. staff were very helpful and friendly. rooms very spacious and airy. the food here is a small bit on the dear side but you get what you pay for and it was absolutly delicious. the seafood chowder was the nicest ive ever tasted.
      
      ",5,2015,07,07
205,"Fine City Hotel, shame about the barman","As a Platinum Ambassador member, I sta in a lot of Intercontinental Hotels around the world and this property is certainly up to standard. I booked 3 Executive Suites for Family and Friends to attend a concert this evening and really enjoyed the rooms and the service throughout the hotel. One lady who stood out was Isobelle who served us all in the late bar and was excellent, kind and attentive and made the visit very pleasant.  However my wife unfortunatly had a bad experience which soured the evening.  She ordered a drink in the Bar Lounge which came out to us and looked rather small so she questioned if the measures were correct, very politely I might add.. The waitress said she would check with the barman David and sort it out, my wife was very shocked when the barman came over with a very aggressive attitude and started arguing with her about the measure rather than providing a polite explanation, he argued and argued and then took away the drink, sent over another and amended the bill to add the extra measure he had put in.... My wife was quite shaken to be treated like that, which was unfortunate as we had up to that point had such a pleasant stay.... However this incident aside, we will certainly be booking in at this hotel again when in Dublin City for future events, we normally stay at the Shelbourne but this property has such a better setting especially with the outdoor courtyard seating area which is a real winner for us.",4,2015,07,02
205,Loved the Dublin Four Seasons,"We stayed here in November 2014, we stayed the week of Thanksgiving. We enjoyed it. The hotel staff was very friendly and attentive. We were upgraded to a beautiful suite which worked perfectly with space. We had plenty of room.

The spa was lovely and the pool was great since it was cold and it being indoors my two boys were able to still enjoy themselves. 

The hotel restaurant was great. My boys fell asleep the first night there while we were waiting for our food, they were jet lagged, and the waiter told us that if they were to wake up that he would make sure their food was delivered at no charge fresh. I thought that was a lovely touch and very heart warming. My boys ended up waking up a little later and was still able to eat dinner at no extra cost to us.

Thanks!",5,2015,07,01
205,Fantastic Hotel,"Stayed for one night with my wife while we were up shopping. An absolutely fantastic hotel, staff are great and can't do enough for you. Only wish I had booked in for longer. Rooms are clean and comfortable. Beautiful breakfast and breakfast room. Looking forward to getting back there again. ",5,2015,07,01
205,Superb Accommodation ,"Have just spent 7 days in this wonderful hotel. 
Everything is presented with the style and class befitting a 5 star establishment. 
The staff are friendly and helpful - nothing is too much trouble. 
The restaurants and bars are first class. 
This hotel has just been rebranded ( it used to be the Four Seasons ) and it is to be hoped that the new owners don't change anything that gives this hotel its exceptional character ",5,2015,06,28
205,Back again,"As a frequent visitor to Dublin hotels ,this was my first visit since this 4 seasons hotel was taken over by InterContinental . Well as I expected very little has changed ,and what has ,really has improved .Rooms are 5star.Service as expected 5star. Very very convienentto city. Not much car parking. Bars are excellent and staff are the highest quality in Ireland or anywhere actually. Lovely are to walk around ,very near embassy belt. Security is a plus around D4.  You really feel safe in this part of city. Short walk to Ballsbridge ,alot of bars. None worth a visit. Head up to Merrion Inn. But really you should never want to leave this hotel. Its just so relaxing. Staff are the stars. If your an American visitor ,you are staying in one of the best hotels in Ireland ,in the best area in Dublin. And all guests are treated like stars. Sure its a little pricey. But the best things in life are. Stay here ,you will come back. Well done staff of Intercontinental D4. ",5,2015,06,27
205,Excellent hotel with superb staff,"A great weekend in a fab city the hotel staff couldn't have done more to help.
Ronan on the bar makes the best Gin Fizz i have tasted anywhere in the world & the food is excellent, the concierge is great and the hotel is clen and rooms are superb.
We will be going back again with friends.",5,2015,06,24
205,What an elegant hotel,"We went to the Intercontinental Hotel Dublin for a long weekend.  Always wanted to see Dublin, and the train station just five minutes walk from the hotel was a great way to get to the city centre and to the lovely quaint seaside towns up and down Dublin's east coast.

The hotel was elegant and grand.  The staff were attentive/professional and made us feel individual. The room was fabulous as was the bathroom.  Great quiet air conditioning (always a requirement for me) and a very comfortable bed. There food was DELICIOUS and we ate there every night of our three night stay. The reception staff and concierge were very very helpful and friendly.  

The only reason we didnt give excellent is because the only bar that was open in the hotel on the Saturday evening was so loud you couldnt hear yourself think. There needs to be a larger bar area as it seems to be too small for the number of customers the hotel can accommodate. The restaurant had the same problem. We had to wait 20 minutes for a table, and this was right beside the noisy bar. But this was only on the Saturday, the Friday and Sunday were fine.",4,2015,06,22
205,Very good,"Overall, a very good experience staying in the Intercontinental.  Rooms were spacious and clean; breakfast excellent although slightly limited on one morning when main room was full and the hotel set up buffet breakfast in a side room - service quite slow. Service in bar generally very good, but very slow when the bar was busy. Location excellent so long as you don't wish to be in city centre.  Disappointed to note that hotel no longer provides a courtesy lift into centre of town, which we had used on a previous occasion.",4,2015,06,20
205,Luxury hotel in every way,"The service is impeccable.  The rooms are extremely well appointed.  The breakfast buffet is really excellent.  And the concierges are most informative (and see below).

I would like to single out one of the receptionists for particular mention.  Oliver Feeney was exceptionally helpful, going beyond the call of duty to sort out a problem.

I would also like to mention that the concierges have a most excellent written description of the best route from the hotel to Dublin airport.  Your GPS will get you there … eventually.  Their route will get you there quickly.",5,2015,06,20
205,Nice spa.... Shame about the restaurant ,"The spa was unreal ! The staff couldn't have been any nicer and the treatments were amazing. Bit disappointed by the pool but the robes and everything else made up for it. However, the 4* is purely for the spa. The staff in the restaurant were rude- especially the lady. She walked past us 3 times and said nothing- obviously knowing we were standing waiting to be seated. However the men waiters were extra polite and made up for the incredibly rude lady. Would deffo come back!! Especially to spa x",4,2015,06,17
205,Average for the money!,"We recently had an afternoon lunch at this hotel. Formerly The Four Seasons the standard of service has dropped since the takeover with fewer staff servicing the bar and also the Four Seasons Group obviously took their furniture with them! as the silver covered chairs and tatty menus are far from five star. The food was good but it is outrageously priced so it has not got the wow factor..Michelin star prices but not the standard. Standards in the ladies toilets have dropped considerably and the overall vibe is mush ado about nothing a four star standard at best with five star prices. The hotel should be thankful for their hardworking friendly staff and it needs to put structures and management in place to support their good work.
Derek and Deirdre",3,2015,06,16
205,Very pleasant stay in Dublin,"Would not hesitate to stay at this property in the future. Old Four Seasons location, central and great neighborhood for coffee and walks. Close to football stadium and beach. Large, nicely appointed rooms.",4,2015,06,14
205,Quiet Oasis,"Previously a Four Seasons property, the reception areas and rooms are large, quiet and welcoming. For us it was a weekend after business travel to multiple cities and a needed oasis. It is a cab ride downtown but in Dublin not an issue.",5,2015,06,14
205,"Good Hotel, Cold Hospitality!","Although the property is nice, the Staff does not make you feel welcome.
The Concierge was most of the time missing and when available was not the least helpful. 
It seems that the Concierge lacks knowledge when asked for suggestions regarding places/  Restaurants to visit be it for assistance in even a small thing such as giving info on Local bus services.

Very Dissapointing !",3,2015,06,13
205,Awesome and Grand in every sense,"Book it if you can. Marvellous building and service, close to most amenities. 
Shoe polishing service overnight was a real bonus and the breakfast cannot be faulted.

I really enjoyed the old world charm with the central location and warm hospitality.

I would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,06,10
205,Excellent settings,Stayed one night at a function.  Room was  nice.  Good size and clean. However it was a the back of the building overlooking the RDS. Public area we excellent. However. It was not quite a full bar. No budweiser on draft.,4,2015,06,10
205,Lovely Hotel,"Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the InterContinental.  Room was very spacious and immaculately clean.  Extremely comfortable bed, bright, airy room and very quiet.  Could not hear noise in hall or outside hotel!  Great hotel  located on the outskirts of Dublin.  Hotel is not located within walking distance of downtown Dublin but there are several cafes within a 10 walk.  Good choice and would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,06,08
205,Not the same as when it was a Four Seasons,"A modern style hotel with lovely lounge and bar areas.  Standard room had one of the most comfortable beds we've ever slept in and had a really nice bathroom, almost on par with the Shelbourne.  Rest of the room, while a great size is fairly ordinary and the photos are a really fair reflection.  Lovely, traditional and proper turn down service.  Missing the touches and finesse of some better hotels, just doesn't feel as special.  Be careful of the extras, they don't advise on car parking or breakfast charges as neither are standard and high speed wifi comes at a charge (really!!!??) Was still lovely and while a bit out of the way of the city centre there are some nice bars and restaurants a short walk away.",4,2015,06,07
205,Superb,"Stayed here on business. I am a fan of the IHG  hotels so pleased to hear this place had been booked for me.   This one is top drawer. I was particularly delighted with the service.  You expect gold standard from 5* hotels but the attention to detail and friendliness of the staff throught the operation was excellent. 
The double room I was allocated on the 3rd floor was a very good size. Bed extremely comfortable.  The television/info system was a bit fiddly and unpredictable but that was probably down to the remote/sensor on the Samsung. 
Conference food was excellent. Bar prices not too steep.  
The hotel is in Ballbridge, around 30mins walk/10 mins bus from the centre.  Possibly a little far out to use as a  long term base for visiting the city but excellent as a business hotel.   

Just a quick hint, the 702 bus from the airport stops just outside the hotel and is much cheaper than a taxi!",5,2015,06,06
205,Ireland's Best Hotel 3 Ways,"1. We had the distinct pleasure of staying at the Intercontinental for four nights in late May. Although arriving at the property while ill, the attention of the staff to my situation was without parallel in all my years of travel.  A call to the concierge had a physician in my room 30 min. and medication delivered shortly after the physician's prescription.  
2. In addition to an exceptional staff, this property has an ideal location in the best of Dublin real estate (Ballsbridge), quiet, safe and aesthetically pleasing to walk.  A short one and a half blocks has you on the DART commuter moments from the center of Dublin without any of the hassles. We spent a day on the Dart travelling from one end of the route (Graystones) walking the beach in Killiney (no sign of Bono) through the city to the other of the seaside route and back, lunch at Finnagin's Pub in Dalkey and hiking at Howth (where they play football golf and the cup is nearly 2 feet in diameter!).  All day for about under $10 euro per ticket.
3. The room was large, fresh and comfortable with one of the most ideally arranged bathrooms of any hotel where I have stayed. 
Should fortune find me again in Dublin this is the only hotel that we would book. 
The concierge arranged for a private car and driver so that we could tour the Irish National Stud and points between.  The high point of 12 days in Ireland for the family equestrian.",5,2015,06,04
205,Possibly my new favourite???,"Having never stayed at this hotel before, I have stayed twice in a few months. My husband and I went earlier in the year for his birthday and I took my mum to stay a few months later. 

It is slightly out of town however the hotel has an excellent private car service which allows you to travel into town in a premium vehicle for in or around the cost of a taxi.

Part of the appeal of the hotel is its' size which is achieved by being slightly removed from the city centre. 

It is luxurious and 5* without being too posey. You feel comfortable when you are there. By contrast, whilst we were staying at the Intercontinental, we had a drink in the Shelbourne in town. It was rammed. I wouldn't like to have paid out to stay in a 5* hotel only to struggle to be served at the bar. 

On one of my stays we were given a free upgrade upon checking in. 

I have to say it is by far the best breakfast I have had in any Dublin hotel. I personally don't really like a hot buffet breakfast and the Intercontinental gives you the choice of having it served to you or to select from the hot buffet. The continental breakfast is excellent also.",5,2015,06,04
205,Resting break,"We stayed day for 3 nights. The rooms were big enough to have a comfortable extra bed with still plenty of space. We had the breakfast included in our rates and was delicious. Pancakes, eggs benedict ... The hotel has a wonderful atmosphere, with nice gardens, resting sofas.",5,2015,06,03
205,6-star,"I am IHG Platinum and was so pleased when I heard IHG purchased the Four Seasons.  Our stay could not have been better.  The common areas are beautiful as is the surrounding area.  The furniture may seem dated to some but I would probably simply refer to it as classic.  We had two rooms and when I checked into our room, I was very pleased by the furnishings and the bathroom but  disappointed by the lack of view.  Shortly after calling downstairs to express my dissatisfaction, I went to our daughters' room and discovered our other room had been upgraded to a beautiful and very large suite.  We all got a good laugh when the manager called and said he understood we were disappointed by our room.  (Thanks Rory for the upgrade and allowing us to keep the suite an extra night.)  Food in the main dining room was priced a little high (especially breakfast) but on our last night we discovered that food was served in the main lobby.  Dinner there was delicious and the staff very friendly.  It was also fairly priced and I wished we had discovered it earlier.  The beds were extremely comfortable.  Thanks for a great stay!  P.S.  We let our daughters keep the suite.  Afternoon tea and scones from room service at the dining table in their very own suite was a highlight.",5,2015,06,03
205,Better than expected!,"My wife and I recently stayed here for three nights on our honeymoon and it was better than advertised.
Although our honeymoon was pretty budget-conscious and fairly no frills. We wanted to stay at a higher-end hotel to kick the trip off. Like it was intended to be a honeymoon.
The grounds and rooms were immaculate and clean, the hotel staff were friendly and helpful and the food (breakfast) was fantastic.
This feels like a very high-end hotel from the moment you step in the front doors and is very impressive overall.
We mentioned to the Front Desk agent Laosia (sp?) we had come in for our Honeymoon and they upgraded us to a fantastic executive room and brought up a plate of chocolates for the two of us.
Little things always go the extra mile.
We loved our stay and it was worth every penny.
They only downside I would say, is that it is slightly outside of the downtown core. My wife and I love to walk through cities so it wasn't an issue for us. However for others looking for a more central hotel. The 8km round-trip walk to Temple and back may be difficult.",5,2015,06,01
205,Luxurious Break,"I went to the Intercontinental for a three night break with my sister and 86yr old mother for her birthday treat. We had a taxi from the airport but there is a bus which stops just outside the hotel if you wish. We were upgraded to a Junior Suit on checking in and were very pleased with it. Large room with a separate dressing room and beautiful bathroom. The room was only equipped for two persons but a phone call to reception resulted in all items being speedily delivered. The breakfast was plentiful and various and served in a pleasant room. The pool and jacuzzi was very restful and as we went after my mother retired in the evening we had it almost to ourselves. The staff were all very helpful and nothing too much trouble. Not far from the hotel there is a train station where you can travel to the many coastal towns in a very short time.We went to Dalkey a lovely village with a small castle and views of the ocean and Dalkey island where you can catch a boat to visit. We also visited Howth which is at the end of the line a large town with a harbour,many fish restaurants and quaint shops.  
An open top bus will take you on a hop on and off tour of Dublins many attractions and includes some entry tickets.",5,2015,05,31
205,What a fab place!,"Stayed here lastnight and couldn't get on quick enough to write a review. The rooms were beautiful, comfortable and spacious, all rooms have a smart TV. The staff are a credit to the hotel. The spa and pool area is warm and tranquil...and the cocktails are worth the price ;) it was a pity the ice bar was closed but the friendly barman in the whiskey bar made up for that. Would stay again. Just be wary that an additional €100 to the price of the room is taken deposit and obviously refunded on checkout...",5,2015,05,31
205,Great stay here!,"Had a lovely 5 night stay here with a very large group. Staff was attentive and friendly. Our room was plenty large enough and definitely comfortable, although if I were to come back I certainly would make sure I had a different location in the hotel. We did attempt to have the room changed but the hotel was full, likely in part to our large group.  Our 2nd floor room overlooked the garbage dumpsters and stables, definitely not a nice view of anything. 
Although not that close to downtown still an easy walk to nearby coffee shops and pubs. I enjoyed my early morning walks around the neighbourhood. There was never a long wait for a car service when we ventured out on our own. With our group we had constant buses serving our needs. All in all, a great stay and I'd love to come back again.",4,2015,05,31
205,Not what is once was,"I was a frequent visitor to the former four seasons and got a bit of a surprise when I discovered it had changed hands as I went to book this visit.
Stayed in a suite and the room was fine, a beautiful room in fact but the sole of the place has gone. 
It's the little extras that made this place what it was and those little things have left with the Four Seasons name.
It's not any cheaper to stay than before but it does seem a lot cheaper. The little touches are gone and the clientele has definitely changed. It was packed with children running wildly around and the general demeanour of some of the guests was a tone lower than previous years.
It's definitely not a who's who kind of place but a free for all. The quite intimacy of the bar and lobby are no more. It's crammed with seating and tables and the service has also declined. They are trying but its unrecognisable from its previous identity.
Sadly, I will have to discover another bolt hole, as this was my favourite I'm not pleased but I won't be back. Food has also suffered a turn for the worst.
My little oasis is no more.
There's nothing very wrong with it but if you were a former guest here you will be very disappointed. 
",3,2015,05,31
205,"Lovely property, attentive staff","Former 4 Seasons. Lovely property with attentive staff and lots of amenities. Not near town center or within walking distance to much if anything, but staff will go above and beyond to accommodate your requests i.e. car service, recommendations, etc. Would definitely stay again.",4,2015,05,28
205,Great place to stay,"Stayed in the Intercontinental this week, 1st time since they took over. Decor changed in the lobby and matches the marble better than before. Very attentive and friendly staff. Had a lovely chilled bottle of Chablis and a giant portion of cheese for one which easily was enough for two. Room was very comfortable. Really enjoyed the stay in this great location",5,2015,05,27
205,Suite and pool was the higlights for the kids,"Our family for a few days short visit was the overall very good. Our children waited eagerly for access to swim in the morning before breakfast, so I was expecting myself. Brilliant moments by the pool.
If you could use some improvement, it would be breakfast pricing simplifying the our family felt that we were under surveillance all the time during breakfast.",5,2015,05,27
205,"Great stay, lovely hotel","From the moment I walked through the door it was clear this place was totally geared up to delivering a quality experience.  The front desk staff were helpful and efficient; whilst the bar and restaurant teams were attentive without being overwhelming .

Lunchtime food was great value and delicious. 

Rooms are spacious, light, and well appointed with incredibly comfortable beds.  Slept very well and was sad to check out!",5,2015,05,26
205,It exceeds all expectations,"We had an overnight stay last week, and we're very impressed. We arrived. I'd morning, and they did everything they could to get a room ready for us. We were going to an afternoon function and needed to change. Lunch was delicious, as was breakfast. The staff are all charming. The bedroom was roomy, with a lovely big bathroom. The lounges really light and airy. Great place to stay, and just 10 mins from the centre.",5,2015,05,26
205,Not Acceptable Given the Price,"I chose this hotel on points as it was too expensive to be worth booking normally. Must say what a let down. As a young couple we were pretty much ignored in favour of more 'important looking' customers, so pretty much either got fobbed off or looked at like we didn't belong and shouldn't ask questions by the staff. Furthermore we also weren't told that breakfast wasn't included- but asked to have a seat and help ourselves to the buffet on arrival- which meant I inadvertently spent the sizeable price they charge for the buffet. 

Rooms are nice (nothing special) but the beds are amazing. That said its nothing you wouldn't get elsewhere and given its a bit out in sticks and with the price they charge for everything else- I'd say book elsewhere. You could have better location, service, amenities and ultimately save yourself a lot of money. You pay more for a wow factor- this certainly doesn't have it.",1,2015,05,26
205,Still waiting for the screaming children to get to sleep,"This is definitely not a family friendly hotel! Was just turned away from a pre-paid reservation for a King Junior suite and sent to a hotel two miles farther from the city centre to a small room with two double beds, for me and three children.  Would definitely not recommend booking here if you intend to bring children on your holiday to Ireland.",1,2015,05,24
205,A bit more of everything!,"Normally the price tag is a bit higher than what I normally choose, however since most everything was booked, I ended here by coincidence and all though this is not cheap, you get a bit more of everything: The room was larger, the food was better and indeed the staff was a bit more on their toes to ensure a nice stay.",5,2015,05,24
205,Beautiful hotel,"I recently stayed in this lovely hotel for a nights visiting friends in dublin. 
It is a beautiful hotel, lovely big rooms, lovely big bathrooms. Very comfortable bed and quiet too, far quieter than other dublin hotels. 
The staff were welcoming and friendly at all times. 
My only gripe was the fact that they charge you 15€ for parking. The room is already pricy enough so charging for parking is a little much. 
But I would stay again, it is a lovely place to stay. ",5,2015,05,23
205,Glad we didn't change hotels.,"When I booked our stay the hotel was a Four Seasons.  We didn't know it had changed hands until I tried to verify our reservation a week before our trip.  They could not find our reservation, but we eventually got it worked out and they agreed to honor our original reserved room and rate. We almost rebooked at a different hotel but are glad we did not.
The hotel staff was great, and the room was clean and very comfortable.
This hotel is also very close to the DART station and we had an easy time getting around Dublin.
I would definitely stay here again when visiting Dublin.",5,2015,05,18
205,Supercomfortable with some strange inconveniences,"Great room, restaurant, overall service, nice design, great swimming pool area, free wifi
2 disappointments:
 - food ordered to the room - low quality, old cheap bread. I have just called them and asked to change it to good breads/rolls they serve in the resstaurant and I couldn t believe that they refused and asked if I want to order more food instead, That one little but annoying thing spoils the whole luxorious exerience
 - swmming pool closing at 9.30, would be great to be able to stay there longer - especially that noone seems to be involved in it, and most of guests have time after 9 pm and early mornings",3,2015,05,14
205,Very accommodating,"We arrived in Dublin very early in the morning. We drove to hotel not at all expecting to receive our room that early. We were told none were available as it was before 8am. We decided to have a breakfast while we waited.  Service was very good, food was excellent, no complaints. I discovered very quickly that  the lack of sleep from our night time flight had caught up to me. My husband went to the front desk asking if anything had become available as I needed a nap. The staff bent over backwards to get a vacant room ready for us. And I cannot thank them enough. Room is roomy, cheerful and bed was comfortable. After a quick 4 hour nap and a shower I was ready to see Dublin.",5,2015,05,13
205,Lovely hotel,"We have just returned from a weekend in Dublin staying at the intercontinental hotel and it was everything we had hoped for and more. The hotel is spacious, elegant and light. All the staff were welcoming mad friendly. Our rooms were sumptuous. Enormous bed, thick carpet, beautiful bathroom
And so so quiet. We took a trip to the spa and had some treatments and this really added to an already fabulous trip. Kerry,my facial therapist was friendly, approachable and so professional. She made me feel like a million dollars. The spa is clean, well designed with separate male and female steam rooms and saunas.
We had lunch and evening cocktails in the main lobby lounge and bar. I think our only slight disappointment was that the infamous Icebar was not open at all during our trip- shame as it is a lovely addition to the hotel. 
I would definitely recommend staying in this hotel whether you are on a mini break or for work. It's super relaxing and we will definitely be back. ",5,2015,05,12
205,Beautiful!,"Had a weekend away with my partner and he booked this hotel and I honestly couldn't have wished for better! All the staff were great and bent over backwards to make sure we enjoyed our stay. The junior suite we stayed in was huge and the bed was so comfy! The bedroom/bathroom were so clean which made for an even more enjoyable stay! The bar staff were brilliant and even made me a cocktail which wasn't on the menu which was a nice touch :) Reception staff were fantastic as they checked us in even though we were a few hours early and it wasn't a problem at all. The only bad part of our stay was leaving as it felt like home from home! If you are in Dublin, I would recommend this hotel highly, we will certainly be back in the not too distant future!",5,2015,05,09
205,Beautiful,Very nice hotel.   The staff is great.  Always ready to help... Rooms are really comfy.  Food was really good.  We have had an amazing time here.  Thank you to everyone here.  I didn't get to use the spa but my friends did an they loved it.  When you are in town an need a van remember to tell them the old 4 seasons hotel.  Lol.  Some of them don't know the new name. This is a must stay place ,5,2015,05,07
205,A really nice place,Staff was really great - bar was nice - lobby was lovely! Room was comfortable - our bed sort of dipped on one side but it didn't bother me - great soaking tub for baths. We did not eat there just had a couple of drinks in the bar. Great thing is the location is sort of off the beaten path but not too far away - so we were able to walk to restaurants with no issue ,5,2015,05,06
205,good hotel,"Stayed at the intercontinental Dublin.  All the staff there were welcoming and friendly and the service was great.  Apparently, there is a pool at the hotel, but I never found out how to get to it, as there were no signs at all.  As I was staying on the first floor I would rather have used the stairs rather than the lift all the time I never found them either.  The room was massive and there were TWO queen size beds in the room.  My only gripe about the room is that I was surprised that there was not a trouser press.  In the room safe, there was a notice and I quote this safe is not to be used to store valuables, if you want to store valuables to contact reception.  I might have missed something, but I thought that the object of a room safe WAS to store valuables etc.  

As has been put in other reviews the hotel is a bit of a way outside the town centre so if you need to get to town you either have to use taxis and buses or walk.",4,2015,05,06
205,"Another really enjoyable stay,pity about car park charge","Just returned from a second weekend break at the Intercontinental Hotel,another fabulous stay.every element to such a high standard,from the reception staff who make you so welcome,to the waiting and cleaning staff who are always helpful and work with a smile on their faces. We stayed in a superior king room and old not have asked for better, room and bathroom spacious with such a comfortable bed.very minor complaint was only one complementary bottle of water.although given a second bottle hen we asked. Breakfasts are superb,with again nothing a problem or the staff. Only significant complaint is the 15 euro daily car park charge.",5,2015,04,28
205,Great stay - girls weekend away!,"Me and 2 of my girlfriends got an amazing deal and stayed here for 3 nights and had a lovely time! 

The hotel and our room was amazing! We couldn't get over how lovely the bathroom was with a huge bath and shower. We also had dressing gowns in the room which were changed as well as the towels and bedding. There is also a large TV and DVD player in the room as well as tea and coffee making facilities.

The spa was also lovely which had a big jacuzzi, swimming pool, sauna and steam room which we made full use of. 

The only thing we would say is there are no details of the hotels facilities or restaurants in the room but apparently these details are available on the TV. We did have lunch in the hotel on one of our days which was very good.

It's quite easy to get into the city and the airport, we got cabs mostly. 

Overall we had a fantastic stay and would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,04,27
205,Wonderful Stay - Richard (Front Office) Exceptional,"First of all what a beautiful hotel inside and out! 

We were greeted by Richard on the front desk who honestly could not have been more helpful. He is an absolute asset to your hotel. He provided us with all the relevant information, history of the hotel, local area knowledge...I could go on. 
He really went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and was one of the highlights of our trip. I work in a hotel myself and would be thrilled to have someone like Richard on the desk. You can tell he enjoys his job which was lovely to see. 

The room was beautful and spacious, the bed was super comfy. 

We had drinks from room service which arrived quickly by a very polite waiter (I want to say his name was Issac but im not 100% sure!!) 

All in all a great hotel and without question we will be back!",5,2015,04,27
205,Lovely hotel,"Stayed here on a fast business overnight recently. Staff at check in were lovely and although our rooms weren't  ready they stored our bags and we were able to head out to a meeting. 

The hotel was spotless and very relaxed feeling around it. Nobody rushing as such.
When we returned our bags were already in our rooms. The room itself is large with lots of storage, a large flat screen tv, lovely range of tea and coffees and a fully stocked mini bar which unfortunately I didn't have time to sample. 

The bathroom and shower are all marble and so lovely and elegant with nice complimentary toiletries. The bath itself was so deep and relaxing I wish I had more time to enjoy it. The bed is probably one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. I want one. 

We ate in the hotel that evening and although the food was ok I wouldn't say it was befitting of the hotel star rating..breakfast was a bit disjointed. We were seated but it seemed all self service after that.. I had to ask for butter for the toast and then for coffee and then for milk. The waiter seemed slightly peeved to be asked this as he was obviously so busy cleaning another table. I ended up having a croissant and coffee and then leaving which seemed a shame as I usually like having my hotel breakfast. 

Aside from the breakfast this is a lovely hotel

Location is quite leafy suburb, right beside the RDS arena and minutes from the Aviva stadium which was perfect for us. 

All in all yes I would return. ",4,2015,04,23
205,weekend in dublin,"Stayed in this hotel for a weekend away with the girlfriend, had a very enjoyable stay in athe junior suite. Very helpful and pleasent staff, lovely spa area, and very accomadating to any needs. there are a few comments in reviews on the cost of there breakfasts, on my first stay i had the breakfast delivered to our room, have to say it is extremely dear for a breakfast but on the other hand im glad i didnt miss it, very nice. on the whole if your considering this hotel, go for it.",5,2015,04,18
205,Great choice,"I recently spent a week in Dublin and had the distinction of staying at three hotels - don't ask why.  This was by far the best and most comfortable.  

Hotel is well kept and maintained. Rooms are spacious and the bed was very comfortable. Bathroom was clean and large. The gym is excellent with a great selection of equipment and a steam room and sauna. 

Food was tasty and a good variety on the menu including room service. Staff was very friendly and welcoming at the front desk, gym/spa area and  overall. 

The area around it is green and safe. Only draw back is it is far from the excitement of Temple Bar District. Some may not see that as a draw back :) 

It would be high on my list next time. ",4,2015,04,14
205,Nice property,"Hotel was booked for us as part of a 6 day tour - and was our first night in Ireland after 12 hours of travel - delayed, cancelled and changed flights. We arrived later than planned and stayed one night - so didn't get to spend much time there. Room was nicely appointed and comfortable. We did do some walking around the area - historic neighborhood with beautiful architecture all around. We found some casual dinner options up the road that were nice - so didn't dine at the hotel. Disappointed that we had to pay to park our rental car. ",4,2015,04,13
205,Lovely hotel! Fantastic staff!,"I stayed here recently for a girls weekend. The hotel was fantastic! Looks amazing, great location and the staff were fantastic! 

We didn't use the restaurants or bar but we did order room service, which was delicious! The man who delivered the food was so friendly and professional (sorry, didn't get the name). The concierge were all amazing! So helpful, friendly and knowledgable of the best places to go and how to get there. Mary Susan on Reception checked us in and was lovely and answered all our questions.

The room was really big! The most comfortable bed I have ever slept in!! And a beautiful bathroom! Clean and refreshed with towels every morning. 

All in all, it was a really good stay in the hotel! I would definitely recommend. Easy access to the centre, airport and a few local bars and restaurants close by. 

Loved it!! Thank you for a great stay.",5,2015,04,13
205,Relaxing weekend,"Stayed here in November 2014 (when it was still the four seasons) and am only now getting around to reviewing it! This was luxury from start to finish, with well appointed facilities all round including the spa/ pool area. The staff were very pleasant, helpful and attentive. Breakfast was very good. Looking forward to my next visit!",5,2015,04,13
205,Great stay & great staff,"We stayed here on business/pleasure and can honestly say its a lovely hotel. We went with the room tips on here and opted for the 4th Floor King with a view and it was lovely - room 424 even has a sea view if you really look for it. The staff were faultlessly courteous throughout our stay and always willing to help or advise. The room was very comfortable and space certainly wasnt an issue - its decorated in an older style but everything was perfectly nice. The bed was made in the morning and in the afternoon if you'd managed to untidy it in between. The spa that comes as part of the hotel package is very nice with a lovely large jacuzzi and steam and sauna provided within the changing rooms. There were many treatments available but we didnt really have the time to enjoy them. 
A taxi into the centre is €10 or apparently the bus is €3-4. This hotel is well worth the money and you won't be disappointed.",5,2015,04,13
205,"Fab hotel not too far out of the city, would love to stay again!","We chose this hotel for a 3 day mini-break and found it lovely! First impression, very elegant and modern. My husband had contacted the hotel prior to our stay as it was for my 40th birthday, not sure if we were upgraded or not, as there was no mention of it on arrival. Booked a double superior and stayed in room 305 which was lovely either way and good size. Bathroom immaculately clean, and complimentary toiletries, I chose to use as they were lovely, we also got complimentary water, tea, coffee each every day....mini bar as expected silly prices. The lifts we found unusual as you needed to insert your room card into slot to access floor..this might have been useful to be told at check in or a note in the lift? The only other fault, although not major was there was no hotel info or surrounding info in the room eg spa opening times, restaurant times etc..although they did bring up menus when requested for the restaurant. We only ate in the hotel at breakfast and it was ABSOLUTLY GORGEOUS! The portions are HUGE..we had the salmon with bagel, blueberry pancakes with ricotta and lemon with maple syrup..heaven! Along with the usual fruit salad, bread rolls etc..Good range of gluten free choices. It was very busy as there was a rugby match on one of the nights we were there so was difficult finding a seat in the bar area, however, the bar assistant was very helpful, we chose to take a comfy seat on the sofas located in the lobby area, and our drinks were served there, within 5 mns a table had become available and reserved for us. We opted to purchase a leap card from the airport spar shop 19.50 Euros for 72 hours unlimited travel on city buses, trams & trains, but we also used it for the air link bus which we waited 2 mns for and were in the city centre about 25 mns later, we popped into the tourist info shop and a lady directed us to the bus stop on Nassau St and also wrote bus numbers down (4,7,8) approx. every 10mns...stop closest to hotel is the British Embassy...would rec the Bewley Hotel opposite for  evening meals in bar and brassiere. The hotel were kind enough to extend our check out time to 3pm, which was great, as this allowed us to have a swim and use the Jacuzzi in the spa then go and get showered etc in our room, before our flight..the saunas are in the male & female changing areas, which was unusual, I didn't bother with that as would usually spend that time as a couple..but the pool was nice and jacuzzi very big, so we didn't feel intrusive if others were in. The facilities were very good, refreshments/towels/robes and also a relaxing area again within changing area, lovely relaxing music playing as soon as we stepped out of the lift. Gym looked a good size, although we didn't use it. Bed was very comfy, big tv although we didn't even switch it on! Would definitely return to this hotel.",5,2015,04,12
205,A nice hotel- rooms needed to be updated- l,"Stayed for night with family- furniture in room was well worn - shower handle power was poor - scant complementary items except for 1 bottle of still eater between 3 - 

Dinner was in the lobby - chicken was luke warm- when asked how was the meal - said nothing was I felt the waiter was just going through the motions- 

There did not appear to be a bar area

However the breakfast was excellent particularly the museli homemade- although my daughter did complain on the lack of real choice in cereals

For a 5 star hotel under its new ownership it needs to step up a gear or lose one of its stars",3,2015,04,11
205,"Large, well equipped room, friendly staff and fabulous breakfast","We really enjoyed our recent stay at the Intercontinental Hotel, Ballsbridge, Dublin. The hotel recently changed from the Four Seasons to the Intercontinental chain of hotels. Outside the front door, we were greeted with five silver BMW chauffeur-driven cars, available for guests transport. We were checked in at reception without any fuss and informed out room was ready with the pre-ordered cot bed for our baby. Our toddler really enjoyed the long carpeted hallways down to the first floor room. 
The room itself was large, bright and airy. We had a view to the front of the hotel. The cot-bed was large and ensured our baby had a good night's sleep. The hotel even provided some nappies, baby powder, etc. complementary. As it was an anniversary stay for us, the hotel had left some chocolates and decorative raspberries on a slate plate. They even left a plate with a large cookie, jellies, and orange drink for our son. Nice touch! The bedroom had a large comfortable bed and we had a great sleep during our two-night stay.
The good-sized bathroom was marble tiled with a small bath and shower. the toilet was through a separate door off the bathroom.
We had dinner in the restaurant on the first evening. The food was good but nothing special. I had lamb, which was average, however it was accompanied by an excellent fresh mint sauce, which elevated the dish.
Breakfast each morning was a real treat. There was a very good selection of food on the menu with freshly prepared dishes. The smoothies were delightful. The full Irish breakfast was very nice and the porridge was good.
We used the pool, which a not very big, but as it was quiet, there was enough room for my son to splash about without annoying the other swimmers. My wife used the spa and found the treatments to be good.
The hotel itself is out of the city center but is easily accessible by car. Dundrum shopping center is not far away. 
Our overall memory is that this is a classic hotel with good facilities, nice rooms and friendly staff. The decor could do with some modernization but everything was clean and in good order. The breakfast was one of the highlights and set us up nicely for a day exploring Dublin.",4,2015,04,09
205,SO RELAXING,"We stayed for the Easter Weekend.  We have stayed here on numerous occasions and as it was our first stay since the change of Management we hoped all would be the same as before.  Thankfully it was.  As soon as you arrive you are made feel so welcome by the Porters.  They always welcome us back which is so lovely.  Rory checked us in and was lovely and chatty offering us an upgrade to a suite for a small fee which we accepted.  Our room was spotless, bright and airy with a private dressing room.  Tea / Coffee facilities were good and housekeeping were great.  It was great to see all of the staff still there.  Had a drink in the Ice Bar before dinner on Saturday and met a lovely cheerful barman.  As usual breakfast is great, tried both the buffet and the cooked. Overall had a great experience.",5,2015,04,09
205,Absolutely Supurb - A Cut Above the Rest!,"My husband, 10 year old daughter and myself stayed here for just over a week at the end of March/beginning of April and what a beautiful hotel it is! 

I was, at first, a tad apprehensive after reading some reviews ONLY based on the fact that it is a little further from the city center than many other hotels.  What I found was it was WORTH IT!  It is merely a 10 minute cab (about 10-12 Euro each way) and is breathtaking from the moment you walk in.  As for the staff... they are undeniably one of the best around.  

Special thanks to Olwyn for her continued efforts to ensure an extremely easy and smooth check in, Isabelle for her constant outgoing and bubbly personality which immediately warmed my heart and stole that of my daughter... you are forever hre ""new best friend"" and David - who is an amazing bartender and is willing to make WHATEVER it is you want to drink - and then some!  

We had some 'flight issues' and unfortunately were not able to get to the InterContinental until a full day after our scheduled arrival time but with only a phone call they said no problem what-so-ever and that our room would be ready and waiting for us whenever we got there.  Our luggage sadly did not make it until another 10 hours after we did, but again, thanks to InterContinental - no worries!  They sent up a package to our rooms with tee shirts, dental kits, deodorant and many other items you would want/need!

Our room (the King Jr. Suite) was beautiful with a TRUE King size bed!  It is common in Ireland that a 'king' size bed is really the size of a queen in the states... not here!  My husband is 6'4 so this was such a welcome surprise to us that is is a true King!  Even the pull out sofa was a nice size and quite comfortable.

I would love to express just how happy I was with this hotel.  If EVER in Dublin again, there is no doubt, this is where we will be staying!!",5,2015,04,08
205,"Great Hotel, facilities and service","We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in a junior suite which was big enough to land a small aircraft inside. The hotel is very well run and a good 5 star with a large heated indoor pool, hot tub and well equipped gym. There is plenty of car parking at a cost of 15 euros per night on site. The hotel is a bit more than a walk from the city centre but there are plenty of taxis to take you in but also the the hotel run a luxury chauffeur service from the hotel to anywhere in town for 15 euros. Nice touch. If it's space you want, this hotel does it.",4,2015,04,08
205,great location and lots of luxury right in dublin,"This was my first stay in Dublin.  We stayed with our two girls for a few nights.  great spa and swimmingpool.
lovely lounge for tea and breakfast was first class, veggie options cooked fresh.  Luxury tea bags in spa, heaven!
Junior suite was huge and was as expected a cut above.  Would definitely stay there again or recommend to others.",4,2015,04,08
205,Quite old School,"Very good service, although a little old school for my liking... I was 37 at the time.  Room feel a little out dated, food was good but expensive.  On subsiquent return business trips to Dublin I stayed elsewhere.",3,2015,04,04
205,"Faultless Hotel, Fantastic service","We stayed for 2 nights early in the week and got a great deal on a beautiful and comfortable deluxe room. The check in was extremely easy and efficient by a very charming and friendly lady (Mary Susan I think). The room was a generous size and well equipped. The marble  bathroom had a large shower and a lovely deep bath.

Throughout our stay all the staff were all perfect. The concierge (called Silviu I think) gave us great advice on bars, restaurants and transport and was totally spot on with his recommendations.

We used the pool and gym every day we were there. The whole set up was great. Well equipped gym, large pool, lovely hot jacuzzi and there was a towel, slippers, bath robe and wet bag for your swim suit all ready for you in your locker.

I have previously stayed in many boutique and independent 5 star hotels around the world, from now on I will be seeking the Intercontinental.",5,2015,04,02
205,Exemplary Service,"We stayed (sadly) just one night here at the start of a short visit to Eire, the staff here are probably some of the best hotel staff I have ever come across. The rooms are spacious, clean and quiet. Good quality linens and furniture. Perhaps the only let down (and this common to a lot of rooms) is that there is no easy place for ladies to 'do' their hair, the mirrors are not placed near a socket for the hair dryer. It is not far in to Dublin using public transport (the bus is 5.50 Euro for two) taxi will be around 15 - 20 Euro depending on time of day.",5,2015,04,02
205,Luxurious Hotel in great location,"Everything was 1st Class in this hotel. Fantastic quality of furniture, bedding, towels and atmosphere.   Really large room, smart TV, Dressing Room and Bathroom.  Great Iron,  Fully stocked mini bar (expensive so don't use it) We got a little bowl of nibbles with all rounds of drink that we bought.  Very near to Sandymount Dart Station and walkable distance to the Aviva.  Nice friendly receptionist from Westport Co Mayo on the desk when we were checking out in the morning..... Would love to stay again.",5,2015,04,01
205,A Pleasure to stay here.,"The room wasn't ready when we arrived and the hotel upgraded us.
Nothing is a problem here and although the hotel has gone from the Four Seasons to the InterContinental the services is still as excellent as ever.
Highly recommended to any traveller visiting Dublin.",5,2015,03,31
205,Very comfortable hotel,"Stay here for just 1 night, visiting 3 arena for Michael Flatley. All the staff were very friendly and welcoming. No space for the car so the Valet took it and parked it somewhere. It appeared next morning when requested, without any delay. Room big with a very comfortable bed. Absolutely no noise at night so had one of the best nights sleep ever in a hotel. 4 of us went for breakfast and we really took our time. Service was good but a bit slow. Buffet was very good, freshly made omelette great. Only thing we didn't like was the scrambled egg on the buffet, something just not quite right about it.  Overall a very enjoyable stay.",5,2015,03,29
205,Wonderful Stay - Dublin Intercontinental,"had a great stay at the Dublin Intercontinental, the re-branded Four Season (as of Jan 2015)

We were really looked after in the Pembroke Suite, the family loved it, the staff were great, really went out of their way, the Sales Manager, whom i had contact with prior to our stay, and one particular Duty Manager, was a champion.

Highly recommend this property, well managed, facilities are wonderful, and breakfast was done very well, a much enjoyed stay.",5,2015,03,25
205,Weekend Away,"My wife and I stayed here at the start of March 2015, while this is a lovely hotel and in perfect location if you were to watch a rugby game in either the Aviva or RDS,  I've stayed in better hotels in Dublin that aren't 5 star in my opinion.

The hotel is clean and staff are very friendly and helpful, car parking is very poor though and I know not all hotels in Dublin offer you parking, but for a 5 star this hotel only has about 60 spaces at most. 

Room was nice, but was expecting better compared to other 5 star hotels I've stayed in. Went down to the pool and couldn't find the Jacuzzi area and no staff where around to ask, slightly disappointed with that. So relaxed by the pool instead which was fine.

The breakfast in this hotel is wonderful, but this is a very expensive hotel to stay in just to have a wonderful breakfast,  while my wife and I did have a nice stay we don't think we will be back.",3,2015,03,25
205,Fell short in some areas,"Rory on reception greeted us warmly and provided us with a room even though we arrived early, well before arrival time! Room was spacious and clean.  All areas were clean it just lacked that little something for me.  Booked table in restaurant and service was poor.  We felt price did not reflect anywhere near expectation, thereafter ate out for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Very good is a generous review but average is not fair either.  Disappointed.",4,2015,03,23
205,Lost its soul?,"I was a huge fan of the Four Seasons Dublin and worried that when it went under new ownership that it might lose some of its special qualities. I am said to say that on my return a few weeks ago I was disappointed! To be fair it was a short visit and they are making some changes to decor etc.  chairs in lobby bar had been reupholstered but paint on the legs was chipped and for me this summed up our whole visit.  A bit if a 'quick tart up' but that was never the ethos of the Four Seasons, yes it was old fashioned but we loved the old time feel, the quality, the ambience.

Service was much slower and we had several issues bar orders that didn't arrive apparently they had been taken to the wrong table?  Previously, We loved having afternoon tea with scones and cream and tea in a silver teapot with a little strainer, crisp linen napkins etc etc. this was our biggest letdown! Tea was more little chef than master chef!

Come on Intercontinental, you are a massive organisation, you are experts in the hospitality trade but you certainly have let things slide in Dublin.  I hope my review is not just rose tinted glasses of the past colouring my views but my favourite hotel has really dropped in my estimation!",4,2015,03,22
205,Relaxing weekend break,My husband and I had very high hopes of this place! I would say that it is certainly worth it's 5 star status but it falls short when compared to other nearby 5star hotels. The staff where very helpful and the hotel is beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean. However we both where slightly disappointed with the bedrooms they certainly where not as big and comfortable as others I have stayed in. The pool and spa area was clean and well equipped but I found the changing rooms messy with wet towels and robes lying about. I went away for a relaxing break with my husband and was disappointed that men and woman have separate relaxation areas and sauna/steam rooms although some people might prefer this. We never ate in the hotel that night so can't comment on the food however breakfast the next morning was amazing!without doubt the best breakfast I have ever had and to be honest was the saving grace of our trip! So much to choose from and supplies constantly replenished!first class! I found the hotel just a bit too far from the city centre for my liking but would be perfect for a rugby break. I doubt I would be back in this hotel as I don't think it can justify it's price but I am glad to have experienced that breakfast!!,4,2015,03,17
205,Great experience,"We stayed here on Mar 7th, it was a very pleasant experience, we had late food in the bar, excellent, great service and reasonable value for money.
Breakfast next morning was great, the bedroom was beautiful and very comfortable.
Overall a great experience...",5,2015,03,17
205,excellent hotel and facilities,"Stayed here at the former four seasons on a recent business function in RDS,  hotel and accommodation  is fabulous and really feels 5 star.  The speed of service at breakfast could be better otherwise staff were fantastic.",4,2015,03,10
205,A lovely experience,"My husband and I stayed recently in this hotel, it was a beautiful experience, everything about our stay was pleasant. The room was spotless and spacious and luxurious. We arrived late and we were able to to have a meal in the bar which was very nice. Breakfast was excellent , great selection. We would certainly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,03,10
205,Lovely hotel,"Stayed in the intercontinental (four seasons) for rugby Ireland v England game, great buzz, mostly, great staff, particularly reception and 2 chaps at the door. Sorry I didn't get their name but they were so pleasant and welcoming no matter how cold it was!!!! Makes such a difference being greeted like that..The first room we were given didn't have a bath but that was pleasantly dealt with by Ronan as we were swiftly moved to one down the hall. We were a bit disappointed in the evening when we went downstairs to meet friends (who were also staying in the hotel) when we were told we couldn't sit in a seat of our choice?????? We found this ridiculous but we were told there was a 15 min wait for seats in the foyer and the young lady member of staff really didn't care that we had nowhere else to sit!!! About 5 mins later we watched her approach a ""well known"" ex rugby player and ASK him if he would like that particular seat!! My husband and I felt angry that this ""attitude"" was so blatantly displayed and disappointed enough to reconsider a return trip when seats were less of a ""premium"". I must point out the hotel foyer was far from packed but sadly there was a certain selection process used when allocating seats.... Looking after your bread and butter springs to mind.",4,2015,03,10
205,"not central location, but the hotel is great","Not central location, but the hotel is great.  The rooms are clean and spacious and with all necessary conveniences.  The services is great.  The only negative point is that it is not easy to get the right temperature in the bath (but somehow it is common problem in many places in Ireland).  The in-house restaraunt is great, but you have to book a table beforehand (at least several hours in advance).  This hotel was Four Seasons until the 1st of January, 2015, so I hope under Intercontinental management it will remain the same.",5,2015,03,08
205,very good,It has changed hands but it's still the best hotel in Dublin  by faer there have been a few adjustments to the hotel I had slipped a bit in quality the staff are super room is the same I standard and the leisure centre is fantastic.,5,2015,03,08
205,Return Visit,"I stayed at this hotel shortly after it first opened when I attended a dinner party in the Four Seasons Restaurant and have fond memories of that occasion. I was looking forward to dining again in this restaurant, but was very disappointed when I found it to be closed in the evenings and only used for breakfasts. Great pity as it is a lovely restaurant and deserves to be fully used. I guess the new InterContinental management are still working out what to do with it. There is a small restaurant off the lobby. Not quite the same thing as the Four Seasons.

Otherwise I found the hotel much as I remember. It is comfortable and within easy reach of central Dublin. There is plenty of space for parking cars. The rooms are a good size. Spent several minutes looking for a hotel directory and couldn't find one. The reception desk eventually told me it was on the television network.

We stayed over a weekend which was very busy with supporters for the  England/Ireland rugby match at the nearby Aviva Stadium.  Although very busy the staff coped well with the influx of supporters.

Would have given it five stars if they had sorted out the old Four Seasons Restaurant",4,2015,03,04
205,Great Hotel - Great Service,"Stayed in February- Family 3 nights , great service and great food, little things that make the difference, water and towel on return from morning jog a nice touch, one of our kids left their swimming gear behind and this was posted on; Spa was great although pool was small for the size of hotel; nice location albeit a good walk from city centre; con- no wifi in rooms and parking is extra; will return",4,2015,03,04
205,Pure opulence,"Arrived having booked a double room, lobby andswanky very sophisticated. Staff were more than welcoming and accomodating. Our room was amazing, fully marble bathroom with double doors, seperate shower and bath. Mini bar wasn't too extraordinarly priced. Would definitely be back. We didn't have any issue but car park noted first come first serve, on Match days parking May be an issue",5,2015,02,25
205,Luxury rooms,"I stayed here for one night in February and I feel it meets its 5 star status. The service in the lounge and bar is excellent. However at €6.25 a pint, you might expect high quality service. It must be mentioned that the breakfast is special and if you can get a seat at the window take it. If there was a complaint it was reception did not ask me if I needed a morning call or a morning newspaper. But I can't leave on a sour note as the bedroom was excellent. We stayed in 419 and I can certainly recommend it.
",4,2015,02,19
205,Average,"This hotel is nice, beds are comfortable. However at dinner our main course came before the starter. Breakfast in bed the side order was missing. We were also told on check in that our card would not be charged however it was, not that we would have been bothered they should have just been honest. On the Friday night we have our room speakers go which made an awful noise, this started before dinner and three hours later when we returned were still making a noise, at 11pm in the evening and two phone calls later this was finally sorted. However for £250 a night you expect better! ",3,2015,02,17
205,Just like a old friend!,"Our last stay, March 2014, was at the Four Seasons, now the Intercontinental.  The change over happened on 1 Jan 2015 and I am pleased to report that we felt like old friends returning home.  We were in Dublin to see Ireland take on France and I must say, the hotel reflected very much this multi city occasion.  Rory, the manager, was half french, so maintained a diplomatic stance re the match, but he and his team were champions in all respects.  

We received a complimentary upgrade, due to a small admin mix up with a corporate Four Seasons gift card and the fact that it was a birthday treat.  Our one bedroom executive master was superb, the spa was excellent, breakfast very good and add in the fact that Ireland won, well, what can I say.  It is true that the hotel is very busy on such weekends, but we also stopped off at the Shelbourne for a quick drink on the Saturday evening and we found the atmosphere there not at all on a par with the Intercontinental.

All rooms are comfortable and well equipped but rooms towards the back of the hotel, overlooking the RDS, tend to be quieter and therefore very relaxing.  However, the professionalism of the staff, the friendly approach and quality of service all reflects very well on Rory and his staff.  Well done to all, and we look forward to returning in the future.",5,2015,02,17
205,Rugby Weekend,"Early January 2015 stayed at this hotel for rugby weekend. Check in great, staff great, room great . Decided to have a beer before the match but no room available (bar full of children running about) even for residents, Went across road to neighbouring hotel and no problem getting served quickly. After match again decided to return to hotel but the same thing, lots of people waiting for bar access and no residents lounge available for staying guests. Decided not to eat here as probably would not have been accomodated. Complained when checking out the next day and was told that I would contacted by a member of staff. Liam ( restaurant manager ) contacted me, apologised for bad service and said to contact him on my next arrival. Last Thursday 14th Feb contacted him to ask if offer might still stand as visiting on the 16th Feb but no response. I can see why the Four seasons Group pulled the plug on this establishment. Still charging 5 star prices for 3 star service. If visiting, organise to meet friends or family in Bewleys hotel across the road as much better service , even on busy rugby weekends.",1,2015,02,16
205,Beautiful hotel with exceptional service,"Luxury spa hotel with the most amazing service I have ever experienced! We went on our 'mini-moon' recently for a couple of days and I will definitely be returning! The spa is so relaxing and the meals that we had for the inclusive breakfast and dinner in the lounge were delicious! The service at breakfast was what made the trip, thanks to the lovely waiter Andrej who could not have been more helpful! Highly recommended for a relaxing trip!",5,2015,02,12
205,A home away from home,"InterContinental Dublin is a home away from home. The staff are always attentive, the rooms are spaces and well layed out. The bar offers a homely feel with a welcoming smile from the staff. resturant offers an excellent and affordable selection. ",5,2015,02,11
205,Luxury in a luxurious hotel!,We had the pleasure of staying for a weekend break at this luxurious hotel. The standards were certainly 5 star with excellent service from friendly staff. Will hopefully return in the future.Only wish we could have stayed longer! ,5,2015,02,11
205,Already dreaming of next stay,"Stayed this weekend with 3 of our children. Also stayed earlier in year with friends. On both occasions stayed in a suite. Had facial (amazing) in spa during last stay. This weekend used pool on two occasions.
Really cannot praise this hotel enough, from booking over telephone with the extremely helpful and friendly Rory (thank-you), to check-in where our kids were thrilled with their chocolate coins from the ""treasure chest"" and their very own keys, to the stunning rooms, delicious food, did I mention the wonderful spa?? Rooms are fabulous. Most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. Coffee facilities are Nespresso machines- yum.
I have only one gripe, and hate to tarnish in any way, but during both stays house-keeping cleared used and dirty glasses and cups but did not replace. Coffee pods for machine also not replenished. Very small, but did hear another guest commenting on similar at reception.

Otherwise AMAZING...Saving for next stay already! Thank you to all staff.",5,2015,02,10
205,New owners keep the Four Seasons great standards.,"Booked into our rooms on the first floor after checking in with the friendly receptionist. Rooms are so big and really tastefully designed. No shower heads aimed into the bath...Thank God!! First floor room is so good because you can open the doors and walk around the gravelled footpaths outside or have a smoke whilst looking down at the guests arriving and leaving. Beds are big and comfortable sleeping is so easy. The breakfast is what makes this one of the very best hotels around Dublin. Simply stunning and so plentiful. You would really feel robbed if you had a hangover and came down to this spread of fresh fruits, breads, honeycomb, my own favourite is the Berchner? Muesli....had 2 of them. Honey roasted ham and a chief there to cook your omelette. An Irish breakfast is nearly boring also had the ricotta pancakes as well. Anyways after a swim in the pool and soak in the jacuzzi I headed back up to the room to pack my bags and sadly leave this terrific hotel. ",5,2015,02,09
205,Luxury close to the city,"Pros:

Luxurious decor
Excellent breakfast and menu
Great service
Idyllic setting
Good room size and furnishings

Cons:

Parking available, however, quite busy
Internet not free
A distance from attractions, however, we had a vehicle

We stayed when the hotel was under the Four Seasons brand.",5,2015,02,09
205,"very nice hotel, but very bad internet services","I was very disappointed from the very poor/slow internet wifi services offered to the clients of this hotel.. I really never had something worse.. even after my boss bought faster options, the wifi remained slow",3,2015,02,09
205,"Good service, lovely hotel ","I stayed here for three nights on a business trip. 
The staff were friendly & efficient, especially both of the concierges who were really helpful. 
All of the staff called me by my name which I think is a great personal service. 
The bar lobby area has a great social buzz about it and the afternoon tea looked good. 
It's located close to the station and the RDS and if you want to its a good 30 minute walk into town. 
I'd definitely stay there again next time I go over to the Emerald Isle! ",5,2015,02,05
205,Family Wedding,"Had my wedding here under the watchful eye of the lovely Kate Draper. She was so professional from the first meeting til the day of the wedding. Couldn't of asked for a better liaison from the hotel. Food was impeccable and staff and services were outstanding. Every member of the staff were so attentive and accommodating. Would highly recommended this hotel for a wedding or any type of get together.

205,"For tourist purposes, if exploring Dublin city center is your objective, know the limitations of a stay here.","What's your purpose for staying in Dublin?  

Is your stay a rewards stay paid with points, or, is it paid with cash?

The answer to the questions will either cause you to love your stay here or, having regret, even though you may have enjoyed an awesome hotel, but, having regret for not having positioned yourself with easy or easier access to the city center.

Below are some thoughts on purposes and payment considerations (for points/for cash) which may assist in a decision to stay here or not.

It would be easy, and I originally intended, to rate this property with 5 stars for the quality of the facilities, the friendliness of the staff.  And, if the purpose of my stay had been for proximity to the many embassies as are nearby, or if wanting luxury amidst tranquility in what in many regards seems a high end residential area, or for a business meeting or conference where the objective isn't a junket but doing business, then if there were 6 stars allowed, my rating would be 6.

If your intent is primarily enjoying the city center, in which there is so much to do, there is an annoying, nagging inconvenience factor of being at the Intercontinental that will be a drag on your enjoying the city center. 

My stay was precisely to enjoy the city center.  And, if the facilities, the staff, had not been so wonderful, my rating--as I think it through carefully--would be 3 stars, at best.  This was a rewards stay.  

Had this been a stay for cash, probably 2 stars would be my highest rating, but only as a reflection of what my purpose was, and that is to enjoy the city center, for which my stay here did not serve well, overall.  

So, if you are evaluating a stay here as a stay for pleasure with your primary interest spending time in the city center, which entails the shopping, Temple Bar area, the museums, Book of Kells, cathedrals, the pubs, wide variety of cuisines from around the world, from the high end to the low end cost range, i.e., lots of choices on what to do, consider this:

1.  As a cabbie told me, if you're coming to Ireland for the weather, you've come to the wrong country.  I haven't fact checked it, but, one of them told me it rains, on average, 250 days out of the year.  So, yes, the hotel may be a 35 minute walk to the city center, and if you're a tourist say, for example, from Washington State, the rain and clouds may perhaps be nothing for you; but, if you're from Arizona, you'll think you're in monsoon season.  My experience in Dublin is, don't trust the sun in the morning, if there is any.  Take your umbrella or a raincoat/rainparka.  [Saw lots of umbrellas turned inside out from the winds.]

2.  Yes, there are cabs and there are buses, if you're not driving.  But, how do you feel about the inconvenience of returning from the city center to the hotel by cab or bus, to offload treasures yoou've bought, or, having had a great lunch and a glass of wine, a Guinness, in the city center, wanting to take a nap, or, finding you've left something at the hotel you need, have underdressed/overdressed, wet from being rained upon, and need change your wardrobe, etc., then after having returned from the city center to the hotel, to get another cab or bus to go back to the city center? Your answer may vary in degree whether you are staying for points, which is one thing, or, if paying cash, it's another thing.  You can't use Intercontinental Hotel reward points to stay at a hotel in the city center (but, maybe in the future, there will be an IHG hotel in the city center), but, you can use cash to stay elsewhere in the city center, which, I recommend your doing if you're here as a tourist wanting to enjoy the city center.

If you do stay here, there is an ATM within 5 minutes walk of the hotel.  I used it.  The location isn't one of those that makes you look over your shoulder out of safety concerns.

Getting a cab from the city center to the hotel is a snap.  Cabs are everywhere.  The reverse is not true.  

If you're on a deadline to be someplace, and you've waited to walk downstairs to ask for a cab to be called, you are in trouble!  

Every occasion I asked for cabs, I did so hours or a day in advance, and no cab arrived on time. I did ask for pick-ups with a buffer of 10 to 15 minutes built in as a precaution.   

One morning I had reserved a cab the night before to pick me up and take me to another location to meet up with a tour group.  I was on the precipice of missing the pick-up time for the tour, so, ), the doorman went out to the street (20 yards away) turned the corner where a hedge row hides any cars parked on the street,  and asked a cab parked there to take me.  [You'll be frustrated.  I had no idea there may be cabs waiting on the street, parked curbside.  You cannot see them from the hotel.  Stay and you'll understand.  Because you can't see without going outside the grounds, you won't know if there is one there or not.  I was lucky on my day I was on a deadline there was a cab on the street available to take me.]

The inconveniences aside, with the stay being on points, I'm not kicking myself for not staying in the city center.  

If it had been for cash and my stay was for access to the city center as a tourist, if I had booked 3 nights, probably after the first night, I would have moved locations to a hotel in the city center.",4,2015,01,28
205,"Excellent hotel, friendly, clean, nice breakfast and a relaxed 30-35 min walk to the city centre",Rooms and service are much better than your average 4 or 5 star hotel. I enjoyed breakfast. I attended a conference in the hotel which was held in a very pleasant conference room easily catering to 200 people. Lunch was served also for 200 people. Food was hot and delicous. Where do you get that kind of service? Usually it is a poor quality buffet for which you have to stand in line. Bathroom is large and the toilet is in a seperated area. Two thumbs up!,5,2015,01,27
205,Beautiful hotel,"This hotel is grand, and you won't be disappointed by the luxurious style.  If you're sightseeing in Dublin, this is NOT your hotel - it's not within walking distance of city center.  If you're on business, taxis come by fairly often but you may need to call one.  My one complaint is that the rooms, although beautifully appointed, are old and therefore not updated for current electronics.  No outlets in the bathroom for a hair dryer (only for shavers) and no outlets near bed for plugging in a phone.  I ended up doing my hair far away from a mirror in the bedroom.  Strange.  Breakfast is good, but for the price, I'd expect a little more.  Continental buffet is pretty average.  
Service was lovely and I'd recommend staying here for a conference or if it's close to your business location.",5,2015,01,27
205,The best hotel in Dublin,"Former Four Seasons hotel it became Intercontinental from two weeks ago,end of December 2014.This is by far the best hotel in Dublin.Rooms are spacious and the best are the ""suites"" which have a living room area much bigger than the bedroom.I traveled with my two kids and the service provided was exemplary.Great spa at the lower level completely free ,concierge who can arrange everything for your stay ,fantastic buffet breakfast or a la carte and very  variate in room dining options. To have a perfect image of the quality of the hotel:I forgot some things in the room and it was no issue to have them shipped immediately to New York express!",5,2015,01,22
205,Unwind,"What a lovely hotel. The staff, the rooms, the food, the spa all fab. As soon as you enter the property you can just leave your hassles at the door. It is expensive and I bowed out of the breakfast at 30 euro each for a full Irish. The dinner the night before was cheaper! 
   The ambience was relaxing and it just tops off a trip to this wonderful city.",5,2015,01,20
205,Luxury,"We stayed here this weekend as we were attending a trade show at the RDS and its location was ideal, just a two minute walk. From the moment we arrived until the moment we left I could not fault the excellent service and attention to detail, nothing was too much trouble and rooms were second to none. Next time we visit the RDS I wouldn't stay anywhere else. ",5,2015,01,18
205,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed here in late November, when it was the Four Seasons, with some other couples and have to say it was an outstanding choice and easily the best hotel we have stayed in. From having your luggage taken at the door, to excellent Staff and a room that was so large you could get lost, it was a great choice. The hotel was very busy however service in the bars was very good and the waiters and bar staff very pleasant. The hotel is located in a very nice area and even though there was a Rugby game on that weekend we decided to watch the game in the hotel bar with some friends and the atmosphere was great. It is certainly a hotel we would recommend again.",5,2015,01,18
205,Down in Dublin for Rugby with my better half,"Great location in South Dublin, just a quick walk from the Aviva Stadium. Beautiful hotel, room was excellent, very comfortable and staff very attentive. Ate in the restaurant, food was great and an excellent value set menu. Had a lovely time with my wife and would recommend to couples for a special weekend. Room was pricey and you needed a 2nd mortgage to buy a round of drink at the bar but still super spot for a special occasion.",5,2015,01,13
205,Miss the breakfast!,"Nothing but high praise for the hospitality here- daytime concierge was extremely helpful- many thanks especially to Silviu and the Dutch guy whose name i cannot remember (my last conversation with him was on Christmas Day and directions to get to the docks) who were standouts and Fiona who works the breakfast with the other lady (can't remember her name but she is currently pregnant if I'm not wrong). I probably spent too much time in my room in the evenings as the bed was so comfortable! Breakfast was really tasty- got to love the smoked salmon and eggs benedict. On the morning when my family and i checked out- shortly before 7am to catch out early flight, Fiona allowed us to takeaway breakfast in the plastic containers provided even though the restaurant wasn't open to customers yet- those muffins and fruit sure lasted me till lunchtime that very day when I arrived at my next destination.",5,2015,01,06
205,If in Dublin stay here,"What a wonderful, luxurious experience.  The staff are excellent as are all the facilities in this brilliant hotel.  The swimming pool is simply amazing and the rooms big with very comfy beds.  My daughters, aged 6 and 2, were made to feel like little film stars with their own room keys and fluffy white bath robes and when they ordered hot chocolates they were presented with a mug of lovely chocolate with a plate of chocolate curls, marshmallows and whipped cream.  They thought they were in heaven.  We felt pampered from beginning to end.  Quite simply fantastic.",5,2015,01,06
205,Polished,"It is a beautiful hotel in a lovely area.  You are a little out of the way from the city centre which is great for a quiet nights sleep and a charming community around you, but I would recommend having a car available to you.  The hotel has a sense of grandeur and polished service.  It is true the carpeting and some features are becoming dated but the staff and little touches like a cookie and juice for my son upon arrival make up for any flaws.  The room is absolutely immaculate, the beds are as comfortable as you could hope for and they accept our dog with friendly attitudes and her own treats!  My only recommendation would be a water in the room for each guest.  You cannot go wrong in booking this hotel.",4,2015,01,06
205,Lovely stay,"We had a lovely stay at the Four Seasons Dublin. The hotel is well situated, although not in the center of Dublin. It's an easy 10 minute bus ride or short cab ride away, and the beautiful surroundings make the distance disappear. There are several great restaurants within walking distance, and the hotel restaurants are fantastic too (both the service and food were outstanding). 

The hotel itself is great. Our room was spotless, and the extra bed for child number 3 was as comfy as the other beds, which is not often the case. The kids enjoyed the pool, which, although small, is adequate. 

The fact that there is a parking lot makes the Four Seasons an easy choice if you happen to have a car while in Ireland, as many of the downtown hotels cannot offer parking. 

Must also comment on the hotel breakfast buffet which was wonderful. Our waitress was so careful with our son's allergy, and went above and beyond in ensuring everything was safe for him.",5,2015,01,05
205,EXCELLENT,"Dear Mr. Nolan  - Having just  returned from our annual 3 day post Christmas at the Four Seasons I have to let you know that it was perfect as usual.  I cannot fault this hotel especially the staff, each and every one of your staff are a credit to this hotel from arrival to departure from Porterage to Restaurant etc.  It is such a pleasure to be remembered and welcomed back by some of your staff.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the upgrade to your Junior Suites was very much appreciated.  Sad to hear the Four Seasons are leaving but hopefully Intercontinental will be just as good.  Many thanks again.",5,2015,01,05
205,I'll be back :),"Really enjoyed our stay at the Four Seasons! The rooms were lovely and very clean, my toiletries were organised neatly upon arrival back to the room! Staff were very helpful and willing to do whatever it takes to enhance customer experience, especially Mary Susan who looked after us during our stay.",5,2015,01,04
205,Christmas Day at the Four Seasons,"We live locally in Dublin, and were staying in the Four Seasons as a special Christmas treat. We booked two rooms for the Christmas Day package, which includes Christmas Dinner and a one-night stay for Bed and Breakfast.

Despite booking promptly when the Christmas offers were first publicised, I had no end of trouble getting a decent booking time for Christmas Dinner. Some friends of us had advised us to get a reservation in the Seasons restaurant (as opposed to eating in the cavernous and impersonal ""Winter Wonderland"" ballroom), as it would be a much better and more intimate dining experience. However they couldn't accommodate us in the restaurant at the time we wanted. They said all the tables for lunch were fully booked, and had been for some time.  So our only choice was to wait until dinner time and be seated in the restaurant, or eat earlier in the ballroom. And after numerous phone calls and emails, I reluctantly had to accept the former option.

Upon check-in at 1.00pm on Christmas Day the manager on duty immediately launched into a sales pitch to try and up-sell our party into suites, at an increased cost of €120 per room.  My parents decided to pay to upgrade us all, which was very generous of them, but I don't feel we really gained anything from having additional space in the suites for our one-night stay.  The décor of the suites also felt quite dated - although the rooms were immaculately presented.

In the rooms themselves, we were disappointed to find that if we wanted to make a cup of tea or coffee, we had to ring down to room service to ask for a kettle. There was also no bottled water provided as part of the turn-down service - which meant that when I wanted a mouthful of water to take medication before bed, I had no option but to take the €4 bottle of water from the mini bar.

We gathered early for dinner in the hotel bar, but didn't actually manage to get a pre-dinner drink.  We stood around for about 10 minutes waiting to order a drink, and despite there being lots of staff around, none of them seemed to want to serve behind the bar!

Christmas Dinner in the Seasons restaurant was excellent. The cold starter buffet was generous and sumptuous. It was followed by a soup course, main course, and then desert. All the food was delicious, and the staff were very attentive - except when it came to making sure our wine glasses were topped up. I can understand why some restaurants prefer to keep wine bottles to one side, and pour themselves - but if so, they need to make sure people don't sit with an empty glass for 5 minutes.

After dinner we wandered along to the ""Winter Wonderland"" ballroom, to admire the decorations. The events team had clearly gone to a lot of effort to create the magical winter forest scene just like the land of Narnia (from The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe), including a wardrobe entrance, about 80 Christmas trees, and a snow machine.

Dinner in the ballroom was a self-service buffet style, with a separate room containing a vast array of deserts - including an ice-cream machine, with loads of different toppings. And although we had just had our fill in the restaurant, we managed to fit in a 99 ice-cream. Unfortunately the experience was slightly marred by my wife cutting her leg on a glass-topped table.

Overall, we felt let-down our experience, and it certainly wasn't what we'd expect from a 5-star hotel.  I know that the hotel has just lost its Four Seasons name and is now part of the Intercontinental chain - and hopefully the new owner can address some of the problems we found.",3,2015,01,02
205,"Excellent hotel, with good service.","Excellent Hotel, well worth the visit. The staff were excellent and the location was ideal for the Dublin City area. We were able to leave our car in the car park for 2 days which made travel around Dublin very easy.",4,2015,01,02
205,Wonderful visit,"Great visit. We enjoyed a three night stay and had the complimentary third night included through the American Express Fine Hotel and Resort program.  Breakfast was also included in the rate. Afternoon tea was included in the rate as well, but we weren't able to take advantage of that. It was an amazing value. The staff was very attentive when we arrived from the states early in the morning. While a room wasn't immediately available, they offered us breakfast while we waited for a room to be ready. By the time we had finished eating, our room was ready. 

As others have mentioned, the hotel is a quick cab ride to the center of the city. We were also able to take the city bus to our destinations. We would definitely stay at this property again, however due to the location we would likely see if other options closer to the city center were available first. ",5,2015,01,01
205,Fab,"Stayed one night with husband and three children in exec. Suite which was very nice and spacious. Only one toilet though which means kids have to trail through parents bedroom to use the loo..no major problem over all. Bed very comfy and cosy and not a sound heard. The pool area is lovely with small pool dimly lit which I found relaxing and comforting! Pool staff were the friendliest I have come across. We were greeted and checked in by Rory who was extremely professional yet warm. Being five of  us Alma in reservations was a great help sorting out what sort of accommodation we needed. Toiletries in the bathroom were Loccitane. Hope to return again, very family friendly.

205,Christmas in Dublin,"I am a regular visitor to this superb property and decided to stay over the Christmas period along with my family. 

Not only were we looking forward to Christmas together as a family but also to staying in the hotel over the holiday as previous experience has told me that their attention to detail normally put into special occasions is second to none. 

I have previously reviewed this hotel, giving it full marks. Indeed it is my hotel of choice in Dublin. 

Generally our stay was very good but not completely up to the normal very high standard one has come to expect. I suppose the provision of a first class faultless service on many previous occasions has made a rod for it's own back. 

It is hard to particularise the specific 'niggles' on this visit as they were fairly minor, rather it was the cumulative effect of sane. 

Upon arrival we were greeted very warmly indeed and x2 out of x3 rooms were available which wasn't a problem as we had arrived early. I was checked in by one of the managers who, with a very warm smile, advised me that he had a suite available for me, just the one left, the last one in the building. My initial pleasure at receiving this 'complimentary' upgrade was very soon damped by the next line ... only an extra €90 per night. As it happened I did go for the suite albeit with the extra cost as it allowed much more space ... we knew that Santa would need a bit of space to lay out his presents to my son. Whilst in no way obliged it would have been nice to have been upgraded given the regularity of my visits and the season that was in it, however I do not fault the hotel in this regard and make it clear that this doesn't affect my review. 

On Christmas Eve when ordering lunch for our x2 year old we ordered pasta with sliced tomato and advacado to be advised that due to the fact that the kitchen was very busy, they had embargoed any 'special orders', so plain pasta and cheese it had to be. 

Later on Christmas Eve we dined in Seasons and whilst the service was extremely charming, polite and courteous, it was just ok! Our teas and coffees were served before our deserts and our waitress had to be advised about 15 minutes later that we were still waiting on desert. When the deserts did arrive the order was incorrect, albeit changed with little fuss or problem. 

Breakfast was, as usual, fantastic. 

Our Christmas dinner was slightly disappointing although hard to put ones finger on exactly why. The Winter Wonderland theme and decorated Ball Room was fantastic and it was clear that a stirling effort had gone into it. Without exception, however, everyone in our party was 'underwhelmed' with the main course. Please don't misunderstand me in that the food was presented well and cooked well, it's just that it was a little tasteless - it didn't exude excitement - we didn't leave the table raving about it! On reflection we wished we had returned to Season for the a la carte menu. 

I am aware that the Four Seasons brand will departing our shores on 1st January 2015 to be replaced by the Intercontinental. Having spoken to a number of staff members it would appear that there will be little change on the ground and that most of the staff will be staying on, with the exception of some of the management team. I do hope that the Intercontinental  take a leaf from the Four Seasons and realise that it is, primarily, the staff and their industry that make this hotel what it is, irrespective of what it is called.",4,2014,12,30
205,Five star luxury 4 star customer service though,"We stayed in the Four Seasons on Nov last.  The hotel was decorated beautifully in time for Christmas.  Two small issues tainted what was otherwise a five star experience.  We had a dinner reservation at Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud and arranged with concierge for a taxi to collect us for 7pm as we returned to our room to freshen up after a rugby match.

When we returned to the front entrance, expecting our booked taxi as promised we were met by a que of people (clearly not staying at the hotel) waiting for taxis.  As a result we missed our original booking time at the restaurant.  We managed to get a cancelation an hour later however this left it late to eat.

The second disappointment was at breakfast.  From seating to our order to be taken and even  for the food to arrive despite other tables being served promptly around us we experienced the slow motion version of service.

Staff we more than apologetic once this was highlighted as one would expect.

This was a birthday treat which otherwise was truly special however these two oversights tainted the experience.

My recommendations would be for the hotel to arrange taxis by prior arrangement and not operate a taxi rank for all to abuse.

Secondly organise your waiting staff better including the hostess as even she was cleaning tables instead of seating diners. 

This hotel is definitely grand but out dated",5,2014,12,26
205,No complaints and staff were extremely courteous & helpfull,"I stayed in this hotel for two nights and was very impressed with my room and as I have said above about the staff. Sorry to hear the InterContinental are taking over although I understand staff will be kept on so thats a plus..My room was always cleaned for me while I was out without asking.
Special mention to Rory on reception who looked after me with extra toiletries when I found myself without. Newspapers were left outside room on both mornings and a nice little touch!
Room service was great. Had a meal with my friend in restaurant and we both found it very nice.
All in all a very enjoyable stay.
Thanks & a Happy Christmas.& New Year",4,2014,12,24
205,Outdated and jaded,"Cannot believe this merits the Four Seasons Brand - more like Holiday Inn Express - truly disappointing. Dowdy and very 80's, it is way overpriced for what one gets.

Much better going to another so-called ""5 Star "" resort, because.. this isn't!",1,2014,12,21
205,Very disappointing lunch,"Was a guest for lunch at the Four Seasons last Sunday and I have to say that the food was very disappointing.  The brunch menu is very limited, uninspiring and quite frankly not worth €59 per head.  I had a starter of seafood chowder which was very thin and lacked flavor but the accompanying bread was very good indeed.  For a main course, I had fillet steak which was cooked medium rare as ordered but was dry and lacked tenderness and flavour. The accompanying vegetables were just about acceptable and the béarnaise sauce was good.........when it eventually arrived.  Puddings was a self service affair from a table in the centre of the room offering a variety of eclairs, chocolate and fruit mousses, pastries of various flavours - they were not bad.  Speaking to other guests in our party, they were of the same view, average/mediocre food and overall a disappointing dining experience. I did not get what my host paid a lot of money for.",3,2014,12,20
205,Five star in every way,"We (2 adults, 3 young kids) took a suite here for a pre-Christmas shopping weekend. There was a *huge* craft fair on in the RDS next door which was a nice bonus. 

The hotel is unashamedly opulent - the suite, for example, was vast and beautifully appointed.

If you're bringing kids and its one of the 11 non-summer months in Ireland ;-) you should order the hot chocolate for children in the lounge - our kids rated it the best ever and I think they were right.

One other note - the bed was simply outstanding - I mean, totally outstanding - the very highest level of comfort.",5,2014,12,20
205,worth that little bit extra!!,"Without doubt you get what you pay for and thats what this hotel does well, from the people at reservations to the staff for room service it was a fantastic break from we got there to we left, they accommodated us with an early check in and made our stay that little bit more special as we were celebrating our engagement, yes it may be a little more exspensive than some but by going to their website we availed of a great offer to stay in a suite get the second night free so my advice is if you have any special occasion check out whats on offer and ring reservations and they will help you make the most of a wonderfull hotel thats iconic with the city of dublin, one word of advice is keep the hotel room key card away from your mobile device as it interferes with the magnatic strip although after being told this i still forgot and had to sail around in my dressing gown(i was coming from the spa which is top class) to get it re-programed!! Happy and sad (i had to leave)!!!!",5,2014,12,18
205,So sad - end of an era!,"Have just spent the weekend in the fabulous Four Seasons. Rooms excellent, service superb, food delicious. Just very sad that the hotel will be under new management from the New Year 2015. The new owners have been set a very high standard.  Thanks to the brilliant management and staff of the Four Seasons.",5,2014,12,14
205,More like 2.5 seasons,"Decided to treat my wife to a nice hotel for an overnight in Dublin. Having been in several other Four Seasons, including Manhattan, I thought the Dublin hotel would be a lovely treat. But we were let down. I travel regularly for work so I know what expectations one should have of a 5 star hotel in Ireland, UK, Europe or USA. 
The experience got off to a bad start when we arrived as our room key would not work. Not a big problem, but according to the hotel staff, this is a regular problem. Anyway the room itself was great with a lovely bathroom - so all good there! Requested a taxi via reception, but it never turned up. After returning after a night out we fancied a cup of tea. No facilities in the room but a little notice saying ""Complimentary Tea & Coffee making facilities available on request"", so we duly called for a cup of tea. Shortly after a lovely tray of tea arrived. Again all good or....
Next morning went for breakfast. Huge queue so we had to wait in the bar for about 10 minutes whilst other diners finished. Clearly the room is too small for the amount of guests. Anyway got in and again lots of little problems. No napkins on table, had to ask for marmalade a few time but worst of all was the buffet/carvery style breakfast. The food itself was great but this is supposed to be a 5 star establishment not a chain hotel experience. 
Then at checkout there was a huge queue, which took 15 minutes to get to head of. Again not what one might expect. Upon receipt of extras bill I queried the €16.40 ""Room Service"" only to be informed that was for the previous night's tea. So much for complimentary, though apparently a kettle and tea bags can delivered to your room for free. To say the sign in the room was ambiguous would be generous. 
In summary this was a huge disappointment. If one pays €60 for a hotel you know what to expect. Likewise if you're paying €300 for a night you expect a lot more. Alas Four Seasons Dublin does not deliver on its potential.",3,2014,12,14
205,"Gorgeous, Amazing Food, Great Servivice","They call themselve a luxury ""enclave"" which is a good place to start. Tucked away, outside of the blare of City Centre, the magic starts as u walk thru the door. Their massive gingerbread house differs from most in that it is real gingerbread and big enough for 2 kids to play in. You can smell Christmas.
We arrived exhausted from a ny-dubai-ny-san fran- dublin 4 day run and aside from visions of gingerbread had a clean, comfortable king sized bed in our scope.
They upgraded is and within minutes I was soaking in an enormous tub.
Later we wandered downstairs, too jetlagged to venture out for dinner. In front of the library fireplace we had the best mussel/clam garlicky broth appetizer we had ever had (and I have a cottage in Prince Edward Island!).
We both had their chowder (amazing!). Even the breads were worth mentioning.
The triple fried chips/crisps were flavored with sour cream and chive. Service was great, especially ""JJ"" who spent time sharing food and travel tips.
The chef was kind enough to share his mussel/clam recipe.
We may not leave the hotel for five days! :-)
Also, don't let the Four Season's name scare you off. We found great seals online, even at the hotel's site.
Truly five star!",5,2014,12,11
205,A beautiful hotel,I found the Four Seasons to be an excellent choice.  I was able to secure my lodging thru the internet and got a very favorable rate.  I historically stayed on St. Stephen Green for it's central location.  I exchanged that for hotel amenities.  My office is in Ballsbridge so I also was walking distance from the office.  No lack of transportation options and staff ready to assist whatever the need.  ,5,2014,12,11
205,Waoh - super hotel!,"Booked months in advance for a wedding and just one week before asked if we could have early check-in to get ready - very good, prompt communication via email and on arrival, were not only given our room early, but upgraded.  Staff were very attentive - excellent attention to detail.  Beautiful room, perfectly presented and a pleasure to stay in.  If you fancy a taste of luxury and a treat for your stay in Dublin, then book into the Four Seasons.  As we were attending a wedding, we had a choice of hotels and are so pleased that we choose this hotel. Can honestly say that we could not have asked for more from the simple things like requesting room service to (the following morning) having our luggage and suit carriers swiftly taken from us and placed in the car.  Fabulous breakfast - must especially mention the omelette chef!  We understand that the hotel is currently undergoing a change of management - it was not obvious from the wonderful staff.  Cannot recommend highly enough.  Push the boat out - we did and are so glad.....",5,2014,12,10
205,Beautiful hotel with well trained friendly staff.,"Very nice hotel with beautiful décor and grounds.  Excellent facilities and full business suite of services.

Located in a relatively quiet and elegant part of Dublin. 10 minute cab ride from city center.",5,2014,12,10
205,Everything we expected and more....,"For a really special celebration, we recently stayed in The Four Seasons. It is not much to look at from the outside (dull red brick, modern build), but what an experience once we went through the portico.
The staff were highly organized (as you'd expect), the service seamless and the room was fabulous. Management had kindly upgraded us on account of our occasion (thanks a million, Rory, lovely personal touch and much appreciated).
We dined in the casual pub area and had breakfast on each of the two mornings of our stay. The 4-Seasons caters to its customer base really well and we felt very welcome indeed. The food options were really nice and the room appointed to the nth degree. We had a ball.
Thanks to the team. I have learned that the hotel will change its designation in 2015 as another francise operation will have tendered successfully. I know they will not be disappointed with the calibre of staff working at this fine world class hotel.",5,2014,12,08
205,Fabulous,"We stayed here for two nights and each was perfect. The bedroom was lovely, old-fashioned yes, but not undesirably so; it was not kitsch but quite tasteful. The bathroom was superb as was the size of the room. We actually only discovered we had a balcony on the second day; what a pity that we were staying in December!

Breakfast in the hotel was absolutely fantastic. It lacked nothing and I cannot think on how it could be improved.

The Lobby Lounge is nice, but The Whiskey Bar is nicer. We had a very enjoyable digestif in here on our first night. However, on our second night, there were no free tables. The one thing that the hotel lacks is a bar big enough to accommodate all the hotel residents. Not having seats for your customers, does not add exclusivity but rather reduces sales!

However, that's a minor issue. The third, and last day, was one of our birthdays. So I arranged for something to be sent up to room. We arrived back after breakfast to a lovely chocolate truffle cake on the table and upon leaving the staff wished him a Happy Birthday.

This is how you run a hotel, we will be back as soon as we can.",5,2014,12,08
205,Nice stay but dated could do witha facelift,"Stayed for a weekend with friend, got twin room which was large and large bathroom, friendly staff.  we ordered breakfast in room both mornings and it wasnt great and very expensive so not worth it, the four seasons are pulling out of ireland i heard in the next month.  and whoever takes over needs to give this hotel a major facelift. overall a nice staff with nice friendly staff.  but not 5 star",4,2014,12,08
205,"Lovely, superb quality main areas, decor or bedrooms a little old fashioned","Very impressive building in a prime location.  Just a short walk from the nearest train station. Plenty of buses passing. A very upmarket hotel. The main areas were delightful (as with so many Irish Hotels). It is also an extremely expensive hotel but that is the nature of this hotel -high quality -high prices.  The service was very good at all times.

My only (very slight) criticism is that the decor of the bedroom was (surprisingly) a little old fashioned. The bathroom tiles and fittings etc in the room were excellent. A giant TV too with an extremely good choice of channels (including sports channels) and well known movies to rent for the evening at a very fair price if you so choose.",5,2014,12,05
205,Fabulous Stay,"We received a gift of a one night stay in the Four Seasons from our children as well as tickets for the rugby match. The location is great for getting to The Aviva Stadium. I was disappointed when we arrived to find our room wasn't ready, despite having called earlier on to confirm check in times (from 3 o'clock on). We arrived at 3.45!
Despite this, I was delighted with our room - the bathroom was beautiful.
The staff were all lovely and very professional.
Because the room was booked for us, we presumed that breakfast was included. NO!! I realised this when I was presented with a bill for €56 for a full Irish and blueberry pancakes!",4,2014,12,03
205,Wonderful Few Days,"Just returned home from a couple of fabulously relaxing days in the Four Seasons.
I had to attend a meeting in Dublin but decided to bring along my Wife and 1 year old for a treat and some retail therapy. From the start the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, this was maintained throughout our stay which is some achievement for a Hotel of this size. There were some lovely touches along the way for Baby & Parents. Breakfast was a treat and savoured in the nicely spaced Restaurant each morning.
Due to the baby we mostly had room service ( Not nearly as expensive as I feared!) in the evenings and it was always extremely efficient and well presented, I can't stand lukewarm soup so was hesitant ordering, but it arrived piping hot along with everything else, Baby was particularly pleased with the Clare Island Salmon dish and devoured it along with Mother.
Had our first swim in the mercifully quiet pool with baby as well and after some initial trepidation at the massive bath,  by the third day it was a real treat for her.

I'd recommend the Hotel for couples looking for a little pampering and shopping pre-chrismas or to blow away January blues, we hadn't been away for a night since January and wouldn't normally frequent 5 star Hotels but it was worth every penny for the happy faces on departure of my two ladies and the much needed brownie points after a very busy year at work.
My parents stayed last year and also loved it so thanks to them for the recommendation.",5,2014,12,03
205,This is a bar only review,"I am posting a personal view of a recent visit to the bar, which I believe I am allowed to do, contrary to certain members opinions. The door man was extremely pleasant, however when we went into the bar we were ignored by 5 members of staff for ten minutes before getting served. the bar area was cluttered and the glass shelves were thick with dust, which is not what i would expect from a top class hotel. this is merely an observation and would put me off staying here. If you do not agree with my review that's fine but please do not contact me to give abuse. that is childish and unnecessary. This site is for personal experiences. good and bad",1,2014,12,01
205,"Changing Hands, Less than I expected from a Four Seasons","Having stayed at other Four Seasons in the past, I was willing to sacrifice proximity for luxury/pampering. (Four Seasons is outside of the main part of Dublin.) Unfortunately, only half of that trade off came true. We were in fact out of the city center, but the service and accommodations were only ok.  Don't get me wrong, there was nothing horrible, but, there was nothing delightful. We  stayed mid October when there weren't too many travelers. So being busy was not a reason for the lack of Four Seasons level service.  Also, ***IMPORTANT*** at check-in we were informed that the hotel would no longer be a Four Seasons after the new year. They are changing ownership at this location. This certainly accounts for all the deferred maintenance and upgrades that were past due. There are better options for the money.",3,2014,11,27
205,South side of the city centre but consistent ,"Consistent good quality venue with real hospitality, whilst it doesn't have the central location of the shelbourne it's relaxed professional warm environment draws me back every year, polite staff and good service. Well worth going south of of the Liffey and a taxi ride away from the city centre ",4,2014,11,25
205,Consistent Four Seasons Quality,"It's a Four Seasons and you get everything you'd expect.  Excellent service, quality food and drinks, outstanding concierge services, expensive and located in a less touristy/more businessy district.  We didn't want to stay in an unknown brand hotel in the chaos of the Dublin's nightlife so we chose the Four Season at the last minute. Like any Four Season around the world, they have perfected their offerings to be consistent.  You know exactly what you are getting and this location was no different.",5,2014,11,24
205,Disappointed,"We stayed for a weekend in November when the hotel was very busy due to a rugby international. Upon arrival, we were directed to a car park which was full so we spent 10 minutes waiting for a space and  reversing back and forth until getting attention to get out of the car park again.
Our room was excellent. Saturday morning arrived and we headed down to breakfast and a terrible experience. No tables were available so we were asked to wait in the bar and have a coffee as it would be 15 minutes. We could see lots of tables but there didn't seem to be staff to clear them. In the bar there was no coffee and when it did arrive there were no cups. We eventually were moved into the breakfast room 25 minutes after arrival to find juice but no glasses. We proceeded to the hot buffet where there was food but no plates. When plates arrived they were too hot to handle. When we sat down the breakfast was ok, as was the poor bread selection. Having stayed here earlier in the year the breakfast was the thing we were looking forward to most.
Credit where credit's due though. On Sunday morning the chaos was relieved by the use of an extra room for breakfast. Why could this not have been done 24 hours earlier if the hotel was at full capacity?
Door staff and concierge were friendly and helpful. Everything about the weekend was 5 star except for Saturday breakfast.",4,2014,11,24
205,Full of luxury,Kids loved the personalised cookies.  Location was great to go into Dublin City and the staff are very friendly.  The beds are very comfortable four of us slept in the same bed it was great and will return back again.,5,2014,11,24
205,Best hotel in Dublin - if the location suits you.,"Good Four Seasons standard on everything. Staff is sometimes a little bit slower than at the best Four Seasons hotels, the dining room is not perfect, neither is the bar. But it's the best hotel in Dublin, if you don't need a more central location.",5,2014,11,23
205,six nights in October,"I stayed at the Dublin Four Seasons for 6 nights at the end of October.  As I arrived very early from L.A. the room was not ready but the staff were very accommodating and I got into an excellent room in the early afternoon.  I requested in - room coffee and tea making ability and an iron, These should have been in the room in my opinion, but they promptly brought up a kettle and tea and coffee and an iron and ironing board.  The room was beautifully furnished and very quiet.  The location was a distance from the city center but this did allow for a quiet environment and the nearby restaurants were excellent and probably better than tourist catering restaurants found in the center of town. Staff were friendly and efficient.  The hotel will no longer be a Four Seasons operation at the end of this year.  New management will need to work hard to maintain the same level of service.  I only stayed at the hotel because of the Four Seasons brand - they do insist that their hotels meet the highest standards.",5,2014,11,22
205,rugby stay,"fabulous location for the Aviva stadium , within walking distance to all the facilities you require. Great atmosphere. We ate in the bar and was a large crowd and staff went out of their way to get us extra seats and additional table so we could dine together. You couldn't fault the food or the staff . Great hotel and a wonderful breakfast the next morning , you could graze over breakfast for as long as you desire.",5,2014,11,21
205,Good stay,"This hotel is in a nice quite location,good area, not to far from center of Dublin. The rooms are very big and comfortable decorated in a classic style. 
Bathrooms are huge and super nice. 
Staff is mostly nice and friendly, but not all of them are professional. 
Restaurant is very nice with a quite and cozy atmosphere. Food here is lovely, but they don't have the best selection of vine.",4,2014,11,19
205,Left happy,"My family and I visited Dublin for the first time this past weekend and were very excited to stay in a Four Seasons.  It became obvious, very early on, that while this is a very nice hotel- with nice rooms, excellent housekeeping and good amenities, it was not going to be perfect from beginning to end.  We were baffled by the time it took the kitchen to bring out a simple breakfast and then even more confused when the bill showed up (both mornings!) with errors as to what was ordered.  We were most disappointed when, after a dinner out,  we elected to bring our 2 children back to the hotel for desert only to be seated and then forgotten by the staff and left waiting with menus in hand for 20-25 minutes.  An excellent manager named Evelina heard we'd left the lounge to try to get service from our room and she had the children's desert sent up along with a cheese plate and a note that desert had been taken off our bill.  She even came up to us the next morning to see that we were happy!!!  Evelina, you made that hotel experience a good one for us by showing you cared and we very much appreciate that.",4,2014,11,17
205,True class,"A recent overnight stay, my first in the Four Seasons, got off to a dismal start when upon arriving in our room we discovered a dog bowl and dogfood.  In addition, our request for feather free beding had gone unheeded.  Difficult to describe the disappointment that I and my 80 year old mother experienced.  The matter was escalated to Rory who introduced himself as Assistant Manager.  He was swift and exceptional in his response, upgrading us to a suite and refusing to accept payment for the soup and wine we had in the lounge as we awaited the allocation of a new room.  Result.....two very disgruntled guests were completely won over,  Well done Rory.  Credit to you and the Four Seaons for a great recovery that left us willing to return and able to recommend to others.",4,2014,11,15
205,Wonderful hotel with wonderful staff,"We arrived several hours late in the early hours of the morning from London with 3 children (one baby) and no baggage thanks to our airline.

The staff were so accommodating - nappies were found, additional toiletries for everyone and a big plate of cookies and marshmallows were waiting in the room! This put the first smile on the kids faces for a while.

The room was large and spacious and the swimming pool a great size. The hotel is not in the centre of the city, but in a lovely neighbourhood and only a short cab or bus ride to town. It is also on the DART train line which made getting down the coast for a day trip very easy. 

The thing that made what could have been a horrible stay (we were without our bags for 2 of the 3 days) into a memorable stay for all the right reasons were the wonderful staff.",5,2014,11,15
205,Halloween Weekend,I work in Switzerland and coming back for the weekend to meet my hustand and son to stay in 4 seasons was great. On arrival a huge welcome from staff very friendly. I go upgraded to a junior suite it was perfect. I found the hotel extremely child friendly which is always a plus. I would recommend this hotel to stay as it is relaxing. The resturant was very nice and also breakfast which was included was lovely also.,4,2014,11,14
205,"Fab hotel, fab service","We recently stayed at The Four Seasons in Dublin and whilst it is a little outside of the centre (a 7 - 10 minute cab ride) the service and quality of stay more than made up for the location.  The rooms are large and the bathrooms are spacious and the amenities were of usual Four Seasons quality.  We needed an ironing board and it arrived within minutes of asking; this efficiency was met with every request.  
The staff were amazing too and so friendly, perhaps it was the irish character that shone through as they were always smiling and happy to put themselves out to help and make your stay great.  
Our flight back to London City was not until 5.25pm and a late checkout of 3.15pm was not a problem so we were able to make use of the facilities and then freshen up before we left.  
Breakfast buffet was substantial and the breakfast room was light and airy with a view onto a courtyard.  
The swimming pool is long enough to do lengths and there is a well equipped gym next to the pool.  
",5,2014,11,14
205,excellent as always,"stayed here for 3 nights during November and having stayed in the four seasons numerous times over the years, it is safe to say it is still our favourite hotel in Dublin.  Service fabulous staff fabulous, breakfast fantastic.  The only comment on the slightly negative front I would make would be that the dining menu is the same for lunch and dinner in both restaurants and can get rather tedious.",5,2014,11,12
205,Always consistent,"I have stayed in this hotel a number of times and have always received the same consistent high standard. The staff are well trained and efficient. Try the hot chocolate! It is delicious and well priced compared with the cost of a cup of tea! I am not a fan of the Ice bar that so many people rave about and was disappointed that this was the residents late night bar on this occasion.I find it uninviting with little to no seating or atmosphere and I did not stay long. Breakfast was delicious but service slow. As I was in no hurry this didn't really bother me. 
The bedrooms are very comfortable with great bedding as you would expect from a hotel of this calibre.",5,2014,11,11
205,Pleasant stay but hardly awesome,"Here is another example of an Irish hotel unable to shake off the celtic tiger legacy with which it became synonomous- vulgar ostentation, in-your-face image and very little authentically Irish about the experience.
The hotel , while operationally very effective and efficient lacked ""soul""",3,2014,11,11
205,FAULTLESS,"Another fantastic stay in possibly the finest hotel in Ireland, a warm welcome from all the staff on arrival as usual and very tasty meal that night in hotel, breakfast still superb. Got a upgrade to a suite and hardly left it all weekend, love this place, a few changes on the horizon I hear and I would expect all to the good",5,2014,11,09
205,Family wedding was amazing,"I have been here for lunch a few years ago and remembered it was wonderful, but the wedding party had exceptional service. Usually you can be overlooked when you eat in a party of more than eight but the staff seemed to be quick and efficient and were filling glasses before they needed to be asked. The food and drink was superb and the surroundings made for a wonderful day. Will be staying here next time we come to Dublin.",5,2014,11,08
205,Luxurious!!!,"luxury luxury luxury!!! Extremely beautiful areas, hotel and rooms .Nice decoration stylish  furniture.Staff elegant , helpful available .Restaurant of high quality and taste!We would like to come back again and live the same Nice experience!",5,2014,11,05
205,Consistently excellent--my home away from home!,"I stayed there three times in the past two weeks-each time for one night only. As always, they know when I'm coming, the room is ready and the warmth is obvious. I've been staying here since it opened and it's among my favorite places in the World! Lucius, Rory or Alan know me well and always manage to have a nice room. The lobby is a terrific place to arrange short meetings, lunch and even dinner (though I want the Restaurant back). The Bar is second to none in terms of professionalism, range, warmth and genuine good company. I always use the pool (rather small) for exercise (it's about 120 laps to get a mile in!) and the staff could not be more accommodating. On this trip I left laundry twice for collection when I returned and also left a bag for storage while I went off to Europe for a few days. As always, the Concierge handles everything with a smile. Very helpful on printing boarding passes, arranging Restaurants etc. looking forward to returning end of the month.",5,2014,11,04
205,Gorgeous and luxurious,"Had an overnight stay at the weekend and the staff and facilities are second to none. From luxury bathrobes and fruit and creams in the swimming areas to the staff ""going the extra mile"" in giving us free water for our room to booking outings for us. The room was beautiful and the bed one of the comfiest I have ever stayed in",5,2014,11,04
205,Stunning on every level.,"From the huge rooms to the extremely attentive staff this hotel lived up to all our expectations.  The pool area was small but very relaxing, loads of loungers and towels as well as complimentary teas, the breakfast was huge in a beautiful restaurant, the staff were very friendly and helpful. We will certainly return and hope that who ever takes it over next year keeps the same standards that we experienced last weekend.",5,2014,11,04
205,Great hotel if a little far from the centre,"We stayed at The Four Seasons recently for a long weekend. It is a lovely hotel with spacious rooms that are very well equipped and comfortable.
Service is first class everywhere in the hotel. A lovely bar that serves food and has an amazing buzz in the evenings.
My only comment would be is that the hotel is quite a walk from the centre of Dublin but if you like walking as we do then it's no bother. Of course you can get a cab but you miss some lovely scenery.",5,2014,11,04
205,"Great Hotel, Poor Location","We really enjoyed our four nights at the Four Seasons. Beautiful, upscale hotel. Our room was very comfortable and the comfort of the bedding was excellent. The pool and spa area downstairs were exceptionally nice areas. The concierge staff was particularly helpful in booking us events in the downtown. We ate breakfast each morning and it was a very positive experience with good food choices and very attentive service. However, check in was not the best experience and we usually we found only one person working the desk for both check in and billing. Twice we had a ten minute wait to take care of our business. The hotel seems to appeal mostly to conference and business travelers. Always very busy and noisy. At times it was so busy there was a 10-20 wait for a taxi. The lobby area has very limited seating if you are waiting for friends etc. I think the biggest drawback is the location which is a ten minute taxi drive from the city center. This is actually a plus in some aspects as the fare was only around 10 euros and the taxi drivers the most friendly anywhere we have traveled. Each taxi trip was a education into the hearts and minds of the Irish people.",4,2014,11,03
205,In a class of it's own!,"I have stayed in The Four Seasons, Ballsbridge on three occasions.  

The first time I stayed was in 2012 and loved the fabulous valet service for parking on my arrival, I was running late that day so it was great to have the car taken care of.

This is a very stylish hotel and has a lovely feel about it with vases of fresh flowers everywhere and all staff members take the time to smile or say hello.

The bedrooms are beautifully decorated with large bathrooms, deep baths and quality toiletries, robes and slippers.

My last visit to the Four Seasons was in June as I was in Dublin for a conference.  I was upgraded to a suite - a real treat.  As I was on my own I availed of In-Room Dining for dinner.  I ordered monkfish with dauphinois potatoes - delicious and cooked to perfection!  Breakfast is an experience in itself with absolutely everything you could imagine for breakfast being available and great coffee also!

In the past I have also eaten in the hotel's Lobby Lounge and had drinks in the Ice Bar both of which have a wonderful atmosphere.

I have not had an opportunity to use the hotel's spa but I have used the pool on one occasion and loved it.  All areas are spotlessly clean and well maintained.

I would highly recommend the Four Seasons if overnighting in Dublin, it's a real treat and I look forward to my next visit again soon.

",5,2014,11,03
205,Surely the finest stay in Dublin?,"The quality of the service from this hotel starts long before you arrive. I had booked online but had a small clarification requirement that meant I had to call them. The phone was answered promptly and the person with whom I spoke couldn't have been more helpful. She took some extra details and ensured that our stay would be even better.

Checkin was efficient and exceptionally courteous. We complicated things by having some people arrive at different times, but the staff dealt with this seamlessly and couldn't have been more helpful even facilitating an early check-in.

The hotel itself is spotless and the decor simply beautiful. The rooms just the same. Spacious and in perfect condition. My one gripe would be the quality of the in-room entertainment. The system was a bit 'low quality' and the reception on some standard channels pretty poor. I wouldn't have expected anything less than high quality HD, but this was not to be, in our room at least.

The spa: excellent, although I've certainly enjoyed more luxurious hotel spas for this price point. The bar area: excellent with great friendly service even on a business weekend evening.

A lovely touch was the welcome gifts for the children and the surprise in the evening.

Overall, this is a really classy hotel, in a great location, almost without fault. Expect to pay for it though, but if you're looking at The Four Seasons seriously, you'll know and be prepared for that already.",5,2014,11,02
205,Luxurious hotel,"Just spent three nights in this hotel as a birthday treat. The hotel is next door to the RDS facility and arena. The hotel staff were attentive and nothing too much trouble. Within minutes of arriving having told the receptionist we were staying in Dublin to celebrate my birthday, a Happy Birthday chocolate mousse was delivered to our room, a thoughtful touch. The room was large as was the marble bathroom which had a bath and a shower, and both rooms and the public areas were spotlessly clean. Complimentary tea and coffee facilities were provided upon request. The hotel is a 45 minute leisurely stroll from the City Centre and Grafton Street, the main shopping area and a further 15 minutes walk to the Guiness Storehouse and Jameson distillery.
There is an Air Coach that travels directly from the airport to outside the hotel and from the hotel back to the airport every hour 24/7 at a reasonable fare.",5,2014,11,02
205,excellent hotel,"Brilliant hotel especially if your winding down and relaxing before / after Dublin marathon. Hotel is close to RDS  marathon expo. Hotel staff excellent, brilliant spa facilities. Have come to Four Seasons Hotel Dublin for the last few years and will do so.",5,2014,10,31
205,Getting better,"Just back from a short two day visit, as usual this hotel delivers comfortable beds and spotlessly clean .

Breakfast has got better, the young Spanish waiter Jon was excellent, I would say this young chap will go far if he stays in this business a good eye to detail.

The staff seem settled now after a period of uncertainity , this is now reflecting on their standard of service, excellent location , excellent staff, and excellent facilities.",5,2014,10,28
205,I recently had 10 days at this hotel. Involving a conference & some leasure days either side. Couldn't fault it.,"I recently had 10 days at this hotel. Involving a conference & some leasure days either side. The Conference was handled very well. Couldn't fault their handling of that. As for the liesure days, I have a good nose for a tourist trap and tend to avoid those. Went to the local rugby game, next door to the hotel. Tickets at gate and walk straight in, fantastic. Did the Howth Loop Walk. Too easy to get to on the DART. Saw some country side, a great experience. Local Live Music scene on Camden Street, very good. All these suggested by service staff in the bar or dining room. They were great. Get them talking and you'll uncover some real gems. They were happy to be engaged.",5,2014,10,27
205,Loved every minute of our stay at the Four Seasons Hotel.,"I and my two daughters spent 10 wonderful days touring Ireland.  We used the Four Seasons Hotel as our base.  Our every need was accommodated.  The room was spacious for three women.  We enjoyed our meals in the Dining room, in the sitting room area and in the Whiskey Bar.  One late night tired and hungry we dined in our room.  I would stay again and highly recommend the Four Seasons Hotel to anyone traveling to Ireland.",5,2014,10,27
205,Very good again,"Fourth stay here ....everything top class each time
Nothing too much trouble
Friendly service
Excellent bar/lounge
Will stay again but....
Changing management from Four Seasons in December so check before going in New Year",5,2014,10,26
205,Excellence in Dublin,"Fantastic 2 night stay in a tree shrouded neighborhood of Dublin. The well
trained staff spoiled us with complimentary early and late check in/out,
as well as chauffeur driven service in a BMW limo to area restaurants. This
hotel will definitely be our home away from home when in Dublin!",5,2014,10,25
205,Wonderful luxurious stay,My husband and I had a relaxed and enjoyable night at Four Seasons Hotel. It was relaxed throughout. From the moment we booked in the attention to detail was unbelievable. We were impressed by all the little extra touches. I would not like to spoil the surprise just go there any experience it.,5,2014,10,24
205,beyond expectations,"A couple of weeks ago I spent  two nights there... It was my first time in a Four Seasons hotel and, on the basis of this experience, i hope I will have more opportunities to enjoy the excellent facilities of such hotels. Everything was impeccable: reception , concierge, room, friendliness of staff and general atmosphere.
A htel to be highly recommended.",5,2014,10,24
205,very enjoyable,"We booked late on Saturday evening & apparently got the last room. The room & bathroom were immaculate bright and airy. Very comfortable. The staff were very efficient and friendly. The bar man was knowledgeable about his trade even knowing the length of the lines from the beer keg to the tap. (impressive) We did have a fifteen wait for breakfast in the morning as the dining room was full and we did not get our ordered newspaper in the morning. The flag ship bar 'The ice bar"" had two people in it on Saturday night at 11.30pm, both the barmen. Disappointing",4,2014,10,21
205,Good location and Excellent Service,"Very good location in quiet area yet not far from the city center. 
Hotel is of high standard and staff were very helpful and welcoming.
Highly recommended hotel.
Room was immaculately cleans and spacious.",5,2014,10,20
205,Top notch,"We recently spent a couple days here.  This was my first experience in a Four Seasons, but was really looking forward to it.  I have to say, it met all my expectations for a 5 star hotel.  The rooms were spacious and exceptionally clean.  Staff were very helpful and friendly.  We had drinks in the bar and then ate in the restaurant where the food was outstanding and service was great.  The hotel is beautifully decorated with fresh flowers everywhere.  We had to leave for the airport at 4:30 in the morning.  They had breakfast to go for us and a shuttle waiting.  It was a great stay.",5,2014,10,19
205,Overall good experience with one minus,"We stayed 6 nights at the Four Seasons Dublin during an enjoyable autumn visit.  The hotel is located in the Ballsbridge neighborhood, close to the British and US embassies, about a 10 minute ride from the city center.  Dublin Bus, DART and Aircoach (airport) pickup stations all nearby.  We arrived early and the front desk was able to secure a room for us right away.  Their computer system was down temporarily and they were unable to issue us the card keys to our room.  The manager, a thoroughly professional and competent young man from Indonesia, immediately offered to take us to our room and send the keys up later.  We accepted.  Our room, on the 4th floor, was spacious, light and airy, facing the main entrance of the hotel.  King size bed was comfortable with deluxe linen.  Housekeeping was impeccable throughout the stay, room, bathroom and towels cleaned and refreshed daily. We asked for the complimentary in-room tea and coffee service, and also silverware for a takeout dinner one evening, both of which were delivered by courteous staff.  The one minus during our stay was the concierge service for our last evening, a Saturday.  We wanted to go out for a special final night dinner.  We picked 2 restaurants from the TA reviews, both smaller eateries focused on local ingredients and excellent cooking.  We asked the concierge to help make a reservation.  He called back saying neither had availability during our requested time, which we understood given it was last minute, a Saturday night, and the eateries are small.  We then asked the concierge to suggest a restaurant similar to the 2 we had picked, i.e., smaller restaurants known for excellent food, that special “find"".  Without missing a beat, he suggested Cleaver East in the Temple Bar district.  As it turns out, Cleaver East is far from a small intimate restaurant.  Instead, it is a loud, noisy hipster bar with small plates.  The food suggested a chef who lacked depth and experience.  The dishes showed while he had ideas, dishes failed in execution and flavors did not come together successfully, e.g., crab cannelloni, lobster dumplings. We can’t help feeling the concierge was a poor listener and our request for a small restaurant utterly failed to register with him.",4,2014,10,19
205,Top notch,"we stayed here when we arrived 10 days ago and again after we golfed around Ireland.  Everything has been first class, plus we got a room suite upgrade.  Couldn't be better, great breakfast, good bar, great service, everything you expect at Four Seasons.  Sorry to hear hotel is changing hands, staff is obviously concerned.",5,2014,10,19
205,Beautiful hotel and terrific staff,Hosted an event and stayed in the hotel.  Found staff to be very professional and attentive.  Beautiful property & accommodations.  We dined in the Reading Room which had nice food and relaxed atmosphere.,4,2014,10,19
205,Good experience,"We stayed here for 2 nights in early October just as we arrived in Ireland. Everything was fine but just a bit off. Concierge was good, not great. Downside to the hotel also is it's distance from the heart of the city. ",4,2014,10,18
205,Excellent Hotel,"The hotel is in a quiet area and is beautifully appointed. From the moment you arrive and experience the fabulous valet service for parking , through to the moment you check out and experience the fond farewell of the reception team, you are treated as a very welcomed old friend.",5,2014,10,17
205,Gone down,"I stayed last night in a junior suite after a function. A letter was left by the management to say the Four Seasons is closing! From Dec 31st this Dublin Hotel will be re-branded.

I am sorry, and I think it was beginning to show, the place was just not as good as on my last stay.

Earwig in the dressing gown, had to ask and wait for the tea tray/ kettle. Little things, just a slightly sad atmosphere .",3,2014,10,17
205,beautiful hotel and good location,I recently stayed for one night on business.I would have given 5 stars only that the service at breakfast was poor; the coffee and toast arrived late . I may not have paid too much attention if I had been staying elsewhere but you expect a lot when you stay at the four seasons. Otherwise it was a lovely experience. beautiful interior and good service in the bar lounge area and at reception. The location is excellent .,4,2014,10,17
205,Not the best of Four Seasons,"I am not a regular in Four Seasons' hotels, but the few times I have stayed in their hotels, it has been magic.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with the Dublin hotel:  the room was large, well-appointed, well-lit and comfortable.  The dining was wonderful.  Staff was courteous and helpful.  The pool is small, but beautiful.  Yet we booked on a ""3-for-2"" deal and noted how obviously other rooms received complimentary water bottles and chocolates, while our room did not.  We saw an older woman struggle to open the front door and there was no one to help her.  My husband received a water bottle after a run ""only"" 2 of 3 times.  Nothing here can be a complaint...it just didn't have that Four Seasons' magic.",4,2014,10,16
205,Fantastic Service,"I was involved in organising an event at the Four Seaons last week.  From the start all the staff were extremely helpful and that made our jobs so much easier.  The meeting space was absolutely perfect for our requirements.  There is a large ballroom that can be designed in various layouts and there are two large breakout areas for tea/coffee, exhibit booths etc.  There are three good size breakouts and a great boardroom too.  At the far end there is another ballroom too should you require it.  We found this perfect as it meant that everything for the meetings was all in one area.

On the first night we had an opening reception in the Ice Bar which was fantastic.  It's a beautiful space and really bright and airy.  Again the staff were brilliant and the selection of food was great.

I stayed for one night and my room was very comfortable.  Possibly the best bed I have ever slept in - just so cosy and perfect.

All the food I had during our time there was delicious and well thought out.  

All in all I would highly recommend the Four Seasons for an event.  The location was great for our overseas visitors who had brought spouses as they were able to go off exploring the city while their other-halves were at work.  The staff really are wonderful and really care about making the event go smoothly.

From a personal point of view I would love to go back and crawl in to that cosy bed anytime!",5,2014,10,14
205,Fantastic stay,"My family and I stayed recently at the four seasons and it was fantastic. The staff were friendly and helpful, the breakfast spread was very enjoyable . We had a family suite and had lots of space which my boys loved. The beds were luxurious. Had a lovely time.",4,2014,10,13
205,Dinner is wonderful!!!,Just in from a wonderful evening spent in the Four Seasons Hotel for Dinner with the family. The service is excellent and you are made feel very special from the moment you arrive. Excellent choice on the menu particularly the Fish selection.,5,2014,10,12
205,"Great hotel, fantastic staff & service","We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights with our children (5 & 2) and upgraded to a junior suite, as we were offered a good deal upon check-in.
The staff were very attentive, friendly, helpful and most importantly took the time to talk to and interact with our young children.  This included reception, concierge, restaurant and hotel chauffeur, who all made an impression, including a tour of the kitchens for the kids (with some jellies thrown in).
The room was large, spacious, clean and even included children's bathrobes, which went down well.  As you came in, there was a walk-in wardrobe on the left and a large bathroom with bath, separate shower and separate toilet room on the right.  The bedroom itself was very large with a king size bed and another double sofa bed, ample space for the 4 of us.

Breakfast on the first morning was a bit disappointing.  They got our order wrong, then brought items in dribs and drabs, so we ended up eating mostly a cold breakfast and tea/coffee & toast didn't arrive until we were almost finished our breakfast.  Otherwise the food was enjoyable.

The pool was a lovely addition for a hotel so close to the city and we all enjoyed it.  They have herbal teas and dried fruit & nuts in the lobby area of the spa/pool which was nice after a swim.  The only suggestion I would have is that it might be beneficial for guests if the spa relaxation area was not in the changing rooms, because I felt quite conscious getting two small children changed a few feet from people trying to relax pre or post treatment.
We would definitely go back to this hotel again",4,2014,10,09
205,Some updates needed,"I stayed here with a friend in July. 

The common areas are very nice, the staff are very friendly and helpful, or at least most are. The rooms are fine, nothing special, although the bathrooms are pretty fabulous.

The location isn't great, you are much better off staying in one of the high end hotels in town, though of course it depends on what you are looking for. But for me, constantly having to get in a taxi to go anywhere is not only expensive but annoying. 

My low score is mostly based on our spa experience, way below par for a hotel of this standard. It seriously needs updating. The steam room was quite off-putting in fact with the cracked ceiling and dodgy tiling, I couldn't get out of there soon enough because it just felt unclean. The Sauna was barely functioning and the bucket that should normally contain water was empty. The pool area was run down too. I was expecting much better especially as we had been looking forward to that part of our stay.",3,2014,10,09
205,"Staff were warm and courteous at every turn.  The hotels location is excellent - quiet, upscale.  Room was superb!","First trip to Dublin for business.  Hotel is exceptional.  From arrival to departure the staff was warm courteous, and truly engaged with the guests.  The bar tender the four evenings we were there was superb.  Breakfast was very good and pricing was as anticipated.  The guest rooms are large for the area and superbly appointed.  The bathroom is lavish and well lit.  The soaking tub was just what I wanted.  I would highly recommend this hotel for business or leisure travel for couples.  It is about 1.5 miles to nightlife, Trinity College, etc. / a 5 min cab ride.  There are a few restaurants and pubs close by that were fine.",5,2014,10,08
205,Beautiful hotel,"We just returned from 2 nights here with our 2 small children. We had booked 2 nights but unfortunately there was a mistake with our booking and the hotel could only accommodate us for 1 night. Normally this would be a disaster, but to be honest  the problem could not have been handled better. We were apologised to profusely and offered complimentary dinner, breakfast and also the next night was free of charge( at another top Dublin hotel). Yes it was a slight inconvenience to move hotels, but Four Seasons Dublin were amazing. Thanks for looking after us! The room at Four Seasons was fantastic( Landsowne Suite)... Huge! Great pool and spa area. Breakfast was divine! We will return!",5,2014,10,07
205,Afternoon Tea - good but not the best,"Afternoon tea is one of those things that you are allowed be picky, typically you are paying about €40 a head for a plate of sambos and buns with a cuppa tea. For me, it’s more about the company, the ambiance, and getting treated a bit like a princess with nice delicate nibbles. 
I tried calling around the usual spots about 5 days prior and all of them were booked out at least 3 months in advance, the Shelbourne, Merrion etc so luckily we got the 4 Seasons on Saturday at 3pm. They were really helpful on the phone confirming the reservation, asking if it was a special occasion and letting us know that it was a match day so there would be traffic as we were leaving. 
As I typically don’t frequent the 4 Seasons Hotel, it was nice for somewhere different, parking was available with 2hrs free when you dine there. The room didn’t have the WOW factor as it is a room off the main entrance so just behind the lobby, however the conservatory let great light in and had a lovely view of a water feature and small garden. Room was spacious and had a variety of diners there for drinks or lunch, nobody rowdy and drunk and no screaming kids a huge plus for a relaxing afternoon. We each ordered the normal tea option (there were options to have Champagne  for €15+ a glass instead of tea) 
The tea: served nicely but china was not anything special. 
The food: displayed in huge box shelves, looked great but due to the size of the tables they took over and were a bit awkward to get at anything (you had to ask someone to pass you something for fear the whole thing would fall off or you would need to stand up and walk around the table). The food certainly was something to talk about…NOT something you could ever re-create at home so in that way it was worth the experience. The positives the food tasted really fresh, a lot of effort went into each individual item and each was different to the last. There was an even amount of everything so everyone could ‘have a go’. My ONLY down side was that there weren't as many savories as I would have liked. There was a real mixture of sweet and savory so alot of the savory was serves with a sweet detail ie sweet coconut macaroon style base filled with foie gras and granache chocolate so don’t expect triangle sambos with ham and cheese. There was also a plate of mini scones with cream and preserves.
The staff were trained to perfection, the bright sunlight shone through the glass, the food was something to talk about as it was all so unusual…(the food was different but it wasn’t something I would have a second helping of) I was really happy with the day and we ended up staying for 3+ hours eating and drinking tea. They even brought over a special tray of chocolates as it was my godmothers birthday. To me…this is the quintessential modern take on afternoon tea. It was good value for money (in afternoon tea terms) and gave us a really different experience than traditional afternoon tea. The staff made us feel really special and looked after. I would certainly recommend this if you are staying in the hotel or if you are looking for a special treat in the area. For the menu click here (although we had a variation of this so may change on the day depending on what is available) http://www.fourseasons.com/dublin/dining/restaurants/lobby_lounge/afternoon_tea/ 

Another point we ended up paying €6 for parking (as we ended up staying an additional hour and 15mintues so watch the clock and stay an even hour or you have to pay for the next hour too)",4,2014,10,07
205,Couldnt have been better.  A cut above other luxury hotels in Dublin in which we have stayed.,"Fantastic.  From the hotel decor, room sizes and general atmosphere to the attentiveness of the staff - this was a different class to other similarly priced hotels in Dublin which we have stayed in in the past.",5,2014,10,07
205,A beautiful hotel with very efficient and friendly staff.,I stayed two nights in this hotel for a conference. The food and service were amazing. The breakfast was delicious and the waiters were particularly attentive. I have been travelling for business for over 20 years and have rarely experienced such professional service.,5,2014,10,07
205,Business Event,"I had a great stay in the Four Season Hotel at a recent Business Event. Service from front desk, the Event itself that was held in the hotel, after dinner bar, breakfast. It was all given with great personal service and I was felt special by excellent staff from the first moment. The quality of the rooms are excellent.",5,2014,10,06
205,A 3 star Four Seasons,"We have just come back from staying here for 3 nights....a party of 3 Adults and 1 child, staying in 2 standard rooms. 
We arrived after a long haul flight, and pulled up at the hotel, no doorman to open our taxi door, or to help with luggage in the the pouring rain. Not a good start. Reception was busy, but we were attended to quite quickly, but had no offer of help with our luggage to our room! We had booked 2 rooms, and even though they were on the same floor they weren't adjoining (which they could have been). Room 311 was located on the 3rd floor overlooking the front of the hotel and had a small balcony. The Ice bar was full of the after work crowd and from our room we could hear the noise with the balcony doors open. However from our other room 313, the noise could be heard with the balcony doors shut, and it was only 6pm!! We had booked an additional bed for our son, which hadn't been put in the room, and we had to call down for it as well. The room was chintzy but pleasant enough, however attention to detail wasn't great. The ceiling had obviously been painted and the paint was over the light fitting. No tea/coffee making facilities, and when we asked for that we were served room service tea at 20 euros. After refusing that, a kettle and a selection of teas was brought to the room. We also had the delight of someone else's dry cleaning hanging in the wardrobe on arrival!! This resulted in more phone calls for the items to be taken away.....god knows if they ever were reunited with their rightful owner. We started to think why we had chosen to stay here. We didn't eat at the hotel at all over the weekend, as we found some charming local restaurants and bars. The only time we actually used the Whisky Bar at the hotel, it was full of ladies celebrating a hen party, in very tacky outfits and not what I expected at all. We also had to move rooms due to the noise of Ice Bar which went on until the early hours. Concierge were unhelpful and not very knowledgeable, and when we asked for a restaurant for local food, we were sent to a bar serving pizzas and burgers. The only pleasant member of staff who actually gave a great recommendation was the limo driver who took us to a great place in town to have breakfast. I would say for anyone who has stayed at a Four Season hotel before, to think carefully as we expected tranquility and high service which we didn't receive. Also to be wary of location as we had to taxi into town at 10-15 euros a time. Checkout was just as agonising, and ordering a taxi was horrendous, with the multi national staff not relaying what was happening. Overall, I wouldn't hurry back. 99% of the staff couldn't give you the time of day, and I think Dublin have better hotels offering the kind of service we expect in a better location. Shame, as other Four Seasons have lived up to the high standard we expect of them.",3,2014,10,06
205,A Sanctuary,"Stayed for one night with my husband. 
Check- in very smooth. Incredibly friendly yet professional which was the case with all the staff. 
We had a superior double room. Bed very comfortable and all amenities as expected for a Four Seasons. Love the l'occitane toiletries. Robes & slippers provided. Tea & coffee making facilities available in request- would prefer them just to be in the room, rather than having to phone for them ( my only negative !)
Bathroom was beautiful with a separate toilet area. Lovely deep bath with a separate shower area. 
Was pleased to see free wifi for 2 devices provided. 
Spa- didn't have a treatment as I hadn't booked in advance and they were fully booked. Had a very relaxing afternoon at the pool, jacuzzi and steam room. A sanctuary in a city!
Breakfast was so relaxing in a beautiful room with excellent staff. Cold & hot buffet, with all food cooked and presented to a high standard. 
A great atmosphere in the hotel - whoever trains & manages the staff does a first class job! Truly outstanding. 
We will definitely return if staying in this part of Dublin. Perfect for the RDS where we were visiting. 
",5,2014,10,06
205,Excellent Experience,"When we checked in...we asked for a room with a good view...we were given a room on the 4th level facing the Front of the Hotel (dead center) with views of the water
The rooms were excellent, clean with all the possible amenities 
The Concierge and Bell boy service was excellent and Four Seasons does offer a courtesy limo service to City Center which is the place to be. The Hotel is about a 25 minute ride from the Airport by way of the Tunnel 
All staff go out of their way to help
There is a small boutique shop in the Hotel and they have some excellent items reasonably priced

Faboulous experience",5,2014,10,04
205,Service Luxury Friendly,"I was in the hotel the whole week organising a conference for a major credit card brand,and spent twelve hours a day in and around the businnes centre having a lot of contact with staff of all level,the kindness and friendlyness,the will to help was a oncz in a lifetime experience,almost everythin possible with a big smile from hard working people making this hotel one of the best places for coferencing evr encountered.Great food also,becaus of the size of the confernce I was unable to have a room so i can not commnet about this,unfortunately had to stay at Hebert Park 5 minute away,and a big thank you to the guy from security on duty when we arrived on sunday 28 september your help was incredible.Thank you very much",5,2014,10,04
205,Extended Stay,"I recently had an extended stay in this hotel in one of the residences for 7 months and I can only praise the quality of the food, the service was exemplary and the whole ambiance is an experience to be enjoyed and savoured. If anybody wants to experience sheer delight and luxury then please push the boat out and stay here for a 2/3 nights at least if you are disappointed here then it says more the person than the hotel.",5,2014,10,04
205,Relaxing Break at its best,"Spent one night with my daughter here recently and we both enjoyed the break from the mad rush of everyday life! Tranquil oasis near the city of Dublin and by far one of the nicest hotels to stay in in our capital city. Room and bed so comfortable and quiet.  Pool area was a real treat and we relaxed there after a morning of shopping in Grafton Street. Nice staff and service. Bar expensive.
Buffet breakfast was definitely 5 star and wonderful choice of food.",5,2014,10,02
205,"Great service, modern rooms and central location.  Highly recommend.",Outstanding hotel experience.  Very comfortable with accommodating staff.  Nice walking path through nearby park with gardens and pond.  Also found excellent restaurants nearby as well as great food experience in the hotel.,5,2014,09,29
205,Not a Four Season Experience,"I had several issues with this hotel. I addressed the manager, Mr. Vallely, on these issues. He assured me that the correct managers were notified. I had a few positive experiences with staff too. He also assured me that these people would be commended. I would not stay at this hotel again. I might be apprehensive about staying in other Four Seasons properties as well. That is all.",3,2014,09,29
205,"Average, not great.","Let's start with the good.  This is a lovely property that has well appointed rooms.  We had a wonderful executive suite that made us feel completely luxurious.  The not so good -- the service was just ok.  First, this is the first time in a Four Seasons property where I saw maid carts in the hall in my previous experience at Four Seasons this is one of the true differentiators you never see the carts or staff it is almost like little elves are working to make everything perfect.  Also, in other properties the staff always made an effort to know your name, welcome you back to the property and work to make you feel special while on the property.  The service in the dining room was also just ok.  We ordered lunch and 2 of our 4 entrees were not accurate and one had to be sent back to be redone.  Upon leaving we booked a car service with the concierge to take us to the airport. The car was a no show and there was not a record of our booking.  Luckily we got the name of the person working the concierge desk so we were able to confirm we had talked to someone.  We did get a car and got to the airport in time, but this is not what you would expect from a Four Seasons property.  Also, the property is a bit removed so you must cab it everywhere if you are touring around the city.  It was a ""fine"" property but I think I would stay some place else on my next visit to Dublin.",3,2014,09,28
205,Our favorite part of Dublin,"When the receptionist asked us what was the best part of our time in Dublin, we both answered ""Right here at the hotel"".  While you need to take a taxi or the hotel driver into the tourist area of Dublin for sightseeing, it was so nice to return to the peace and quiet and the luxury of the hotel after a day out.  They had upgraded us to a larger room and the spaciousness was much appreciated.  We had been doing all self-catering during a 3 week trip and having any request met so promptly and friendly was a very nice change.  I took all the advice on the hotel website for dining off the property and all of them were spot on and what we remember most about Dublin.  The hotel dining and bar areas were quite full on Friday and Saturday night with a wedding party on as well, but we had the place to ourself on Sunday night and enjoyed a relaxing  and tasteful dinner our last night.   I guess my husband and I like to pop in on the city scene, but he was so...glad I booked this hotel instead of in the noisy city center.  Loved it!",5,2014,09,27
205,Anniversary celebration,"My grandparents are just back from a 2 night stay to celebrate their golden anniversary,from the moment they walked in the door they were treated like royalty and their room upgraded, the suite was breathtaking and the staff done everything in their power to make their stay memorable and they cannot speak highly enough of their stay.",5,2014,09,26
205,Lovely treat,"Just spent 2 nights midweek in Four Seasons (in Dublin for James Taylor concert) and what a lovely treat. Excellent staff/service from start to finish. We were asked if we needed help with our bags 3 times from the car park to the front door!!! We only hand 2 small bags. Receptionist was very pleasant and very helpful, room 102 was spacious and immaculate with a lovely bathroom. We had a terrace which proved most welcome as the weather was gorgeous. We had breakfast included in our package which I would recommend as we received a bill on both mornings for approx €50/€47. Phew!!, so glad it was prepaid because although the eggs benedict and full Irish where excellent they weren't worth that!!!  It's been a while since we stayed there but hope to return soon rather than later. If I had to make one negative comment for me it would be lack of front stairs to the bedrooms. I like to use the stairs but the only way to the rooms on foot is the back stairs which means you have to go out of the hotel and around the side to go to your room via a staircase....not very pleasant!",5,2014,09,25
205,Another great stay,"Just a fantastic hotel!  From start to finish the staff are great, the atmosphere lovely, they think of everything.  Can't wait for an excuse to go back. I love the breakfast here and it lived up to its reputation.",5,2014,09,24
205,Elegant.,"This a lovely hotel very close to the heart of the city of Dublin. Spacious room, friendly staff and really great breakfast. Great stop for the discerning travelers. Short ride to the city. will Recommended.",4,2014,09,23
205,Wonderful stay in beautiful hotel,"Took advantage of special wedding guest rate to stay for two nights during a family wedding - breakfast was even provided by the family so it was really good value for money considering the standard pricing. A little disappointing that the hotel didn't allow us to use the 'stay 3 nights deal' to afford an extra night, but understandable. Absolutely beautiful room and large bathroom with wonderful bath and shower. Some of the other rooms family members stayed in didn't have windows that opened but we had a door opening on to the hotel's front balcony, which was really nice. In-room wifi was very slow, but paid wifi was available. Thoroughly enjoyed but unlikely to stay again unless a spectacular deal was offered as the price is difficult to justify.",5,2014,09,23
205,Five star luxury,"We had such a wonderful time here! Upon arrival, we were upgraded to a family suite. The room had a large bedroom and a separate living room with a luxurious bathroom, walk in closets, etc. We were so comfortable staying here, we were very sad to leave the Four Seasons Dublin. We would definitely come back.",5,2014,09,22
205,Everything a Four Seasons should be,"The Four Seasons Dublin is wonderful. It is everything that you would expect from a Four Seasons...great rooms, comfortable beds, tranquility and - above all - impeccable service. All of the staff are incredibly friendly and professional and go out of their way to make you comfortable. This allowed us to have a restful and pleasant stay.",5,2014,09,22
205,World Class Luxury,"The Four Seasons Dublin capped off our anniversary trip to Ireland.  What a treat!  Upon arrival, you are pampered until you leave.  We had a large room near the front of the hotel. The bed was ultra comfortable.  The bathroom was large with a separate shower and soaking tub.  The amenities were top quality.  The restaurant and bar were excellent as well.  The entire staff was excellent, knowledgeable and accommodating.  Kudos to all!!!",5,2014,09,21
205,"Five days in Dublin, away from the crowds, the Four Seasons were a welcome reprieve.","Had a lovely 5 day stay at the Four Season, September, 2014.  Everyone from the desk to the doorman saw to our needs with careful and courteous attention.  Taking a cab into the city center was quick and easily done.  The hotel is located in a lovely residential area, with the American Embassy down the street.  There were several good places to dine within walking distance from the hotel.  If you want to get away from the crowds at the end of a day of touring, The Four Seasons Hotel meets that need.  That said, a coffee service in the room would have been welcomed.",5,2014,09,17
205,Fabulous,"Stay was so lovely, everything is very well appointed. Beautiful spa, rooms lush! Loved it. Bar is expensive and clients are of the loud imposing variety. But could not fault hotel or service. Just beautiful ",5,2014,09,17
205,A luxurious stay,The complimentary driver and beautiful property are wonderful attributes. It is difficult to walk to shops or restaurants as none are nearby. The bar area is wonderful. The hotel has a more European flair than national tone. ,4,2014,09,16
205,high quality however...,This was very luxurious accommodation but the cost of breakfast was excessively high. The extra touches such as robes in the pool area and lounges added to the experience.  The overall ambience was excellent,4,2014,09,15
205,everyone deserves to stay here at least once in a lifetime if not more!,"such a nice hotel,so handy for the RDS and city centre, friendly professional staff,seamless check in/out ,lovely breakfast , one of the best hotels i have ever stayed in.I hope to return sooner rather than later.",5,2014,09,15
205,"excellent service , great wheelchair accessible rooms","stayed here in july and had a very positive experience . the wheelchair accessible rooms are spacious , the bathroom has a roll-in shower with shower chair and toilet seat available on request . staff are  attentive . bus stop outside the hotel about 15min to city centre , also wheelchair accessible .",5,2014,09,15
205,Service and a Food not good,"We love the four seasons and on Friday evening we went for dinner for my Dads birthday and was really looking forward to it.

When booking we were told that for parties of less than 30 we could have dinner in a smaller room/private lounge off the main lobby area where you normally have drinks.

There was a set menu and with some reluctance we could also choose from the a la carte. I chose from the set menu and went for the melon and prawns for starter which were very nice. For main course I went for hake which is normally a safe bet but it was cold and certainly not the best hake I have ever had. The pavlova for desert was plain but fine. 

Overall, the service was very poor and not like the Four Seasons that was always head and shoulders above the rest.  To top it all off and what prompted me to write this review was that when I went to validate my car parking ticket (as we were not staying in the hotel on this occasion) the porter at reception informed me that the first two hour were free and you had to pay for the balance if you aren't staying in the hotel. I have gone for dinner on several occasions and I have never not got my ticket validated. I was on my way to the ticket machine to pay and I met my sister who said that she had her ticket validated with no questions asked. I went back into him and he still wouldn't validate it and I decided I would just pay get home as I had young kids to bring home to bed. My sister took the ticket off me and gave it to the porter and he validated the ticket straight away. Very poor form on his part. Maybe it was because she was female!

I was ver disappointed by the whole experience and felt like I was I convincing the staff by being there. I remember my wife and I went to the Four Seasons in Paris and when we entered the lobby we were greeted by the friendly staff with ""Welcome to the Four Seasons"" now thats service. Needless to say that I won't be in a rush to go back to the Four Seasons Ballsbridge. I will be going to the Merrion from now on. Watch this space perhaps four star status is on the cards.",2,2014,09,14
205,Fantastic Stay!!,"Myself and 3 friends stayed in this hotel for two nights in the Lansdowne Suite before we head back to university, the hotel itself is wonderful! The suite was excellent and everything we had requested was in place and organised for our stay! The staff are very friendly and helpful - especially, Oliver, who was on the concierge desk and Ron, who drove us into town one morning. However, it was disappointing that the courtesy car does not operate on a Sunday or Monday! 

Overall, we had a fantastic stay, staff were extremely pleasant and would recommend anyone to stay here!!!",5,2014,09,14
205,Classy place to stay,"The rooms, service and included breakfast were all great.  The hotel is on the outskirts of Dublin, but it's not a problem as five passenger taxis are plentiful (EU influence) and run less than 20 Euro to get most places in the city.",5,2014,09,08
205,Wedding,"We attended our niece Claire's wedding on Saturday. Every single staff member we encountered during the day (and it was a long day) was friendly, courteous and helpful. We were made feel very welcome to the Hotel and the wedding. The food was excellent and served quickly and courteously. Needless to say, the function room was beautifully decorated and spotless. All in all, the venue was perfect for Claire and Colum's wedding. The only slight criticism I'd have was the bar prices. However, it is a 5 star hotel after all. A beautiful location and venue for a very special occasion! ",5,2014,09,08
205,Fading grandeur plus a hike,"The Four Seasons Hotel is a huge pile adjacent to the RDS show ground, close to the Aviva stadium but about 15 mins by car from central Dublin. This being the Four Seasons they do have two cars to facilitate the trip but if you are looking for a top class hotel within a walk of the craic then this is not the one for you. It most definitely is a top class hotel. From the valet staff to reception, from restaurant to house keeping everyone knew their lines, what was expected of them and provided perfect polite attention.

I was lucky to be staying in a junior suite on the third floor. Luxurious in space but a little dated in fixtures and fittings. I did not dine at the hotel other than breakfast, which was very good. I did use the gym which was very well equipped. 

I do recommend this hotel highly. However, if you are looking for a special or romantic frisson then this is not the one for you, it is a little sterile.",4,2014,09,07
205,Not quite what you expect for the price,"This hotel is nice but is not what you would expect from a Four Seasons and there are other hotels in Dublin that are either more luxurious, more historic, or have more character.  The service and attention to customers is good, but probably not better than other places.  Food was good but not outstanding.  Room is on par with higher end business travel hotels, but nothing exceptional.  I will try a different hotel next time in Dublin to try to find a higher end or more unique experience.",3,2014,09,06
205,Excellent,"This is a luxury stay, it is a special place but it does come with a price tag to match.  Had a glorious one night stay here which was divine.  Staff helpful and in particular the doorman and driver organising a lift for us to a meeting.  Really stepped up when we needed help.  
The bar service and late food is a service not available in other hotels in Ireland.  At 11pm you could have a wide selection of food and drinks, yes it is expensive but it is AVAILABLE something that when you are travelling that you like to see.
Would definitely go back.  Nice touches everywhere.",5,2014,09,06
205,Very poor start!,"Check in, first wedding anniversary, emailed them with arrangements and no greeting just an awkward receptionist arguing with me that I have booked a twin; I have the email from reservation! Keeps us waiting over 30 minutes to check in at 1630. Not impressed and will be checking out tomorrow if matters do not improve markedly.",2,2014,09,05
205,Unwanted alarm call,While the general experience of staying at the four seasons was very good I had a problem with an unrequested alarm call at 5 am on the final day of my stay. This was less than ideal preparation for an exam that I was sitting later that afternoon. I raised the problem with the receptionist when I was checking out and the best that she could do was to apologise. I have also subsequently raised the issue via the four seasons online feedback form and have not received any response. I had chosen the four seasons over the nearby hilton doubletree that I was visiting during the day but I may reconsider on my next visit.,2,2014,09,03
205,"Stay Here, Just Don't Eat Here","It should be noted that this hotel is a bit far from the city center and tourist attractions. This wouldn't be an issue if not for the overpriced, slow restaurant that the hotel provides. We only ate dinner there once because it took them well over an hour to bring our costly meals. For such an expensive place, service should be better. The breakfast is not much better. You're looking at about 26 euros for the same quality of buffet you would get at a Holiday Inn for free. 

The stay itself was comfortable. We didn't have problems with noise or accessing WiFi in the room. The staff was responsive, friendly, and helpful. The Ice Bar, located in the lobby, is a nice place to go down for a drink and to watch sports. They have ESPN, so we were able to catch a college football game and pick from a good selection of beer and cocktails.",4,2014,09,03
205,Very Good but Very Pricey,"We took advantage of a special offer to stay in a family suite in the Four Seasons Dublin. Overall, we had a great stay. The room was fantastic - very spacious with a great bathroom and separate bedroom.  We were travelling with young kids and there were some nice touches - rubber duckie and foot stool in the bathroom, mini-size bathrobes etc, and they even came in to turn the sofa into a pull out bed for us. The fitness centre was also extremely nice, although the pool was not especially kid-friendly, but I don't that kids are really their target audience.

I am by no means cheap, so when I say that the big issue overall was the price of meals - via room service or in the restaurant I mean it. Room service was expensive - it was a scandalous EUR26 for a paltry continental breakfast with coffee, 3 pieces of fruit and 2 pastries. For an expensive hotel, I had the sense of being nickel and dimed on the menu at all times. Don't get me wrong - the food we had was very good, just massively overpriced. So I am subtracting one star for this.

The staff were responsive - check-in was good, fitness club staff were good and we had an issue with our A/C that was resolved quickly by housekeeping. One downside - the concierge was a bit snooty.",4,2014,09,02
205,Perfect choice for luxury in Dublin,"My family and I just returned from Dublin where we stayed for five days at the wonderful Four Seasons Hotel Dublin. The hotel is truly beautiful in a lovely neighborhood minutes from downtown Dublin. Our suite was beautifully appointed and the staff was friendly, professional, and extremely helpful. The concierge was terrific, arranging the best day tour for our small group. The public areas are gorgeous, typical of the Four Seasons. The fitness center and pool were wonderful. We will definitely return to this friendly city of Dublin and won't stay anywhere but the Four Seasons Hotel! ",5,2014,09,02
205,Very nice hotel,"The Four Seasons Dublin was a very nice hotel.  The location was in the embassy district, so not ideal for walking to tourist destinations, but we were able to navigate the city via taxi, which wasn't all bad because we also had the benefit of the expertise of the taxi drivers for recommendations and local lore.  

We had a family suite, and the room was beautiful and spacious with a sitting area that had a fold out bed for the kids.  They thought it was comfortable; I thought it was terrible, but I didn't have to sleep on it.  Our king size bed was fabulous, and I'm sure my excellent night of sleep wasn't entirely due to jet lag.  The bathroom was SPOTLESS and huge by European standards with a separate tub and shower, and a separate toilet room.  

Breakfast in the restaurant was lovely (best cup of cappuccino I had in Ireland), but it would have been nice if it had been included in our room.  The bar area was also lovely, with excellent service and a great pint of Guinness (not that we had a bad pint while we were there).

There are several pubs within walking distance, the people at the hotel were friendly and helpful.  We had an excellent stay.",5,2014,09,01
205,Luxury and quality service at it's best.,"Two nights in the Four Seasons was a wonderful end of summer treat for my family.  Luxury and quality service at its best.  Extremely comfortable rooms and amazing food added to the experience, as well as a visit to the pool.",5,2014,09,01
205,one of the best hotels in dublin,top notch hotel. Great and spacious rooms including bathroom. Staff very friendly. Good breakfast. Amenities suitable for a 5 star hotel. The gym is excellent the best among the hotels in Dublin. Among the three hotels I stayed in Dublin over last year (Merrion and Westbury being the others) it is  definitely the best in terms of the facility. The only  advantage the other two have is location. It is far away from the city center and attractions.,5,2014,09,01
205,Exceptional staff!,"I booked a one night stay at this hotel as a birthday surprise for my boyfriend and it did not fail to meet my expectations of a Four Seasons. From the moment I handed the car key to the valet to the moment he handed it back to me (with complimentary bottled water for our trip home) the staff went above and beyond to make us feel special. Check in was very personalised and quick and our bags were delivered promptly to our lovely room. There was a beautiful chocolate moose dessert waiting for my boyfriend with Happy Birthday written in chocolate on the plate which was a really lovely touch. We had room service for lunch which was delicious (the club sandwich was divine and the triple cooked chips - yummy!) I had booked a table at Bellucci's for dinner so we didn't avail of the hotel restaurant but if it was half as good as the food on room service I would expect it to be spectacular. 

With only staying the one night we didn't have time to avail of the spa facilities but the treatment menu looked great (albeit a bit pricy). No complaints with the room whatsoever, luxury everywhere you turned! Will definitely return! Many thanks for making our one night stay a special one!",5,2014,08,31
205,Pure bliss!!!,"Perfect hotel in Dublin. Signature Four Seasons hospitality. Always will stay at Four Seasons Dublin. Working to onboard them as a preferred hotel for our business. Worth every penny!
amazing staff & wonderful food",5,2014,08,29
205,Definitely not what I was expecting,"When I booked the Four Seasons Dublin for my mom and me, I was hoping for a luxurious 4-star experience before we began staying in smaller boutique hotels for the remainder of our Europe trip.  Unfortunately, I'm sorry to say that the Four Seasons was my least favorite hotel during our trip.

The stay got off to a bad start when my mom went to take a shower and noticed that it was clogging despite her removal of the previous guest's hair from the drain (GROSS).  This little snafu was fixed and we were off for some site-seeing.  

I only booked a hotel so far from the Dublin city center because of the hotel's promise of a complimentary shuttle that regularly takes guests to and from the city center.  Randomly enough the shuttle was off-duty the day we arrived and when I tried to use it the next day I was told it had been taken for repairs.  My annoyance with this led the hotel staff to provide a complimentary taxi for us, which was nice, but it doesn't remedy the inconsistency of this ""promised"" service.

The breakfast buffet was pretty pathetic compared to the buffets of similar hotels we have stayed at in the past, but the coffee was good so I shouldn't complain too much here.  The L'Occitaine toiletries were nice, and the beds were comfortable to sleep in.  The room was also large and luxurious, but nothing out of the the ordinary for a property of this type and for the price we paid to stay here.

If I ever return to Dublin, then I will most definitely not be staying here again.  I'm sure there are better options available that would be closer to the heart of the city.",3,2014,08,28
205,Dreadful breakfast,"Just had the misfortune of a Four Seasons breakfast.   The full Irish reads great on the menu however the delivery does not live up to expectations.   The toast was pale.   Strangely it was hot so all I can assume is that they warmed the bread in an oven rather than toast it.   I sent the toast back and received an identical performance.   The hot breakfast was quite good but it was missing several items which were listed on the menu.   There were no white pudding, no black pudding and no mushrooms.   When I asked the waiter I just got a shrug of his shoulders.   Now the above might not sound too bad but when the price is €28 you do expect to get what it says on the tin !",1,2014,08,28
205,Not Up to Expectations,"Beautiful hotel with very friendly and helpful staff. Nice location near very good restaurants. Excellent food and overall service, but problems with room. Sink was stopped up. Toilet was leaking. Coffee service for 2 in room only had 1 coffee cup. All problems were quickly corrected.",3,2014,08,28
205,luxurious,"my daughter and i were travelling to a gaelic football match .we booked this hotel through onhotels site for one night .it was the bargain of a lifetime.truly luxurious,spacious,so calm and peaceful.beautiful breakfast.we had our car but if you wished the number 7 bus will  take you to oconnell st (spire) and 7 out again .you could take a walk in the leafy streets near the hotel or join a jogging group from the hotel .safe and secure.staff were very helpful and pleasant especially breakfast room manager.will probably never again have this experience!!!!",5,2014,08,27
205,warning!,"Beware

had a confirmed booking for this hotel on the 24th Aug. had a call at 1pm on the day (whilst on the way to check in) to advise me due to an overbooking the room was no longer available. 

not something which is expected from a hotel with such a reputation.

book at your own risk.",1,2014,08,27
205,"Exceptional hotel, exceptional staff.","The Four Seasons Dublin is a great representative of the Four Seasons brand.  It is not in the core of Dublin which is a real plus.  The taxis are plentiful, the restaurants in the area excellent, and it is out of the Temple Bar area which is a frenetic hubbub, hardly worth the time to visit..........in our opinion.  I would heartily recommend this hotel for the elegance of its rooms, the quality of its food, but mostly because of its personnel.",5,2014,08,26
205,Expectations Met,"Overall this Hotel makes the 4 Seasons 5 Star grade.  The room quality was good, food service was very good and the overall facility is above average with a good indoor pool, steam, and fitness area. 

The Staff was very friendly and the Front Door staff was particularly helpful with directions for jogging and walking.

The Ballsbridge area where the hotel is located is perfect --  a short taxi/25 minute walk to the heart of shopping/entertainment -- while at the same time not being in the middle of the madness of the pub/bar scene.

Lounge and Restaurant are particularly attractive and a beautiful setting for dinner or a drink.

This was my second stay and there will be a third some day.",5,2014,08,26
205,Beautiful Hotel,"Lovely Rooms, very friendly staff, breakfast was one of the best, cant recommend hotel highly enough. Lovely location when staying in Dublin. Only 20 minute walk from city centre and its a lovely walk. Will definitely stay there again.",5,2014,08,26
205,Lovely hotel,"Just outside of the city centre but regular buses. We would have used the DART but they were on a 2 day strike. Weather was what we expected...wet and windy - but we came prepared. 

Hotel is lovely and service was great. I had a spa treatment booked but I got the impression they wanted me to cancel. It was Albert Reynolds funeral and I was told by the spa staff that all the roads around the hotel would be closed. When I asked the concierge he told me that the roads would not be closed. Turned out they weren't but I cancelled the treatment anyway. Not impressed by the spa reception. But apart from that everything else was great. ",4,2014,08,26
205,Ireland 2014,"We had a brilliant stay. The hotel is very well managed and every detail gets look after. A bit more out of the Hustle from town but yet , hop on a bus and you in Grafton str in Minutes. We had a Junior suite and we absolutely loved it, that extra space you have is great. Will definitely recommend this hotel and revisit this hotel.the food by the was was Define .",5,2014,08,23
205,Outstanding value,"This hotel is a jewel of Dublin and the staff is outstanding  Everything at this hotel deserves recommendation. The rooms are beautifully appointed, staff helpful, the food is outstanding and it is located near great restaurants..",5,2014,08,20
205,Luxury,Lovely hotel in a nice leafy suberb of Dublin. The bar was lively as the horse show was taking place next door. Good restaurant for quality dining and there are lots of options close bye also. You do need to take a cab to the city though.,5,2014,08,17
205,Favorite Hotel of the vacation,"Everything about the Four Season Hotel was top notch. Every single staff person from maids to managers were professional and pleasant. We were impressed with their recommendations and help in gaining entrance to popular attractions. The location was quiet, yet close to anything you would need. The rooms were the most comfortable of any we were in over two weeks of travel. ",5,2014,08,15
205,Anniversary celebration,"Stayed for one night to celebrate a recent wedding anniversary. Having informed the hotel in advance they upgraded us at check-in to a junior suite( a three room category upgrade). They also offered us a late check out until four the next day. This really enhanced our stay as we felt we were away much longer than 24 hours. The suite was very large with a separate living area and also contained a large well stocked bathroom. There are bathrobes supplied that you can wear down to the swimming pool/spa. We had a spa credit as part of our deal. I enjoyed a wonderful facial. We ate outside the hotel and had dinner in a nearby restaurant Roast. This is a little gem of a restaurant and comes highly recommended. Breakfast at the Four Seasons is a feast, served in a beautiful dining room and the service was excellent.",5,2014,08,12
205,Wow!,As a special celebration we spent a night here. We had a suite and it was gorgeous. We pushed the boat out and used the in-room dining for lunch. To watch the trolley/table being set up was a treat in itself. We had dinner in the restaurant that night and it was wonderful. The food was delicious and service was very good. That was not the case in the Lobby Lounge where the service was very slow. Breakfast the following morning was fabulous. We had afternoon tea in the Lobby Lounge. It was a modern take on the traditional afternoon and was quite a treat.,4,2014,08,11
205,This was a great experience,"The little details really are what make this a 5 star experience.  From the moment that we arrived until our departure, it was just lovely.  We enjoyed every moment here.  You can't go wrong.  The hotel is located away from city central in a great area that we loved walking and exploring however within minutes we were able to be in the middle of all the action...perfect.",5,2014,08,11
205,Just reviewing my experience of the bar food this time,Just had to write about the amazing bar food we ate at the Four Seasons on Saturday night and even more amazing was the man who served it.I cannot stress what an asset this man is to the Hotel.I have reviewed this hotel a couple of times but didnt actually get to stay last weekend as the horse show was on but we HAD to have our 4 seasons fix in some shape or other whilst in Dublin for the football.Our waiter even though he had a long day was the ultimate professional and whe I asked him his  name it was David a Dublin man.Some of the staff are very formal at this hotel but this man was polite funny and VERY on the ball and I relly cant wait to go back.The bar menu is so well priced and everyone enjoyed the fab food especially the 12 minute flourless choclate cake.It was so yummy.I just wish You would put back on the  mixed platter for two to share There is one on  but the one we all loved had toasties burgers prawns and chicken skewers etc.Just a small thing though,5,2014,08,11
205,Trying to book dinner is impossible..,"Having stayed for Christmas a few years back and had a great experience, we thought we would book Christmas lunch this year, as a treat for the people we are staying with. 
I have now phoned 3 times and each time failed to get through to anyone taking Christmas bookings. 
But each time I'm told someone will phone me back. 
No-one ever does. 
It's shockingly bad service.",2,2014,08,10
205,O.K.,"This hotel has some definite positives: it's nice to be outside of Dublin; the staff is very helpful, esp'ly the concierge Robbie; the gym is very good; the food is good; and it's nice to go down for a swim or a jacuzzi.
It also has some negatives: the rooms, while huge, lack any sense of luxury. This is a Four Seasons, not a Marriott. The hotel caters to a lot of weddings--at least during my July stay last week, so there's lots of commotion in the lobby. And there are some quirks that I just found annoying. The bathroom was chronically short of shower fixings like soap, shampoo and lotion; indeed, I even had to leave a note asking for more! And twice after booking a taxi far in advance, I had to wait and wait while the doormen scrambled because they said they were never told. Not the level of service one expects at a Four Seasons. Next time that I am in Dublin I will try the Merrion in town.",3,2014,08,08
205,They do not disappoint!,"The staff is beyond excellent!  Whether you need a cash advance on your credit card or help in finding and travelling to a crumbling castle that nobody else has heard of, the folks at this hotel will pull it off for you in the most pleasant way possible.  These people made our trip to Ireland the best it could be!",5,2014,08,07
205,old fashioned grand hotel with excellent service,"pro:
bed long enough for tall people
reception gentleman named Serge was best ever had
room big
good sound proofing
nice pool and steam room
free shuttle service to the city
cons:
none
note:
the excellent staff makes the difference",5,2014,08,05
205,Just another Four Seasons experience,"We stayed there for a week and it was just a treat... A good place to relax off the beating path... Breakfast was great with healthy options for everyone.
The staff was simply great. Nice, smily and happy to help.",5,2014,08,05
205,"Lovely hotel, excellent staff, a bit out of the city center","This is a beautiful hotel and the staff is wonderful.  We stayed in a suite and it was my daughter's birthday.  They made a lovely little cake for her.  The pool is large.  The only drawback would be the location which is a bit out of the way, but it's a quick cab ride and a DART station is nearby.  The spa employee who did the morning running group was particularly nice.",5,2014,08,05
205,Four Seasons Dublin - a winner for meetings and incentives,"Four Seasons Dublin hosted breakfast for our corporate guests on the morning of their arrival off a long transatlantic flight. The entire experience was pure Four Seasons – special, attentive to detail, highly creative, focused on high touch. Aline FitzGerald and Grace Ann Fallon, the senior sales team, and Robert Nolan, General Manager welcomed our guests upon arrival and remained with them for the duration of their visit to the property. They escorted them immediately to a private banqueting suite where revitalizing head and shoulder massages were administered, the perfect antidote to a long flight.

Breakfast was laid out on individual tiered trays on a beautifully set block table with stunning florals. Patricia, the Junior Sous Chef was on hand and charmingly explained all the food items while offering freshly cooked crepes and eggs. Knowing that the customer was from the health and wellness sector, the individual food items reflected this – I particularly liked the Quinoa Salad with Natural Yogurt, Walnuts, Dates, Pistachios, Feta and Lemon Zest and the energy shot with Avocado, Ginger, Pineapple and Cucumber.

It was great to be back at Four Seasons Dublin and to witness the ground floor refurbishment which accents the contemporary with a colour palate in the lobby lounge of raspberry, beige and slate grey. The 55 signature art pieces, which include a wonderful Sean Scully, have been augmented by three impressive Michael Warren installations and, in the Ice Bar, by a series in Oil, by Hilary Eustace. The guest rooms, at 42 sqm, are by far the biggest that Dublin has to offer.

205,flawless!,"Hotel is very nice, quiet, comfortable: Hotel staff is also very nice, helpful, especially concierge.
Extremelly comfortable bed ! Large bathroom. Excellent meals. Hotel is in residential area, but to city centre there is good connection (taxi 10 EUR) or public bus.",5,2014,07,30
205,Family vacation,Fantastic hotel. Staff were very accommodating in every aspect of the trip. Concierge helped plan our event and great suggestions for places to eat. Really nice neighborhood for walking around. Dublin is a fun city!,5,2014,07,29
205,Excellent stay,"Fabulous stay. Beautiful hotel, great room (rubbish view but we did get a really good deal on the room price), wonderful staff.  

Try to make time to use the steam room and sauna if you can, just adds to the relaxation experience. 

Not a bad word to say about the hotel. It's stunning!!",5,2014,07,28
205,My Four Seasons Experience,"One of my favorite parts about traveling to Dublin is my chance to visit the Four Seasons. It is by far the comfiest, most relaxed I have ever been. The room service is incredible - the waiters are so kind and generous. It is available 24 hours and there is a wide selection. Everyone that works at the Four Seasons are very accommodating and make you feel very welcome. I have stayed there 8 times over the last two years and I am continuously impressed and never let down by their services. I would recommend this hotel over any other hotel in Dublin.",5,2014,07,25
205,"Wonderful stay, great location","The hotel is immaculate and very accommodating.  Upon arrival in our room we noticed a distinct smell of cigarettes presumably coming from some other person's room to no fault of the Four Seasons staff.  The front desk was more than welcome to change our room and did so in a very timely manner.  All in all everything you would expect from a Four Seasons Hotel; great restaurant, friendly staff, accommodating services.  I certainly would look at this hotel first for a subsequent trip to Dublin.",5,2014,07,24
205,five stars all the way,"The Four Seasons Hotel Dublin is what you expect from a five star hotel. It has very professional and helpful staff who are always there when you need them. Regardless if in the lobby, at the pool, restaurant in the corridor or in the meeting rooms, they are always smiling and react to any question.
The hotel leaves a very classical impression with great attention to detail and good upkeep. The rooms are nice and big. The breakfast is very good. The meeting rooms are comfortable and all that we have used had daylight.
The spa are is also very nice and comfortable to use.
To get to or from the airport it is recommendable to take a taxi and go through the tunnel (3EURO extra) but it is much shorter and it will cost cca 30 EUR.
The city centre is about 4 km away and a taxi will cost cca 10 EUR because as a taxi fee starts with 5 euro.",5,2014,07,24
205,IMPECCABLE ATTENTION TO DETAILS; ESPECIALLY THE FLOWERS,"Our 5 night stay was to attend the World Flower Show next door at the RDS.  Imagine our delight to be welcomed by a most exquisite flower display in the lobby, which led by way of bumping into the public relations manager, Gillian,,,to an introduction to the Flower Room floral designer, Catherine. We became kindred spirits!  From there it was all about flowers for me  However, the concierge service was second to none.  One evening we took advantage of the chauffeur service; we felt like royalty.  The breakfast room staff were absolutely delightful..we looked forward to chatting with them every morning.  They are great ambassadors for the hotel.  On arrival our room was upgraded to a junior suite.  It was a most welcome surprise and made our week's stay even more enjoyable.  Well done to all at this hotel.",5,2014,07,23
205,Unbeatable luxury hotel close to Dublin city centre.,"Friendly staff, very accommodating. Hotel is very well maintained, immaculately clean. Lounge restaurant food was very tasty and not overly expensive. Breakfast was fantastic. Spa / pool area were a great place to relax. Although the pool is fairly small it was never overly busy. We were able to relax and read / snooze on comfortable loungers drinking the complimentary green tea while the kids had a swim - a rare moment of peace! We had a terrific two night stay with our kids and would thoroughly recommend it to any family looking for a luxury break close to Dublin city centre.",5,2014,07,22
205,"Afternoon tea,,,, not the best!!!!","We had a good sunny day,,,,, maybe not a good time to go for afternoon tea. 
 
 My friend was so eager to go to Four Seasons (so we did). 

It didn't start well.
We have been sitting and waiting to be served, but no one approach us. Also, we had to move table, as we find the spot we had been seated to as quite warm. After a good while, we had to approach the waiter to order (as I said, no one came to take our order. Now, looking at what Tempo Tea has to offer, we notice that my friend and I have different menus, some items on mine isn't on hers, and on it, it says tea is serve from 3:00-5:00. It is now 3:30 and we still haven't been ask for our order). Then as we successfully got the attention of the waiter, we finally had our drinks and 10 minutes later our savouries and sweeties. The level of service at Four Seasons isn't great. It's okey, but not great, considering it is a 5* hotel. (They are serving afternoon tea, while other guests are having a bite to eat in the same room/lounge, plus the crying babies.) It wasn't a pleasurable experience at all. Tempo Tea at Four Seasons lacked sophistication, it is not on the same level as Art Tea at The Merrion. Sad to say that I won't be rushing back. 

We did however find the hostess, Raquel (looked after us well) was amazing. She's a credit to The hotel.",3,2014,07,20
205,Great Luxury experience in Dublin,We had a wonderful stay at the Four Seasons.  As the top lux spot on our trip it was a joy to have such wonderful beds and service for the week.  The bellman and concierges were exceptionally helpful and informative on things to do and inexpensive ways to do them if desired.,5,2014,07,15
205,Wonderful Stay in Beautiful Setting,We had the great pleasure to visit the Four Seasons Hotel Dublin. The hotel is beautiful. The staff was very helpful and considerate. The concierge staff helped us arrange great tours of the downtown area as well as the country side. The fitness center and pool are spectacular. We will be happy to visit again in the future!,5,2014,07,14
205,I spent 4 great nights at 4 Seasons in Dublin. The hotel was excellent as I have come to expect of all 4 seasons.,"The best of this hotel is the quality at still an affordable price( for this level of hospitality). The only  ( minor) problem is the location, quite off the beaten track, but you can feel better thinking that it is absolutely quiet and city center can be easily reached by bus or by cab. We Upgraded to a junior suite and i feel it was money well spent. the suite was huge, with the fantastic comfy beds I have gotten spoiled with at other 4 Seasons, with a very roomy living room, a great Nespresso machine that made awesome coffee, and a beautiful bathroom with all the amenities.
Breakfast was a bit expensive and I wish it was included, even if the cost of the room might be a bit higher...We had dinner one night in the hotel and I was not too amazed by the food or the service, but I think we had a new waitress who was really unprepared to accommodate a guest's requests.Considering the much higher rates of comparable hotels in Dublin, located closer to city center, I would definitely stay here.",5,2014,07,14
205,Amazing!!  10/10.,"We stayed at the Four Seasons in Dublin when we first arrived in Ireland.    The building and grounds are beautiful but what was most impressive were the staff.  Specifically, Laura who checked us in and then showed us to the spa so that we could relax while waiting for our room (we arrived very early in the morning).  Laura was lovely, kind and helpful.  We were fortunate to have Oliver as our bellman upon arrival and departure.   Oliver was sweet, professional and very accommodating to us. We used the spa and fitness centre everyday and it was beautiful, clean and peaceful.  We met Ruben one morning and had a great chat with him. Such a kind and knowledgeable man. Thank you Ruben.  Last and certainly not least was Brian.  We met Brian one morning at breakfast and he was such a gentleman. Brian took the time to get to know us and give us great advice on pubs and areas of interest around Dublin.  Every time we ran I to Brian he would remember our names, we would have a quick chat and he would continue to guide us through our vacation.  He introduced us to his famous Cappuccino and we will be back for more.  thank you Brian King for making us feel at home and we wish you all the love in the world at your wedding in December.   The staff at The Four Seasons Dublin made it a priority to connect with us and make us feel welcome.  Oh and the breakfasts were wonderful!  It is worth paying for 'breakfast included'.  Food is expensive in Dublin and is was nice to know that our breakfasts were taken care of.   This stay was 10/10 for us.  Thank you!!",5,2014,07,14
205,It is a great hotel in a nice if slightly out of the way location,"I thought the hotel was lovely.  The spa was great as was the fitness center.  The only thing I didn't like was the breakfast room.  The maitre d' acknowledged my reservation but when my guests arrived, she sat them at another table.  It was only after I ran after my guests that I was able to sort the issue out.  The internet in my room didn't work, and that took sorting out.  While the hotel was lovely, and I would stay there again, it wouldn't necessarily be my first choice.  The location is also slightly out of the way:  good for business but not good for nightlife.",4,2014,07,14
205,Everything about the Four Seasons whispers Class,"My wife and I stayed in the Four Seasons for one night in July 2014. Every little detail is worthy of 5 stars. Cleanliness, staff, quality of food, room, fittings, etc. We got an incredible deal and didn't know what to expect. The room was large with a very comfortable bed and pillows. The bath room was very large with enclosed shower and separate half bath. The bathroom shampoos were all L'Occitane. We got chauffeured via the courtesy hotel car into the city. A beautiful, long wheel base 7 series BMW. Luxury all the way. The staff were very attentive and one felt as if nothing was too much trouble. The in-room breakfast was beautify presented and delicious. Of course, any additional items are a little on the expensive side, but that has to be expected and one certainly does not feel ripped off when the service is to such an exceptional standard.",5,2014,07,14
205,Great location,"Stayed 2 nights in hotel. Location is in ""embassy row"" area, so very quiet, but also convenient to city center. Taxi cost is about 8 euro. Rooms very spacious, and beds very comfy. The staff was excellent. Everyone very friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend this hotel if you are looking for upscale experience.",5,2014,07,13
205,Fantastic trip,"Fantastic trip all round, staff very friendly and helpful. The hotel was immaculate throughout, rooms large and beds were very very comfortable. Breakfast in bed was a delight and gorgeous.Dublin was a lovely city with the Liffey running straight through. Loads of pubs and restaurants.",5,2014,07,13
205,Best Hotel in Dublin,"Loved the hotel, nothing was to much trouble.  The spa experience was excellent.  Food in the restaurant was great.  The room spacious and king comfy bed.  Looking forward to returning again.  The location of the hotel is in a great area, not to far away from Dublin centre.",5,2014,07,08
205,Fab   Hotel,"Have just returned from staying at the four seasons in Dublin for 2 nights. It was the best experience that I have had in a while, I took my daughter with me, the check in was excellent , room fab .Had room service a few times and it was beautifully presented ,ate in the READING ROOM as the restaurant had no space and the portions were very satisfying .Having stayed in  Ashford  Castle a few times  I was very impressed here and we left both refreshed and contented, will be back.",5,2014,07,08
205,"For a quiet, relaxing stay","Luxurious hotel with beautiful lobby, lobby bar/restaurant, courtyard.  Rooms are well appointed but definitely in need of some updates.  The décor / style in the common areas of the hotel (more modern/updated/sophisticated) do not carry to the rooms.  Nevertheless, the rooms are very large, comfortable and well appointed.

The hotel does advertise free car service into the city center but the car is never available.  It was easier and faster to take a taxi.  The hotel was in walking distance to a handful of restaurants but not to city center and the bulk of the dining/drinking options.  I would definitely agree with the other reviewers that the hotel is too far out to make the coming/going easy.

But if you are looking for a retreat from the hustle and bustle of the city, the Four Seasons fits the bill perfectly.  Excellent in house restaurant and lobby restaurant.  The bar has an extensive whisky collection with an incredibly knowledgeable staff.",5,2014,07,07
205,Not quite hitting the spot,"Overall very good, but would try other hotels next time in Dublin
Pros: 
- Staff was outstanding, pleasant and eager to please.
- Room was perfect, with a quiet HVAC system, and well ventilated bathroom
- Nice pool to swim in if not too many kids at the time.
Cons:
- the shuttle into town is convenient if the car is present when you need it.  But with only one car, we often opted to take a taxi instead of waiting for it to return
- breakfast buffet is just OK
- Spa area is minimalist.  
So if on business, go ahead.  If sightseeing, choose something downtown.  The location is simply too far out to be convenient for frequent in/out daily outings",4,2014,07,06
205,Best hotel in Dublin,"This is our third luxury  hotel we have stayed in Dublin. It is definitely the best. Breakfast and the serving staff were brilliant. The lounge area serving staff felt a bit like training day as the staff member and to keep going back to check with the chef and drinks were a little slow. Other than that small glitch it was brilliant all the way.
My husband says the beds are the second best he has ever stayed in (the best being the Westin in Berlin). The room was large and very well equipped.
For those interested the bathroom toiletries are L'Occitaine.
A special 'thank you' to Sharon at reception during checkout, she was friendly, efficient and professional. She was helpful and reminded my husband about the charger he had left in our room.",5,2014,07,06
205,A Good alternative,"Just a few miles on bus to city centre. A nice experience for those who want to stay in Dublin and live like a Dubliner for a couple days.
Just take the bus...go to the city and on Saturdays get the music live in your ears.",5,2014,07,06
205,Skip it- a lot of problems,"This is not run in typical 4 seasons style. We had a lot of problems. We stayed here at the start and end of our trip to ireland, two stays about a week apart.  Reservations ( made online) were completely screwed up both times. After our first stay we were told our problem was corrected but that was not the case. Our rooms for both visits had a view of dumpsters.   Additionally we spoke to (and tipped well) a concierge on our first visit to arrange a city tour on our return that was never arranged. If you have more than one device to connect  to wifi you have to pay 15 euros a day for connection. This was the only hotel that we stayed at that charged for it ). Overall a huge disappointment don't bother to stay here,many other nice hotels in this city to frustrate yourself with this one.",2,2014,07,05
205,We felt pampered throughout our stay.,"Any Four Seasons Hotel is out of our price range, but we have learned that an occasional treat makes for a happier vacation. The Dublin Four Seasons is outside of crowded downtown in the leafy suburb of Ballsbridge. After 2 1/2 weeks of constant motion around Ireland, we spent the final 24 hours of our trip surrounded by the quiet, understated luxury of our room (upgraded upon checkin), ordering room service, and venturing out only for two delightful ""Reboot"" sessions in the spa. You only go around once--I've never regretted splurging on the Four Seasons.",5,2014,07,03
205,"A Very Nice Hotel, But Not Close To City","The hotel is beautiful, rooms are a good size and breakfast was very nice.  My dislike were the toilets were not elongated anew were without a brush.  Expect a 10 euro or more taxi to city center. I liked the soaps and shampoos",5,2014,07,01
205,Enjoyable Stay,"A good quality 5 star hotel. If I am being uber critical, the spa could have more amenities and perhaps the atmosphere could have been better in the common areas. However overall no complaints of particular note. Not a hotel of great character but a good place to stay with good levels of service and comfort. ",4,2014,07,01
205,so handy to the R D S,"we were at the world flower show today and we meet up at the four seasons for Tea, the menu is good and something for everyone, the staff where very attentive from we arrived until we left , good value also.",5,2014,06,20
205,"Top Notch, as a Four Seasons should be","A luxurious, class act. Traditional style has been lightened up to create a more modern ambience, but still references what one would expect in a venerable property. Friendly, attentive staff. We had our laundry done here (very spendy, though), and it came back in a basket tied with a ribbon. Good breakfast, easy to get to the airport with your rental car, or a quick trip downtown by cab.",5,2014,06,19
205,Excellent all around,"I stayed there with my family recently. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left everyone was exceptional. We upgraded to a deluxe suite and it was very comfortable. It is hard for me to tell if the room was dated or just not my style, but either way, it was in pristine condition, All the furnishings, the carpeting and the woodwork (first place you see signs of wear and tear) were all in excellent condition. One thing I did not know was that there are no electrical outlets in the bathroom, per code, and there was really no dressing table, so you kinda have to use a makeshift one. All  of the concierge staff were a delight to deal with. They were great to my kids wen they needed wifi and helped me with a car rental situation. This hotel is not in city center, but it is a short cab ride. There are a few local bars and restaurants around the corner to satisfy you. I wouldn't hesitate to stay again.",5,2014,06,16
205,"Maybe Three Seasons, but not Four Seasons","Yes, this is a fine hotel.  I rated it as average because it falls far short of the usual Four Seasons standards.  The decor is elegant and the staff are dressed for the part.  That's pretty much where it ends.  What needs attention are the fundamentals!  The houskeeping staff continually made errors.  For example, they removed the two drinking glasses but only replaced one.  Sometimes our ice was refreshed, sometimes it wasn't.  We asked for iron and they cheerfully agreed to send one up.  Five hours later-- no iron.  For us, room comfort and service are far more important than fancy chandeliers and crown moldings.  Then there was the food.  Forget it.  Of course, it's best to enjoy the local restaurants in town and we did.  Still, when we had the occasion to eat at the hotel it was a disappointment.

Again, this is a fine hotel, overall, but if you've stayed at a Four Seasons elsewhere then you'd do well to lower your expectations.  For what it's worth, others staying there at the same time we did were of the same opinion.

Maybe they'll up their game at this Four Seasons.  I sure hope so.",3,2014,06,14
205,Next level service. I LOVED it!,"I travelled here on business..and my only disappointment was that I didn't have more time to enjoy this great hotel. 

What really makes this hotel is the customer service. The Four Seasons hotels have the gold standard in customer service in my book. From the moment you arrive, everything is taken care of. I particularly liked the limo service. Great for getting to my appointments around town.

This hotel passes my comfort test. Quiet in the evenings, comfortable beds and efficient services. Restaurant and pool facilities are also wonderful if you have time. 

This place is a little out of town, but at the same time still feels pretty buzzy. There's a lot of conferences and business meetings taking place during the day and evenings. 

Enjoy!",4,2014,06,13
205,It feels like any other Four Seasons....not special to Dublin.,"It feels like any other 4S hotel and there just isn't anything that makes it feel like you are in Dublin.   I'd reccomend staying some place more localized.   Typical 4S experience but when you are in a great city, you'd like to feel you are in that city a little instead of waking up in the same room as in San Fran in Dublin.",2,2014,06,12
205,Fabulous... pricey but thats D4!,"Fabulous room, , Attention to detail was great.  Crib for our son was full of lotions and potions. Even a lovely cookie awaited him on arrival!  
Kettle I would think should be provided in all rooms ...also an iron. 
Shower pressure was good too.
We ate in the foyer and staff were attentive and helpful

Pricey but that's Dublin 4. A bottle of Evian water was €5 in the mini bar... slightly excessive by all accounts! ",5,2014,06,11
205,Exceptional service in a beautiful hotel.,Second stay at this hotel and the service is excellent in a beautiful hotel.  Rooms are very comfortable with top quality bedding and very comfortable beds.  Stayed for business both times but have booked a vacation for another stay.,5,2014,06,10
205,The staff exemplify the Irish hospitality,"Always enjoy the Four Seasons brand but combined with Irish Hospitality and one wonder ""why leave"".   Always found someone to assist and was recognized with a smile and warm greeting when passing and returning to hotel.  Staff always helpful without being overbearing.",5,2014,06,09
205,Wonderful experience,"We just spent a wonderful long weekend at the Four Season’s Dublin. It was a last minute decision and yet the hotel staff went out of their way to make it work. From the moment we were collected at the train station to the moment we were taken back we revelled in the lap of luxury.
We could not fault anything about our stay it was a dream! Every department team we encountered treated us with the utmost courtesy and greeted us by name. No request was ever too big a problem. My partner has special needs and every member of staff went the extra mile. The Concierge department, food & beverage, lounge, room service, house-keeping teams and duty staff were so efficient and cheerful always greeting us by name. 
We have to say that the GM (Robert Nolan) is always so caring and helpful and it is so obvious that he has a wonderful team of staff around him. The staff teams made everything seem so effortless and each department worked with the other seamlessly but we also know this takes hard work and we greatly appreciate each of them. A big sincere thank you to Robert Nolan and his wonderful staff team for making this a really wonderful trip.
Mervyn & Stephen",5,2014,06,09
205,It's the service,"I was expecting a big surprise when I informed them of the surprise birthday treat, but it was only 2 cookies in the room; slightly less than the chocolate cake I've seen others get in other 5 star hotels. The service at breakfast also was not as attentive as Kempinski or hotel G. When I informed them that I wanted to bring some dessert upstairs after breakfast, the young lady only provided me with a tin foil to do so; what a letdown as previously in the last Four Seasons we stayed in Sharm El-Sheikh and Cairo, they provided me with a large picnic box to bring the desserts up; same as Kempinski.
The lady serving us was young, and had this surprised look when I asked her to bring the tinfoil up to our room. She didn't want to do it; but didn't say either until I just said I'll do it myself.
I also feel they should serve the vegetarian sausages and fish fingers for those who can't take pork sausages. I left feedback on this. I did ask for vegetarian sausages and they did get me them but not halal sausages which would be useful for international Muslim travellers.
The swimming pool area and spa area is very nice; the folks there, especially the Cuban fellow is very friendly and helpful. 
The Spanish gentleman around the lounge was very helpful, offering to take our photos proactively. 
The lady at check-in was also great, Andrea who took us to the lifts, and her colleague allowed my young 2 year old to get her own check-in card and steps to sign in as well. Cute.
Overall, it wasn't as good as the other Four Seasons we've stayed in, but a few gems in between regarding the service and room and amenities.",4,2014,06,09
205,Wedding,Went to a wedding and  had a great time until they rang the bell at 5.30pm for dinner. ( it was 9.20pm when we got a main course) the starters were cold and the 2nd course ( soup) when eaten the empty bowl was left in our place for over 45 mins. The main course also came out cold and over cooked. For such a well known hotel in D4 it was such a let down. Stear clear for weddings but fine for a lunch or brunch. ,2,2014,06,07
205,Clear why this is a 5 star hotel - excellent service in every way.,"We were treated royally by the entire staff.  The concierge had great suggestions for local sites and places to eat.  Also great tips on using public transportation. They even pointed out one of the living places of William Butler Yeats - one of my husband's favorites.  Even though the concierge suggested that we could go up to the front door to take a picture, we thought it would be an intrusion so took a shot from the street.",5,2014,06,07
205,"Four Seasons, Five Stars!","Had a quick overnight here with a couple of friends to see Glasgow Warriors vs Leinster - hotel is right next to Royal Dublin Showground where the home team plays. This is as class act property and as usual the Four Seasons experience is delivered impeccably. The property is well maintained and the rooms are probably of as high a standard as you will find in this fair city. Service levels are again outstanding with as good a check-in experience as you will ever encounter and a general friendliness and helpfulness that goes beyond the norm in terms of professionalism. We ate on the terrace when we arrived and the food was excellent in terms of taste and presentation. Breakfast was also well prepared and delivered.

Only gripe in what is an expensive city is the cost. Not cheap, but of course you get what you pay for. Bit out of the city centre but taxis are always on hand. 

Overall a good stay in a great place. ",5,2014,06,02
205,Usual Four Seasons Quailty,"We returned to the Four Season at Ballsbridge in Dublin  after trying a few of the new hotels that have blossomed in Dublin city over recent years. It was like ""coming home"" to the familiar ""quality"" surroundings. Competitive pricing in the current market makes the Four Seasons good value for money for a 5 star product. Rooms are well equipped and a reasonable size but it is the quiet, quality ambience and service that is at the heart of the Four seasons product. If there is a down side it is that we have stayed in a great number of four seasons properties around the world and with the exception of the resorts like the two in the Maldives and the Two in Bali the city based properties are all the same whether in Dublin, Singapore, Toronto or Sydney. I suppose however that's what a BRAND is all about so that you know what to expect. It would be nice however if  the local culture could be embraced so that at least you know what country you are in.
The ""fine dinning rom"" is now closed due to lack of demand and you now eat main meals in the lounge area which is not that appealing or intimate but understandable as the demand for formal dinning is falling and most visitors want to get out of the hotel to enjoy the local restaurants. The spa as always was great and the bars are friendly and comfortable. The breakfast is the best meal of the day and is exceptional in the Four Seasons so take your papers and take time to enjoy a long breakfast that will in fact be ""brunch""!
The Hotel is a little way from the main shopping and eating area in Grafton Street and St Stephens Green / Temple Bar BUT the hotel lays on an excellent and FREE limo service for quests.
Search for deals as here are plenty to be had! Enjoy!  RW",4,2014,05,29
205,Wonderful Stay in Dublin,"Everything was excellent, room, staff, food, service, pool and fitness centre. Particular thanks to all the staff we encountered who were so friendly and helpful and provided excellent service. Will definitely stay again.",5,2014,05,29
205,Great service.,"A home away from home. Stayed here on and off for 1 year and they treat me like an old friend. 

Rooms big clean and great marble bathrooms

Good service. Good
Pool. Good food. Prices ok for a 5 star hotel. ",5,2014,05,28
205,"Fabulous, perfect stay!! (dog friendly place)","There is not much to say - the stay was more then perfect, everything was more then I expected, the best hotel we've been to! We stayed for one night with our two golden retrievers - we were informed at the desk that only small dogs are allowed (there was no information provided when booking), but the lovely lady at the desk spoke to her manager and they agreed for us to stay. We received a very warm welcome (it was my boyfriend's birthday and he got a lovely piece of cake as a birthday gift from the hotel!!!), as well as our dogs when they were given two beds, bowls and bag of treats each :) FANTASTIC!!
Lovely swimming pool and leisure facilities, the changing rooms with separate rooms where you can sit comfortably, relax, drink your organic green tea and forget about the whole world... what a great place to be...
Bedroom massive with a really comfy, huge bed, access to a terrace and a beautiful marble bathroom. 
The hotel has everything for a perfect stay and we will definitely come back again!!
Thank you for your hospitality :)",5,2014,05,25
205,Best hotel experience I have ever had,We were upgraded to a suite without asking even though we booked the hotel on the day of our arrival. We were given a complimentary ride by the concierge to purchase tickets for a rugby match that day (which was suggested by the concierge and a great idea!) and the driver also took us to the Jameson Distillery. The staff was unbelievably welcoming and kind during our entire stay and I have never felt so at home in a hotel.,5,2014,05,21
205,For Seasons Dublin,"What an awesome hotel! A few minutes from the downtown in a nice quiet suburb of Dublin. Excellent food, service and concierge. Very helpful. Patrick the courtesy car driver was outstanding and had a great Irish wit that made us all feel great!",5,2014,05,15
205,Four Seasons Dublin Ireland (Ballsbridge - area of embassies),The Four Seasons Dublin was a very nice stay.  We were here for 5 days in April 2014.  Everything was very nice.  Breakfast a little pricey at 28 euros but it was served in a room that would remind you of Downton Abbey - so perhaps worth it for the atmosphere.,5,2014,05,15
205,Excellent 5 star hotel,"Very nice 5 star hotel with staff and service as expected in a hotel of this level. Good quiet location. Nice clean and spacious rooms with comfortable beds and most important, good bathroom and shower. Good choice for our first stay in Dublin.",5,2014,05,12
205,perfect,"I've stated at Four Seasons Hotel chain many countries, and all of them were perfectly perfect from check in to check out. It was not the exception with the hotel in Dublin. I stayed here for my 4-day personal issue. The hotel was truly elegant, luxury and classic. Getting inside I was breath taking of its lobby lounge and hall, so fabulous. My room was spacious and cozy as rooms I've stayed in other 4s hotels in the world. Clean, comfortable and convenient as always. They used bath amenities L'occitane - my favourite shea butter brand. So lovely. I felt like I stayed at home. The indoor swimming pool, restaurant and bar were all great. However, wifi was not free, so using monthly 3G was much better for me.",4,2014,05,10
205,Worst service ever at breakfast,My husband and myself stayed at the  dublin four seasons this weekend.we and our families have stayed many times in the past and whilst the room are very dated we love the charm service etc that comes with the four seasons brand. Sadly On this occasion the appeal has gone tired and stale. Breakfast was like a scene from faulty towers. The lame excuses for the bad service from the manageress on duty further added insult to injury. She said the waiter had not been trained and it was beyond her control. Hardly the customers concern? Overall it was inexcusable bad service and we have vowed never to return. The staff in the restaurant were more concerned with chatting to each other at the end of the room and the management ladies were busy chatting in the side office When we left very annoyed. Much better luxury and service in dublin.,4,2014,05,06
205,"Excellent hotel, but very poor restaurant","Stayed at the Four Seasons for three nights over the May Bank Holiday Weekend. First the positives. This is an excellent hotel. The rooms are top class, cleanliness is a given and the local staff are very accommodating.  The hotel is located in Ballsbridge very near the new rugby stadium and the area is one of the nicest areas of Dublin.  It is NOT however a city centre hotel. Indeed a walk for example to O Connell street would take up to 30 minutes and taxis are generally the best vehicle to get to the central areas.

It was interesting that a number of taxi drivers commented on some negative feedback from their paying customers on what was perceived as the rather ""soulless"" nature of dining at the hotel. I have to say for a top class hotel our experience was very poor. We had two consecutive breakfasts and on both days we were overcharged by the staff for an Irish breakfast and a continental breakfast. As both average out at around 21 euros this is no small matter. We pointed this out to the staff on both occasions who neither apologised nor it appears from properly checking our final bill when we got home actually made the changes. The staff were painfully slow to get the bill when requested (20 minutes on the second day) which led us to finally walk out and pay at the entrance. The food itself was ok but I had a bowl of porridge which cost about a ten pounds which on the first day was scalding hot and the second lukewarm. It came with a some fruit which frankly constituted one cut up strawberry and about 10 blueberries. I have eaten at numerous four to five star US hotels where the waiters constantly check whether you are satisfied, need more coffee and serve with some sense of interest etc. in this restaurant myself and my partner should have received ""loneliness therapy"" for the lack of attention. Sadly the staff appear disinterested and grumpy.  My advice is simple.  Go down the road 500 metres to Rolys Bistro, play half the cost, have them bill you correctly, serve you with a smile and a great breakfast. Noticeably the place is packed full of locals while the Four Seasons breakfast on the days we were there largely empty. 

Again to stress this is a very nice hotel but I'm afraid this is its Achilles Heel",3,2014,05,05
205,Remains a world class hotel,"Stayed here again with my family in April. Not much to add from previous visits, though for sure the rates are going up. Breakfast remains exceptional. The staff turnover is low (the F&B lady remembered us from 18 months ago) which really adds to the experience. Bar is great, and the food in the small restaurant off the lobby bar is good (though the room is a little small for a table of more than 4). Staff were always helpful, took a real interest in our well being. Rooms (we had a suite connecting to two further rooms) were lovely. Slightly 'sparse' in the manner of FS generally, but new TV's, massive bathroom, great towels, comfy bed. Overall very hard to beat, especially if you can get a deal.",5,2014,05,05
205,City centre luxury,"I stayed at the Four Seasons in Dublin with my husband in April 2014. He was chairing a conference in the hotel and I was working for the conference organisers. For that reason, we were lucky enough to get a deluxe suite, which I think was actually larger than our house.

Aside from being huge, the suite was nicely appointed and decorated in a sightly old-fashioned, somewhat chintzy style. The bed was about the size of a tennis court and we both slept very well in it. The bathroom was large, luxurious and well-lit. There was a walk-through wardrobe and dressing area with a dressing table and, unlike so many hotels, a professional-quality hair dryer.

The conference staff were helpful and the facilities very good.

My one, very small negative comment was that the room should have had tea as well as coffee-making facilities. Ireland is a nation of tea-drinkers after all!",5,2014,05,02
205,Nice hotel - not near many attractions.,"My wife and I stayed in an Executive Suite 2 non consecutive nights. The 1 bedroom suite costs around $600 USD.  This first night, the suite was satisfactory, located on the 3rd floor.  The second night, the suite was not satisfactory - for example - the bedroom had no windows.  They offered another Executive Suite option, but warned me that it was worse, and it was.  So - if you are going to spend a lot on a room at this property, check out the room first before agreeing to stay.  Aside from that, the staff was professional and the property was roomy, clean and well organized.  TIP - whatever you do - don't order an Irish Coffee - which was excellent everywhere we went in Ireland - but was awful here. TIP - it's a looooong walk to most attractions, so plan on using cabs.",4,2014,05,01
205,great service,"Attention to detail is the order of the day here. Staff are everywhere and its impossible to open a door yourself. I even said I would not have a shower as there  would probably be someone to help me out. Cleanliness was excellent. Parking great. Rooms lovely. Credit to all who work there. Not the cheapest even for a sandwich, but hey you only treat yourself every so often.",5,2014,05,01
205,Elegantly handled a tricky situation,"Just also stayed at Four Seasons in Dublin.  Great place, great staff, great service and great food.  Rooms were nice.  I have to specifically point out the incident that made the title of this review.  It was handled exquisitely and credit goes to the bar tender and the night managers.  On Good Friday, in Ireland, alcohol is not served anywhere except to the resident guests in the hotel.  An elderly gentleman, fairly tipsy, had wandered in.  He came to our group in the bar and asked us to please buy him a drink.  He was well dressed and polite and offered us the money for his beer.  The waiters were watching him and swiftly called the night managers who promptly and very courteously asked the gentleman if they could have a private word.  The managers escorted him to the lobby and unknown to us at the time had actually taken the gentleman safely home in the hotel car. The bar tender came back, apologised to us - though he didn't need to.  We said we would have gladly bought the gentleman a drink.  The waiter so kindly said ""ma'am, the drink was not in his best interest"".  This elegance sums up the Four Seasons.  Not only do they take care of their guests impeccably, they do the same with anyone who sets foot inside.  And they do so with such courtesy. No wonder we keep returning!",5,2014,04,30
205,Splendid Hotel,"Splendid hotel in Dublin. I have often attended this hotel for business meetings and functions. Excellent eye for detail. While I have not stayed there, my experience of attending there for events has been excellent.",4,2014,04,27
205,A very nice stay.,"I enjoyed this hotel, the rooms were lovely, spacious and service was very good as usual for The Four Seasons chain, however, we did not find the location ideal.  We did not have a car and had to cab into the city so be prepared.",4,2014,04,27
205,Excellent service,"Lovely hotel, very clean with excellent service. Nothing was too much trouble for staff. Would definitely stay again. Short walk from local eateries but 45 min walk from tourist attractions. Easy bus ride from airport. ",5,2014,04,27
205,Did she say yes.....,"On arrival police were doing a reccy for a visitor of note, however the very polite front of house wasn’t giving anything away on who it was, while I was checking in he greeted my party and took time to go through a map pointing out places of interest specific to us, he really made my family feel special and it was an amazing start to the trip 

I’d never visited a four seasons before and I wouldn’t normally justify such an extravagance, however it was my parents anniversary and as I was considering popping the question to my girlfriend at some point I’d already decided to go up market rather than cheap and cheerful

I chose the Four Seasons as they offered 3 nights for the price of 2 online, so this made it competitive with hotels of a similar standard.  One advise I would give is always try and book through a concierge service, luckily the TenGroup which I’ve used before has an exclusive deal with Four Seasons Dublin, booking through them I received a free room upgrades, £75 towards the Spa (Per room) and free breakfast.
 
I was happy to have received the breakfasts for free as the cost would have been an extra 120 Euros per day. You’d think for a 30/35 Euro breakfast you’d either get an amazing dining experience or at least your fill, however with the extra tea and toast came an extra charge, and on 2 occasions I was wrongly presented with a bill.  All the staff were pleasant but not the most attentive, on one occasion we’d finished breakfast before our toast came, another day the toast looked like it had been passed on from another table, and on every occasion it looked like it had been shown a match rather than toasted.  Of the 3 days there, one morning we had to wait 15 minutes to be seated for breakfast, and when you’re paying for an experience feeling guilty your finally being seated while an elderly couple and a pregnant lady wait on isn’t how I wanted to start my day, we arrived at the breakfast area with only one couple waiting in front, but by the time we were seated the queue was closer to 20 people.

I appreciated the room upgrade and as I wasn’t looking to take out a mortgage in order to finance a trip to the minibar, so the extra room gave the 4 of us plenty of space to crack open a bottle of duty free and sit around comfortably without feeling like we were sitting in someone’s bedroom, while Ireland did what it does best, rain. 

If you think Ireland in general is expensive go to Dublin, if you think Dublin is expensive go to the Four Seasons, I’m not stupid so I understand the business is priced towards it’s intended clientele, however forgetting the mini bar (that needs to be seen to be believed) the hotel Bar is little better, I was expecting to pay a pretty penny for a bottle of wine, so if you’d said 50 euro for the house I wouldn’t be happy but I’d expect it, however I was expecting to be served something that was exclusive or unknown, but at 47 euro for a bottle that you can pick up yourself at a quarter of the price that’s ….

One very important thing I haven’t yet mentioned, check your bill, then recheck it and then recheck it again, on check out I usually just give my card and don’t think about it, naively I assume it’s going to be right and I’ll give it a quick scan before it gets lost in the pockets of a coat I won’t be wearing for 6 months. Anyway the bill was wrong, the first attempt had charged for 4 breakfasts for 1 day, 2 breakfasts on another, sundries which couldn’t be explained (maybe the cold toast), and a spa bill without the 75 euro voucher discount. It took a good few attempts to get it right, luckily it was raining outside and I wasn’t in a rush, and I won’t be in a rush to go back, 
I’ve now experienced the Four Seasons, nice front of house, nice big rooms, nice marble bathroom, Hotel car with friendly helpful driver (it’s free), professional house keeping (without introduction they know who you are, male HK actually called my dad by his name, made his day), but at the end of the day it wasn’t worth the hype, over priced and inconsistent,

......
In case your wondering I didn't ask her, I figured whenever I do it it needs to be somewhere special, only because she's a big sap (english meaning not american) and she'll want to go back time after time, I should probably ask her when I'm in the pub",4,2014,04,27
205,Not as good as expected,"Although there were some nice aspects to this hotel, it was overall not what I expect from a Four Seasons.  There were some erroneous charges on the bill and someone from the cleaning staff broke a lamp in our room and left it there for us to discover upon our return to the room.  The room was also somewhat dirty - including the fact that there was a fake fingernail left on a night stand! Also, despite the fact that the pool was completely empty at 8:30 pm the staff would not  let our children  swim because it was after the designated family swim time.  I understand this to some extent but it seemed overly rigid given the fact that the pool was totally empty - and we offered to leave if anyone else arrived.",3,2014,04,23
205,Atmosphere of an iRobot Club,"Sorry we stayed for Easter weekend 2014 - but I struggled to give our stay even a ""poor"" rating. the atmosphere was far too poor & unfriendly for even a 2* - I have no idea how some people can describe staying at this place can actually be a place worthy of been capable of providing a positive 5* experience. Even when I was checking out after paying over €1000, the clerk told me only 1 car was complimentary but checking in, a different clerk said 2 cars was absolutely OK.. The bottom line is.. it is not a 5* experience and 50% of the staff are fantastic but are carrying the other 50% who are robotic, unfriendly, impersonal, look deflated and just don't seem to understand what a 5* experience should actually be... Sorry but the hotel is completely overrated and very over priced too.  I'd really need to be convinced by others to ever dare go back.  Hire some friendly Irish people too for goodness sakes.",2,2014,04,23
205,best hotel in dublin,my family and I stayed here over easter hols and we had a fantastic time as usual. hotel staff rooms and spa all top notch.we travel to Dublin a few times a year including the horse show week can not bring ourselves to go any where else.,5,2014,04,23
205,Great for Sunday lunches,"My favourite hotel in my home town.  Great for sunday lunches, a couple of nights with the Mrs or beers with the boys.  The craic is always mighty....!
Best of all is the service, kind, welcoming and sincere.",5,2014,04,23
205,Beautiful hotel,I had the luxury to stay here during a conference. The hotel is beautiful with an eye for detail. The room was big with lots of light and a very comfortable bed.Very friendly staff. Unfortunately the breakfast was just average.,4,2014,04,22
205,Luxurious hotel close to the city centre,"This is a luxurious hotel close to the city centre in one of Dublin's nicest residential areas. Very large hotel - staff very helpful. Overall a quiet, relaxed hotel. Breakfast was nice but not amazing (the breakfast room is beautiful). This is a great spot to stay if you want to see one of the nicest areas of Dublin (Ballsbridge) and have access to the area's great bars and restaurants as well as being right beside the city centre. The hotel is also near Lansdowne Road rugby ground and the great pubs all the rugby fans head to before and after any games. Would recommend.",4,2014,04,21
205,"Nice, but not sure its worth the premium price",Very nice hotel and very good service. Really enjoyed the stay and everyone we dealt with was very good at their job and attentive. Location (a bit out and away from things) and price were the main negatives.,3,2014,04,19
205,A Spectacular Hotel,"My sister and I had a wonderful stay at Four Seasons Hotel, Dublin and will definitely be returning soon.  We could not fault any aspect of the service and found our room clean, spacious and well equipped with everything we needed and more, for a comfortable and relaxing stay. We stayed in a deluxe twin which not only had the most amazing spa-like bathroom, with a grand entrance, but also had a beautiful garden view. We ate a grand breakfast, lunch and dinner in the hotel as well as enjoying a drink in the bar and found everything to be of an extremely  high standard, including the service. The hotel was constantly buzzing with life, whilst being very cosmopolitan and sophisticated.Throughout our stay, the concierge and porters were welcoming and couldn't do enough for us. On our last night, we were also lucky enough to experience the amazingly tranquil spa and found, once again, that every possible need had been catered for; from plush towels, robes and slippers to complimentary toiletries, drinks and snacks. We were only sorry that we hadn't ventured down to the spa sooner. A very pleasurable stay at a spectacular hotel.",5,2014,04,14
205,Flawless,"I generally prefer privately-owned to chain hotels, but the four seasons is an exception to this. They have clearly got the formula just right and everything from the moment of arrival is spot-on....and then goes a little bit further. The door and desk staff are all really friendly and efficient. The room was perfect. I'd requested a quiet room and was concerned that the hotel was busy with a number of functions going on, but I never heard a sound. I was travelling with my young son and little touches like baby toiletries, a baby bath robe and a cookie with his name on made a very personal impression. The swimming pool was lovely and quiet (and a decent depth unlike many hotel pools) and again staff were really chatty and helpful - offering my son armbands. I don't know whether this is part of their training or whether Dublin four seasons has just struck lucky with a great team. My only slight negative would be that breakfast was really busy and we had to wait about 10 minutes to get seated, while people from a wedding were let in ahead of us. However once seated breakfast was lovely and in a very nice setting. If there was anything at all I could suggest to ""improve"" a close to perfect hotel it would be add some references to Dublin eg in the form of artwork or photographs. Thank you for a lovely stress-free stay. I will definitely stay again.",5,2014,04,14
205,fantastic,we stayed here saturday night and had a fantastic experience the hotel was amazing and the staff could not have been more helpful . would stay again in a heart beat.the staff were really good wih the children and attended to there every need.,5,2014,04,14
205,"Very good hotel, but the lounge facilities are rather compact","There was a wedding on each day we were there and therefore there were no quiet areas. Lots of children around. Outside of your room and the spa there was no place where you could go and sit and quietly read a book and enjoy a cup of coffee. There should be a separate lounge area for some quiet time for residents. After all I came there to relax, and that means I want to be able to relax in any part of the hotel.",4,2014,04,12
205,Lovely room and friendly staff,"This is a bit late as we stayed in February 2014 just for one night.  The Hotel is lovely, our room was spacious with beautiful bathroom.  The staff are fantastic really friendly and helpful.  The food in the Restaurant was excellent.",5,2014,04,11
205,Great hotel! ,"Really loved this hotel!! My first time here as a treat for my recent 30th Birthday!! Bedroom fab and also bathroom well stocked with L'Occitane toiletries,an added luxury!! Had dinner in the hotel restaurant and food was delicious,for three course meal and coffees after cost €89.90 total,a bit pricey but well worth!! Hotel only a 5 minute drive form Sandymount Strand for some fresh sea air!! Would highly recommend to a friend for a break :)",5,2014,04,09
205,Highly Recommend,This is a great hotel. Very warm and welcoming. Rooms are very comfortable and clean. Breakfast is excellent. This is my second time staying here and will come back again. It is ~7-10min taxi journey from the city centre. Location is excellent for Aviva or RDS.,5,2014,04,08
205,Quality 5 star hotel,"This hotel is exactly what you would expect in a 5 star hotel, especially with one named the Four Seasons.

We were offered an upgrade to a suite for only $40 euros a night and since we were traveling with our daughter it was well worth it.  

The hotel is also very good in catering to families with children providing child size robes, good kids menus in restaurants and with room service.

Only complaint is the free wifi disconnects regularly and only allows 1 device per room.  You can log into the ""meeting"" wifi though with the password displayed at bottom of restaurant menus.  Not sure if it will work on higher floors.

Hotel also offers complimentary chauffeur service to city center in afternoon.  This is nice because of distance of hotel.  It is south of most tourist attractions, but there is also a train station less than a five minute walk.

We will stay at this hotel again when we return to Dublin.",5,2014,03,31
205,Lovely stay - but is it 5 star?,I thought the rooms were nice but not sure of the decor. The staff were lovely and attentive- even when we called room service 3 times - the response was excellent. The fitness centre was good but the pool very small. The breakfast was excellent! I would return and will recommend - just a bit expensive for what you get. ,4,2014,03,30
205,A great place to stay in Dublin,"A great place to stay in Dublin.....outside of city center but near to all.   The  Four Seasons is a great  hotel stay.  We stayed our first 3 nights while in Dublin.  The hotel lived up to Four Season expectations.  The rooms are very nice with all the necessary modern amenities and quite spacious. The staff are amazing, attentive, efficient, and deliver excellence.",5,2014,03,30
205,"A cut above the rest, superb friendly and unpretentious service.","The Four Seasons' reputation is lived up to by the Dublin property.  Excellent service in luxurious surroundings, with a host of great local staff.  Despite this the hotel is relaxing and unpretentious.",5,2014,03,29
205,Sublime to ridiculous,"Stayed in Four Seasons last month.  The building itself, inside and out is excellent.  Staff were very helpful, maybe even over the top.  Sometimes less is more, especially the eternity of questions and information on check in - just let us get to our room please.  The room was excellent and bathroom also.  The breakfast was a real treat, the best choice and best food I have ever experienced in Ireland.  Free parking gives it an edge over city rivals also.
The downside was the bar, or rather lack of bar.  In an Irish hotel we expect an Irish bar but this hotel doesn't deliver.  Granted there is a large soft seat area where drinks can be consumed but it lacks a bar in the proper sense of the word.  And 5-star or not, can you justify those prices?  Undeterred we made our way to a local pub on both nights where we enjoyed music, craic and sensible prices.",4,2014,03,28
205,Not got the wow factor,"We arrived home from Abu Dhabi and had planned on staying for 2 nights before going home, it was a treat for my wife's birthday. When we arrived we were offered an upgrade to a suite at an additional charge which we declined, we were shown to our room which was very basic so we decided to take a look at the suite and to upgrade. The suite was much bigger with a separate living room walk in wardrobe and step out balcony. The decor is old style and chintzy, I have to say it probably appeals to an older generation. 

The service in the restaurant and bar was very slow, we ordered food and it took 40 minutes before our starter arrived, the following evening we were in the ice bar with some friends and again the service was extremely slow and in the end I went up to the bar and ordered at the counter, the bar man said they would drop the drinks down,Ii insisted that I would wait for the drinks and bring them down myself.

The concierge David was very attentive and the reception staff were professional and friendly, there was a small birthday cake left in the room for my wife which was a nice gesture.

Overall it was an average stay, I wouldn't stay again as it is way overpriced for what it is, there are much better hotels at a much lower price nearby.",3,2014,03,26
205,Fantastic,"Stayed here for 2 weeks with a mixture of work and pleasure, and i cannot say enough good things about this hotel. Having stayed here many times before it was like being welcomed back as an old friend. Within the first day or 2 most of the staff from concierge or the bar new us by name and always greeted us with a smile. The Spa is my favourite in dublin. The pool is so relaxing in the evening and i found that it was very peaceful around 9pm. The hotel has had a little face lift in the common areas lately which has really helped it. The rooms are comfortable, and the L'occataine bathroom products are so nice. The breakfast is fantastic, a great mix of local irish products.",5,2014,03,24
205,Relaxing,"Went to Dublin for a friends birthday so booked a couple of days so we could relax.  Ordered breakfast in bed fantastic and then as we were being lazy ordered dinner on room service too.
Staff are polite and efficient, rooms were clean comfortable and inviting. Food was excellent and laid out nicely.  As we were being very lazy we didn't get a chance to see much of the hotel but what we did see looked lovely.
I would definitely return, to check out the rest of the facilities, restaurant, spa etc. but for what we wanted it was perfect.",4,2014,03,18
205,Not up to previous standards,"I have stayed regularly over the years at this hotel and my most recent one night stay on business was disappointing.  The room was just as nice as ever but the restaurant was poor.  Firstly dinner was not in the main dining room, but was in a much smaller square room which was really part of the lounge.  Service was amateurish.  After I had sat down nothing happened  - no offer of a menu or a drink, and I had to ask after 5 minutes.  Yet there were waitresses putting out crockery on empty tables oblivious to me.  The food was OK but nothing special, and it was just brought and put down very functionally.  No amuse bouch and a very limited wine list - I'm sure it was a lot more extensive on my previous visit.  The breakfast buffet was poorer than I remember - the quality was good, but it was just not so extensive.  Service was from eastern Europeans, and I have nothing against them having been served well by them in many places, but these poor chaps could hardly speak English.  Something has clearly changed at this hotel for the worse, which is very sad.",3,2014,03,14
205,Unbelievable experience and comfort!!!!!,"The moment we walked in tired from the ferry we were greeted by name and everyone came for comfort. From the car service to the front desk, we were taken care of. The hotel is warm, and inviting with lots of charm, very kid friendly with a little of a home feeling. You must ask for Michael Zielinski and Vic Terlier who helped us get into our room quickly with our child. Our room was quite large with an upgraded bathroom and large closet area for changing. The beds are extremely comfortable as well as the pull out sofa. The two men answered all our questions for our trip with suggestions for tomorrow. We would 100% recommend this hotel for couples and especially for children. Knowing it was our son's birthday they had a cake sent up to our room with a candle!!!! Lovely surprise.",5,2014,03,13
205,Fantastic Hotel,"This Hotel is next to The RDS, So fantastic when watching Rugby. Within walking distance of BallsBridge. The airport transport stops outside the Hotel, so no stress. We upgraded to a suite, so it was amazing, the room was very quiet.",5,2014,03,11
205,OUTSTANDING!,"You can`t go wrong with that hotel. Perfect service, perfect sleep quality, cleanliness, rooms are wonderful, spa and sauna and all you can think of. Location is great. Five minutes walk from great restaurants and gift shops, stores and supermarkets,  but still in a very quiet part of a residential area. Staff is more that willing to help you and make you feel comfortable and at home. Great lobby bar, food served at the restaurant and breakfast is also at the highest level. One of the best hotels i have visited and by far with the best service. Fantastic stay, luxurious experience, immaculate facilities....if in Dublin and willing to pay a bit more for your stay...just book it! Photos of that hotel just do not do it any justice!",5,2014,03,11
205,The Spa is absolutely fantastic!,"We came here on 7th March 2014 for a spa day. 8 of us attended in total, and we couldn't of had a more fantastic day! 
the pool area, and all facilities were immaculate, the staff were friendly, attentive and caring, and the food and drink selection was delicious.

We weren't staying at the Four seasons overnight, but if we came back, I definitely think it would be worth the money!

We also went into the bar for a drink and the gentleman working on there was funny, attentive and lovely.

I can't thank the staff there enough.

Thank you so much for all your help.",5,2014,03,10
205,LUXURY without a doubt the best,"Absolutely the most luxurious hotel.  The staff went above and beyond my expectations, helpful in every aspect.  We stayed in a suite that was perfect for our stay.  The hotel is tastfully decorated, very quiet and the location was good.  The restaurant and bar were very convenient.",5,2014,03,06
205,Open your window for a beautiful view of downtown Dublin.,"Enjoy a soak in the most comfy soaker tub ever. The hotel is away from the City Centre and it's quiet. The staff is ok, just not as friendly as other places in Ireland. The 12-minute cake is NOT worth it, but the dining area is pretty and picturesque. The tv is updated. Honestly though, the best part is the tub. I would have taken that home with me. SOOOOO comfy!",4,2014,03,06
205,Beautiful hotel in Ballsbridge,"My husband and I stayed here from the 13th to the 16th of February.  I actually grew up in Ballsbridge so it is lovely to return and to stay in a magnificent hotel near to my old family home.  I much prefer to stay here than in the city centre as it is a peaceful oasis, but the transport links from Ballsbridge are fantastic.  Our room was magnificent and left nothing to be desired.  I showed all my family, friends and relatives when they came to see me and they all want to stay there now.  The lounge has a lovely sumptuous relaxed feeling with enough privacy.  The bar food is excellent and the Guinness is very much up to standard.  We felt we were looked after so well, that even when my friend came to visit me and I was in my room, the manager ushered her into the lounge with a drink ordered and told her I would be down presently.  I can't say enough good things about my experience here, I felt as close to royalty as I'm sure I will ever feel.  Don't hesitate to book in here, you won't regret it.  Oh and for all the ladies, you get beautiful L'Occitance toiletries to use in the bathroom.",5,2014,03,04
205,Enjoyable city family break,"We have just returned from a weekend away at Four Seasons Dublin and very much enjoyed our stay. First impressions of the hotel were good- the relatively new building was a little further out of town than we'd thought but taxis were constant and so it wasn't a problem. Facilities were good too with a nice lobby bar which overlooked the gardens. Upon checking in and despite us arriving at 10am, the lady at reception found a room which was ready and so we didn't have to wait which we were very appreciative of and allowed us to get started with our weekend away. The room we had was enormous- not sure if we were perhaps given a larger room? I would say however that for a hotel that's only 13 years old, the decor in the rooms are quite tired and dated. Nothing that would affect one's stay as the rooms were spotlessly clean but perhaps they'll be due a refresh at some point soon. 

The staff are fantastic and it's their attention to detail and the manner in which they make each and every customer feel the most important there that makes the four seasons such an enjoyable place to stay. Concierge were great and lent us a pushchair for the duration which proved an absolute
life saver! The hotel car chauffeur, Ron was lovely- giving us top tips on where to go in the city and what he doesn't know about where to go isn't worth knowing about! 
 When we called down to reception to ask what time we needed to vacate the room, we were told that as the hotel was not full, we could keep the room until we needed to leave later that evening which we were delighted about and really made a difference to our last day. 

I did feel it important to mention one person, Laura, restaurant manager at our local FS Hampshire, who recommended we try her home town FS and not only made sure we were well looked after, but kindly emailed us a list of where she thought we should go and what we should try while we were in Dublin. 
All in all we had an enjoyable stay and would once again recommend the FS hotels to anyone looking for an enjoyable, stress free and special break away, especially those with children as their focus on younger guests is unparalleled. 
We now very much look forward to a big birthday in April at FS Firenze, Florence. 

Thanks, The Bell family.",4,2014,02,24
205,I Could Get Used To This,"Once you check into this hotel you may never want to leave. The staff are superb, the rooms luxurious and the grounds are beautifully maintained. The restaurants serve a wonderful assortment of dishes and the bar is a cozy place to have a well-poured Guinness or any other drink you desire. If for some reason you decide you must leave the property, there are many fine restaurants and pubs within walking distance. If you want to venture out further, the Dart train station is only a few minutes walk and a very comfortable way to explore the area. We had a wonderful stay and i can't wait to go back.",5,2014,02,21
205,Felt like a Queen,"My husband & I stayed here for two nights (Feb. 9-10) which was our last hotel for our Ireland vacation.  As soon as I stepped inside the hotel, I felt so at ease.  We had driven from Galway and after getting lost so many times it was nice to finally find the hotel.  The location was so beautiful, and staying there was great finish to our trip.don't get to stay in many upscale hotels.  We took ""The Dart"" into the city which was not only convenient ,but easy to use. The Concierge desk was so very helpful and recommended Mulligan's Pub to eat (which was very good) and so well worth the long walk (again, we got lost). Our room was very nice, and comfortable and I loved all of the marble in the bathroom, the shower was the best. I would love to visit Ireland and Dublin again, but both of us agreed that we would NEVER HIRE a car again and drive ourselves because of the following issues: .Besides, driving on the left, (wrong side) not having street signs very visible and the narrow roads, the next time, we will come by ""the big white limo"" (aka Princess Cruise Line.)",5,2014,02,18
205,One of Dublin's Finest,"Excellent property. Stay was part of a package vacation. Rooms rather pricey if arranging stay on your own. Bus and train transportation very close by which was a plus as driving in Dublin as a foreigner is very difficult.
Excellent staff, very willing to help with any issue.",5,2014,02,18
205,A beautiful break away for Valentines,"I stayed at the Four Seasons Hotel in Dublin over the weekend! From arrival everything was perfect, drove up to the front of the hotel and asked the nice gentleman at the front where we could park. Parking is just to the left of the entrance and its free, the card is swiped at reception on check out! Two doors to in to the hotels reception, doors opened by 2 gentleman and the greeted by another gentleman who showed us to reception, the guy at reception asked for a credit card for pre approval but i had no money on my Credit card but it was no problem my visa debit card was swiped instead and that worked perfectly! Got a complimentary Financial times newspaper! Another Gentleman brought us upstairs to our room and gave us a quick tour as it was our first time.. i think he was the room manager, very nice and helpful man! Walking through the corridor reminded me of the posh corridors on the titanic, very beautiful. When we got to the room we were very impressed!The bed was huge!! The room was immaculate! The bathroom was beautiful and had everything we needed! Everything was amazing and we will definitely be returning (hopefully soon)!! Also recommend Patricks cafe for brekkie too if you are looking for a cheaper brekkie!",5,2014,02,17
205,most go,We realy enjoyed our stay hear it is a wonderfull hotel it has  every thing you need to make your time in dublin remeberable staff very frendly and helpfull room was very nice we did not have good vue but not a problem the pool and sunna are top class we will return,5,2014,02,17
205,A weekend break for my Mother and Aunt,"I recently put my Mother and Aunt here for a weekend break and they couldn't be more praiseworthy of this hotel. They said the staff were amazing and service was impeccable.
In terms of a 5 star hotel the rooms were reasonably priced, the food and drink was a tad pricey but that's pretty normal in any 5 star in Dublin. I was pleased that they had a great stay there.",5,2014,02,17
205,Dublin Four Seasons Shines,"I always expect quality at a Four Seasons hotel but Dublin surpasses them all.  The resort feeling embraces you the moment you walk through the doors.  Hospitality and Irish warmth abounds. 
Breakfast was a feast for a king.  The beds.... need I say more!",5,2014,02,16
205,Racing Weekend at Leopardstown,"Received a very warm and personal welcome from the concierge on arrival, bags whisked away effortlessly and I had a nice glass of champagne in my hand before I knew it! Lovely stay in a fantastic and very comfortable suite. Impeccable service provided as always. Great location for a working weekend at Leopardstown races. Highly recommended.",5,2014,02,12
205,fabulous personal treatment and very comfortable room,fabulous personal treatment and very comfortable room. i stay here often and always get a personal welcome from the concierge and the front desk. the rooms are very comfortable and a bonus is having a free shoeshine every night!,5,2014,02,11
205,Very enjoyable stay. Top notch service expected from a Four Seasons hotel.,"Had a great experience at the four seasons. Convenient to the DART and service was top notch.  Bed was very comfortable and cozy, though it was quite dated.  Bathroom was very spacious and used la occitane products.  Location is also great. However, the spa was quite pricey compared to outside, but the steam room was great! My only major complaint is the internet.  They only allow you to have free wifi with one device and It took me a long time to connect",4,2014,02,08
205,Very Grand,This is certainly a magnificent hotel with outstandingly attentive and friendly staff. The public areas are extremely grand and spacious. The bedrooms are large and very well appointed. The prices match opulence of the decor. When I visited the hotel was extremely quiet. Breakfast buffet was all that might have been expected but the dinner menu was disappointing and most guests seemed to be eating elsewhere in the City. The location is just outside the city centre but that is no real difficulty.,4,2014,01,31
205,Excellent staff,"We were only able to stay 2 nights, so didn't have time to experience all the amenities, but the staff treated us very well.
All of our requests were filled to beyond our satisfaction.
Ron, the doorman, was especially helpful to us, on more than one occasion, with directions, recommendations, a bottle of water to take along.  What a gem of a man.
Kudos to the Four Seasons for your excellent staff.",5,2014,01,30
205,Tired Rooms,Travel frequently for work and generally avoid Four Seasons. Pretentious and charged for everything at every turn - internet charges chief among these! Upgraded to a suite but what a tired suite it was. Colors were very passé. Coffee service in room has to be requested and service wasn't replenished daily without request. Nice staff etc. Feel as though cabs think you have a bottomless corporate wallet when announcing Four Seasons as your destination. Not true. ,3,2014,01,28
205,Wonderful hotel outside of the city center.,"Luxurious hotel, everything I expect from the Four Seasons.  Short walk to the train into the city center.  Discovered a lovely eatery, Browns, within a short walk on the morning of departure.  Wish we'd found Browns sooner!  Concierge were very helpful.",5,2014,01,27
205,NOW I won't stay anywhere else!! Fabulous Hotel,"A group of us - 7 people, 2 couples / rest friends.....

We landed in Dublin, Larry our driver was waiting with a sign and a smile! Transfer to the hotel was smooth, about 20 minute drive.

On arrival, we were greeted by the FS Team. Check in had been completed already for us and keys handed over to the most beautiful rooms! The Deluxe Suites are stunning. Everything you could possibly need - a bed that if you had a choice, you wouldn't get out of....pillows that melt.

Amazing well appointed rooms with all mod cons and requirements.

Breakfast - Great coffee and juices. Attentive service. 
The menu isn't huge, but it doesn't need to be. A small buffet is available with select list of tasty options which are made for you. Omelettes, Eggs Benedict, A Full English etc plus healthier options. 

The SPA is gorgeous. A narrow but long pool, with a luxurious feel. 

Taxi's from right outside take you into Drummond Street or Temple Bar - between 11 - 15 EURO each way depending on how many passengers. The doormen are helpful and knowledgeable about the area.

I would certainly return!  I couldnt have asked for a better overall experience anywhere else. Four Seasons never disappoints!",5,2014,01,27
205,Comfortably grand,"Impressive looking hotel, the taxi driver told us we would have to take our shoes off inside the hotel and wear slippers. As grand as this hotel is, the staff could not be friendlier or more helpful. It is a luxurious hotel but not imposing or snooty in any way.
The room was large and beautifully furnished, fantastic bathroom. 
The gym was well equipped for a decent workout and we made use of the pool and jacuzzi, both were nice and warm.
Breakfast was tasty and good value, I had the Irish, my OH had the pancakes. The difference between an English and Irish breakfast? They're Dublin up on the portions in Ireland.
The no flower chocolate pudding and baileys coffee were just what was needed when we got in from a cold wet Dublin afternoon.
As lovely as this hotel is, it's the staff that provide the comfort.",4,2014,01,27
205,excellent staff and service,"Nice hotel, with plush mattress and large flat screen.  The gym was more than sufficient with a lap pool, free weights, weight machines and treadmills.  Hotel is within walking distance to several restaurants and pubs which provides for a nice variety of dining options.  Complimentary parking and valet option was nice.  Overall it was the staff and level of service that made the difference turning ordinary into extraordinary.",5,2014,01,22
205,Ideal location,"Multigenerational family(9 of us) Christmas/New Year vacation. Helpful and delightful staff, thank you,Patrick, for the BMW rides. After a rather disappointing Dinner/show elsewhere our New Year's Eve ended with a delightful  evening in the lobby with new friends

205,Fantastic Hotel,"The Car was waiting for us when we arrived at the Airport our driver Liam, was so kind and very helpful during our entire stay.and  upon arrival at the hotel we were greeted and escorted by management  to a large comfortable room.  The Staff was extremely helpful and pleasant. The location is a five minute drive from City Center. We ordered room service several times and were quite happy with it we also ate breakfast every morning in the hotel and it was excellent. Overall a very nice experience and we will defiantly stay here again. Unlike the Ritz London, which we stayed following our trip to Dublin. Just goes to show, I will always choose a four seasons over The Ritz. from now on.",5,2014,01,20
205,4 Seasons Dublin,"A very nice hotel. All your need will be covered here. Very nice workout room and pool. Nice restaurant and good service. The staff is more than helpful. They have a car service at this hotel. Maybe a couple euros more than a taxi,but we'll worth it. The drivers are friendly and have a very good knowledge of the area. The staff at the hotel staff is very helpful and the hotel is very very clean. You can't go wrong with the four seasons.",5,2014,01,19
205,"A few snafoos; but in terms of room size & standard- the overall quality here, is far superior.","I believe that when one stays in a facility for over a month; their perspective is slightly different than a weekend- only guest.
Compared to the average hotel room- it was usually much more comfortable. 
The full array of deluxe amenities, {such as French toiletries, flowery curtains, soft bed linens, cotton slippers & terry cloth robes} was there, as expected.
The room thermostat worked quite well- and I was able to adjust the temperature as desired.
I really liked watching a full array of international channels- on the TV set.
The room was kept very clean, to general Four Seasons standard. 
The room lights are quite bright; and thus could use dimmers.
During the night hours; it was delightfully quiet.
Most often, the days were tranquil, too. 
The bedroom carpets helped with soundproofing the room- as did limited buffering on external doors.
The walls are solid, & thicker than those at most hotels that I've stayed at.
Occasionally, issues would crop up with inconsiderate housekeepers- but management was responsive to my requests not to be unduly disturbed.
The expected standard of Four Seasons' front desk & concierge  services- is definitely there.
I am pleased to note that management, {especially Mr. Pritam} bent over backwards to resolve any & all issues or requests that I had.
As for the overall lobby & public area's atmosphere; it is a bit snobby and pretentious. 
Despite a lack of written dress code; men are predominately wearing suits & ties, and casual attire is almost unheard of.
The surrounding Ballsbridge neighborhood, is upscale- but not low key. The denizens tend to be EXTREMELY haughty & condescending- towards those they deem not to fit in here.
It was a bleak & dismal place to spend the holiday season alone.
The Four Seasons Dublin is best suited to specific types of people; especially those who enjoy dressing up to the tee, & being seen. 
I would most highly recommend it for business conference attendees, formal groups, familes, & certain couples.",4,2014,01,18
205,A very good hotel,"I took a suite here with my family for a few days break. It is the best hotel that I've been to in Ireland, of which I've visited many. However, it wasn't the best Four Seasons that I've been to. I was at the one in Vegas recently and that was much better. I don't remember what the Vegas one cost but this one was certainly Four Seasons prices. We paid about £750 per night for a suite that comfortably slept 4 and did another couple of hundred on room service without any effort. 

The pool was quiet and good for the kids. The jacuzzi is very nice and big. The food was good, but not great... but then it never is in Ireland. They don't get food.

The only complaint I have is that my 5 year old found a pill (some medicine) on the floor under the bed. She didn't eat it. Could happen somewhere I guess.

If you are going to Dublin, this is certainly the place to stay. Dublin doesn't have anything better.",4,2014,01,18
205,every detail covered,"Four Seasons was a dreamy, unforgettable destination in Dublin.  Staff do their best to accommodate or anticipate the needs of weary and eager travelers alike.  We loved the luxury, décor and comforts of our room and larger-than average bathroom.   LOVELY",5,2014,01,16
205,Treated like royalty,A special and luxurious hotel. The room was huge and beautifully decorated.  The staff was super Friendly and  waited on us hand and foot.   A really nice surprise was A basket of treats in our room upon arrival.  Unfortunately my son has a nut allergy so he couldn't indulge.  They more then made up for it bringing everyone popcorn and ice cream.   The only downside was that the kids loved the hotel so much that they didn't want to leave and do any sight seeing.  They just wanted hang by the pool and use the exercise room.,5,2014,01,15
205,"The best, as expected.","When you check into a Four Seasons you expect perfection. And this is what the hotel delivers. From arrival to departure and everything in between this is a true five star hotel. Service is impeccable, personalized, unobtrusive yet attentive. Rooms are spacious, perfectly appointed, with bathrooms to live in. The bar is a treat, breakfast in either the lobby bar or seasons restaurant is sumptuous. The location is a bit out of town but therefore serene and quiet. Take the hotel's limousines for your daily trips, they are immaculate and hardly more expensive than taxis which can be hard to find at times in Dublin. The Spa is elegant and soothing, sauna could be a tad hotter and of course mixed (but only for us Europeans). All in all, one of the best hotels I ever stayed in. Look no further if in Dublin.",5,2014,01,15
205,Outstanding first class hotel!,"I stayed at this hotel in December with my brothers. Everything about this hotel is 5 stars. The staff was terrific, the accommodations were amazing and the food outstanding. It's the little things in life that I truly enjoy and in this case, having slippers laid out at my bedside is one of them. Who knew that something so simple was all I needed... loved it! On our last night in Dublin, we arrived back at the hotel kind of late and the bar was already closed. The bartender was kind enough to re-open it so we could enjoy a few pints as well as the best burger I've ever eaten in my life. 
Is this an expensive hotel? Of course it is, it's the Four Seasons, what do you expect. But when I booked, they were offering a special stay 2 nights and get the 3rd night free.  For what we paid, it was actually an incredible value. We had two rooms for 3 night, all for under $1,400. Normally when I travel, it's with the wife and kids so this was a rare opportunity to stay at an awesome hotel and only be on the hook for a 1/4 of the final tab. Would I do it again? in a New York minute!
If you want to experience Dublin on a first class level, this is the hotel you want to stay at.",5,2014,01,12
205,No cead Mile Failte here!,"Arriving a few minutes early for lunch with a group of friends in the Dublin 'Four Seasons Hotel' recently, I foolishly asked the gentleman on reception whether there was a convenient washroom that I could use. 
He confirmed that this was the case and assured me, with lofty contempt, that the hotel had a full range of such modern amenities.  
 I can do without overly friendly greetings in some hotels, but this is the first occasion on which I have been swiftly and gratuitously insulted by a receptionist on arrival. 
Who do these people think they are? Is this the image which the hotel's management wants to project?  I won't be back in this snooty and supercilious hotel, notwithstanding its full range of modern conveniences.",2,2014,01,11
205,New Year Delight,"We love this hotel, fourth time this year, booked 30th Dec went New Years Eve had a lovely break. Good to see family's enjoying this property. The hotel had a great atmosphere, the staff were very attentive and the service excellent. It was one of the better New Years Eve experiences that we have had. The Seasons  and Reading Room Restaurant were booked out but we ate in the bar/lobby  - food was superb and the service first class and very attentive. Breakfast to die for. My wife went to the Spa and while it was quite expensive see said it was amazing. 
As always a lovely relaxing break and not that expensive for what u get, with the Tunnel it can take you there in just over an hour. It won't be long before we find an excuse to be back.",5,2014,01,08
205,Family stay between Xmax and New Year,"I never write hotel reviews although I always use them! It was an excellent experience and the staff were great.  Kids well looked after and good value for them, their meals were around 10 euros excl drinks, desert.

A little disappointed with the adult menu which was pretty limited and no different if you wanted to have a ""special"" meal in the main dining area.  Having said that, the food quality was excellent and prices reasonable considering both where you are staying and the fact that Dublin is expensive anyway.

Service was always good and when mistakes were made (happened twice) they were rectified immediately, in one case we had a free round of drinks - so happy with that.

My only gripe was the amount of time we had to wait for drinks from the bar on our last night, both rounds we waited around 20 mins and the cocktails were not great - we put this down to how busy it was that particular night, but it should not have happened particularly to guests of the hotel.

The suite, facilities and friendly staff made this a very enjoyable stay.

I would have given it 5*, however, considering the cost of 4 days in a suite and my end bill (we didn't skimp on food, drink and room service) against the last night of service, it gets a 4*.

I would definitely stay again....",4,2014,01,07
205,Excellent Stay!,"Loved this hotel.  It is an oasis in Dublin and I would highly recommend it.  The value is also very good.  It is adjacent to the ""RDS"" - so be sure to stay there during a horse show/event as it is has its own ""private entrance"" to the facility.  The staff, the rooms, the food, everything was, as they say, ""just lovely!""",5,2014,01,06
205,Simply superb!,"Stayed for a weekend pre-Christmas in the Four Seasons -wow what an amazing experience!  From valet parking to  a swift and helpful check in to our junior suite where there were amazing treats in the room since it was my birthday.  The suite was excellent what a fabulous bed -very comfortable, the decor was very attractive and the facilities excellent from a high quality tv to a well stocked minibar.

The decorations for Christmas were excellent especially a Hansel and Gretels cottage made by the pastry chefs which was lifesize!
Breakfast was a veritable feast either from the a la carte menu or the buffet;the selection of juices, fruits, breads was unimaginable.  we loitered over breakfast having endless cups of tea (silver pots and real tea leaves) and were made to feel right at home.  we spent afternoons having afternoon tea in the lobby again a feast for all the senses.  

The decor, the luxury of this five star hotel are superb but their attention to detail and superb service are what sets this hotel apart!  It is expensive but when you need a treat this is an amazing experience!",5,2014,01,03
205,My last ever review of this hotel…..,"Why? Because I won't be back unless it's on a room only basis for the Dublin Horse Show as the hotel is convenient to the RDS. Why room only? Because the dining experience is not now ""disappointing"" as per my last review but farcical as I shall explain shortly.

Stayed here for two nights just after Christmas with my husband and two children in adjoining deluxe rooms booked through Grand Luxury Hotels (gets you your breakfast included and a spa credit). Rooms were fine, check-in efficient and rooms were available ahead of check-in time. Seems that there are some improvements since my last visit in September with free parking and Wi-fi although the kids had difficulty in connecting to the internet.

Had lunch on arrival - 2 days after Christmas and the hotel had run out of ingredients for the festive sandwich - my soup was luke-warm bordering on cold - this was not a good start. However since hubby and kids seemed to enjoy their lunch ok, said nothing.

Had dinner in the Lobby bar on return from a trip to the theatre - although service was a bit slow, food was good when it arrived (although it beggars belief that a 5 star hotel does not have a fine dining restaurant). 

It was the following day that things really went downhill. Service at breakfast was very slow- hot buffet was misdescribed in that it should have been warm buffet, and a simple request for some brown sauce was not complied with - in the end I ate my fry without it. Just thinking about it makes me realise that this is the only 5 star hotel I have stayed in that actually has a breakfast buffet- in all the other 5 star and indeed most of the 4 star hotels I have stayed at, hot breakfast orders are prepared from scratch.

There was a rugby match at the RDS show grounds and a large influx of guests arrived during Saturday. It seems that with any substantial increase in the number of guests the food and restaurant service simply goes to pot. We were going to walk down to Sandymount village on Saturday night to eat, but after a couple of drinks in the bar, decided to eat again in the hotel. 

Big mistake! Although a lot of people had gone to the match by the time we sat down for dinner, the service was quite quite appalling!  Our order was taken promptly and we got our drinks, but it was 40 minutes before our mains arrived - fish and chips and chicken fingers for the kids - food that could be prepared in no time! The food only arrived after we had complained about the delay. We had also asked for some bread and this arrived a minute after our main courses had been set down (which really defeats the purpose.)

Dessert was a total farce. I asked for pavlova and the kids had desserts from the kid's menu. Twenty five minutes later nothing had arrived, and again a further enquiry was made. Hubby does not tolerate bad service and was getting increasingly annoyed. Shortly after a waitress arrived with two pavlovas. When we said we had only ordered one, she lifted both and headed to the table next to us where she set one down and walked off with the other. We watched as she circled the room several times clearly not knowing what to do with the other dessert. The kids' desserts then arrived, and as they ate their last mouthfuls, my pavlova finally arrived. 

Dinner was a fiasco from start to finish, and although the member of staff we complained to was most apologetic it is just not acceptable at all to have such poor service. As I have said before, if the hotel knows it is going to be busy PUT MORE STAFF ON!

Breakfast on Sunday was worse than Saturday. We were put into the Lobby bar as the breakfast room was full. We were assured that a full buffet had been set out there but this was not the case. There was no fresh fruit and although a waitress fetched us fruit plates, it's not the same as choosing it yourself. The ""hot"" food was stone cold although I did get some brown sauce!

This hotel does have its good points. The rooms are comfortable (although a little dated and like most hotel rooms far too hot). The spa is lovely - I had a very relaxing back massage, and the staff are very polite. For me however, for the 5 star price I paid, I expect the FULL 5 star package and the dismal restaurant service totally ruined our stay. One other gripe was the fact that the wall heaters in the smoking area were not on, presumably broken. In temperatures barely above freezing, going out for a cigarette was not an enjoyable experience.

In conclusion, my advice would be - if its a ""normal"" time you are going to visit this hotel, then go ahead, everything will be perfect. If there is an event such as a rugby match/concert/horse show, go elsewhere.",2,2013,12,29
205,Amazing hotel,"I have never been one for leaving reviews of hotels we've stayed at as they've all been fairly disappointing. We would travel a lot to Dublin for rugby games and would use the large hotels right beside the Aviva for convenience, although most times we compromise on the quality for the location. We have always found these hotels to have very unhelpful staff, rooms that are dirty or falling apart and prices that would make them seem self elevated. 
For a change we booked into the Four Seasons hotel in Ballsbridge beside the RDS, and a very short walk to the Aviva. From the minute we arrived we knew it would be a great stay. The door staff we're great, very helpful, the staff at the check in desk couldn't do enough for us, they were fantastic , and in the evening the bar/restaurant staff were amazing. We felt so comfortable and we're made to feel very special, in particular a member of staff called Jennifer went out of her way for us.
Price wise it was as good as if not better than some lesser hotels. The rooms were absolutely spotless, they were immaculate, and very quiet. 
We shall never stay at another hotel after being here, 10 out of 10.",5,2013,12,29
205,Limited experience but negative,"I was actually staying at the Herbert Park Hotel (a very nice hotel 5 minutes from the Four Seasons) and needed a haircut. The HP advised the Four Seasons. I phoned them and was pleased that they could fit me in 10 minutes later so I walked down.

For me Four Seasons is synonymous with style, service and an amazing level of client focus. One of my best hotel experiences ever has been with this hotel group in the Gresham Palace in Budapest.

Unfortunately the salon, that I expect to be on the same level as the Four Seasons group, though they've obviously got a concession arrangement for this aspect, made the classic error I would barely expect from low end corner establishments. The price quoted was €25, which seemed very reasonable. The problem is that when a man books into a salon and requests quite a simple cut (number 1, all over) the salon sometimes hears ""this man doesn't care what we do, let's do a little as possible and sen him on his way"". Which is exactly what happened. I was in the chair for about 7 minutes, maximum. The woman seemed like she had never cut a man's hair before in her life. She had to borrow all of the equipment from a colleague, running back an forward across the salon. She never picked up a scissors during the whole exercise. No mirror was shown so I could see the back. She tried to even out a few stray hairs here and there with an electric trimmer. I could go on, but that pretty much summarises the 7 minutes I was summarily afforded.

Four Seasons, please have a word. Your salon has made the mistake of confusing a simple request with a reason not to pay sufficient care to the client. I expect more and this taints my view of what to me is a premium brand. If I wanted a lack of care and a cavalier attitude I wouldn't have gone to the Four Seasons.

I did mention to the woman who was collecting the money that I thought my hairdresser had a lack of experience with men and she said no, that she had done three cuts just before me. She did however, as she put through the payment in an embarrassed fashion say, oh, let's call it €20. Not bad for 7 minutes work. However, I didn't go to the Four Seasons looking for a bargain. I probably won't be back. Shame.",1,2013,12,24
205,39 heavenly nights,"I had the pleasure of staying here for almost 6weeks while out on a business project with my firm.

I could write a very detailed review about my stay, but I will get to the point and say that it is probably one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in. The service was at a level that I've not experienced, and it was consistently high throughout my entire stay.

All the staff from front desk, bar, kitchen, right through to housekeeping and room service made me feel at home, and furthermore met any and all requests I had of them. While everyone was brilliant, there are two members of staff that deserve a notable mention- Preetam (front desk) who met and helped any requests I had in relation to my stay, and David (concierge) who was very helpful in booking the variety of places I wanted to visit whilst in Dublin.

The hotel itself although a little away from central Dublin (35 min walk) has a very good car service, local taxis appear immediately, is located two minute walk from SandyMount rail station and has regular buses running outside of it. It is grand and also provides a sense of occasion and importance other hotels in Dublin don't, that make your stay feel extra special. It has a lovely breakfast room that overlooks the courtyard, with plenty of breakfast choices, the main restaurant and bar are very good with staff always trying to please. The gym and spa is a good size, and the pool is usually quiet after 7pm so it can feel like you have the whole place to yourself, (not a bad thing after a days work!).

I cannot thank the staff enough for making me feel at home and going to the efforts they did to keep me happy as I'm not a man who is easily pleased, and i would highly recommend The Four Seasons to everybody that wants to stay in Dublin. ",5,2013,12,24
205,Disappointed..would have expected more from The Four Seasons,"This was a Christmas treat and we really splashed out on this hotel. I have visited the hotel many times before but had never stayed over.

Valet parking was excellent and a real treat, check in was pleasant and efficient. When we arrived to our room 356, I was so disappointed. The room is large, but is not luxury, in fact it is anything but! Old furniture, tired carpet, and really awful lights. The bathroom was ok, but not the quality I would expect. In a 5 star you should not want to leave your room as it's so nice, but I was happy to spend as little time as possible in the room.  
Breakfast room is lovely, and you can have buffet or A la carte, i got Eggs Benedict! which was lovely. Teenage kids opted for buffet, and she said it was cold and tasteless. 
We used the car service into town..twice, and the driver was lovely, but it's a bit expensive at €15. 
All in all, not the 5 star experience that I expected. ",3,2013,12,22
205,Beautiful second stay at this Gorgeous Hotel,"Originally we planned to stay at another hotel in one of the suburbs of Dublin as our Christmas present for each other. 

Realizing we wanted something more memorable we were looking out for our favorite hotels. We found a very good deal on the Four Seasons' website and decided to go for it. The deal included a guaranteed room upgrade to the next category and breakfast either in room or at the Seasons Restaurant.

We took Bus 7 from Trinity College towards Loughlinstown and got off at the RDS stop. The Four Seasons Hotel is just a few steps behind the Royal Dublin Society (RDS). The National Craft Show was going on, so it was really busy.

We had stayed at the hotel four years earlier and also visited for cocktails or lunch over the years. 

It has changed quite a lot. For example check in is not any longer to the left side when entering, but to the right.

The lobby has been also modernized and has some daring pink splashes in the lounge for example. 

Check in was very pleasant and we were offered another very special deal. We could upgrade for a reasonable amount to a Junior Suite, which we decided to take. Otherwise we would have received a Deluxe Room.  We were recognized as returning guests. We also asked for a late check out, which was no problem at all. Our room wasn't ready yet, so we went for lunch at the lounge. 

It was ca. 1.5 hours before official check in time when we arrived. We were in the middle of eating our starter when the receptionist came with our key cards. 

After finishing our meal we went up to see for ourselves what the Junior Suite looked like. It fulfilled our expectations completely. The suite was open plan and large. There was a hall way with a large wardrobe, leading off to the large bathroom to the right or to the bed room and separate sitting area, when going straight.

The room was kept mostly in gold, brown and green colors. We had views over the RDS and Ballsbridge. 

The bed was very large with a credenza and a huge TV in front of it. The Four Seasons has the most TV channels available of any Dublin hotel we have stayed so far. There are regional and international channels including CNN and Bloomberg, Arabic, German, Italian and much more.

The minibar was stocked with Sunraysia juices, beer, water and other soft drinks.

The sitting area consisted of a large sofa, a comfortable armchair, large coffee table with Photography books and magazines and a writing desk. There was another credenza with a slightly too small TV.

The safe didn't function, but we had trust in the staff and thought it was unlikely somebody would break into our room. Valuables can be also handed over to reception. Staff will store them in the main safe.

The furniture was scratch free and having tested all, comfortable. We spent hours talking and watching TV.

The lightning was bright, which was a plus. We don't like too dark rooms. 

The fully marbled bathroom had the typical Four Seasons set up with a separate bath tub and shower, one sink and a lot of storage space for cosmetics. There were also the usual L' Occitaine bath room amenities.

In room dining is 24 hours a day available. We enjoyed hot chocolate, a pot of green tea, a milkshake, a large bottle of still water, Farmhouse Chicken Soup and chocolate mousse with caramelized banana and peanut butter ice cream. The bill came in at 63 Euro (ca. 85 USD) including tip. 

There was also a turn down service, but there weren't any free goodies, like free water or chocolate. The bed was made and slippers put out. The gentleman was very friendly and asked if he could also check the bathroom and if we needed anything else before leaving.

You might wonder what we had for lunch earlier in the day. We had two seasonal cocktails, a cappuccino, a hot chocolate, chicken lollipops (messy eating, but tasty), turkey with ham and root vegetables and venison with greens and red cabbage. The bill was 96 Euro (ca. 130 USD) including tip.

After a good nights sleep we had breakfast at the Seasons Restaurant.

There was a buffet with a selection of cold cuts, smoked salmon, fruits, vegetable, yogurt and much more. There was also an egg station and a la carte items were included in our rate. He had French Toast, which was large enough to feed two and me an omelet. 

Afterwards we spent some time exploring the ""Sculpture in Context"" exhibition - the largest and most prestigious outdoor sculpture exhibition in Ireland by emerging and established artists. It is going on until early January 2014 in the courtyard.

Time Out by Ana Duncan, The Fat Lady Swings by Mike Duhan and A Gathering by Maureen Bush were a few of our favorites. All the art can be purchased ranging from 140 Euro to 30.000 Euro (ca. 189 USD to 40.491 USD).

Unfortunately and way too quickly check out arrived. Again it was quick, warm and friendly.

We can't say enough about the warm, welcoming and knowledgeable staff, the perfect condition of the hardware and the excellent food.

Naturally we are going to return.

Would we recommend this hotel to a friend? YES!
Would we stay again at this hotel? YES!",5,2013,12,22
205,Just lovely ,"I stayed here for the weekend with a friend-we were on a rugby trip but booked our own accommodation.
The room was huge and the beds were wonderful-I felt like I was sleeping on a cloud. 
The welcome from the staff and the service throughout was fabulous. 
We ate breakfast at the hotel and had a light bite one evening. Both meals were great and not too badly priced considering the hotel and the city.
The cocktails in the lounge were some of the best I have ever had, I need the secret recipe for the Purple Tinsel! 
A big thanks to all staff and the management for an excellent hotel experience. I shall return. ",5,2013,12,22
205,Luxurious weekend retreat,"Really enjoyed our 3 night stay at the Four Seasons.  The hotel is really beautiful with great attention to details and customer satisfaction.  The location is a little removed from the airport, so average 30 to 45 minutes in a taxi.  Ate at the restaurant a couple of times and the food is delicious and very well prepared.   Overall,  it was a wonderful trip and I would recommend it.",5,2013,12,21
205,Amazing!! ,"I stayed here this week with my husband and we were so impressed. The service throughout the hotel was incredible and our room was amazing. 

We had lunch in the drawing room which is beautiful & cocktails in ICE in the evening which were also excellent!

I will definitely be returning to this hotel when staying in the city. ",5,2013,12,20
205,"A lovely place to stay, just outside the bustle of the City centre","Had a great weekend here, the suite was wonderful, quiet and we slept v well. Breakfast was good, the Restaurant at night on Saturday mediocre due to the loud party next door having a Christmas party.",5,2013,12,19
205,"excellent staff, great rates, wonderful food, well appointed rooms, excellent location - what's not to like?","not much more to say - the title says it all, great hotel and better value than most in current economic climate.
close to city centre, a 10 euro taxi gets you to all the shopping you can do.
breakfast was great overall, with the exception of the coffee, perhaps brewed a little too long...",5,2013,12,19
205,Panto and Christmas shopping ,Me and the family was here last week for a panto show that was on at the gaiety theatre and some Christmas shopping must say the hotel go the extra bit for the kids with homemade cookies and sweets with there names on them as a welcome gift to the room. Excellent staff and facility's the staff was all very helpful and friendly. The suite was spaces and comfortable the kids loved the swimming pool early in the morning. Stay in the hotel most times we are in Dublin it never let us down. ,5,2013,12,15
205,Five star Four Seasons,"Due to a flood in my home I was forced to decamp to the nearby Fours Seasons Dublin for 4 days.  Stressful though the situation in my house was, the joy of staying at the FS alleviated it.  The staff are so pleasant and obliging (of course they are it's the Four Seasons, but they are really very nice) and it felt like I was on holiday.

My deluxe room was so comfortable, and the en suite was one of the best I've experienced, gorgeous.  I can only imagine what the larger suites are like.

Great breakfast, and the food at the Ice bar was excellent too, if a little pricey, but hey, it the Four Seasons, what do you expect?!",5,2013,12,14
205,Wonderful Stay at Four Seasons Dublin,"The Four Seasons is a wonderful treat. Large room and bath is difficult thing to come accross sometimes so having that was wonderful. Instead of using cabs definately use the limo/car service. It is only a few Euro more than a regular cab but you ride in style and comfort! The concierge will do all the work for you as well and there are great local restaurants and pubs, that are walkable from the hotel,  if you don't want to trave into busy Dublin in the evenings.",5,2013,12,12
205,Excellent staff and facilities. A little way out of town.,"The Four Seasons is an upmarket hotel that ticks all the boxes. The staff were all very helpful and friendly, the room was spacious and comfortable and the hotel facilities were all that you could expect. The room was large and had perfect heating and plumbing - in my experience no mean feat in such a large building.The TV had access to all channels including Sky Sports and BBC - better than being at home! The bed was great and the blackout curtains meant a restful sleep. Breakfast was great. The hotel bar served a perfect (if expensive) pint of Guiness. We didn't eat in the restaurant, so breakfast apart, can't comment on the food. The only criticism is that it is a good 30-40 minute brisk walk (15 euro taxi fare or 2.5 euro bus fare) from the town centre.",5,2013,12,11
205,Unmatched in Ireland,true 5 star hotel which i have stayed in on many occasions without fault and nothing is a problem to the fantastic staff who work here. Room service is ultra prompt and again nothing is a problem. New televisions in rooms and renovation work being carried out is securing its position as top 5 star.,5,2013,12,11
205,Love It,"Tried many accommodations in Dublin. For sure there are several nice places in town. But over years now: Here is sustainable top class service and overall condition guaranteed. Nice and cosy atmosphere even it is not a small hotel.
See you soon",5,2013,12,09
205,Great place to stay,"Best place in Dublin. The hotel has it all. Gym, Pool, great rooms and beds. Great hospitality among staff and nice always someone to help. All in all a enjoyable place to stay, and I have never found anything to complain about.",5,2013,12,09
205,Simply fab,"I have just spent a long weekend at this hotel and the experience from start to finish was just fabulous. I have stayed quite a few times in Dublin in different hotels but have never felt so at home as in the Four Seasons. The rooms are large, with flat screen TV, loads of channels to choose from, comfy kings size bed, really clean as was the whole of the hotel. Staff was really friendly, professional and always on hand to help you in any way they could.Thanks to all who made our short stay unforgetable.",5,2013,12,05
205,"Never start your trip in Ireland at the four seasons....you'll be too spoiled to enjoy the other ""5 star"" hotels","Yes, the hotel is a 20 min walk from city center, BUT, does it ever make up for it in a million ways. We arrived after a semi-long flight from ATL and were thrilled that our suite was ready at 8 am!!!!! The room was huge, well appointed and beyond comfortable. It was quiet and the AC worked perfectly. Our view overlooked a beautiful fountain. Our first 3 days in Dublin we were jet lagged and spent -too much time really- in our room. The tub in the all marble bathroom was luxurious and a great place to unwind and enjoy. Room service was hit or miss. Bar downstairs was fab. Didn't try the restaurant. The have a car that takes you into town and the driver was a delight and hilarious! What makes a hotel, besides maintenance, is the staff. Only the Ritz London has equaled the level of customer service we experienced at the Four Seasons Dublin. I won't bother to name all of the brilliant staff because each and every one was perfect and exceeded our high expectations. The Shelbourne seemed like a dump after this, and even Merchant in Belfast was nothing special. Keep up the good work and we will be back, as will our friends!",5,2013,12,04
205,Spectacular Hotel,"Stayed 7 nights this past November.  Concierge was fabulous and extrememly helpful.  Restaurants were too pricey for my family but plenty nearby to choose from.  The Dart (Dublin's train) is only one block away and taxis are plentiful tho expensive.  Overall, a definite five star hotel with five star service.",5,2013,12,04
205,Excellent service - great staff,"We stayed at the Four Seasons Dublin on a recent trip to Dublin.  Our two rooms in the hotel were booked by a travel agent with a vacation package.  The accommodations were very nice.  The rooms were large and well appointed.  Large king sized beds, a desk, smart TV, DVD player, room safe all included.  The only complaints were one room booked as a double and was a king.  The other room provided was handicap accessible (not by request) and the shower was unmanageable.  

On the plus side, we arrived in Dublin early in the morning, fresh from a redeye flight.  Although check-in is not until 3pm, the front desk clerk checked us into one room right away which allowed us to rest and freshen up before starting our day.  The staff was just as responsive to every other request; hypoallergenic pillows and comforter, extra bedding, coffee service, etc.  

The restaurant was expensive, but the food was very good.  There were other restaurants in the area, but there was not much in the way of sightseeing nearby.  Fortunately, Dublin is not too large and travel around the city was quick enough.  We had rented a car and the hotel offers free self-parking, a nice touch when you're already paying a high price for a room.

We visited on a family trip with older teens.  While the hotel was nice, it would not be my first choice for another family stay.  I would look for something closer to sightseeing, or a better value.",4,2013,12,01
205,A1 service,"A long weekend gave us a taste of this top class hotel. The foyer is traditional and you get an idea of how well everything is done around here. The staff are pleasant and always around, the dining room was a well run ship with the lunch menu a real treat, the paté was a taste of heaven. The room was large and comfortably traditional, we liked it all. One of the best hotels we've stayed at. Reassuringly expensive.",5,2013,12,01
205,"Better is simply not possible. The entire chain is expensive, but is worth every Cent.","The entire chain is expensive, but is worth every Cent. I have spent probably a couple of months in that particular hotel over the past few years and, even though, the crisis in Ireland left its mark there too, it is still the best address in Dublin. A more personal experience is impossible to find. When, after having stayed away for almost 2 years, you are still addressed by your name right at the door you cannot help it but feel right at home. I can only recommend this place.",5,2013,11,27
205,Just class,"we stayed three nights over a very busy weekend, big conference in the hotel and international rugby match in Dublin. Staff were very attentive, food was great, both breakfast and dinner, room was spacious and spotless. 
Can't speak highly enough of Liam, restaurant manager, and Fiona, lounge manager. They took time to chat with us, remember our names and our little boy. In a busy hotel this is just a good feeling. 
This is the best hotel in Ireland by a long way, they go the extra mile in every wait.
Can't wait tip next time.",5,2013,11,27
205,"Things have changed, for the worse","Was attending the same company dinner as I do every year in this hotel.
First impression: many of the familiar faces that used to work and run this successful property seem to have left it. 
The Restaurant has closed as such, now they have downsized the food options to the Lobby area and reading room. Food is OK, not great for a supposedly 5* establishment.
Bedrooms have not changed at all, same flower deco on the curtains, same carpets in the common corridors, same Xstmas decorations on the front door. Tight budget we can call it, but it does not go unnoticed. 
Same goes for the Main Ballroom were our event was held, supposedly the biggest in the city and the most run down probably as well. The carpet is screaming for change, the whole interior design of the Main Ballroom of this hotel must have looked dated 15 years back, imagine how it looks in 2014. 10 years I have attended functions in this hotel and that Main Ballroom has not changed a bit... more than your home away from home, it feels like visiting your Granny's living room when away from home. Staff serving the function spaces has also changed quiet a bit, a lack of professionalism and passion seem to be the rule. Blame it on the busy end of the year push... 
I have not stayed in other Four Seasons properties recently, but my fear is that Dublin is losing to tough competition in the city and struggles to retain good employees. I hope it improves for next year.",2,2013,11,26
205,"Four Seasons, Four Reasons to Love it","1.  The staff are incredibly helpful and courteous.  Everyone we met was wonderful.
2.  Bathrooms and Mattresses:  For us, these are the two biggies in a hotel room.  This hotel passed with flying colours.  Great room.
3.  Food:  The restaurant food was superb, perfectly prepared and presented.
4.  Cleanliness:  Spotless.

Two downers:  a) Wifi service is hard to access (the concierge even had trouble trying to help me), is not available throughout the property, and is restricted to one device per room (of course, one can pay for the other device access).  Get it right, Four Seasons.  It matters.  b) Inconvenient to tourist attractions, unless by car.  Public transportation available, but staff was not sure how to use it.  Long (40ish minutes) walk to Grafton St., but very scenic and pleasant.

Bottom line:  Up to Four Season standards overall.  If the two hiccups matter to you, you might want to consider another site.",5,2013,11,25
205,Simply perfect location and perfect stay!,"Simply perfect location and perfect stay! The staff is very firendly and professional.
Even if the transfers have been organized by an external company, it has been done perfectly. The driver gave us good recommendation and took care to organize our return transfer.
The welcome was very warm and the service very smouth.",5,2013,11,24
205,Traditional hotel with excellent service,"Hey if you like flower curtins, green carpets and traditional furniture - this is your place.  The bathrooms are great, the suites are spacious and have Nespressso machines.
The breakfast was below my expectation in particular the fruit variety. The fitness is slightly small but the machines are good.",4,2013,11,24
205,Definitely not Four Seasons International Standard,"When you are used to Four Seasons class then you get really disappointed with the FS Dublin.
That starts with the checking facility. I hate when check in staff tries to be cynically friendly and tries to give you lessons what you need or not. 
Same goes to the restaurant. Foodwise , well, is very average - but not the price. Here you are back at FS international standards. Just one restaurant opened during my stay which serves food only until 9.30 pm.....
Rooms are spacious but not really comfortable. Many of these little amenities usually at FS hotels are missing. In my case I forgot my shaving cream and shaver. This is not provided in the bathroom as it is the case in all other FS Hotels I know around the globe. When you ask why it is not provided they will mention budget reasons adding the FS Dublin is one of the cheapest hotels of the chain.... well, when it comes to service they are right",3,2013,11,24
205,Another beautiful Four Seasons Experience,"Our stay was wonderful.  The food delicious.  The cocktails (in Dublin, I know!) were fantastic. Our room was your typical beautiful Four Seasons room -- all just lovely.  The lobby flowers were like pieces of art.  The only downside was that if you wanted to get a ""feel"" for Dublin -- this wouldn't be the hotel. It's on the outskirts of the town center and there was nothing (even on the menu) that made it particularly feel Irish in character.",5,2013,11,22
205,Very good hotel but service and food were a bit disappointing,My wife and I were only staying at the hotel for one night while attending an international rugby match. We had dined in the casual lobby area in the past but not stayed there. The check in and reception was very good and the young man personal booked a table for dinner later in the lobby/library. The lunch in the lobby was fine with friends but the service at dinner and the food were disappointing. I had ordered a seafood starter and main which were luke warm and took a long time to appear. The waiters were very good but I felt that the dining area was a bit disorganised. The rooms are good and well prepared but complimentary bottled water would be appreciated. I think that guests should be made aware of all the dining options in the hotel on arrival. Sorry Four Seasons I won't be rushing back.,4,2013,11,21
205,Wonderful Stay in Dublin!,"We stayed here as part of a Groupon deal and we must say the stay was top notch. We upgraded to a suite and it was very nice, as we were here for a week. The room had everything you could ask for and more.,as you would expect from a luxury hotel. The concierge staff were so helpful with all of our questions and plans. The made us dinner and theatre reservations,helped us navigate the city with maps and, plan small trips out of Dublin on the bus and DART line. We only had 2 breakfasts in the hotel and they were fine, good food and lots of it on the buffet. The hotel is not right in the middle of Dublin but a 35 minute walk or a very quick trip on the DART line, an oasis for us! I cannot recommend it enough!",5,2013,11,19
205,Very disappointed from a hotel that should have delivered more,"We were so disappointed with our stay at this hotel. The foyer and atmosphere as you enter is brilliant as was the gentleman that checked us in. Unfortunately our stay went downhill from here. We were in Dublin for a rugby game so decided to check in and have a light dinner before the match. I had a soup and spring rolls and my wife had a burger. The food was only lukewarm when it arrived and within a few minutes the fries and onion rings had gone completely cold! We were upgraded to a deluxe suite on check in. This room was huge but felt completely empty as there was so much space around all the furnishings. It unfortunately didn't have the level of luxury that I would have expected from such a fine hotel. The furnishings were all a bit dated too. The real let down was definitely the concierge service. We asked if they could book us dinner in an Italian restaurant as the hotel restaurant was booked up. They rang one place and it was full, so the concierge asked the other concierge what he thought about a different restaurant to which he replied, 'it's alright'. Not exactly getting me excited about eating at the other restaurant option. He then turned to us and told us that we would be better off just walking around town to see if anything was free. Not exactly 5 star service!!",3,2013,11,18
205,Fabulous hotel,"My husband and I recently stayed at the Four seasons and it was wonderfully relaxing. The guest rooms are beautifully appointed, spacious and bright. There  is a centre light in the bedroom which gives great light and something that is missing from most hotels. The bathroom is spacious with separate bath and shower. The staff are very attentive and professional. The hotel is centrally located and convenient to access most of he the city attractions.",5,2013,11,17
205,Great hotel but shower head too low!,Stayed here with my fiancé for a weekend getaway treat. It is a really nice hotel and has a great sense of luxury. The room was lovely and bed very comfy but all a little dated. The bathroom was a great big size but we were really disappointed that the shower head was super low and not adjustable. Breakfast was awesome - lots of variety and very good service. The location is out of town but in a quiet leafy area and a couple of minutes walk from good bars and restaurants. Would recommend the Four Seasons and hopefully a refurb is on the way!,5,2013,11,17
205,Nearly flawless,"This is a beautiful hotel that defines luxury. The reception staff made us feel welcome. Our room was luxe, immaculate and nicely arranged. The artwork throughout the property would not have looked out of place in a gallery or museum. Every little thing was just so. I only wish it wasn't so large. I missed the ""personal touch"" that made our stays at smaller properties so memorable.",5,2013,11,16
205,the. best. hotel. ever.,"we did not want to leave. the suite was spacious and lovely. But what really makes this hotel is the staff. In the ""land of 10,000 welcomes"" this place excels in welcoming guests and going way out of their way to make sure everything is perfect. The restaurants are great too. Hint-  try the lobster mashed potatoes!",5,2013,11,16
205,Irish Dream Fullfilled,"Lovely hotel. The staff were exceptional, they could not do enough for you. Particularly Graeme on the Concierge's desk and Rory  on the front desk.

When we return to Ireland we definitely will be returning to the Four Season's Hotel.",5,2013,11,14
205,"Luxury, elegance & great service",Stayed at Four Seasons during short business trip to Dublin. The hotel delivered on promise of luxury and top quality service. Consistenly a great experience and definately one of the best top-end hotels in Dublin,5,2013,11,12
205,Excellent value for 4 star luxury,"I stayed at the Four Seasons whilst on a business trip to Dublin and also attended a conference being held at the hotel. The Four Seasons is great value for money for a 4 star luxury hotel in a popular location.

The hotel has a grand feel whilst being modern. We were greeted on arrival and our bags taken to put into our rooms, check-in was quick and a room was available despite an early arrival. 

My room was large and spacious including a (very) large screen TV - the bathroom was luxurious with a deep bathtub (shame I didn't have time to use it) and separate shower. There were no tea/coffee facilities however they were available via room service. The only downside of the room was the view of the back car park / bins which was a bit untidy and didn't really suit the ambiance of the rest of the hotel.

Had several meals at the hotel and I thought the food was excellent quality, although a bit pricey. I enjoyed an excellent breakfast which if you can get the buffet option included as an add on to your room rate it's definitely worth taking.

The hotel is slightly out of the centre of Dublin, I think a taxi was about 15 Euros.

Overall a great stay and good value for money.",4,2013,11,11
205,Great Hotel and Wonderful Staff,We stayed for 2 nights and had a wonderful room. The food was excellent and the staff was very helpful. The suite was very nice and clean. The staff is very friendly and very welcoming. I loved the food so much. The place is very accessible and is a very good place to stay. I will surely stay here again when I go back to Ireland.,5,2013,11,11
205,Stunning property,"We stayed at the Four Seasons in Dublin for 3 nights in a Lansdowne Suite. The room was gorgeous and very spacious, the bed was super comfortable. I loved all of the windows and the light that came into the room. The bathroom was great also, deep tub and separate shower.  The pictures on the website represent the suite well. Perks of the room: mini bar (didn't really use), Nespresso machine, they charge for it. You can ask for a complimentary coffee/tea set-up to be brought to the room which we did. They had a free internet plan but it was pretty basic and you could only connect one computer/device. It was sufficient for our needs. We did not eat in the hotel but used the Ice bar and the bar at the front of the hotel. Both were nice, good selection of beer, wine, and cocktails. Only downside, it is a little pricey.
Location: not near downtown but it was kind of nice to be away from the hustle and bustle and have a nice relaxing place to return to. It was about a 13 euro taxi ride to the downtown area. There is probably public transportation which is cheaper but we did not attempt to use it. There is an area about a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel which has 3-4 restaurants and a couple of pubs. We chose to take a taxi to this area which cost about 5 euros. We went to Kites (Chinese) and the Crowes Pub in this area and enjoyed both. Two other restaurants nearby, Roly's and The Lobster Pot which we didn't try.
Overall we had a great stay, our room was awesome and the service was great.",5,2013,11,10
205,One of the best experiences,"I come to this hotel around once a year and every time I stay, I am always impressed. First of all, the hotel rooms are quite big and this time, FS upgraded me to a really nice suite. Especially the view from the hotel room in early morning was stunning and definitely enjoyed the view. The hotel seems to be a bit old so don't really expect modern type of interior, but it still has the typical FS taste and you can easily feel it from the ambience. Staff is extremely friendly and are very eager to offer the guests help.",5,2013,11,07
205,"I never write reviews, but...","Micheal O'Shea is one of the best bartenders I have ever had the pleasure of being served drinks by. He knows his whiskeys, he'll remember your name, and he'll make you a damn good drink. Marie Claire at the Concierge desk is also lovely and very helpful. The rooms at this hotel are a little dated, just by general Four Seasons standards, but they make up for it with great service. Highly recommended.",4,2013,11,06
205,TOP CLASS SERVICE IN THIS HOTEL - EVEN BETTER THAN BEFORE,"Great experience from a hotel that is getting better and better in terms of customer service.
From the moment you walk in the front door , you feel the staff there are superior and actually appreciate your custom",5,2013,11,05
205,Great Hotel in Dublin. My personal favorite,Stayed here for 6 nights. The rooms were very comfortable and had a great stay. Centrally located. The view from my window was excellent showcasing the beautiful autumn colours in their full splendour. The service was unobtrusive yet impeccable. A good place to stay,5,2013,11,04
205,Amazing hotel with fabulous service,"We have just returned from a 2 night stay at the Four Seasons hotel Dublin. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, the staff made us feel so welcome and looked after our every need. Our room was clean and very comfortable. We ate in the restaurant on the first evening. The food was very good, the service was friendly and attentive and the ambience relaxing and comfortable. 
The only slight down side to this hotel is the location. A taxi into the city centre costs 10 euro , but this would not put me off staying there again as everything else was so perfect. 
Thank you to all the hard working staff for making our stay amazing ",5,2013,11,03
205,Excellent stay,"Very confortable room, excellent breakfast, but queue for check out
good value for price, and nice place just few mn from city center (by taxi)
thanks for the running map, first time I get one in an hotel,",4,2013,11,03
205,"Great hotel, bad service.","I spent three nights here in early October.  

The hotel is a bit isolated, but if you don't mind a bit of a walk there are some decent restaurants in the area.  A twenty minute hike to a good golf course.

The problem came after I left.  They made a number of billing errors, and it took a number of hours of work to get them to correct them.  Emails were ignored, and required follow-up contact.  They required that I fill out and fax in a bizarre identification form before they would even start to solve these issues.

So, I won't go back or recommend the hotel.  As nice as it is, they have serious problems on the administration side and I don't enjoy wasting a lot of post-travel time helping them work through these issues.",1,2013,11,02
205,wonderful hotel stay,"Wonderful hotel stay ,great welcome free upgraded room. we arrived with our 12 year old daughter un planned ,complimentary welcome cookies sweets and drink for our daughter set out in the room a really nice touch A late check out was provided free of charge as  I wanted to have a shower after completing the Dublin marathon.  Great service and excellent food and value in the bar/restaurant .cannot recommend this enough. make sure you eat here.,it's great.",5,2013,10,31
205,Where are the 5 stars,"Arrival : u don't get your room but a better one => finally, no king bed but a twin queen bedroom ... 
Then u order on the night menu : oh well we just have a sandwich, no burger, nothing on the menu except sandwich & ice cream.
The mini bar is not filled everyday so if u are hungry when u go back to the hotel during the night, the mini bar is empty & the night menu is not available... 
Well u know what ! i did many hotel over the world ! it's the first time i do a five star hotel with such a poor service ! Doesn't worth to expense money on Dublin Four Season then !!!! i m so disappointed !!!!!!!!!!!!! Finally 3 stars would be enough ! if i compare to many hotel i did over the world !",2,2013,10,30
205,A superb Christmas dinner,"As a number of the family were away last Christmas , my wife , daughter and myself decided to treat ourselves to Christmas dinner . It was so good , we are repeating the experience again this Christmas . Exceptional customer service and excellent food  were the hallmark of the day. Already looking forward to Christmas 2013.",5,2013,10,30
205,Lovely with great service,"I was recently in Dublin for a conference and this was one of the hotels recommended by the conference organisers. The hotel is elegant and classy. The staff is very polite and efficient. When I checked in I asked if it was possible to have a room with balcony and the lovely lady at reception went out of her way to find me one, despite the fact that they were almost sold out. I am a vegetarian with a number of food allergies, and room service was happy to prepare something suitable for dinner even if it wasn't on their menu. Rooms are clean, spacious and comfortable. If I were to return to Dublin, this is where I would like to stay again. Highly recommended.",4,2013,10,30
205,"Great room, great level of service.","I am not driven to write reviews very often but I'll make an exception here.  My stay in Dublin was made all the more brilliant by the fantastic service, warm welcome and high quality of room I experienced at the Four Seasons.  I will be back, worth every penny.",5,2013,10,28
205,Enjoyed our stay,"I stayed in the Four Seasons last night,we really enjoyed our stay and we found the well trained staff very courteous and considerate.The bedroom was spacious with air-conditioning.The bathroom was fresh and spacious.It  had a marvelous view across South Dublin.Our only gripe was the price of the breakfast,we would advise any traveler to pre-book breakfast and then they will have no surprises",4,2013,10,27
205,Four Seasons Dublin,"We enjoyed out stay at the Four Seasons Dublin.  The hotel is very nice and the rooms as well. The staff/concierge was courteous and helpful.  We had a few cocktails in the bar which was nice (not to mention the young gentleman bartender was very helpful in telling us how to get around town), but we did not eat in the hotel restaurant.  We stayed as part of a vacation package and have no complaints, but this is not somewhere I would normally stay...  a little too high end for me.  If you are willing to pay the price, I would definitely recommend this hotel. Unfortunately I did not have a chance to try out the spa.  Only possible negative is that it is outside of the city center if you want to be in the heart of Dublin... but there is a bus stop a block or 2 down the street that takes you right to town, or there is also a car service at the hotel that can take you within a couple mile radius of the hotel to the edge of the city where you can walk from there.  Also if you are interested in taking the Hop On/ Hop Off bus, there is a shuttle that comes by the hotel in the AM (I think it was 9:30AM) and drops you off at the nearest stop on the route which was very convenient.  It took about 30min to get to the stop because the shuttle picks-up at 5-6 hotels along the way (so if you are in a rush this may not be for you).",4,2013,10,24
205,Irish service was superb in Dublin!,"We loved our stay in Dublin at the 4 Seasons. Our flight arrived very late and our bags were lost when we arrived after a long flight from America. The staff not only opened the kitchen but made us an unbelievable feast!  The staff at this hotel is the best! 
Our room very spacious and well equipped. 
The only disadvantage to this stay for me was the location of the hotel being outside the downtown shopping area.
I have stayed at another hotel in Dublin in the past and although I enjoy the traditional style of an older hotel I much prefer a newer fresher style room for sleeping.
The 4 Seasons never disappoints us!",5,2013,10,24
205,business trip,"I enjoyed my  stay in Four Seasons - top quality international brand. Highly recommend it  for 
business travellers. Located in a beutiful and safe area. Staff is always there to help you out.
Close to Dart station- easy and fast excess to the city centre. There is also taxi ( about 10-15 euro) or bus servise. Very good daily service of the rooms, rich breakfast in a lovely restaurant.",5,2013,10,24
205,Weekend in Dublin,"Stayed there for a wedding (not at the hotel) and the staff were really great, they accommodated me and my family, fifteen people in total(most of whom were not staying at the hotel) to breakfast at extremely short notice and despite the fact that a lot of them turned up after breakfast had officially closed, they continued to serve, take orders and at no point make us feel like we were holding them up.   Hotel was beautiful, my room was beautiful and their black out curtains in the rooms are great - nearly blinded myself opening the curtains on the Sunday morning as the contrast was extreme.  Loved the hotel and would happily stay there again.  Next time hopefully I'll have time to use the spa.",5,2013,10,23
205,"Very nice, but a bit out of the action","Very nice hotel, a bit posh for my taste - but couldn't fault it. The room was large with high ceilings and wonderful large windows that fully opened. I love fresh air in a hotel room, and this was perfect. Lovely big bathroom with separate showere and deep soaking tub (love that!). Only complaint was no coffee maker in the room (I suppose I could've requested one).

The location is fine if you have business out that way or are attending something at RDS, but it's a bit removed from the center of Dublin and all the action there.

I got a very good deal, stay 2 nights and the 3rd night was free......this contributed to my happiness with the property.",4,2013,10,23
205,Fantastic property,"Three nights in this lovely hotel was amazing. The staff and concierge were very helpful. The location, while a bit out of the main city, was just right for us. Our final night in Dublin on a return visit we moved to a five start hotel in St Stephens Square and the noise and crowded conditions were far less appealing. We dined in the city center every night then enjoyed a lovely walk back to the hotel on beautiful streets in an elegant neighborhood. Our room was very large by European standards, the health club excellent and the dining in hotel options very approachable. Give it a try!",5,2013,10,23
205,Excellent service,"Stayed at Four Seasons for two nights and everything was excellent: the service, the room, the breakfast, the facilities and caring staff. I liked the location as well - it looked like a very nice area to live in, short taxi or even bus ride to the city centre. Would like to come again.",5,2013,10,20
205,"Like most FS city hotels, a bit disappointing","Quick recap - It has all the Four Seasons trappings - large luxurious rooms, wonderful bathrooms and impeccable staff. If only every person in the worldwide service industry was trained by the Four Seasons, no one could ever complain about service. The negative is that it's far outside town and they didn't bother to give all rooms beautiful views.

Pros -
Superb breakfast buffet
Signature Four Seasons bed, bedding, extra large room and bathroom
Flawless service

Cons -
Some room types look out over large rubbish bins
The showers don't have rainshower heads but small little (20 year old) massage jets

Full review
I'd stayed years earlier in Dublin at an LHW hotel directly in the center, but since this was winter and I was only staying two nights, I thought I'd give this FS a try. I regret that I did.

My stay at this hotel was what I've come to expect from Four Seasons city hotels like the one in Prague, Lisbon and Buenos Aires amongst others. The interiors and service are outstanding, but the views are horrible. The Prague hotel has an excuse, it was built right in the center of the town so only a handful of their top rooms have views of the river, but there seems to be no excuse for the Dublin property. It's so far out of town, they could have picked almost any location to allow all guests, in all room categories, to have wonderful views. Instead, the lowest category room which I booked, had a view of a backyard parking lot full of large scale rubbish bins.

You could never say enough good things about the service which is almost unequaled in the hotel industry and never ceases to amaze. My always favorite at FS hotels is how the housekeeping staff is trained to learn your name!

You also could not saying anything negative about the very large rooms, luxury furnishings and all the things you come to expect from every Four Seasons experience. I just wish they'd have put more thought into the surrounding area.",4,2013,10,19
205,Amazing service and care to detail,"The hotel was lovely, the staff assisted us with any request we had and best of all we were happily surprised when we returned to our room to find a birthday cake.  When i made the reservation i was asked if we were celebrating a special occasion, I told the reservationst we were celebrating a birthday and they sent us cake.  It is those small details that make a difference between a good hotel and a great hotel.",5,2013,10,19
205,Classy,"Great City Hotel in a nice neighborhood away from the city center.
Reminded me a bit of the Denver Four Seasons less 15 floors!
Rooms are what you would expect from a Four Seasons, very nice.
Staff was excellent, especially the breakfast wait staff and female manager.
We loved the quality and choices of the breakfast menu.
The walk into town Is a bit far, especially since we started at the Guiness Brewing company.
First things first, right?! But we learned our lesson and took taxies for the rest of our stay. All the cabbies were very friendly and efficient. Never did use the in-house shuttle service, it was always in use by other guests.",4,2013,10,17
205,Not where you expect a Four Seasons to be....,"My first visit to Dublin and I am not sure if I will return.  The hotel was a little difficult to find using the satnav, it was not close to the city centre which was very disappointing, walking took us 40 mins to walk home from there which is ok if the weather is nice.  Surrounding areas not so nice, too business like.  The room was nice, as expected, no surprises...the Nespresso machine was a nice touch and I was able to obtain a kettle with nice crockery for my tea but the housekeeping did not for some reason on all 3 of my mornings, would not replenish my shampoo.  I tried to book a spa treatment only to be told they were totally full.  The service in the hotel overall was quite disappointing, we felt neglected at the restaurant and bars.  Food overall was alright, nothing to write home about.",3,2013,10,16
205,Elegant but comfortable,"This hotel is primarily for business travelers, with meeting space for large gatherings. Yet, for a tourist it offers a friendly stay, very large and well equipped rooms, and a wonderful breakfast - either buffet or a la carte. The staff are uniformly friendly and accommodating, making the hotel seem as warm and comfortable as a family run B & B.",5,2013,10,16
205,Perfect Dublin Stay,"We were booked for a 3 night stay using AMEX platinum Fine Hotels program. This is our third stay at a Four Seasons property and our first stay at the Dublin location

The hotel is an elegant property located approximately 25 minutes (walk) from city center and approximately 10 minutes walk from the DART.  We especially enjoyed the sculptures outside the hotel and the lovely garden adjacent to the conservatory where we enjoyed a perfect breakfast and afternoon coffee. 

At check-in, we were offered an upgrade to a suite for an additional fee. I was a bit surprised as our AMEX ""package"" includes a room upgrade if available. Upgrade wasn't given. Oh well. Our room was large,comfortable and elegant. The bathroom was enormous by European standards with a lovely soaking tub. 

The staff was outstanding. From the Concierge to the Breakfast Manager, all were delighted to help us with ideas of where to visit, what to do and where to dine.

Food at the hotel was delicious. Breakfasts were very generous with almost too much to choose from. We ate breakfast and an afternoon snack or enjoyed a nightcap each night. Most days we skipped lunch due to our filling breakfast.

The spa was lovely. I enjoyed a very relaxing facial and visit to the steam room.It is also very helpful to have a hair salon on the facility which I used and found reasonably priced.

There is free wifi downstairs.

While we would have preferred to stay in city centre, we were delighted by the area. The US Embassy is just down the road.  

Highly recommend this property.",5,2013,10,16
205,Top Top Class Hotel,"We have never visited a Four Seasons hotel before and I can honestly say it will definately not be our last visit.  I don't think we have ever been to a hotel that we have had obsolutely nothing to moan about.  Right from the start - the reservations staff were fantastic.  We had two labrador dogs with us, and trying to find a hotel that would take them was impossible - until I spoke to the Four Seasons !!!.  They were fantastic - the dogs had treats, beds and bowls - and unlike some places we weren't downgraded to a 'scrotty' room just because we had dogs.  My husband and his friend were travelling on their motorbikes, and the hotel kindly let them park in the underground carpark.  We spent a fantastic night eating through the snacks on the bar menu and drinking our way through the cocktail menu - not cheap, but the service and quality of the food/drink was second to none.  Breakfast in the morning was again fantastic - food was exceptionally hot and fresh - I think I had the best scrambled egg ever !!.  On checking out it really did feel like we were leaving old friends, the staff were amazing.  I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough - and our trips around the world will start by looking at the Four Season chain hotels :-)",5,2013,10,15
205,It was a great hotel and a wonderful staff,"My business partner and I arrived at the Dublin airport and were greeted by a limo driver who rushed us to the Four Seasons Dublin at 9:00 am. We were greeted by a friendly receptionist who found rooms for us and checked us in immediately so we were able to nap after a long overseas flight.

The rooms were large, comfortable and appointed nicely. The bathrooms were beautiful with a large tub and a great shower. The room was as nice as any hotel I've stayed in across the UK or Europe.

We spent each night in Dublin eating a great restaurants and finishing the night in the hotel's bar. The atmosphere was great and we met and chatted with many people from all parts of the world in that bar. The breakfast was hot and fresh with a large variety to choose from with excellent service. The breakfast room is bright and cheerful as well.

All-in-all I'd have to report that the physical plant seemed to be in fine working order, the rooms and common areas were very clean, the spa and fitness center were well-staffed and spotless.

The only minor point of concern (and it was truly minor) was the vehicle used for the limo ride from the airport. The price was pretty high for a fairly short ride (which was okay because it saved us from having to deal with a cab after a long flight) and the vehicle could not handle two mid-sized suitcases and 2 golf travel bags. We rode from the airport to the hotel with a golf travel bag across our laps. This was not a huge matter but for the upcharge I paid for this service it seems the hotel could use a vehicle that could accommodate luggage to include golf bags in a place like Dublin. Still it had little effect on my endorsement of this great hotel.

The staff at the Four Seasons Dublin went out of their way to ensure our stay was excellent and they outperformed my expectations without overdoing it. It was service with a smile without interference. My hat is off to this group of professionals. They seem to have it figured out.",5,2013,10,14
205,Top class sunday brunch,"It has been a while since i have had Sunday brunch in the Seasons restaurant, and i was not disappointed, the service ,presentation and quality of the food are of the highest standard. the staff where as alway's very tentive and friendly. The only thing i missed was the Piano playing although there was some back ground music playing. it was also very good value for money, the kids are well looked after in every way. i can recommend it to anyone looking for a nice relaxing Sunday afternoon lunch.
Well done staff and thank you.",5,2013,10,13
205,Top draw,"We stayed in the Lansdowne suite for four nights .
The four seasons are an excellent chain .the hotel is large  and elegant .the breakfast room was beautiful .the breakfast themselves were also excellent.
Service all round was perfect.
The suite was huge and very nicely furnished.
We used the spa .the girls were well trained and the massage was blissful",5,2013,10,10
205,A bit let down,"I can't help but be a little disappointed with my stay here. Everything was perfectly pleasant, the checkin was quick and efficient, the staff were polite and friendly and in the restaurant the waiters and service was near faultless. Breakfast in the morning was lovely, a large selection of both Irish and continental breakfast and plenty of fresh coffee and juice.
My disappointment stems from the rooms, while undoubtedly large and comfortable, the Junior suites are very dated and in desperate need of freshening up. The shower and tiny bath were not to standard of a 5 star hotel and certainly not for a suite. Also the amount of noise you could hear from the corridor and other rooms was wholly unexpected and quite annoying, particularly when a baby is crying at 6:30am in the adjoining room. Maybe my expectations were too high or perhaps I'm being too picky but at €400 a night you should be picky and expectations should be high. 
Anyway, outside of the rooms I really like this hotel. It's superbly located and a very pleasant place to while away the afternoon or evening.",3,2013,10,06
205,OK Stay,"adequate stay. Rooms are quite basic for a five star, however to balence this the service is very good. Overall I believe more attention to detail would certainly improve my stay.The little touches are all important.",3,2013,10,02
205,Four seasons for all seasons,"Warm welcome,very helpful staff and a real feeling of relaxation.The breakfast kept us going all day,so much to choose from and delightful friendly staff who served us.I love the décor of the rooms.They are very spacious with 5 star facilities,very comfortable bed,big bathroom,with a bath.....so many hotel rooms offer a mere shower,but,i do love to relax in a bath on a weekend away,and this bath was divine.The four seasons never disappoints and I would highly recommend it to anyone staying in Dublin wanting a 5 star experience.",5,2013,09,30
205,Second to none,"We stayed 3 nights in the Four Seasons for our sons  wedding at the end of August. Several family members were staying in the hotel from around the world. We enjoyed every moment there being treated with such a perfect balance of friendliness, courtesy and professionalism. Nothing was too much trouble. If you asked where something was, you weren't just told, you were brought there. Everything was about the comfort and enjoyment of the guest and we were made feel valued. Every member of staff was as excellent as each other. My one regret though is that I did not get the name of a particular member of staff who waited at the wedding reception. She was so friendly, witty, helpful and a joy to engage with that we have all been commenting on her.I think she told my sister it was her second day there. Keep that little girl! I can't wait to go back and keep up the excellent work.",5,2013,09,30
205,"Excellent service, facilities and staff.","We had five clients stay at the hotel at the end of September, it was their first time travelling to Europe. Our clients were very impressed with the hotel , most of all the professional staff, from check in to bar staff to breakfast and checkout. We will return to use this hotel again and would recommend to clients and friends.",5,2013,09,30
205,Friendly staff  & Comfortable Rooms,"Just spent 3 nights staying in the Four Seasons and it didn't disappoint. The welcome you receive from the moment you arrive, to the time of checkout is superb. 

Whilst I live in Dublin my parents and brother were travelling to celebrate my mother's 80th birthday (we previously stayed here to celebrate my father's 80th birthday and enjoyed it so much that we came back). On arrival in her room my mother found a Happy Birthday plate with some strawberries and a cake waiting for her which went down very well.

The hotel is situated in the leafy suburbs of Dublin 4 and is a short bus or car journey from city centre and the main tourist attractions. There is a complimentary courtesy car available which can bring you into the centre or there is a bus stop just around the corner.

The rooms are spacious, comfortable and well appointed with all the usual facilities one would expect in a 5 star hotel. A great night's sleep is guaranteed on a very comfortable bed. Whilst I would agree with previous reviewers that the decor might be somewhat dated, that should not detract from the fact that the rooms are worth every penny. 

Breakfast is delicious particularly the full Irish but there is a good selection to suit everyone's taste. 

Lunch and dinner were both nice however the only criticism I would make here is that it is the same menu for lunch and dinner. Whilst the food is great it won't take you long to work through the menu if you are staying for a few days and eat in. Having said that, there are alternative options nearby.

We had a truly marvellous time at the hotel. The hotel was busy but notwithstanding, the staff were always extremely friendly and courteous and couldn't do enough to make our stay wonderful. The whole place exuded elegance and charm and i would certainly recommend coming here. Although we did experience some issues during our stay these were dealt with courteously and professionally.

Whilst I would like to recognise everyone, I would particularly like to mention Tony and Laura on our checkin and checkout respectively along with Aida in the restaurant and last but not least, Alan the front of house manager. They are really a credit to this hotel.",5,2013,09,29
205,Picture-Perfect Reception at the Four Seasons,"My husband and I were married where we reside, which is in Lexington, Kentucky.  Since he was born in Dublin and most of his family lives there, his parents graciously hosted another reception for us at the Four Seasons, which coincided with the last few days of our honeymoon.  We had drinks and dinner in a beautiful room on the first floor. From the pre-dinner pints or glasses of wine to the amazing array of starters to the perfectly cooked entrees and decadent desserts, every detail was simply amazing.  The staff members were incredibly gracious and accommodating and the food was just spectacular.  I want to thank the hotel staff for providing such wonderful memories for my husband and I, along with all of our family members.  It was such a special evening!",5,2013,09,25
205,Wonderful hotel.,"Went up to see Fleetwood Mac's 2nd performance in the O2 Dublin and got a super rate to stay here. We always walked past it when we lived in Dublin many moons ago so our expectations we high when we eventually got to stay here. We were not disappointed and the sight of Mick Fleetwood chatting away to guests greatly improved our moods from a 3hr car journey. Room was a king size delux with an exit out onto the roofed pathway overlooking the entrance. Room was fine and spacious with a 52 inch TV. Bathroom fab and plenty of gels etc. Breakfast was to die for and staff were really attentive and helpful. Spa and swimming pool though small again left you wanting for nothing..bathrobes,slippers,shaving kits and aftershave all provided. Looking forward to going back. Drink pricey but it is a wonderful experience all in all.",5,2013,09,24
205,"Excellent location, excellent staff - definitely a top tier hotel!","Just returned from a trip to Ireland and we started our stay at the Four Seasons Hotel Dublin.  For me, people ""make the hotel"" and the staff here is excellent and very accommodating.  The reason for the trip was an awards trip for our top performing distributors - and all of our guests were pleased with the choice of this hotel.",5,2013,09,23
205,Top class and worthy of it's reputation.,"We arrived up at 15:30 as we were heading to see Fleetwood Mac that night in the O2. The first impression was of delight as Mick Fleetwood was chatting away with some guests as we strode in. Great start. The room was a King Size delux on the first floor with access to the outside walled area over looking the entrance. Ideal for smokers and nice also to catch the suns warm rays. The room itself was wonderful and spacious with a big LED TV 50' and fine bathroom also with everything you could want in toiletries. All the staff are friendly and the breakfast is fabulous with a huge selection to choose from. I went with an omelette that was prepared in front of me and it was delicious. The pool/spa area is worth a visit also. In the mens changing area there are complimentary shaving blades, shaving foam, deodorant, aftershave and gel. Steam room and sauna also inside there with bathrobes and slippers also. Free carpark and great location with lots of good pubs and restaurants near-by. Pint of cider costs €6.90 ahem!",5,2013,09,23
205,"Good, but expected more from the Four Seasons","We stayed here in September for a few days as part of a group and the good aspects of the hotel are a nice lobby, good lobby bar, cool lobby bar called the ""Ice Bar"", great Spa on the basement level and the service was on par with Four Seasons.  But once you go up to your room, you're likely to be disappointed.  The decor is very dated and non-inspiring.  Oh, and a suggestion if you do stay here...stroll down the street to the restaurant Rolly's...yum.  See the awards on the wall and taste for yourself.",3,2013,09,23
205,We wanted to move it...,"After traveling back and forth from EU to the states, we had a 23 hour layover in Dublin before returning to Palma.  If staying close to the airport is important to you then the 4S is not for you as it was over 60euro in fair by taxi.  However, if beautiful property, fabulous staff, delicious food and a beautiful room is what you are searching for, look no further! Book now, we never wanted to leave :-) Also a special thank you to Laura, at the front desk, for making our early arrival doable AND memorable. We are still raving about your graceful demeanor!! ",5,2013,09,21
205,Fantastic Hotel-Amazing Service.,"This is a fantastic hotel with amazing service. The hotel itself is beautiful, the rooms are outstanding. We stayed in a suite and a deluxe suite, loved them both. They have a great pub off the lobby were you can enjoy a Guinness. The Irish Breakfast was over-the-top great. Some people have commented about the location of the hotel, not to worry. We walked into the heart of Dublin from the hotel in less than 30 min. through some nice neighborhoods and along Embassy Row. If you want to step out of the hotel and take a 5 min. walk into the heart of Ballsbridge, there are plenty of pubs and places to eat. I would stay here again in a heart beat. The only downfall, don't depend upon the complimentary car service to town, it never seemed to be available even after waiting for 20 minutes. No big deal, taxi's are reasonable and the walk is nice. We had some other ""minor issues"" not worth mentioning, but what is worth mentioning is how the hotel staff and manager took care of those issues and treated us, they went above and beyond. Thank you for a great time at another fantastic Four Seasons Property.",5,2013,09,20
205,Four Seasons,"Reception, Staff and Hotel itself absolutely excellent.
Hotel a little out of the way, about 4km from centre of Dublin.
Building itself excellent and located in a very nice area.
Staff could not be more pleasant and more helpful",5,2013,09,20
205,"Beautiful property, wonderful staff","Our rooms were beautiful, the tub is so nice and deep and great for a long hot bath. The spa facilities were amazing! Not a far walk from downtown Dublin, maybe 3 miles. A few restaurants right around the corner too.  The lounge area, and restaurant were equally beautiful as well.  And the beds!! Oh so comfortable!!! I never wanted to get up in the morning!!",5,2013,09,20
205,Was expecting much better based on the reviews read here....,"We found the hotel to be old and not well maintained. They made us pay 100 euros for Internet services for 4 days and connection was not good. There was no iron in the room. The room was not available until 4pm. I not stayed at any other hotels in Dublin but I am sure one could do much better for the amount of money we payed.
On the positive side it is correct to say the hotel is in a decent location although still a long walk or 12 euros cab ride from Center of town.
Would not re-visit or recommend!!",2,2013,09,19
205,Very comfortable and beautiful hotel,"Really nice garden. Dinner at restaurant was excellent. Gym opening at 6 am if you like to work out before your day starts. Breakfast was good but I was expecting even a larger choice.
The room was nice and quite, I slept beautifully.",5,2013,09,19
205,Great Luxury Hotel In Dublin,"Just returned from a business meeting with a group of clients at this property.  This is our third visit over the past few years.  We found the service once again to be 5 star.  Staff is very attentive.  Property is in excellent condition.  All in all an excellent choice if you are looking for a premium property for a stay in Dublin.

The restaurant offering is above average.  We enjoyed several lunches and even our last dinner in the lobby bar/lounge area.  The menu is exceptional.  Had excellent chowder, Irish salmon, cheese board, etc.  Whiskey bar has over 100 whiskeys.  Signature drink is Touch Wood - invented by the bartender - excellent concoction that has won awards.

Meeting facilities are excellent.  Had breakfast and a business meeting several days for 30+ clients.  Service is very good.  Would definitely return with another group.

Jr Suites and deluxe suites are nice if you want a little extra room, though regular rooms are very adequate and are appointed well.",5,2013,09,18
205,"Everything you want is in this Four Seasons, makes for a great trip!","I love this hotel. Once I arrived, they had my business documents ready for me and everyone was very professional yet friendly. The location is awesome, as I ran into the sea on my morning run. When  got back to the hotel there was ice cold water, towels and tea bags waiting. The other residents are very friendly and interesting. I received a free upgraded room and the beds are soooo comfortable. I loved the huge bathroom and well equipped shower. I had breakfast one morning at the restaurant and it was delicious (egg white omelet, spinach and tomatoes. Really quick cab ride to city centre and a fun residential neighborhood to walk around. Loved it!",5,2013,09,17
205,"Fabulous place in Dublin, Ireland.","Staff excellent, room clean and comfortable. All our needs were met!!!  The view from our room was awesome and we were in walking distance to a lot of what was to see in Dublin!!! The bus, which goes everywhere was very close to the hotel!",5,2013,09,15
205,A weekend treat,"A group of friends and I chose to stay at the Four Seasons for a birthday weekend away and were not disappointed. The room clean, nice decor, not modern but tasteful.  The huge hotel itself a pleasure to explore.  We had lunch in the bar which was very pleasant...expensive but then I guess that's what you'd expect from a 5* location.  We didn't have breakfast included so took ourselves off into the city centre quite early to eat...a recommendation would have to be Bewley's Cafe in Grafton Street...really good food at reasonable price.
Afternoon tea at the Four Seasons was very nicely served and was on a par with others I have had at London hotels. 
My only slight disappointment with the hotel was the location...we hadn't quite realised just how far out of the city it would be...I guess about 10 minutes in a taxi or a 15 minute bus journey.",5,2013,09,15
205,Delicious brunch and fantastic service!,"We have just come back from the Four Seasons where we went to celebrate my husband's birthday with the in-laws on September 15th. The experience was great from beginning to end - despite the fact we had turned up half an hour earlier than our booking by mistake. This was not a problem for the well trained staff. To start we had a mixture of Caesar salads and chowder - all of which were delicious. The mains were chicken with chorizo, fillet steak and sirloin of beef. All beautifully cooked. The sirloin beef in particular was lovely and well above the traditional standard Sunday fare you receive elsewhere. The highlight was the desert buffet which was just fab and the birthday plate they gave my husband. The food was of the highest standard that I would expect from the Four Seasons. I think though what really stood out was the gorgeous staff whom we met right from the new guy at the front door to the excellent waiting staff in the restaurant. As well as the Dublin manager who chatted to us about the All-Ireland next weekend. It made us feel really comfortable and highlighted how this is not your standard hotel Sunday lunch. We look forward to many more visits to come!!",5,2013,09,15
205,EXCELLENT HOTEL!!,"Went on a four night 'girlie' trip to Dublin and chose this hotel due to its Trip Advisor ratings...from the room, to the food and the service everything was excellent.  Would recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to stay in Dublin.",5,2013,09,15
205,Still Superlative,"Wonderful, as usual. The 3 of us stayed for 2 nights in late August. This is really our 3rd time to stay with Four Seasons Dublin and service standards are as high as ever. Special mention must go to the door staff/concierge, but in particular the driver who chauffers the complimentary 7 series car service into the city centre - a real gentlemen who certainly provides 5 star service all the way. The same can be said of all the staff in the Four Seasons. Dare I say it, the sincere anticipatory service herre may even eckipse some other 5 star hotels - there is just something that little bit extra felt when staying here. 
It was our first time to stay since the redecoration of the lobby and lounges areas. We think the materials and furniture used are of the utmost quality and add a more modern feel to the area - did it really need this....I'm not sure- I loved the previous traditional decor and there certainly were more soft sofas and seats in the Lobby Lounge area. I would actually suggest there should be a few more low soft sofas in the lounge area to enjoy a leisurely coffee. But it's minor nonetheless. 
Everywhere still has an air of 'newness' about it, as it should do. Everywhere is beautifully decorated and the deluxe room we stayed in was light, airy, and spotless. Beds were really comfortable and bathroom amazing as usual. The corridors to the rooms are particularly lovely. 
Breakfast is a real delight. Silver pots and cutlery, cooked to order food and a wonderful buffet, executed with precision and quality. 

The next few things I would like to say are some suggestions I would put to the management. They didn't really detract from our stay but I feel I want to give my feedback to help in any way I can.
1. Firstly, I was rather disappointed to learn that the Seasons Restaurant which was traditionally the more fine dining area of the hotel, now only serves breakfast! It's a massive and attractive area and it seems odd that in a hotel like this, the only place you can get a nice meal in the evening id the lobby lounge/sitting room area. Plus, the menu that is served in this area in the evening is very nice for a lobby area, yes, but in my opinion does not really befit the title of a 'fine dining meal' at the Four Seasons. But then, Seasons Restaurant provided that service until now..I just think it detracts from the choice in the Four Seasons. 

2. Secondly, while the swimming pool and the spa area is serviced by the most conscientious and courteous staff I think I've ever come across, the pool and particularly the jacuzzi pool, is in need of a bit of maintenance. The grout between the tiles has become very yellow and some of it is peeling off and again, detracted from the experience there. It made it look a bit dirty, while I'm sure it wasn't. The thing is, the spa has one of the most beautiful, well looked after and serviced changing rooms in the business- so many amenities to avail of. As I said, a special mention has to go to the pool/changing room serivice staff who were so good at their job and always saw things to do, like folding towels and replenishing new ones. It may sound like a very small thing, but it is these things that make the difference!!! And they are certainly the things I remember. But in general, I think the facilities need a bit of updating to keep them up to par with other 5 star spas, they are perhaps getting a little tired cosmetically in places. But the staff surely do their best to keep them in the best possible condition. In fact, the spa I would sort of say is due a complete overhaul/ refurbishment to keep it in line with other 5 star spas at the moment. 

Again, the above are only just comments/thoughts/suggestions, and I would emphasise that our experience there was wonderful, and would not deter us from returning. The staff really create the experience and we cannot wait until the next stay, maybe in the new year!

Thanks again Four Seasons Dublin!",5,2013,09,12
205,Not a typical review!,"My wife and I recently married and had the celebration at the Four Seasons. Having stayed there 4 nights and planning our wedding we got to know many of the staff well and managed to use each restaurant, cafe and spa.

The food and beverage was excellent as was the service delivery. The property has had a recent renovation, so the lobby areas are looking refreshed. The spa is a little small, but the therapist was excellent and in all honesty Dublin isn't the place for a destination spa.

The property location for people visiting Dublin is in a neighbourhood called Ballsbridge (Dublin's equivalent of the upper west side or Mayfair). It is a 4 minute car ride to the city centre (about a 25 minute walk).

I know the Dublin hotels well, and for me the Four Seasons is the only hotel that delivers on service, building standard, location and accountability. 

I look forward to visiting Dublin again with the familiar and friendly home from home that is the Four Seasons Dublin.",5,2013,09,12
205,"Lovely hotel, as you would expect from the Four Seasons","The service in this hotel is impeccable, and the surroundings are beautiful.  The rooms are spacious, comfortable, and have all of the appliances/amenities/power outlets you would need.  Housekeeping tends to arrive at inopportune times, but they are very accommodating if you ask them to return at a later time.

I highly recommend sitting in the lobby/bar area for a drink and a snack in the afternoon.  The sun pouring through the glass ceiling makes you feel like you are living in a terrarium, which is comforting.  

While I have nothing negative to report on the hotel, I would warn guests that it is further outside of the city center than you may like.  Yes, the city is perfectly accessible from this location, but it's not the same as tumbling out the front door and having the city at your feet.

If you like first-class hotels, this one wins!",4,2013,09,11
205,Can't go wrong,"My family and I spent 3 nights at the Four Seasons Dublin and had an excellent experience (similar to our first stay there back in 2006).   We arrived after an overnight flight around 11:30 and were able to get into our room within 15 minutes of arrival.  Rooms and facilities are first class.  Concierge was very helpful.  While the location is a 10 minute cab ride (or accessible via a short walk to DART train) from the heart of Dublin, the surrounding area is very nice and quieter than downtown. You can't go wrong staying here.",5,2013,09,10
205,Perfect Hotel,"The best luxury hotel in Ireland is the Four Seasons Hotel in Ballsbridge - just 5 minutes south of Dublin city center.  Just a great location.  Rooms are extra large and quiet.  Large spa and exercise facilities.  We had 4 days of great room service breakfast at 5 am in order to catch our tours by 6 am.  The staff is professional, helpful and knowledgeable.  The area around the hotel is filled with concert halls, other great restaurants (Rolys was the best just 2 block walk).  Easy access from Dublin Airport coming and going.   Hotel Bar was a fun spot each evening after our day trips.  Each night we ran into many other people who camp out or visit to unwind (Bono sat next to us on one night to name just one).  The Four Seasons Dublin is not only worthy of carrying the FS Brand moniker but more importantly an ideal location to access the fine art centers and to just walk around the neighborhoods late at night or early morning.
The best hotel in the Dublin area.  Book it.",5,2013,09,10
205,Super,Enjoyed our stay here at Four Seasons Hotel. Warm friendly staff. Breakfast is lovely with plenty of options to choose from. Room have ample space. Plenty of public transport and the city is easily accessible.  Would return here over and over again.,5,2013,09,09
205,an oasis of calm,"great hotel, oasis of calm
great service
as a regular it is lovely to be welcomed back personally by the staff
we found that the updated public areas were an improvement.
we were able to get served at the bar by a very proficient barman - who seemed able to deal with numerous orders simultaneously",5,2013,09,09
205,Fantastic Yet Again,"Our stay earlier this year in February was for leisure and more to the point we get to visit our favourite hotel. We arrived  at the hotel via an independently booked airport transfer via Crowne Chauffeur's who I can also highly recommend for their prompt and warm service. We were checked in by one of the highly trained and welcoming receptionist's who informed us of our special benefits received through booking with Grand Luxury Hotels. Although our room was not ready at 10 am, we decided to have breakfast in the Lobby Lounge which was delicious and around 30 euro for two. 

When it was time to check-in we were allocated a Premium room, which was very spacious although could do with some moderate refurbishment. This should include new carpets and curtains as both of these are now very dated. I do however appreciate that new bedside tables have been added and Samsung LED Tv's. 

All bathroom's at the FS Dublin are of the same high standard and I also enjoy the twice daily housekeeping service, were toiletries and towels are restocked at night. 

We ordered room service one night which delivered promptly and of excellent quality. My order was exactly what I had asked for, and more importantly was hot. I also recommend the fresh strawberry milkshakes which are delicious. I also had one of these delivered to the Spa on a sunny afternoon which was delivered on a silver tray, and I was able to order from the Spa reception desk. 

As always the Spa facilities are top-notch, a locker key is always available to get even if a staff member is not behind the desk. The lockers are always stocked with a bathrobe, towel, hanger and laundry bag. Which the Ritz Carlton Powerscourt should learn a lesson from.

Any request's we had from staff members were always dealt with a smile, and each and every staff member are excellent. The door staff are always their to welcome you when going in and out, and very helpful when asking for Taxis. I would like to use the complementary car service, but in the past two years it has always been unavailable. I would also be prepared to pay extra for a premium car service. 

A minor issue with our stay is that when booking through a FS Preferred Partner we received 2x complementary breakfasts each morning of our stay. However on check-out we were informed that this was not supposed to be included on the last morning of our stay due to booking a 3 for 2 night deal offered by the hotel. In the past we have never had a problem having used the same booking website and the same 3 for 2 night deal. Although the 60 Euro charge was removed, we were not happy that this was not made clear to us upon check-in. 

I look forward to my next return visit to the Four Seasons Dublin, which is likely to be next year and hope that some minor improvements to the rooms are added.",5,2013,09,07
205,Lovely Room,"We recently stayed 3 nights and while the room and the bathroom were lovely, I didn't really like the feel of the place. The location is not great as we had to catch a bus or train to get into town and the bus service was a bit patchy. We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel as it was pricy as was the wi-fi. Luckily my husband had purchased a SIM card so we could both use devices. The toiletries were lovely but there were no complimentary bottles of water.",3,2013,09,07
205,It missed a certain something,I travel lots with work so have certain expectations of hotels. They struggled with a lone business traveller tending to push me into corners at breakfast and dinner. The food is over priced for what it really is. However the rooms and decor are fantastic. ,4,2013,09,05
205,just book it !!,"the quiet rooms.. the matress is superb for a deep sleep ...the hearty concierge staff greet one so warmly  ... its special how they do it all ... the foyer is so friendly and chatty .. nice music ... the food is heavenly     the spa and pool is a haven of peace ... no strong chemical in water , so no skin rash ...    the best    !!",5,2013,09,05
205,Service that is second to none,"Four Seasons, Dublin is simply the best hotel in which to stay in Dublin.  Staff members will ensure that you are well looked after and your needs are met during your stay in a professional, warm and efficient manner.  Our suite was beautifully appointed, allowing my husband and I to relax and unwind in luxurious comfort.  Both the Lobby Lounge and in-room dining provided us with delicious food during our stay. We stay here time and again because of the consistent good service. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2013,09,04
205,Comfortable with some glitches,"We stayed with our children ages 13, 11 and 8 in two adjoining rooms for three nights.  I chose this hotel because of the reviews that said the beds were comfortable, and we were not disappointed.  Definitely the most comfortable beds of our two-week vacation in Ireland, and we were jetlagged and tired so we spent a lot of time in them!  The rooms were quite spacious and we had ample room even with all of our large luggage.

We did not find the Ballsbridge location to be a problem at all--the DART is two blocks away and it is just a few stops to near the centre.  The only problem we encountered with the location is that there are not many eating and drinking options nearby, so we did feel held hostage by the hotel and the steep prices for breakfast (i.e. 28 euros for the hot buffet, which consisted of scrambled eggs, mushrooms, sausages and potatoes).  However, we were so tired we slept through breakfast most days, at considerable savings.

The pool is a nice touch but it is a small two-lane lap pool and our children were a bit disappointed.  The lobby is attractive but quite formal and not inviting--not once did we sit in it.  The lobby also suggests a snootier hotel than we found it to be as the staff were uniformly friendly and helpful.

The hotel looks to be about 150 years old and I had completely forgiven the slightly curling wallpaper and scuffs and scraches.  Then I read it was built little more than ten years ago and my attitude changed somewhat.

There is free wifi in the lobby but it costs extra to be able to access it from the rooms, which definitely contributes to a feeling of being nickeled and dimed. There was a general lack of small touches that would make this a super luxury hotel. 

Overall, we found this to be a comfortable family hotel.  It was a good choice that met all of our needs.",4,2013,09,04
205,Perfect.,"The beautiful property is conveniently placed near transportation to easily access and discover beautiful Dublin from Trinity College to Howth.  The rooms were huge and elegantly appointed, the bar has an immense whiskey selection, and the breakfast was delicious! Just lovely.",5,2013,09,03
205,A Wonderful Weekend,"My wife and I attended a wedding reception in the hotel last weekend, returning home last night. We spent three very enjoyable nights here. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff . Our room was in  immaculate decorative condition and very clean as one would expect. The bed was most comfortable. My wife especially enjoyed the very luxurious hot chocolate prepared in the bar!
Room service was exceptionally speedy.
I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin who wants a luxury break.",5,2013,09,03
205,Expected standard,"Booked the Four Seasons Dublin blindfolded, and was not disappointed. Nice, generous size of rooms, with large bathroom with all the amenities. Requested for tea service to be set up which was quickly provided. There was a glitch with the TV channels but was soon sorted out. The Staff is very friendly and efficient, concierge happy to help. The staff at the Porch are a jovial lot, happy to help me when the parking barrier refused to accept my card (validated at the reception if a guest). All in all for a city hotel it works. A 15 min taxi ride to the City centre.",4,2013,09,01
205,Amazing!,"Stayed here with my partner for the English August Bank Holiday for my partner's birthday. We had the best weekend possible - the hotel is gorgeous, the service was first class and the facilities such as the spa and pool are excellent. Afternoon tea is unmissable! Absolutely loved it!",5,2013,09,01
205,Disappointing,This particular Four Seasons did not meet our expectations.  The service and cleanliness were there but the luxury was not.  The rooms need renovating- the décor was very tired and the bed was not comfortable. I would be hesitant to stay here again.,3,2013,08,30
205,"Excellent Infrastructure, Service sometimes lacking","We stayed in an Executive Suite recently which is brilliant for parents with children.  I cannot fault the room itself, the furnishings are great and both the bedroom have a Samsung Smart TV installed which is great to keep the little ones busy.  Sadly, the hamstrung remote control means you have absolutely no way to play content from USB sticks (who doesn't travel with a collection of kid's movies on sticks now?!!?) but the HDMI sockets did allow my laptop to playback on the TV.

The sofabed in the room, however, is unsuitable for anyone over 50kg to sleep on.  So do check if you're putting adults or larger kids on the sofabed.

The table by the door, the first thing we saw upon entering the room, was dusty when we arrived but the rest of the room appeared to be very clean.

The pool is quite nice, the kids enjoyed playing and swimming in there.  There's also a hottub/whirlpool next to it.

The service in the hotel is hit and miss. Concierge - excellent.  Reception - excellent. Getting fed and watered when you don't appear to be one of the snootier guests in the restaurant or other areas that serve food?  Very average.  I might be wearing jeans and a polo but I can tell you that my income probably exceeds some of those suit and tie gentlemen.  Be more attentive please, people - just looking up and around once you've served someone else would help.

I'm 50/50 as to if I'd return to this hotel next time I'm in Dublin.

The food is good and reasonable value but the most annoying thing I found at this hotel was the €2 per coffee capsule in the room (seriously!) and the hotel following the trend to charge €25 per day for multiple devices to get on the wireless network (buy a 3 SIM for €20 and use it everywhere like I did).",4,2013,08,30
205,Four Seasons always Four Seasons,"If you stay Four Seasons Hotels you always know that you get great service.
Staff was very friendly in proffesional way. They are very helpful even in the midnight. Rooms are comfortable and you never want to leave from their comfortable bed. Only the missing thing in the room there was no coffee machine. Special thanks to reception and concierge staff.",5,2013,08,29
205,Best Hotel in Dublin,"I think it's one of the best Hotels in Ireland, and by far the best in Dublin.
Location is not the best, but service no match, staff are very warm and friendly, especially Karl at the front door, he was very friendley and helpfull.",4,2013,08,29
205,Fab place for lunch,"Was at the RHS in Dublin and needed an oasis for lunch. walked into a calm foyer, excellent staff, seated quickly and seated in the sunshine. Lunch was delicious, kids had great hamburgers and I had a lovely smoked salmon. excellent and well recommended",5,2013,08,29
205,Perfect Business Hotel,"The Four Seasons Dublin was the perfect location for my recent business trip to Dublin.  Close to our office, great amenities including a spa and fitness center.

The location is a little far from the city center, but an easy cab ride or walk and being able to run to the water in the morning was ideal.

Will definitely return the next time my travels take me to Dublin.",5,2013,08,28
205,Overall very good,Very warm staff and well appointed rooms.   Food was okay. The room was great and bed super comfortable.  Very quiet and we never heard anyone next to us.   The location might turn some off as it is short taxi or long walk to city centre.   There are some great pubs out near Ballsbridge area.   ,4,2013,08,26
205,Lovely property but far from the action,We stayed for 2 nights in August to start our three week trip in Ireland.  It was a very nice hotel and the rooms were large.  It was a very good value for the money which you don't often get to say about a Four Seasons.  If I was to go to Dublin again for a short stay I would not stay here as the location is a good distance from the main sights and the cabs back and forth were 10 to 15 euros each way.  Walking took us well over an hour from the central area and that was at a good pace.  We went to the play Streetcar Named Desire at the Gate Theatre which was fantastic.  We had dinner at a new restaurant called the Hot Stove which had very good food for good price but we did run into a service problem and had to eat main course in under 10 minutes in order to make the play.,4,2013,08,25
205,Great way to start a trip to Ireland.,"We began a 2 week trip to Ireland in Dublin. I picked the Four Seasons because I wanted a quiet location away from the center, and the rates were reasonable for the quality and reputation. It was a good decision. The hotel knew we were arriving Sunday morning, but we were even earlier than expected; they had both rooms ready by 9 am, and we were able to swim, breakfast, and rest befor heading out, and essentially had no jet lag issue. It is a 20 to 30 minute walk to the center, but through pleasant, upscale streets, and there are several restaurants 5 min away.
For us (3 children) having the pool/gym/spa after each day was probably the best thing about this hotel. We had no issues/problems at all with this hotel, and will consider other sister properties based on our experience.",5,2013,08,18
205,The hotel is great but the concierge is lacking.,"We love the hotel but, under the direction if the concierge, we took a day trip with a hired car.  The trip was not as it was to be and we were late back to the hotel, even when we told the driver we could NOT be late.  We blew a whole day.  Too bad...the concierge did not seem to care.",5,2013,08,18
205,Brilliant.,"We just got back from a 3 night stay and yes it's an expensive hotel but I have to admit its worth it. 
The service is just amazing. The place is flooded with staff and we went on what has to be the busiest time of year on horseshow week.!! This did not matter a bit. They were ready and more than willing. So hats off to everyone there. 
The pool and wellness centre is lovely. The room was great the breakfast was amazing. Could not fault a thing!!!
It is shockingly expensive but when you take it all into perspective it's a bill I was dreading but paid it willingly. 
Looking forward to next year!!",5,2013,08,16
205,Could not have been better,"Whilst travelling in a group of 130 people, we had the pleasure of staying at Four Seasons Dublin. Our room was luxuriously appointed and extremely spacious. Services received were excellent. Breakfast variety fabulous. Our positive experience was shared by all travelling in our large group. ",5,2013,08,16
205,"Great location & exceptional service, as only you would expect with The Four Seasons.","Great location & exceptional service, as only you would expect with The Four Seasons.

205,"""Disappointing dining""","I stayed here for three nights in August 2013 during the Dublin Horse Show with my sister and 12 year old daughter. I have stayed here on a number of occasions in the past few years and have enjoyed every stay immensely. On arrival we were efficiently checked into our luxurious premium room (courtesy of a free upgrade from booking through Grand Luxury Hotels). The room was perfect with all the details you would expect from a hotel of this calibre. There was a nice personal touch of a bowl of cookies including a horse shaped one for my daughter, and as requested tea and coffee making facilities had been put into the room. After a day at the show we were really looking forward to a nice meal at Seasons Restaurant. And it was then that things went pear-shaped.  It was my sister's first visit to the hotel and I had raved to her about how good the food was. We sat down, looked at the menu - and I couldn't believe my eyes. Had I walked into the wrong restaurant?  Fish and chips, burger and chips, even a club sandwich. On a 5* hotel dinner menu?  Now I know that the horse show week is a really busy time and I had anticipated a limited menu. What I had not anticipated was that the food offered would have been so basic. A club sandwich for dinner? If I had wanted pub grub I would have gone to the pub around the corner! The food itself was ok - nothing to write home about - we formed the view that it had been sitting about for a while. Overall we were left feeling hugely disappointed  with the dining experience. 

 I love my hotel breakfast and was expecting the usual lavish spread. I think though that the fresh fruit on offer was more limited than previous visits. There were two low points at breakfast - the first being when my sister took a spoonful of her luxurious yoghurt and found it had gone ""off"". Hers was clearly not an isolated experience as the lady at the next table took one spoonful and left the rest of her pot. The second was when I asked if there was any sign of the toast we had ordered ten minutes or so earlier and the member of staff stated somewhat curtly that the kitchen ""WAS RATHER BUSY.""  This is a five star hotel. During the horse show it charges premium rates for a minimum three night stay and every room is booked. It is entirely unacceptable  to provide (at best) a three star ding experience, just because the hotel is very busy.  If extra staff are required, they should be put on. 
Aside from these issues the rest of our stay was great. I had a massage in the spa which was absolutely divine. Apart from the brusque lady at breakfast all other members of staff were unfailingly helpful and polite.
Would I go back? Yes - in fact we are going back in September for a concert at the O2. Would I eat at Seasons again? Yes, but not during the horse show. I will go to the pub and get the same food at pub prices!",4,2013,08,12
205,Don't stay anywhere else!,"We stay here for the 4 days of Dublin Horse Show every year with our 2 teenagers and wouldn't consider staying anywhere else.  The staff are friendly, welcoming and are genuinely interested in taking care of you and making your stay special.  You will eat and sleep well at the Four Seasons!  It's the little things and the attention to detail that makes the difference - a thoroughly wonderful 5* experience and totally worth every penny.  The decor has been updated since last year giving the downstairs a more modern feel and although I did miss the table with the 'statement' flowers in the foyer I noticed these have been re-located to the entrance of casual dining.  Nothing is too much trouble for the staff (even in what must be one of the busiest weeks of the year for the hotel!).  The staff are what you would expect in a hotel of this standard, very well-trained - they are attentive but not intrusive..... it's interesting to watch a happy team at work giving a seamless service.  Thank you Lucius and your team for looking after our family so well.... already looking forward to our stay next year!",5,2013,08,11
205,Comfort and luxury at a surprisingly reasonable price,"We love the Four Seasons.  The staff is professional and welcoming, the rooms are clean and luxurious, and the price is surprisingly reasonable.  Although it is a bit of a distance from city center, it is a very pleasant walk or a short taxi ride, and Ballsbridge is a calm, beautiful area.  There are several wonderful restaurants only a short walk away.  We highly recommend the hotel.",5,2013,08,09
205,Very nice service and lovely property,We had a good stay here for two nights this August.  We were given the option to upgrade the room and we brought up to view before making the decision which was very nice.  The staff were all incredibly friendly.  The location is a bit outside the city which was fine although for two nights it might have been easier to just be in the city.  The concierge was incredibly helpful getting us tickets to the GAA quarterfinal game at the last minute which was a trip highlight.  My only disappointment is the restaurant situation.  We ate in the lounge and I thought it was only average and expensive.  Otherwise very comfortable rooms in four seasons style.,4,2013,08,08
205,"Wonderful, as always","I stayed at the Four Seasons for a short business trip.  The hotel rooms are spacious, light, and beautiful.  Some of the nicest rooms I stay at in all of my European travels.  The staff are friendly and always willing to help, without being intrusive.  I truly enjoy staying in this hotel. While the location is a bit far from town, the walk is nice and its quite easy to grab a taxi if not in the mood far walking.",5,2013,08,07
205,Top Class Service at a top Class Hotel!,"Best service I have ever experienced at a hotel in Ireland - stayed for three nights with my husband, we were in Dublin to watch the Ireland v England Six Nations Rugby game, great location, 10 minutes walk to the stadium. We ate at the hotel each day, the food without exception was great, even if it was just a snack or full dinner - all the staff were courteous and helpful. Highly recommend this hotel - it's a must if you are staying in Dublin!",5,2013,08,05
205,"SUPER HOTEL, GREAT SERVICE!","As a regular visitor to Dublin we have the pleasure of staying here every few months. The hotel is consisterly very good with the rooms (we've stayed in many different types) all immaculately presented and appointed to the highest of standards. Our favourite are the Executive Suites which are just everything you want from a hotel. The service is warm, friendly and completely professional. The staff are one of the shining joys of this establishment and nothing is ever too much trouble and they're always two steps ahead of you.

Breakfast is served in a large conservatory with views of the garden. At times service can be a little slow at busy times (to be expected) but perfectly acceptable. Breakfast itself is nice without being exceptional. We haven't had dinner here for a while so I'm not best placed to comment on this part. There are so many super places to eat in Dublin it's hard to eat in! The public areas are a little ""generic"" and do lack a little character. Whilst the Ice Bar is definitely a great place for a cocktail.

Yes it may be a bit further out than The Shelbourne but it's well worth the short taxi ride!",4,2013,08,04
205,"Excellent location, excellent hotel.","Excellent location, excellent hotel.  Staff were warm and friendly.  Food was innovative and good wines.  They made fresh tapenade and a pineapple tart tatin at my request  Lovely room.  Some lovely parts of Dublin within a stroll, as well as central Dublin.",5,2013,08,04
205,Excellent standard of care. Highly recommended.,"A very relaxed and beautifully appointed hotel. Don't be put off by the rather bland exterior. The rooms are spacious, the beds are wonderfully comfortable and the service is first-rate.
Not a very ""Dublin experience"" but great for those who appreciate the grander North American hotel experience.",5,2013,08,03
205,"Exceptional property.  New, large rooms.  Concierge very helpful.","Exceptional property.  New large rooms.  Great area of town.   Hallways were bright and the hotel was spotless.  Restaurants were innovative and clean and bright.   Our reservation was for several rooms and it was done completely correctly.

205,Let down again :(,"This was the most disappointing visit to the Four Seasons Dublin I have ever had. I travel to Dublin once or twice a year on business and normally stay here. This visit I had my son with me. I had requested a particular type of room with a particular view, neither of which I got. I had to change room three times,had to reschedule one meeting due to waiting on a room change. The food for my son never included vegetables, something I would think is standard for a child's meal, but not here, you have to pay more for your child to receive vegetables. The menu options for children are not the most varied. Upon arrival my room was not ready again, I have had this problem in the past. I arrived at 2.50pm so not sure why they say check in is 3pm when your room will not be ready for then. The girl I was dealing with was very matter of fact and unhelpful and did not even inform me when my room was ready, the porter informed me! I must ad the porter Borja was the most helpful and friendly. He is a genuine employee who cares about your experience. I pay big money to get the experience and comfort when I travel but will not be making the same mistake with this hotel again. Looks can be very deceiving.",3,2013,08,01
205,Hotel between the city and the sea - perfect location.,"We were pampered!

Our room was large and comfortable, the king-size bed was perfect for our backs. We ate one very late hot afternoon at the hotel and were satisfied.

The location, just a short 'dart' ride from downtown, introduced us to another part of Dublin: residential, stately, and a short walk to Dublin's seaside!

But I preferred the indoor pool to the ocean.  I took a swim every morning and then enjoyed tranquility in the ladies' lounge just  off the pool, which was equipped with really everything: lounge chairs,teas and coffees and sticky buns, hair combs & lotions & swimsuit-wringer,  all wrapped in serenity as preparation for the hectic of the day. 

We enjoyed the stay.",5,2013,07,31
205,Everyone was amazing,"This is a most amazing hotel, 100% 5 star. The staff is perfect. We loved the bar and breakfast was the best we have had at a hotel. I should be a paid endorser LOL. We will always stay at the four seasons when in Dublin",5,2013,07,31
205,"Exactly what you would, and should, expect","My family and I had a wonderful experience. Everything was perfect. Location is an enormous plus; quite yet close. Highly recommend this hotel as the best place to stay when in dublin. The staff is perfect, the atmosphere as you would expect. The best hotel chain around.",5,2013,07,30
205,Sunday Brunch - Outstanding food & staff,"I had Sunday brunch for my Mum's birthdays at the hotel & it was amazing - the best meal i've had in a long time. The atmosphere was very relaxed, the staff were outstanding & the food was by far the best restautrant food i've had in a long time. The menu variety is great & quality is fantastic. The staff accomodated any change we asked for. The special birthday dessert plate is a lovely touch. I would like to call out how helpful & thoughtful Fiona the manager in charge was. She was very friendly, thoughtful & helpful - a real asset to the your business. 

Thank you for an amazing experience & we will be back...",5,2013,07,28
205,Not up to standard,"We stayed at the FourSeasons for two days during a European trip and while the building is a nice one, I was dissapointed on a few occasisions.  We got the Family Suite and the room was fine, but not five star quality.   Onet thing that was odd about the room was that it had a large outdoor patio off of the living room that had no furniture or any way to really use it.

We checked in around 11 pm and got to the suite and realized that the kids sofa bed was not made up and needed to have housekeeping come up with all of the needed bedding to make the bed up.  Was a little disappointing that the hotel would not set up the only other bed in the Family Suite until they were asked;  particularly since they knew that we were arriving late and had kids.  We then ordered the late night room service pizza and it was truly awful.  Unedible.  Now I do not go to Ireland to get great pizza, however, this was truly bad and since we had been travelling a lot of the day, this was not what I had hoped for,

On the positive side we did feel that the folks at the concierge desk and reception were unfailingly nice and helpful and I was impreeseed with the gym facilities.

All in all it was OK but not up to what I expect fropm a Four Seasons.",3,2013,07,28
205,Amazing building lacking warmth.,"This is without doubt a beautiful hotel, it lacked warmth. staff behaved more like robots that people.  as i stated in my preview on Muckross park hotel, it is too an amazing place but the warmth and atmosphere surpassed The four seasons by far. its a shame really because apart from this it had it all.
regardless of the hotel rating a little natural warmth wouldnt go amiss. everything you needed was available and provided but as i said in a robotic type way.
i will stay here again if only for the surroundings.",4,2013,07,25
205,It's just OK,"We stayed for 5 nights at this Dublin hotel with our extended family in 1 large suite and two other standard rooms. Our final room was comfortable and very spacious with great light but we were overall underwhelmed by this FS property. 

Our first problem was upon checkin at 6am after an international flight with my 2 year old son. We had reserved our 3 rooms for the night before so we could directly check in and go to sleep. We had requested rooms next to each other as we were traveling with my sister and mother in law. Our first room was on a different floor on the opposite end of the hotel from our family. The man who checked us in forgot our keys and had to go back down to the desk to let us in. It overlooked the rubbish bins. It was dark and set up as an ADA room- which I didn't like the bathroom (1 sink, flickering lights, bars everywhere, no WC just toilet in the middle of the bathroom...).  It took until 7:30 to get through to room service. 8:30 to get our breakfast!!! Meanwhile I unpacked. Finally we got to sleep. Later that day I asked to be moved. Sure enough they had a suite next to the rest of our family.... why couldn't we get this room initially?  So we packed up all our stuff and moved.  This was really annoying as we had reserved and requested this 8 months earlier.

Now the main problem with this hotel is the location. It is outside of Dublin center.  They have 1 house car that can bring you into town, if available (most of the time it isn't). The other option is a BMW to drive you which is 20-30 Euro into town. And then you have to get a taxi back to the hotel 10-20 Euro each way. This can be 15 min without traffic or 45 min with traffic. If there was a shuttle like FS Firenze, that would be fine, but they don't have this service and therefore we found the location to be very inconvenient. Especially traveling with kids. I would suggest a hotel in downtown.

There were not any children's amenities set up in the room as per usual with FS.  But we felt very comfortable and welcomed with our son.  The food options for children were also not very healthy.  Bathroom was beautiful and spacious so were the closets. I wish FS would choose more natural bath toiletries and soaps that are not packed with chemicals. The laundry service was prompt and great. Room service food was ok- not great, I wish they had healthier options. The problem was that there were not a ton of restaurants within walking distance. So to go out for dinner is another journey into town. We did bring our son to use the pool in the spa area which was peaceful at some points and loud and boisterous at others-children are allowed. 

When we checked out, they helped us load the car, but I did not feel like they cared if we had a nice time. No bottle of water or goodbye and thank you ... overall this was a comfortable hotel but they did not go the extra mile I expect from a FS property so I would look elsewhere next time I visit Dublin (somewhere close to central Dublin).",3,2013,07,21
205,A luxurious stay!,"A beautiful hotel with excellent service and a very accomodating staff.  We stayed 3 nights - the last of a 2 1/2 week visit to Scotland and Ireland.  It was the perfect way to end a great vacation. Breakfast was included - a fabulous buffet that started our days off just right.  Our room was spacious, as was the bathroom, and very clean.  There is a computer and printer available in the lobby, another handy service.",5,2013,07,21
205,Perfect,"A beautiful huge room, welcoming gym/spa staff, and excellent food made our week long stay one of the best vacations weve had as a family.  Also the DART (a quick local train/metro) is only 2 blocks away.  I highly recommend this hotel for business or pleasure",5,2013,07,21
205,Amazing stay and Great People!!!,"My husband and I stayed here for four days at the end of June as part of a 10 day anniversary trip.  It was wonderful mostly because of the superb staff.  The Concierge provided wonderful dinner recommendations in Dublin, they told us best places to go in town, and were just so friendly.

Rooms were great- we requested a room facing the street vs the courtyard which we enjoyed.  

We took taxis in and out of town the first two days, then figured out that two city buses drop off right in front of the hotel and opted to use the bus on the last two which was super easy.  

The Four Seasons has an amazing bar which we would post up at in the evenings and chat about our travels and make friends.  I could have not asked for a better stay!",5,2013,07,20
205,A Great Stay,"Stayed here for 4 nights while attending a meeting in Dublin. All in all, this was one of the nicer hotels I have stayed in. The hotel, rooms and service were all top notch. Room was spacious and comfortable. We enjoyed the bar and lounge at the lobby. Breakfast was included in our package and was always well done. We had some problems with tours we arranged that did not involve the hotel but the concierge helped us iron the problems out. The only negative I can think of is that hotel is a little outside the city. We knew this ahead of time and we enjoyed the neighborhood we were in. We took advantage of the car services that the hotel offered, a little more expensive than a cab but not by much and they were fixed costs. We used the car services to be picked up from and to be taken to the airport. It was very convenient and just a little more the cab. Also, there is a train stop a block away which links you to further locations. We took train to Howth for a nice little excursion. Would definitely stay here again. ",5,2013,07,13
205,"Great luxury hotel where the staff is nice and willing to help at any time ! Large room, nice L'Occitane bath products !","I stayed 3 nights in the Four Seasons Dublin for business and it was really a nice stay. The hotel is cosy, the staff is sooooooooo kind and willing to help ! The staff at the Concierge is really great, recommending very nice restaurants also ! The room was really comfortable and large and in the bathroom they have L'Occitane products to take care of ourselves ! Wifii was provided during our stay and the connection was really good. The bar menu offers tasteful homemade ice tea. The food is also very good, from the breakfast to the lunch and the food for the breaks. A great hotel with a great staff ! The hotel is not in the city center but it's not far by taxi.",5,2013,07,10
205,Great Location,"This hotel is great. We stayed here for a week. The staff was excellent. The location was great. It really made our time here wonderful. We would travel in the day and have a great nights rest here. The rooms were clean, the hotel is very updated, and was fantastic.",5,2013,07,10
205,5 star experience in Dublin,"I have stayed in this hotel many times and always loved the luxurious feel as you entered the foyer. Beautiful flowers and plush decor.
What a disappointment!
They have re decorated the foyer and lounge areas and they are now in a supposed modernist style....chrome lamps in pink, plastic chairs and tables that one would expect to see in a bar.
The lovely grand lounge for afternoon tea is now used for dining.
Bedrooms are comfortable and bathrooms 
 are 4 season standard.
The staff are helpful but a lot of their well trained experienced staff have left. Takes quite a while to order a drink. I had to ask to get my table cleaned!
Hotel is in a wonderful location....and close to the city. It is definitely NOT 4 Seasons standard.
Would stay in the Merrion Hotel on my next trip. Much more authentic 5 star hotel.",3,2013,07,08
205,Just what you would expect and great food,"The Four Seasons Dublin did not dissapoint.  The lobby is modern and traditional all at once.  The decorating in the lobby is spot on and beautifully done.

We arrived after an overnight flight from the States and we were exhausted.  It was 9am Ireland time and check in time is 3pm.    I had booked massages in the spa to fill some of the down time.  The spa is lovely with a nice pool.  The pool was filled with kids, so unfortunately some much needed sleep by the indoor pool was not an option (to be fair, it was mid day.)  However, had I had my own kids with me I would have happily had them in there.  The hotel is very family friendly. 
The massages were EXCELLENT.  Really above standard.  The eucalyptus steam room with an ice cold washcloth on my eyes was the perfect way to relax until the room was ready. 

Luckily the room was ready early and we were happy to see a very clean, very comfortable, traditional room.  We had a standard room with a courtyard view.  The beds were soft and comfortable.  The bathroom was clean and the water pressure in the shower was good.  The hair dryer in the room was great - I was worried having left mine at home due to warnings of it being damaged.  It was comperable to my super solano.  There is also a very large, lighted magnifying mirror.  

The food in the bar and retaurant was outstanding.  The eggs benedict, spring rolls and irish coffee are not to be missed.  The only compaint I have is that the service was very slow.  The staff were a bit disorganized and their systems kept crashing (one meal was free b/c they couldn't print our check, once a manager forgot to bring my cocktail after being asked twice).  The corner table in the Lobby seating area next to the gorgeous atrium window is fantastic.  

Everyone was extremely friendly, curteous and helpful.  

The hotel is a cab ride away from the center of town.  You can walk it, but it will take about 15-20 min (or more).  The ride is quick and we were happy to be away from the noise and chaos of the Temple Bar area and downtown area once our night was done.  It was great to be in a beautiful, clean and quiet location.  

I would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here again when I return to Dublin.  I don't think I would even consider another hotel there unless it was necessary.",5,2013,07,07
205,Home from Home,"I have stayed at the Four Seasons, Dublin on about 6 or 7 occasions over the course of the last two years, mainly for pleasure with family. Prior to my initial stay I had stayed at all other 5* properties in Dublin, however, since my initial stay almost 2 years ago, the Four Seasons is really the only Hotel I would want to stay in. 

I have tonight arrived home from another wonderful weekend with my wife, 1 year old, and granny. The Hotel was everything you would expect and more. Apart from the beautiful building and well appointed rooms (one of our rooms was kindly upgraded to a Junior Suite which had even more space), I believe that the hotel's best attribute is its staff, to include those 'behind the scenes' staff members who are often not noticed. They are pleasant and personable without exception. 

I do accept that one can obtain a better rate at other good hotels in the area, however you do get what you pay for at the FS. I recall a visit to a competitor 5* a few years ago and feeling robbed as I paid my bill which was not as high as that paid from time to time at the FS;the difference is that the service provided at the FS is much much superior.

Seasons Restaurant is a superior eatery, from breakfast right through the day. I consider that the breakfast provided is excellent (on occasion I have drifted off to sleep of an evening looking forward to my breakfast the following morning) and whilst we did not have dinner in the Restuarant on this visit, previous experiences have always been positive.

I also must comment that the hotel is absolutely child friendly and it is nice that the staff take the time to make a fuss about guests' children.

I have read the various average, poor and terrible reviews out of interest and, whilst they are no doubt written in good faith and as honest sentiment, must disagree with them entirely. ",5,2013,07,07
205,Super service Super Hotel,"Staff is as good as it gets. Quite, out of the downtown noice, but close enough. Hotel is beautiful.Reasonable, compare to other Europeen cities. Dart is about two blocks. Taxi is always available. Parking is available to those that wish to drive on the wrong side of the road.",5,2013,07,06
205,First class all the way,"Although this is a rather pricey hotel, if you get a good package deal or can stay there on business, this is one of the nicest places in Dublin.  It is also only a block's walk from the DART train line that runs into the heart of the city.  The hotel's service is first rate and they are more than willing to accommodate any request you may have.",5,2013,07,05
205,"Great service, great spa, cool location.","If you want to be in Dublin, but not in the hustle and bustle of right downtown, the Four Seasons is great. The staff is wonderful, the spa is relaxing, the gym is fabulous as is the pool. While you pay a pretty penny for anything you consume on site, I will say- the bartenders in the Ice lounge make delicious cocktail. Best old fashion I've ever had. ",5,2013,07,05
205,"Good hotel, slightly far away from the center!","We stayed here for a few days on our honeymoon.. The hotel
Is lovely and vast!! 
Our room had a poor view of a yard behind the hotel though...

The staff were friendly however seemed a little overpriced for the service we got,  With one exception being the head concierge who was fantastic!
Also way to far out of the center to walk to and from the hotel so we had to get taxis all the time. We would stay here again 
",5,2013,07,04
205,Fantastic Dublin Experience,"Yes it's a bit pricey but worth every penny - and we were lucky enough to get in on their promotion ""stay 2 nights and the 3rd is free"". That made the rate extremely reasonable for a luxury hotel. Our room was very large and comfortable. The staff at this hotel is exceptional - everyone is friendly and helpful with any request. The hotel is not in the heart of downtown Dublin so if being right downtown is important you might want to look elsewhere. But it's only about a 20 minute walk to the ""Hop on Hop off"" stop and we found that easy and a great way to see the city. Plus there are several great restaurants right in the immediate area around the hotel so we were happy (don't miss Roly's!).",5,2013,07,03
205,Memorable Birthday at 4 Seasons Dublin,"From arrival to departure it was a treat, Joanne Power receptionist did everything she could to make our stay memorable. We booked two executive suites and the rooms are fantastic. We had dinner in the restaurant and the waiting staff could not do more for us, the food was great. Breakfast the following day had us stuffed leaving slightly distressed but more distressing was having to go home!
Giving poor rating for value as they charge for Wi-Fi and four euros for a bottle of water in the room is unexpected as the room rates are high enough to include those 'standard' items",5,2013,07,03
205,"Excellent, professional, flexible","Stayed over following the Rihanna concert in Dublin. Excellent fun had by all and great cocktails !! Breakfast in the room was an absolute treat. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a very central, very professional and thoroughly enjoyable experience",5,2013,07,03
205,Great service and food,"The hotel had everything a guest could want from service, food, and amenities.  The food was excellent and try to Sticky Chicken Lolli’s or the Triple Cooked Fries along with a great Guinness.  

Hotel staff was very helpful and the front desk staff are excellent.  Best hotel that I have stayed at in Dublin.",5,2013,07,01
205,What a treat!,"We were very fortunate to have attended a wedding at the Four Seasons at the weekend and were not disappointed.  Unfortunately we were unable to stay as a certain Mr Rod Stewart was in town and the hotel had been fully booked for quite some time, although we did actually catch a glimpse of him when we arrived, a bonus for all us old rockers!!
The hotel itself is situated in a quiet residential area close to the city centre.  It is extremely smart as one would expect from a 5 star establishment.  The staff we encountered were all so welcoming and nothing appeared to be too much trouble to them.  The wedding meal was absolutely superb and the service excellent.  We could not have faulted it in any way and enjoyed every morsel!  
All in all, a wonderful occasion in a superb hotel in what is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful Georgian cities in the world.  I look forward to a return visit in the not too distant future!",5,2013,07,01
205,A let down for the four seasons,I have stayed in a few of these hotels around the world and they deserved 5* and more not this one appalling service absolutely appalling and I must have heard very guest say the same ...no excuse for the exorbitant prices and reputation of a 5* hotel and this chain in particular....,2,2013,06,30
205,Didn't Quite Hit The Mark,"We've stayed at a number of Four Seasons and this one didn't quite hit the mark. Positives: Bell/valet, reception, concierge and spa staff all did an exquisite job; housekeeping was excellent except for the last day we stayed where they left the room half-made for way too long and didn't replace the coffee cups - other than that, housekeeping was efficient and went out of their way during turndown service; room (Exec Suite) was up to par and food was excellent and consistent; local walking options for breakfast weren't there so the same breakfast day after day got old. Negatives: location is a challenge and street signs in Dublin are horrendous (obviously not the hotel's fault) and it's a taxi ride or 15-minute walk to any dining choices, even for a coffee; service in restaurant was spotty - sometimes right on target but too many times we had to chase someone down just to start service or get something; they have self-seating in the main lounge area, with some tables reserved for afternoon tea - but there is no indication of that so we (and several others) would sit down and then be made to move. Seemed a bit disorganized. But at other times service was efficient. Pool area was well-maintained, generally quiet and relaxing and pool temp perfect. Some of the carpets in the hallways were showing wear at the seams, although they were kept clean; Overall, I'd give this property an 8.5/10 but any Four Seasons should be achieving 10/10 - otherwise one begins to question the brand's consistency.",4,2013,06,30
205,"Love Four Seasons, but...","The location really disappoints.
Somehow I assume the Four Seasons will be centrally located (thinking NY, Boston, Prague). But this one is in a bizarre hinterland--not the city, not the 'burbs.
On the positive side: great Irish art work in the public areas.
Less positive: sterile environment; overrun when I was there by middle-aged rugby fans.",4,2013,06,29
205,Not quite up to scratch,"We stayed at the Four Seasons in Dublin while attending a friend's wedding. Having stayed at other Four Seasons hotels including the George V in Paris, I guess we had high expectations. On the way to the hotel, the taxi driver told us that the hotel had gone into receivership during the financial crash and was now state owned. This should have warned us. While the hotel is in a decent neighbourhood, the service and room appointments are somewhat lacking. There is a big difference between staff being unobtrusive but ever present and not really available. It is difficult to describe this but there is a feeling that one gets in upscale hotels that gives you the impression that if you need someone you only have to look up and someone would immediately be there to assist you. One does not get this feeling at the Four Seasons in Dublin. On the point of room amenities, generally in hotels of this supposed quality there is an abundance of toiletries both for the bath as well the shower. Here there was one single bottle of shower/bath gel to be shared between two people so it was impossible for one person to have a bath and he other a shower. Again there was only one bottle each of shampoo, conditioner and body lotion and no other toiletries. I guess this is what happens when a luxury hotel is run by the state.
As a previous reviewer wrote, it is not a bad hotel, it is just ok. However, when one stays at a Four Seasons, one does not expect an ok experience.",3,2013,06,29
205,Our new favorite hotel,"We recently returned from a 3 night stay at the Four Seasons Dublin; a bonus add-on trip after a 2-week cruise. What a delight! I've just read some of these recent reviews and am rather surprised and saddened. I'm not sure what others' threshold is, but we found our experience at the Four Seasons to be exemplary. Arriving late without half our luggage after British Airways delayed our flight and lost our luggage, causing us to miss a connection (a review for another day) - we were stressed and harried. The outstandingly professional and courteous manager, the front desk staff, the concierge, the bellman, the valets, the room staff ALL served to help us feel relaxed, calm and taken care of. The few clothes we did have were laundered and returned to us the next morning. A bag full of ""essentials"" was delivered to our room. Surprised to learn that Neil Young was giving a concert next door the night of our arrival, and bonus, we could hear the show from our room. Our suite was elegant, understated and inviting - clean and quite comfortable. After a wonderful breakfast, we were provided a luxury ride into town the next morning complete with great local stories and color from Tony. David, the concierge, was very helpful planning our day outing in town and wonderfully communicated some details he arranged on our behalf. When our bags were finally delivered, even the valet, Omar, remembered us and was excited to tell us that he put them in our room. There was one ""human error"" slip with the timing of early, pre-flight in-room breakfast delivery, but really, in the scheme of all the good - not at all a mar on a wonderful stay. (My only comment/suggestion - and it goes for all hotels really - at this price point, WiFi should really be free. If small local motels can offer it, I think the Four Seasons can as well.) We can't wait to return to the Four Seasons Dublin - hopefully sooner than later.",5,2013,06,28
205,A cut below the rest,"Ok, I'll admit it. I'm spoiled by the Four Seasons brand.  Time after time the name delivers in city after city and resort after resort.  I returned to the Dublin hotel recently, and while it was an ok experience, it just didn't quite measure up to the high bar the name sets.  

The property doesn't elicit any electricity. A remodeled old estate in a nice neighborhood, the location is isolated and there is no curbside charm.  There are embassies around, but no pubs or areas to browse.  The rooms are nice and well appointed.  The bar falls well below what one would hope for in Ireland.  The lobby lounge is decent. 

It's not bad, mind you, it's just not great.  Two days in a row they missed on a timely wake up call, again not what I expect from a Four Seasons. And the misses weren't by two minutes. On a business trip w a 5:00am wake up call, ten minutes late hurts!    One day they were out of tuna for a lunch salad.   I asked for a Herald Tribune and got the FT.   

Doing these reviews I have to call 'em as I see 'email, and although I'm predisposed to love Ireland and the Four Seasons, this time it just didn't fully deliver.   Maybe it was a bad week for them.",3,2013,06,28
205,Failure to Honor Confirmed Reservation,"I recently was a 'guest' for four nights at the Dublin Four Seasons Hotel having booked a 5-night stay.  On the 4th day I was told I had no reservation for the last night despite written documentation and confirmation number.  The front desk manager indicated the 'hotel never confirmed the last night' and disavowed the confirmation from Four Seasons.  Because of a set of concerts that weekend there were no other accommodations forcing me to not only leave work early but to pay change fees for the airline and incur the cost of an additional night's lodging in Frankfurt.  

The entire incident was not well managed by the front desk manager and certainly was not what I have come to expect from a Four Seasons property.",1,2013,06,26
205,"Our wedding at The Four Seasons Hotel, Dublin","We just had our wedding reception in the restaurant at The Four Seasons Hotel, Dublin following our civil marriage in the Junior Ballroom. This hotel is The best hotel in the country for weddings! We looked at every hotel within a 10 mile radius of the city, but didn't realise just how amazing our experience would be until we started dealing with the staff at the hotel. Lucius Farrell was outstanding in how he managed the whole event with Laura and his team. They were always one step ahead of us, thinking of every detail before we ever did. So many of our guests said it was the best wedding ever, including their own! We also heard that, like our experience, the staff were not only incredibly professional, but the were friendly and warm too. They literally could not do enough for us. This is, in our view, The best hotel in Ireland for a wedding.",5,2013,06,25
205,Our Wedding,"We had our wedding at The Four Seasons Hotel on Saturday, June 22nd.  I looked at every hotel within a 5 mile radius of Dublin and finally picked this one . This is The  best hotel in the country for a wedding, in our view. From the day we met Lucius Farrell from the hotel, he, and all of the staff there, could not do enough for us. Lucius, Laura and the team were always one step ahead, thinking of every detail before we ever did. The professionalism of every single member of staff was outstanding, but more than that, so many of our guests commented on their friendliness and warmth as well. They literally could not do enough for us and all of our guests. The Four Seasons Hotel made our wedding easy and truely the best day of our lives.",5,2013,06,25
205,Poor Service and Stone Cold Food,"This was our second visit to the Four Seasons Dublin.  A beautiful hotel, but the service is appalling for a 5* hotel!  35minutes before anyone came near us to take our breakfast order and it wasn't even busy.  Breakfast was cold, dinner which we had in the reading room was look warm, and room service was stone cold.  They really do need to focus on this, especially at the price.  The only saving grace of the weekend was the cocktails in the ICE bar!",3,2013,06,23
205,Beautiful Hotel but bad location and average staff service,"Too much trainee stafff
Too much foreuigner staff who can´t advise us for local attraction and don´t have a 5 star training and know how to serve and give the as value require by the customer for this type of hotel
Bar and restaurant too expensive regarding the service and altarnativa outside the hotel
The worse part is the location unless you want to do nothing.
The best part are the concirege team
It is a good hotel but a Four Seasain is below your expectation.",3,2013,06,21
205,My new favorite hotel!,"We were to stay at the Four Seasons three nights as part of a three city package deal. When we arrived, we were told that unfortunately the hotel was overbooked and they did not have a room for us. The paid the cab fare and had arranged for us to stay at another five-star hotel. They said to please come back to them for the remaining two nights. I am so glad that we did! When we returned the next day (they paid the cab fare), we were upgraded to a beautiful suite with a complimentary bottle of wine. We enjoyed the beautiful room and the rest of this gorgeous hotel with it's beautiful grounds. All of the hotel employees were extremely friendly and professional. We also enjoyed a wonderful breakfast with a beautiful view of the courtyard.The hotel seems bit far from the center of Dublin, but we walked to the Guinness factory one day and then Trinity College, etc. It was an easy walk along tree-lined streets. On our last morning, while waiting for a cab to the airport, we witnessed a staff member feeding bread to the resident ducks; he said he has been feeding the same family of ducks for 15 years!",5,2013,06,20
205,What a treat,After spending five days at the Adare Manor Resort we checked in for two nights at The Four Seasons Hotel in Dublin.  What a pleasant surprise!  The staff was outstanding as were the accommodations!  The food was delicious and the entire stay was outstanding.  I cannot praise The Four Seasons enough. We were travelling with a four year old and when we checked into the room there was a small table set with a plate and a large cookie with her name on it and surrounded by candy.   She also had her own terry cloth robe.  The friendliness and the attention to detail by the staff made this an experience we will not forget!,5,2013,06,19
205,Very nice hotel - Huge rooms!,"Myself and my girlfriend stayed here over the weekend of the Heiniken Cup Final and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. It is in an excellent location for the stadium and also for the town centre. The fron desk were very friendly on arrival and made no attempt to be overly formal, so this made us feel comfortable in such a nice hotel. The room was huge, the vathroom was huge and the wardrobe was a walk-in type. We were also greeted with some nice chocolates on arrival to our room as it was my birthday. The swimming pool and spa area is very nice but they are not unisex so if you wanted some romantic relaxing time in the sauna then you wont be able to here! everything is provided in the spa changing rooms e.g. razor, mouthwash, comb, tea, fruit etc.

It is an expensive treat but well worth it if you can afford the extra money.",5,2013,06,19
205,Attending the IFIA Annual conference at the Four Seasons Hotel in Dublin.,"The quality of the hotel the professionalism and freindliness of the staff throughout the hotel, the quality and size of the room, the food served, the Bar and the infrastrucure for supporting the conference were all TRULY EXCELLENT. It was a pleasure to stay at this hotel.",5,2013,06,19
205,Room was bigger than my house!,"My wife and I went to Ireland to celebrate our wedding anniversary, and the Four Seasons Dublin made our trip very memorable.  On check in, the front desk informed us that we were upgraded to the Presidential Suite on the occasion of our anniversary.  I think it made it easier that we only stayed one night.  The room was amazing!  Plus, when we got up to the room, there was a little plate of chocolates waiting.  I particularly liked the in-room Nespresso espresso machine.  Needless to say, we enjoyed out experience.  The hotel staff treated us very nicely and the customer service was flawless.  Our little beat up rental car was parked up front with all of the expensive sedans and sports cars due to the room we were placed in.  We had to laugh about that one.  If we ever go to Dublin again, the Four Seasons will be our residence of choice.",5,2013,06,18
205,"A rare find, a welcome change, and a terrific hotel.","The Four Seasons Dublin is an elegant city hotel offering luxury without excess. It is a rare find, a welcome change, and a terrific hotel.

Perhaps it is not surprising that a hotel in Dublin exhibits as part of its public spaces a stunning collection of paintings, prints, and sculpture by contemporary Irish artists. What is surprising, though, is how successfully the presence of art defined the hotel for me and improved my experience as a guest. 

All in all, it was simply a pleasure to be in this hotel. The staff was spectacular and the accommodations perfect. Particular praise to the concierge, but in fact every person we dealt with was helpful. Recommendations for local restaurants were right. Directions were clear. The room, just a standard normal room, was wonderful in all respects. Further, the room was ready very early, 9:00 a.m., as requested and was always refreshed by housekeeping  regardless of our schedule.

So, what do we have? A surprising oasis with effective staff. Works for me. Five stars for this Four Seasons, for sure.",5,2013,06,17
205,Just a superb hotel with great service.,"We have stayed twice in the last week, both in a premium room for 3 nights and a superior room for 1 night. The quality of both rooms was equally superb and the level of service in both visits was without parallel. Could not recommend the hotel highly enough. Worth every penny.",5,2013,06,16
205,Fabulous experience,"Myself and my two children booked in here as we were going to Robbie Williams in the Aviva.  I felt it would be close to the Aviva and would save us getting a taxi. We were so pleased with everything in the hotel - staff, food , bedroom etc. I really enjoyed my stay and was sorry I wasn't there for a second night",5,2013,06,15
205,"Great room, poor breakfast","Stayed here for 1 night during a business trip. The room was typical Four Seasons standard. Nothing to complain about. very clean, great size, comfy bed. 

The big let down was the breakfast. You have the choice between a Continental breakfast for €21 and a hot option for €27 which gives you a choice of eggs, bacon etc.  There is no menu you can order from (Why not?). I went for the Continental option. The variety (some bagels, a bit of fruit, some pastries, muesli, bread) and presentation (crammed into one of the corners) were far below 5 star standards. No toaster was provided to toast bread/bagels, so I asked the waiter to get it toasted by the kitchen. I had to wait 15min (!!) for it to be returned to me and the restaurant was far from busy at 7am. Unbelievable. 

All in all a very disappointing experience and hence only 3 stars. If however you are not a breakfast person, you'll like it here as the rest lived up to the Four Seasons standard.",3,2013,06,11
205,Perfect..a bit too perfect..,"Myself and my boyfriend spent the last month travelling around Ireland and this is one hotel we still cant make our minds up whether we'll be back or not. Everything was perfect, to a tee, but it was so perfect is was uncomfortable, staff were stiff, with a very poor homely feel to it. Food was amazing and also the rooms. I think I would prefer be able have a friendly chat with staff throughout a stay than military style service. I don't know, I think I would maybe return.",4,2013,06,11
205,Its the people who bring you back.,"This was our first time at a Four Seasons Hotel in Europe and every stay at a Four Seasons in North America is beyond expectation. The people at the Dublin Four Seasons take service and politeness to another level. The staff were very helpful in getting our car rental back to the airport and whenever we left a tip for service, they were gracious and appreciative that we had offered them a tip. This was much different from so many other hotels and restaurants where the tip is just expected.  

The Hotel is smaller than other Four Seasons hotels and within a day we knew the people in the restaurants and reception areas.  The Four Seasons staff are from all parts of the world. Our waiter was from Poland and when we told them we were from Toronto, he wanted to know about the new Four Seasons in our city. We will stay in the Four Seasons in Dublin again, because I want to say hello again to people who we  think of as friends.",5,2013,06,11
205,5 Star Luxury,"I stayed with my husband in the Four Seasons hotel on 1st of June 2013. We had a wonderful stay!!! It was the best Birthday ever- my husband said. Staff at reception on check in and check out where very helpful! We got a nice upgrade to a bigger room, we got a lovely birthday plate!!! That was amazing. When we turned the tv on we where welcomed with our names on it!!!!! That was awesome !!! The hotel really has a wow factor. The bed and linen is very comfortable and we had a good night sleep! AC in the room works properly. the breakfast was yummy! And the man who set it for us in the bedroom was very professional!! There was few things, that made me uncomfortable too. 1. The walls around the toilet where dirty. 2.there was a small hair in the bath. 3. The staff in the bar where a bit slow getting our drinks and then the bill. 4. I didn't feel comfortable enough by not having iron in the room and tea and coffee facilities. It was available on request.  But in general the Hotel is lovely and worth experience!!!",4,2013,06,07
205,Sheer Class !,"""Four Seasons""..........enough said ! Our sincerest thanks to all staff members, you are the best ! Thanks also to the Indigo (?) drivers for their invaluable help, stories and professionalism in getting us to where we needed to be.",5,2013,06,06
205,Luxury!,"Loved my stay here - they couldn't do enough for us. We were lucky to get a corporate rate, which was quite a bit cheaper. The room was absolutely beautiful . Huge bed. The TV was massive - probably too big for me, but I know people love that! The breakfast was really nice - I ordered mine freshly cooked from the kitchen - but my husband took the one which was self-service and it certainly wasn't as nice.",5,2013,06,05
205,"Once again, the Four Seasons does it best","Service, decor and attention to detail were exceptional.  A lovely room, quite large by European standards.  We arrived in the morning and were shown to our room right away.  This was the quietest hotel I've ever stayed in.  They have a wonderful brunch also.  About a 50 minute walk from city center, but a delightful walk.  Also an easy cab ride and the Dart is just steps away from the hotel.",5,2013,06,05
205,Great Four Seasons Property,"We got the stay 3 pay for two deal and this turned out to be a super value and great hotel. The Junior Suite was very large. The Spa was lovely, my son had a massage. The bar, restaurant and surroundings were well appointed in the classic Four Seasons style. Comfortable, pleasant and not too far from the sites, I recommend this hotel during your next stay in Dublin.",5,2013,06,02
205,excellent property,Lovely stay of three days... The concierge steered us to two walking distance restaurants that were quite good. The rooms are plush and the bar elegant. Loved it. A fairly costly cab ride of 20 euros each way is the norm.,5,2013,06,01
205,Beautiful and elegant,"I completely love this hotel and return as often as I can, It's very relaxing and quaint. The staff are very professional and the concierge is brilliant at his job.

The hotel lobby is fantastic, very grand with beautiful flowers and welcoming staff. The door men are really lovely and greetings go without saying. This hotel is purely for leisure, sitting in the tea room with friendly and professional staff, with the pianist playing is blissful.

This hotel has a wonderful spa and swimming pool, the Jacuzzi is amazing for your back. I love coming to this hotel for this reason. 

On return to this hotel, I usually arrive in my room with a welcome back card and a fresh bowl of fruit, or some chocolates, either way, I'm happy! I stay in a junior suite room, furnished to 5* style, the layout is perfect and I couldnt ask for much more. Rooms a beautifully decorated and have l'occitane amenities, bath robes and slippers which are all my favourite!

Great hotel and look forward to returning soon.",5,2013,05,31
205,Worst Breakfast Of Any Hotel-Have Eaten Better at Best Western,"The food experience at this hotel was miserable. I've stayed at several Four seasons and Ritz-Carltons, and the breakfast at this hotel was awful. They should be embarrassed. Their continental buffet consists of 3 fruits, a few breads, some pastries, a very small charcuterie board, and some cereals. Again, very comparable to a Best Western breakfast. For even more money, you can upgrade to a 'hot' buffet which is the continental buffet and your choice of 4 hot selections which included: under cooked eggs, ham, sausage, and potatoes were awful. 
Most hotels of this level will allow you to order anything off of the menu with the price of your breakfast. Not this hotel. If you'd also like to order a menu item to complement your undercooked eggs, you'll pay full pop.

Despite the breakfast experience, my husband and i decided to have a snack in the restaurant this afternoon. My husband ordered a milkshake which took 35 minutes. Yes, 35 minutes! The waitress was very sweet and apologized 'for the delay' but she should have followed up her apology with comping the milkshake. The milkshake was also dissappointing. Perhaps they are different in Ireland but it wasn't of an icecream consistency. It was like a glass of chocolate milk. The consistency was no different than a glass of milk. they should be embarrassed with the food service at this hotel.

the rest of the hotel is beautiful, the staff friendly and the rooms clean but seriously, save your money in the restaurants. A 5 minute walk will find you many great breakfast, lunch and dinner options.",1,2013,05,31
205,"Four Seasons, what else is there to say.","Four Seasons, what else is there to say....the lounge is great, the food is great, the rooms were spectacular, but the location is a bit outside the city center, probably a 20 minute walk or so. The staff was very helpful as well.",5,2013,05,31
205,Fantastic Stay,"We stayed at the four seasons on the last leg of our Irish journey.   As with any four seasons I’ve had the pleasure of staying at, we were welcomed graciously and my husband and I made full use of the spa and pool facilities and the bar.  The staff was very nice and helpful.  I called room service to request an iron and asked if they could find bubble wrap for me, and they did.  The room was lovely and classic, but modern at the same time.  A few minor comments…during our lunch at the bar, which was fantastic, I requested mustard for my sandwich.  When no one brought it after about 5 minutes, I had to go and flag someone down to make the request again.  By the time it arrived, my husband was finished with his lunch and had to wait on me to start mine.  The jacuzzi was out of service, which we were disappointed in.  For our Iast dinner in Ireland, my husband and I were looking for a simple but fantastic meal.  Nothing fancy, just good food.  I made this request of the concierge and they recommended a bistro called Rolys in walking distance of the hotel.  The food was fine, the service was horrible.  They left us waiting at our table for 20 minutes, lost our drink order several times and after we declined dessert and waited another 20 minutes, I had to get up from my chair and find someone to bring our check.  It was not the experience I was looking for to end our trip and I was disappointed the four seasons would recommend such a place.  Otherwise, I love this hotel and will be back.",4,2013,05,29
205,Great Hotel,"The hotel rooms are great and great ! Big, spacious rooms with very good quality. The staff and service is very qualified also.The only thing is that its located a little far from the city which is about 7 euros distance with taxi though.",5,2013,05,28
205,Fantastic Four Seasons,"We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The rooms are large and extremely comfortable. You can spend time relaxing in an armchair and enjoying the view out to the leafy suburb of Dublin. The bathroom is one of the largest we have ever enjoyed at a hotel with lovely l'occitane toiletries. The beds ensure a restful nights sleep.
The whole hotel offers a high standard of service with a beautiful lounge and reasonable bar prices.
The only downside for us was that breakfast wasn't included and at euro 28.50 per person we felt obliged to opt out. They could also make better use of the space in the lounge with additional seating, we found it impossible to get a seat although we did stay at a busy weekend.",5,2013,05,27
205,Mixed Feelings,"Having stayed at a lot of Four Seasons before we didn't hesitate to stay here again on the last leg of our Ireland road trip.  We arrived late, 10pm, we let them know we would be arriving late on our reservation.  When we pulled up there was a gentleman standing at the desk outside and her literally looked at us, he never came over.  My husband got out and went to check us in, he came back to the car where I was waiting and we started to take out luggage out ourselves and the guy finally came over and asked if we were checking in.  It was so strange.  We then went to the room where another younger gentleman actually brought the bags us and was super nice and friendly.  The room was very nice, waht you expect from a four seasons, comfy bed, nice shower and seperate tub, all very clean.  I called down and asked for non-feather pillows and housekeeping was very prompt bring them up.
We went down to the lounge to get something to eat and had very good soups and sandwiches.  It was pricey, but you have to remember you are at the Four Seasons.
We drove into town as we had to get our luggage replaced as the airline had damaged it on the way in, but the walk seems ok, a tad bit far especially if you are going to be walking around all day sightseeing. We ordered room service for the other 2 nights we were there and it was excellent.  Hot and fresh and delicious, and the young man who delivered it was great too.
We left at 5am for a flight so carried our own bags out.  The positives to this hotel was that there was free parking in a self park lot, very nice and the rooms were quiet, clean and comfortable.  The negative was the staff, with the exception of a few mentioned, they were all a bit snooty.  It just did not make you feel very comfortable walking through the lobby and that is why we ordered room service twice.  Also wi-fi was $25 a day.  I think that is the craziest thing that upper end hotels make you pay for it and all of the other smaller ones we stayed at around Ireland didn't.  I realize this is the case at most Four Seasons, Ritz, etc but I think they need to relax this policy.  
The hotel has an ironing board, haridryer and safe.",4,2013,05,27
205,Amazing,"This hotel is amazing - kids get their own cookies with their names iced onto them when the enter the room, at easter there is a kids club going on(although the kids club is aimed more toward younger kids). The pool is lovely, so is staff, and food, as well as the rooms being really nice and clean! The Location is the only down side of the hotel you have to either walk 20-30minutes from the hotel to get to the center or pay €10 for a taxi, or get the DART. I really recomend this hotel and will definetly stay here again if I come to dublin again.",5,2013,05,26
205,fabulous!,"Our stay in the Four Seasons was exceptional, from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. We were very pleased that out room was ready for an early morning arrival, always a pleasant surprise. The staff could not have been nicer or more congenial - concierge, wait staff, front desk, valets - all so friendly & helpful. We were upgraded to a junior suite that was very spacious & comfortable with a modern bathroom. And as a bonus there are a number of excellent restaurants within short, easy walking distance of the hotel.",5,2013,05,25
205,A true Five Star,"Several hotels on our Aer Lingus package were rated with many stars, but the four seasons was  the best of the best.  From arrival to departure were were welcomed in a professional manner.
A complete business center was a plus.  Valet car parking was very quick and easy.  The front desk gave accurate suggestions for returning to Dublin airport the next morning.  NOTE: If you use a GPS, coordinates are a must to find the hotel.",5,2013,05,23
205,Would go back in an instant...if we could afford it!,"Lovely hotel and close to town - 7 minutes in a taxi or a nice, flat walk. Stunning rooms, gorgeous bed sheets and because it was our anniversary we were upgraded to a suite. Spa was lovely and tranquil. Male member of staff working on Sunday morning was very helpful and brought us tea to the poolside. Fresh fruit, drinks, mags and snacks all free at spa.
Only negatives were no kettle/tea and coffee in the room and wifi is only free in the downstairs lobby - you have to pay for it in each room. Staff were friendly and room was cleaned perfectly.
Good service at front desk and concierge were helpful.",4,2013,05,22
205,dublin experience,"If visiting the RDS,it is so handy,and will give you a 1st class hotel experience. We enjoyed our stay very much..During our stay I sampled the pool and enjoyed a pre-breakfast swim. The friendly service throughout the hotel.lives up to its star rating. The opportunity to park your car in the hotel grounds",5,2013,05,22
205,highly recommended in Dublin,"We, a family of four, stayed in two interconnected rooms (one premium and one deluxe). The experience from concierge opening the car door to closing it with a smile as we left was excellent. The staff were very professional yet naturally pleasant. Any and all questions were answered knowledgably and with a smile. Dining room staff were especially helpful, our eleven year old announced that she would like to move in permanently. Rooms were excellent.",5,2013,05,22
205,Very nice...,"We stayed two nights at this lovely hotel while we were visiting Ireland.  It's a good location if you have a vehicle.  We ate most of our meals at the hotel and walked to a near by pub to sample the Guinness.  The food was excellent, however the service at the restaurant and bar had a lot to be desired.  Maybe it's just Europe, but it was hard to get a server to serve us and then after our meal we couldn't get anyone to give us our check!  We would have order a dessert and another drink, but we couldn't catch our server.  It didn't appear to look all that busy...this happened on more than one occasion.",5,2013,05,21
205,Good but not top notch for a Four Seasons,"One expects a Four Seasons hotel to be truly top of the line-in rooms, in service, and in food. The Dublin, Ireland Four Seasons is a nice hotel, but does not measure up to the Four Seasons mark. While everything seems (and for the most part is) nice, the true Four Seasons touch that  distinquishes this hotel chain seems to be missing here. Rooms and public areas are nice but not sufficiently different than other luxury hotels. Service is fine but again not uniquely distinquishable. And the dining experience is just average-both in food quality and ambiance. One senses that the hotel has decided its clientele is the conference meeting crowd (or the sporting crowd as there is a nearby stadium) and has pushed down the normal Four Seasons experience to match. We did not feel special in this hotel as we usually do in staying at a Four Seasons.",4,2013,05,20
205,Sheer Class from the minute you arrive,"Unfortunately this was only an overnight stay, only wish it had been longer.
From the minute you drive to the door you are treated the way you would want to be. Your bags are removed from the boot of the car and whisked away, valet parking so no need to worry about the car. Check in was fast and very efficient. As we walked along the corridor to the room our bags were arriving behind us.
Lovely room and very, very quiet even though the hotel was fairly busy.
Breakfast the next morning was all you would expect from a 5 star hotel.
I never like to single out any single staff member at any hotel as they all do what at times must be a difficult job depending on the customer.
But is was  nice touch to be greeted by the concierge on the Sunday morning by name and asked if we had enjoyed our stay so far - nice.
It`s not inexpensive but it want cheaper go across the road to Bewley`s, but there is no comparison",5,2013,05,20
205,Exsquisite,"Totally luxury from the moment you walk in, service is second to none.  didn't have a chance to eat there but will certainly ensure we do next time.  Cocktails served in the lounge are fabulous!  The staff are attentive beyond the call of duty - whilst it is a bit on the pricey side I can recommend this for a romantic break!  Be careful with the mini-bar - the best one I've ever seen in a hotel room!!",5,2013,05,17
205,Amazing. Perhaps the finest service available anywhere.,"It's a Four Seasons, so you can't go wrong. Room? Kept impeccably clean, with any clothes left in the room either folded or hanging in the closet. Food? The best in Ireland and ranks with the best anywhere. And unlike the thin mattresses European's seem to love for some reason, deep comfortable beds American style, with complete fresh linen daily. Huge flat screen TV with all channels, including American. Pricey? Well, yes. But....
We flew out of JFK on an overnighter. Very bad weather was forecast, and for those who've flown out of JFK, if someone sneezes in Queens - flights get delayed for hours, I planned on it. But the flight mysteriously departed on-time. Heavy tailwind on the flight as well. Landed early. No hour and half thru Irish Customs either - more like 5 minutes. Long story short, we're standing outside a cold, blustery Dublin Airport - at 4:30 a.m.. What to do? Where to go? Check in is at 3 p.m.. We took a taxi to the hotel, what other choice was there? It's a luxury hotel, we figured they'd take our bags and we'd exhaustedly do - well whatever. Basically wait. When we arrived at the hotel, at something like 5 a.m., the Assistant Manager, Mr. Alan McGrath, greeted us with the Four Seasons smile, and no problem at all, ""Your room is ready sir, no need to worry about the check-in time"". We were asleep within minutes, and truly enjoyed our Dublin stay.
So while pricey, you get what you pay for. Stayed for three nights, and wish we had more time to enjoy the many amenities at the hotel. The pool and spa looked great. The bartenders, wait staff, in fact the entire hotel staff were consummate professionals. 
While not in the center of Dublin, it's a 25 minute walk to the city center, or a five minute cab ride. We met people who stayed in hotels in the city center, and the pub scene is, well - shall we say exuberant, perhaps a little too exuberant when it comes to wanting some relaxing time. 
Spend the extra few bucks and experience Dublin staying at a fine hotel with a fine staff.",5,2013,05,13
205,Everything a luxury hotel should be,"This hotel did everything right. We arrived early in the morning, after an exhausting red-eye flight from the US. We went straight to the hotel, expecting to hang out in the lobby until our room was ready. We were amazed that the manager was able to get us into our room even though it was 6 hours before our official check-in time. The room itself was wonderful:  large room, comfortable bed, and spacious bath area. But the best feature was the staff. They continually went out of their way to accommodate our every desire. During our entire stay we were greeted by name, and always with a smile. The manger who checked us in inquired about our visit when we saw him a couple of days later.The day before we were leaving, we were looking for a book on Dublin but hadn’t been able to find anything that worked for us in town. The hotel gift shop was closed, but the manager opened it for us, so we could buy one last gift before we headed home. That type of service leaves a great impression. We were also thrilled with the selection in the lobby restaurant – and enjoyed both afternoon tea and post-dinner whiskey there.",5,2013,05,10
205,One of the best hotels in Ireland,"Absolutely fabulous hotel. I could not fault anything at all. I travel a lot and have stayed in so many hotels and must admit that this one was truly excellent.

Full credit should go to all staff that work tirelessly to make everyone welcome and comfortable.

Location is good. Not too central, however, it is not necessarily a bad thing. There is a complimentary transport provided for all guests should you wish to visit cental Dublin. Totally unexpected and rather delightful feature.

Food was excellent and very enjoyable.

Rooms are comfortable, spacious and well appointed. Beds are just amazing! 

I would recommend this hotel to anyone without any hesitation at all.",5,2013,05,09
205,Did not impress unfortunately,"We booked the 4 Seasons Dublin as part of our honeymoon, and had high hopes for this special indulgence, but it was far the best hotel we stayed at. Check-in was slow and plagued by poor communication, but at least we had the opportunity to use the lobby computer during the delay. The major plus was that they had a small treat tray waiting for us in the room upon arrival, as well as provided airplane amenities packs upon request. Aside from that we found the price very high for the results of both the room and the restaurant (although the breakfast buffet was the exception). We didn't even sleep well as the air conditioner seemed to be broken. Upon check-out we mentioned this but the guest services manager wasn't interested. Would not recommend this Four Seasons option. Hotel location is also quite far from downtown.",3,2013,05,09
205,Pure luxury,"It is exactly what you expect from a fabulous Four Seasons Hotel.  Wonderful staff, beautiful hotel, superbly run.  Everyone is so friendly and the service impeccable.  A bit of luxury.  Food is delicious and beautifully delivered.  The only thing to note is that it is not in the centre of town - about 10 mins out by taxi.  But Ballsbridge has many great pubs and restaurants within walking distance.",5,2013,05,09
205,Superb Hotel. Exceptional service!,"We just stayed at the hotel for a few days a few weeks ago in the executive suite. We travel to Dubai twice a year and are used to outstanding service and we will say that the staff, particularly the restuarant managers were second to none. The food in the restuarant was superb as with the cocktails, however, the menu could have been more varied but this goes for most restuarants in Ireland overall…not much Asian infusion. The room was spotless, the sheets and towels were of a 5* + standard. The only problem I found rather disappointing was the lighting….we all know that hotels now need to play their part and use energy efficient lighting but each time we looked at ourselves in the mirrors in the room we felt we looked ill (slightly green)!  The downside if you have children is there is nothing for them to do apart from swim….the hotel should create a room with a pool/games table. The spa was outstanding as with the products they use, we ended up purchasing a few but very expensive. If ever we rerturn to Ireland there would be no other hotel which we would even consider. Thankyou.",5,2013,05,08
205,Bad start - in total O.K.,"My family and I stayed at Four Seasons Dublin for three nights from December 27 - 30, 2012. I booked a junior suite (227 Euro/night) and a moderate/superior room (127 Euro/night), breakfast excluded.

A few days before arrival I got an email from Four Seasons Dublin - with a big picture of the hotel entrance showing several doormen and porters welcoming new guests - asking for special enquiries or information on an allergy against flowers.

We arrived at about 6pm on December 27, 2012 - no doorman or porter at the door! I entered the lobby and wanted to check in at the front desk (which was the concierge desk in fact, what I didn't know). Without any word the concierge pointed with his fingers to the front desk, located in an opposite room. The problem: there was no staff available. So I waited about one minute, got back to the entrance and shouted into the lobby something like ""Is there anybody responsible for arriving guests in this hotel""? Within the next minute three (!) empoyees arrived at the front desk for checking in my family and two other arriving ladies. I was a bit annoyed at this moment but the best was the first question of the receptionist: if I would like to have an upgrade from junior suite to a regular suite for xx Euro/night? Doing business as usual and no feeling for the situation, this really wasn't well trained.

We were guided to our rooms by this front office team member and met the two ladies checking in besides us in the elevator. They were lost as they were not guided by hotel staff and didn't know where to put their room cards to activate the elevator. - Needless to say that these two ladies did carry the luggage on their own as there wasn't any help offered as they said.

The rooms were fine (superior room 144, junior suite 139). Any special welcome was missing: no welcome note of the management or guest relationship, no chocolates or christmas sweets, no complimentary bottle of water or even a single flower in the bathroom (why did they ask if we are allergic against flowers and why is on every room photo on the Four Seasons web page a bunch of flowers?). The view of the superior room is shown on the picture (""ornate courtyard adjacent to the showgrounds of the Royal Dublin Society, or homes in the surrounding neighbourhood"").

The luggage transfer from front office to the rooms took about ten minutes, 15 minutes later we discovered that we got luggage from other guests. They changed the luggage within a few minutes.

Unfortunately the restauarnt was fully booked this evening and there even were no seats available for hotel guests before 9pm. So we decided to start with the soup in the room and booked the table at 9pm. Roomservice was fine but bad luck continued as the waiter lost a big bottle of water in the room and housekeeping had to remove the glass with a vacuum cleaner afterwards.

So I complained that night at the reservation department by email. Next morning I got a nice call from the front office manager and they find a nice way to apologize. From that moment on everything was O.K. - really not breathtaking but solid service one expects in a luxury hotel.",3,2013,05,04
205,What's Not to Like?,"This is a great place to stay.  Every detail is excellent.  The bathroom was especially spacious and elegant.  There is absolutely nothing not to like.  However, two things which absolutely stood out for me were the complimentary transport via BMW and a very friendly driver into the city center and the menu at the lounge.  The cheese, fruit, and bread board I ordered was a nice change.  We stayed here at the end of our trip, and I was excited to see this choice on the menu.  It was very substantial and beautifully served.  The business center is also first rate.",5,2013,05,04
205,It was very relaxing and it is true 5*,"I really loved my stay with Four Seasons. I can not seem to fault anything with the hotel, maybe location(not too central), but not too bad.
Very personalised service, little note from the manager and a nice touch to have some complimentary chocolate on arrival. I had a junior suite which was great, but I am sure other rooms are fine too.
Everyone is trying to help and being very courteous.
Stayed one night only an did not have a chance to use hotel's pool or gym.
Definitely would not mind staying again!",5,2013,05,02
205,A fine 5+ Star hotel,"Everything that you would expect from a Four Seasons Hotel. I've stayed in a few Four Seasons around the world. The Ballsbridge hotel keeps the good name and reputation of the group intact. 

My wife got a shock when we entered our room to find a small but lovely birthday cake..I'd made a remark when booking and the receptionist arranged this complimentary surprise. Nice touch.

Loads of different good quality restaurants within easy walking distance and right next door to the RDS exhibition centre.

Dublin is expensive and so is the Four Seasons, but occasionally a little bit of luxury and spoiling yourself is good.",4,2013,04,30
205,Phenomenal,We stayed one night at this lovely hotel.  The staff were quite helpful and the hotel beautiful.  It was walking distance to pubs and restaurants.  Parking was easy and not too far from the airport. We would recommend to anyone.  The bed was a bit too firm for my preference but ok to firm lovers.,4,2013,04,28
205,A Class Operation,"April 19, Check-in professional and efficient with some excellent ""on selling"" with an upgrade to a suite. Hotel is in excellent condition as are the room(s) (358), immaculately clean and well stocked.  Bathrooms excellent and a good range of products. The hotel  position relative to the DART [light rail] station  is close but no train noise. Noise level on 3rd floor non-existent and no noise from adjoining rooms. Appreciated the shoe cleaning service over night.
Staff were very  helpful, professional and positive about the product. Room service  was efficient and the food was  well presented. Well organised taxi system,  all cabs were clean and with  cheerful drivers. The hotel limo service to the city centre operated only during the afternoon. Price of a taxi TO theairport was  around the 32-35 Euro's with price varying according to the time of travel. The only thing annoying issue was the"" add on"" charge for the basic internet connection. Bit tacky for a hotel of such quality; should be ""free"" or added into the room tarrif.
I rate the Four Seasons on a par with Hotel Widder in Zurich and when the price differential is considered then the Four Seasons, Dublin is ahead.",5,2013,04,26
205,Outstanding,"Just had a wonderful time at the Four Seasons Dublin.The staff were all superb from check in to the time we had to leave .Cannot wait to return to Dublin.Food was superb , all in all could not fault the hotel if you are planning a trip to Dublin then this is a must.
bye the way afternoon tea in our opinion was better than the Ritz",5,2013,04,23
205,Excellent place to stay in Dublin!,"This is an exceptional property to stay at in Dublin. Like all the Four Seasons I have stayed at the experience was outstanding. We stayed here the first day we were in Dublin and then finished up here our last 3 nights. I would recommend this hotel to everyone.

Pros:
- Great staff that provides exceptional level of service. They focus on the little details like going out of the way to make sure our stay is rememberable. They have a ""Treasure Chest"" full of chocolate euros fro kids when you check in and they gave my daughter a balloon. They also have stairs they pull out so she could see over the front counter. She loved it.
- Food in the restaurant / bar / lounge area is great. We found ourselves eating here often.
- Parking was free!
- Close walk to several restaurants and convenience stores.
- Its a 30 to 40 min walk to Grafton Street or a 5 min Taxi ride that cost 10 - 13 Euros.
- Next to RDS if you are going to an event.
- Super comfortable bed and pillows
- They provide L'OCCITANE products for the bathroom
- Quiet and relaxing 

Cons:
- GPS can not find hotel. Here is the Long and Lat    53.326231,  -6.225392
- Retrieving car in AM can be challenging as the hotel hosts many conferences. It keeps the door men busy.
- It is a little far from ""Center City"" but it was not that much of an issue. Take a walk it is a great way to enjoy the city.",5,2013,04,21
205,The best hotel to stay in Dublin,"We love four seasons properties and this one is our favorite. We have stayed a number of times and it is always a special experience. 
This is a great place for breakfast or lunch and the food is consistently wonderful, the coffee is great and the staff are friendly.
The rooms are beautiful and graceful. We have had a number of lovely dinners in them with our family and friends.
The spa and pool are relaxing and peaceful as well as beautifully appointed. 
Children are always welcome here and the staff genuinely enjoy them. 
The car to the city is always available, so no problem being in Ballsbridge, which is a great place to be, anyway.
Christmas here is really special.",5,2013,04,15
205,From a Travel Writer - Great Residential Location in Dublin,"We arrived in Dublin very early, excited that our first stop was a comfortable bed at the Four Seasons Hotel Dublin. Sleeping on a plane is always difficult for me, but on this trip, I found it impossible. All the Advil PM in the world wouldn’t have helped and I was exhausted. My adrenaline was about to override my sleepiness, though, as my husband tried his hand at driving on the right side of the car on the wrong side of the road.

ARRIVAL

I shouldn’t have worried as David is good at everything (including driving), and we arrived very near to the hotel without a problem. The GPS (as usual) didn’t quite hit the mark, but soon we were rounding the corner to a stately hotel with lovely landscaping. The hotel is in a residential district surrounded by beautiful homes. The sun was just rising and the green land was becoming more vivid by the minute as we pulled up to the entry. A quiet front desk agent waited in the quiet lobby with a genuine greeting. Check-in took about a minute and we were soon shown to our deluxe suite.

ROOMS

I didn’t properly see the room until I awoke nearly five hours later, well into the afternoon, but rested. The bed was heaven. David and I toured our enormous room and admired the view into the courtyard while we planned the day. I did a double-take when I saw a man sleeping on a park bench in the garden. This just isn’t something you normally see at a luxury hotel! My husband laughed and pointed out that the newspaper over the man’s face didn’t move in the breeze – it was a statue. In Irish fashion, the statues that surround the hotel are ironic and a little irreverent. I wish we had more of that in our stuffy country!

DINING

Good news - Irish hotels usually include a full Irish breakfast in the room rate! Our first morning in Ireland, we were treated to a wonderful spread of potatoes, meat, yogurt and fruit. I felt pretty adventurous and tried black and white pudding, an Irish tradition. The food was so filling, we didn’t eat again until dinner on Grafton Street. 

BEYOND ROOMS

It is here that I normally talk about the spa, lounge and grounds. Unfortunately, our time was short and mostly spent in the spacious room and in Dublin. We did get the chance to take the hotel car service to town, driven by a wonderful gentleman who gave us a fantastic introduction to Dublin and general tour of the nearby embassies. I’m sorry to say the U.S. Embassy is an architectural embarrassment of epic proportions, so don’t get your hopes up in that regard.

Our driver took us to what he declared was the best shopping in Ireland on Grafton Street. He was spot on! The first place we stopped was a book shop. I am thrilled to be the only American I know who owns a copy of Marian Keyes’ book, The Mystery of Mercy Close, (besides my sis, who got it as a souvenir from us). It was thrilling to get a book in Ireland that is not yet available in the U.S! Other stores on this street include the famous European stores Brown Thomas and Top Shop. Our hard and fast rule – we don’t waste time in stores and restaurants we can visit at home. Vacation time is too short for that. 

MY RECOMMENDATION

This hotel is perfect if you like a place with a residential feel, but still want to be close to city life. The beds are wonderful and the deluxe suites have a ton of space.",4,2013,04,15
205,As you would expect,"Just what you would expect from a Four Seasons.  Wonderful bedlinen, good large room and bathroom, very friendly staff and for once i was able to us the beautiful spa.  I shouldn't complain given i am fortunate to be able to stay in places like this but the one flip side of being what you would expect is that you could be absolutely anywhere in the world.  ",5,2013,04,12
205,Lovely hotel well worth a visit,"Went with my hubby for two nights.  Overall a beautiful hotel worthy of its five star rating.  Beautiful room.  Huge bed with georgeous bed linen, feather and down pillows and quilts that were starched white.   Really nice friendly staff and no snobbish elements which I loathe from some other five star hotels I have stayed in. Highly recommend to all.. A tad expensive.",5,2013,04,11
205,Good experience,"The room was good and confortable, no breakfast. The bar is nice.

A beautiful experience.The bathroom was very big and the shower and jacuzzi was so relax. In the hotel you can find a very good spa,is a little expensive, but perfect if you want to visit Dublin.",4,2013,04,08
205,Beautiful opulent hotel,Top class service. Nice rooms. Had a couple of drinks in ice bar but very quiet so went into town for drinks and dinner. Very clean. Beautiful bathrooms. It's expensive but you would expect that from a hotel of this standard.,4,2013,04,08
205,Lovely hotel but disappointing light lunch in lounge area,"Visiting the Four Seasons hotel in Dublin is usually a great experience but unfortunately not that great today. Had a light lunch in the lounge area and while the service was as charming and professional as always, the quality of the food was not what I have come to expect.",5,2013,04,07
205,Very Good Restaurant,"We had such a delicious dinner in the Four Seasons Restaurant, I was very happily surprised as I never expect much from hotel dining rooms.  Lovely fresh prawns and excellent beef coupled with first class service.  A real treat!",5,2013,04,06
205,Simply Superb!,"We have stayed at four other hotels in Dublin before.  After staying at the Four Seasons I will ALWAYS stay here when I am in Dublin.  It is so far better than the others.  Rooms were super spacious (we had a suite), and well equipped.  Bathrooms spotlessly clean and ultra modern.  People were friendly and made our stay so memorable.  Love the lobby and the wonderful rose bud vase arrangements.",5,2013,04,03
205,gorgeous but no tea/coffee making facilities,"This is a beautiful calm and warm hotel and i have stayed in a few four seasons this probably the best yet.  However upon checkin and discovering we were celebrating our anniversay and indeed my recovery from a serious illness having recently had surgery we were offered an upgrade but then were ask to pay 90 euro per night I would have thought a hotel of this calibre could give customers a free upgrade on this occasion as we never ask for one in the first place.  another issue for me was sometimes in life it is nice to be able to go to your room and make a cup of coffee especially if like ,me you drink about a dozen a day but no i was expected to pay 5-6 euro for a coffee served by the hotel this was very dissapointing . The hotel staff are lovely and polite the breakfast was amazing the restaurant served beautiful food all in all a first class hotel  the spa is excellent and well run even though the water machine had not iced water but loads of jugs of fresh water, fruit and pastries in am we will return to the hotel and who knows we might get that complimentary upgrade will keep you posted.",4,2013,04,03
205,"A wonderful stay at the Four Season's Hotel, Dublin","I had the pleasure of staying at the Four Season’s Hotel Dublin during St Patrick’s week. It was just a really wonderfully relaxing break. I couldn’t begin to thank Mr Coveney, the concierge team, restaurant staff and all the staff who interacted with us enough. They made our stay so very personal and pleasant and made us feel so relaxed and pampered.
From being collected at the train station until our return home we revelled in luxury and being so pampered. Our food was delicious; the suite spotless and welcoming; the staff members warm, friendly and so obliging. Nothing was too much trouble.
A sincere big thank you to Tony Coveney and all the wonderful team at the Four Season’s – we had a ball!
Mervyn & Stephen",5,2013,04,03
205,Everything you expect from top hotel,"My family and i stayed there recently. The staff was excellent and always helpful.  Each morning I went down to the spa where they have a large and well equipped exercise room and an indoor pool and jacuzzi. The staff was very pleasant each morning. The breakfast was great. They had a continental buffet that included a great selection of fruit, breads, cereal, meats and smoked salmon. The mango juice was great.  The rooms were very large with large bath areas as well. The furniture in and decor of the rooms were top of the line. The lounges were also nice in the lobby. There was nothing to complain about. 

The hotel itself is away from downtown but only a short 10 minute cab ride to trinity college. There are several pubs about a 5-10 minute walk. We tried the the horse show house and crowes which are close by. We also ate a restaurant called roast which sits over crowes pub. You can go upstairs or order in the crowes pub. They feature a roast of the day that was great that we had in the pub.  So good we went to the restaurant itself the next night. ",5,2013,04,03
205,Very nice stay,"We enjoyed our stay at the four seasons and the food, the rooms slightly let it down as had old box Tv's and slightly dated rooms! All in all though a good hotel with a luxurious feel.

Car parking is handy and not too far from amenities, very handy for RDS or match days!",4,2013,04,02
205,Fantastic,"Just back from hotel. We have stayed there on a few occasions but I can honestly say this visit was out of this world. We had our four year old with us. The staff there especially in the kids club made our daughter sophie so welcome. Thank you Laura!!.
The conceirge are the most helpful, polite and friendly staff I have ever come across....even down to entertaining our daughter...
THANK YOU all for an incredible two days.
Looking forward to returning.",5,2013,04,01
205,Superb!,"I had the pleasure of staying in this hotel for a couple of nights. 

The rooms are fantastic, very well-equipped, wonderful beds, wonderful bathrooms, and one of the few hotels sporting large flatscreen TVs with a good selection of English TV channels (this is generally rare in Europe).

Housekeeping in this hotel, is the best I have ever experienced, and I travel a lot. Attention to detail was just astounding. It's those little things that make the experience memorable. For example, I brought a bottle of vodka and left in on the night stand. When I came back to my room in the evening, the bottle was in an ice-bucket, with two glasses, and lemon slices, ready to go. The personalized welcome card waiting for me in the room; my pile of dirty clothes put on top of a laundry bag - really, very impressive.

The hotel itself is well equipped, and this includes the restaurant. The food is very good, in fact I had the best meals during my stay in Dublin, at this restaurant. 

The only negative was the poor service in both the bar and restaurant, which was unbearably slow. Additionally, if views count, I got unlucky with a view of a construction yard next door to the hotel.

This hotel has smoking rooms available.",4,2013,03,31
205,Top Class,"Dublins Four Seasons is exactly what you would expect from a five star hotel, attentive service, good ambiance, good food and superb location. It is a little bit out of town but still close to all amenities, it has a great lobby area that city centre hotels generally don't have. While it can be expensive i would recommend it for any visit for any group of travellers.",5,2013,03,30
205,Highly recommended if you don't need to stay in the city centre,"My first time in Dublin since 1994 and my first stay in the Four Seasons. I was somewhat lost at the airport given the host of bus connections available... but after some time I figured it out: You need to take the AIRCOACH service towards Donnybrook, it has a stop in  Ballsbridge/Simmonscourt Road very close to the hotel. However the ride takes approximately 1h so I decided to go for a taxi (there is no train). Cost was about 25 EUR and I arrived at the hotel about 20 mins later.
The hotel looks unspectacular from the outside but very decent once you stepped in. To the left is the Concierge (I tried to check in there, they will point you to reception which is on the right). I got a very warm welcome and was explained all amenities of the hotel. There is a Spa and a Jacuzzi so make sure you bring some swimming gear (unfortunately I didn't). I had a standard room which was a bit more spacious than standard rooms in London but other than that typical 4 star hotel style. I know the Four Seasons is 5 star - so what makes up the difference? A huge flat screen TV with a full range of satellite programmes and a spacious marble bathroom with full shower pressure. Mini bar is pricey, unfortunately there are no free soft drinks or snacks.
You can walk into city centre (about 30 mins, get a map from the Concierge). Apparently there is a train station nearby but as it was pouring I opted for a taxi again (10 EUR - affordable). Back in the hotel I had a final Guinness at the hotel bar, very nice atmoshpere with a large fire place. Just sit and relax and watch the flames.
I went for breakfast the next morning. It is served in a very nice room (one might even say saloon given its size) with large windows facing the garden. Buffet range is decent, you can also order a la carte. I'm a fan of English breakfast and quickly learnt the differences to the Irish breakfast: with the latter one doesn't get beans and the scrambled eggs are refined with cream. Other than that - very tasty. Try out the freshly squeezed fruit juices.
There is no real fault with this hotel, I would highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't need to stay in the city centre. The staff is friendly and competent and in no way condescending (happened to me in other top hotels - I'm not the suit wearing type).",4,2013,03,27
205,St Patricks weekend,"Attentive staff, comfortable rooms, overall a quality experience. All this on a St. Paddy's day weekend. Sterling experience. Highly recommend it. even got 3 nights for the price of two on St. Paddy's weekend.",5,2013,03,27
205,Best Hotel Stay in a Long Time,"The Four Seasons in Dublin really delivered on its reputation. Top-notch service during check-in, a clean and comfortable room with a beautiful bathroom, and excellent treatment from the staff throughout our two night stay. The business centre and wifi available in the lobby met our needs for staying in touch and planning our sightseeing excursions, and the concierge provided helpful recommendations. Moreover, the room was extremely quiet - I've often taken it for granted that staying at a hotel means dealing with some unavoidable hallway and adjacent room noise, but we enjoyed a totally silent night's sleep. Breakfast was excellent. We had a great time while we were here - the only caveat is that there isn't much in the area, and the train into town is a 5-7 minute walk away. Nevertheless, would gladly stay here again. Thanks to the staff for a wonderful experience!",5,2013,03,26
205,Great St Paddy's Day stay,"Attentive staff, comfortable rooms, overall a quality experience.  All this on a St. Paddy's day weekend.  Sterling experience.  Highly recommend it.  even got 3 nights  for the price of two on St. Paddy's weekend.  WOW!",5,2013,03,26
205,Unhappy experience,"My Husband and I stayed in Four Seasons Hotel Dublin in March 2013 This hotel is rated 5 star. Staff were extremely curtious and helpfull. We had not stayed in a 5 star hotel before and really looked forward to it. On entering the room there was no ""WOW"" factor at all. It was clean and fesh. The bathroom was the best part pf it. The mattress was very soft as were the pillows. All seemed to require an upgrade. The curtains are very shabby,definaely need replacement. No teasmade available. I have to say I have stayed in far better ""B&B's""Price WITHOUT breakfast is 195Euro Per Person sharing. Breakfast price is ave. 18 Euro  Very expensive and disappointing stay.",3,2013,03,25
205,Absolute comfort,"I stayed at this hotel for a few days to attend a Facebook-conference in Dublin.

The hotel is luxurious, comfortable, and impressive. The rooms are clean, and large. Everything is just comfort, comfort, comfort. Even at the public bathrooms, you dry your hands on real towels!

The beds were great, our room was fitted with a comfy chair, and a dining table.

This is the most luxurious hotel experience of my life so far!",5,2013,03,25
205,Outstanding,Stayed at the four seasons on my last trip and decided to stay at the Conrad this time.  Wish I had not bothered to change anything. Four seasons is the top hotel in Ireland. Don't bother going anywhere else,5,2013,03,21
205,Beautiful and Comfortable,"This is a very elegant and comfortable hotel.  Rooms, spa, food, service, all wonderful.  Would love to come back. Especially enjoyed the tea room, pool and room service.  All staff wonderfully accommodating.  Lovely residential location.",5,2013,03,18
205,Amazing hotel,"This is my second time to stay at the hotel within the last 9 months and wow it has not let me down. I had a one night stay this time around with my mother, staff were so helpful and courteous they could not have been any better. Facilities were fantastic, bedrooms were lovely. I would have no hesitations of recommending hotel to family and friends, I am already looking forward to my next stay.",5,2013,03,17
205,outstanding,"just returned from dublin after a splendin evening in the four seasons restaurant. frm the time you are greeted you are made to feel ectremely special, the resturant manageres very welcoming and then the staf in the restaurant were just superb, special thanks to the lovely jj also the amazing funny efficient michela, she was a real tonic, permanent smile nothing fazed her she was just great...we also met david in the bar, john in rstaurant  who was great....one feels very special leaving four seasons and that is so important...last but by no means the food was divine to say the least....the only tiny thing i would change is please bring back the linen table cloths ...so much nicer...but overall a 5 star night . barbara holloway crosshaven cork",5,2013,03,16
205,Great hotel.,I stay here a few times a year. I love that the rooms are so quiet and peaceful. You could walk to the city centre (abut 25  - 35 minutes) but there is plenty do around Ballsbridge (nice little bars). Te service at the Four Seasons is pretty special and that is why I remain a customer. The only time I felt let down is when I stayed there over Christmas 2011 and felt the hote was understaffed and the service was not up to its usual high standards. I am used to staying in hotels a lot and this is world class.,5,2013,03,16
205,Terrific hotel in the suburbs,"The Four Seasons is a great hotel with great service. We booked rooms with breakfast, and the breakfast was outstanding. There was a massive breakfast buffet, with a wide variety of pastries, breads, cereals, juices, and hot items. As part of the B&B package, one could also chooses items from the menu, like the typical Irish breakfast, which was excellent. 

The concierge was also excellent, as well, and was very knowledgeable about the tourist attractions in Dublin.

The rooms were huge, especially by European standards, and they were furnished with comfortable beds, chairs, and couches. Overall, the lodging experience was very comfortable.

The only drawback about the hotel was the location; however, its location in the suburbs made for a very restful break. On the other hand, the hotel was fairly far way from the town center.

We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel, and we hope to return for another visit.",4,2013,03,16
205,Luxurious hotel in a nice location,"The Four seasons Dublin is a very luxurious hotel well located on the south side of Dublin city next-door to the (RDS) Royal Dublin Showgrounds and within walking distance of Landsdowne road.
The hotel decor has been changed since we last stayed in the hotel which was over two years ago it is now quite contemporary in the open/main lounge not to our liking we preferred the traditional style which in our opinion was warmer and more welcoming.
On this occasion we stayed for two nights with bed and breakfast and we had an evening meal on our first night which I have to say was very good well presented very tasty and served in a smaller restaurant than usual after asking our waitress why the small restaurant she explained because it was Tuesday night and quiet the atmosphere in this restaurant was very good.
As usual our bedroom was the now to be expected Four Seasons standard IE pure luxury spotlessly clean beautifully furnished and with a bathroom fit for a King & Queen.
The breakfast again Four seasons best with a large selection of foods to satisfy any taste and as much as you could possibly eat served to your table by excellent staff at your beck and call at every turn round.
We had a couple of drinks each night in the bar and found the prices just a little bit higher than the normal in the area but again your paying for the surroundings and service which we didn't mind.
All and all I would highly recommend the Four seasons Dublin and hopefully we will get back someday soon.",5,2013,03,15
205,Wonderful hotel just outside an amazing city,"The Four Seasons is a great hotel.  The staff is amazing, always welcoming you and attentive to your needs and requests.  We stayed in a Jr. Suite and my wife and son thought it was the most luxurious hotel we've ever stayed in.  My son especially loved how they put a kids robe in the bathroom before our arrival.  They have an Irish story time for kids every Saturday afternoon, but because of the jet lag we missed it.  When the staff saw how disappointed my son was, they setup a separate reading time on Sunday just for him.  Jeremy, the concierge, was the reader and through the entire stay, every time he saw my son he would take the time to come over and say hi and give him a high five.  My son was so happy that he could get his own reading. It's a short walk to Ballbridge which has some very nice restaurants and just a short 10 minute taxi ride from downtown Dublin.  It's a beautiful property and if we ever come back to Dublin, we'll definitely stay here.",5,2013,03,09
205,Best hotel in Dublin,"Just back from 3 days R&R in the Four Seasons. We have stayed here on many occasions and it always lives up to expectations. The staff are so attentive and helpful, with nothing being too much trouble. Love the new decor in the lobby lounge. Bedroom/suite was stunning spotlessly clean and the breakfasts are the best anywhere in the world! The only ""small"" complaint is why do you charge for wifi so many places have free wifi and I feel if you are spending a lot of money then it should be free. Apart from the ""wifi"" we had a marvellous relaxing time and will be back very soon",5,2013,03,07
205,"Wonderful Hotel, staff, dining, location.....","Will def be back - the hotel was wonderful, staff so helpful and nice, location is perfect! Dinner in the hotel was awesome and the room itself would be worth going back for alone. Close to everything short taxi ride to the shops, pubs!",5,2013,03,02
205,Wonderful Hotel,"We just returned from 4 nights at this wonderful hotel in Ballsbridge, just outside of Dublin City Centre. This hotel is lovely. The staff are very helpful and accommodating, great gym, nice room.

It was our first time in Dublin and this hotel was a great base.

There is a wonderful indoor lap pool by the spa. I also joined some of the staff for a run on Tuesday morning. They escort guests on runs on Tuesday and Friday mornings, which is a great treat.

Although this hotel is a more business hotel, it is also very quiet and relaxing for travelers. It is a 15 minute walk to a lovely area in Ballsbridge with lots of great restaurants,  and a half hour walk or 10 minute cab ride into Dublin City centre.

The only very minor issues we had at the hotel were we had a very strange check in where we were asked how much we would be willing to pay to upgrade from our King suite (we didn't) and the coffee pods and cups in our room were not refilled from the first day so we had to order room service.",4,2013,02,27
205,Another great stay at the Four Seasons!,"The Four Seasons is renowned for service and the hotel in Dublin does not disappoint! It's great to receive the same calibre of service no matter what Four Seasons you visit throughout the world. The food is great, the room is great and the location is convenient by taxi. Will definitely stay again!",5,2013,02,27
205,Wonderful Hotel and Location in Dublin,Just spent another wonderful night in this hotel. The staff and location are perfect for a trip to Dublin. We have stayed in the Four Seasons many times and for extended periods and have always come away feeling better than when we arrived. Thanks Again !,5,2013,02,27
205,Exactly what you would expect!,"Traveled to Dublin with my husband for a work event last summer...stayed three nights in the Four Seasons and it was exactly what you would expect from a Four Seasons hotel.  The rooms were clean and had elegant. Staff was friendly and professional. Did not eat at the hotel but did have a nice experience at the bar! The only ""complaint"" I would have would be location. Hotel was a little off the beaten path; about a 20min walk into town/5 minute cab ride into the center of town.  Overall would recommend for a to resort in Dublin!",5,2013,02,24
205,Service could have been better,"I stayed here for one night in late December in a Junior Suite with my wife. The room was spacious with two large HD televisions with separate feeds. The room was large, very clean and comfortable. The bed was large and comfortable. 

Generally the staff we good and friendly, but this was let down by the breakfast service which was very poor. 

We were greeted when we came in as we were asked about tea/coffee and toast. We ended up asked twice for the tea and four times for toast which was very frustrating as everyone apologized, but did nothing. 

For the RDS this location is perfect with about a 15 minute taxi ride into the city.

Overall this is a good hotel if they could just sort out the service",4,2013,02,22
205,Numerous visits,"We have stayed in the Four Seasons many times and for extended periods.  The junior suite is really nice and the beds are comfortable and big.   The service is amazing and all the staff go out of their way to make sure you are taken care of properly.   In all my visits I have never been able to use the car service as it's been never available, which did add to the cost of getting into the city, considerably.

The pool area is small, but perfect to relax by the windows and have lunch.  Could have stayed there all day!    The food is fantastic, both in the restaurant and bar.   The bar staff are very nice, especially Keith. He really knew how to make you feel at home and made the prices worth it.   The last time I went, I did not see him or a lot of the old faces, but everyone was great.

On one of my trips, I dropped my case in my room and quickly rummaged through everything for a quick change---throwing things around the dressing room.  When I returned about 4 hours later, my shoes were all lined up, my clothes on hangers, the things I had in the bathroom put on little mats and a book mark in place of my down turned page in my book!   God, I love this hotel !    Only wish is that I could afford to go more often.  Oh, and you never know who you might see...Tina Turner was there on one trip and Jennifer Aniston another...",5,2013,02,21
205,Very relaxing few hours spent at the Four Seasons,"Had friends home from Australia and spent a few hours in the lobby area over a few drinks, the staff where very friendly and where at hand if needed, very relaxing area of the hotel, and easy parking, Thank you all.",5,2013,02,20
205,"A great place for a meeting, even better for a personal interlude.","Hotel is well located with excellent services for meetings and a delicious spa.  The staff wants to make sure you have a good time.  The rooms are spacious and well appointed.  All in all, whether on business or looking for a retreat, this is a good solution.",5,2013,02,20
205,Fansastic,"Fantastic stay, the suites are amazing. Staff are incredibly friendly and helpful and the building and decor is second to none. For such a fancy place there is a very welcoming and friendly vibe. Pretty easy getting into the city center, there are always taxis about.",5,2013,02,18
205,First time guest here and its really good !,"I have visited this city for many years and just stayed here for the first time. Excellent high Four Seasons standards and it seemed in great order throughout. The food was good but not world class but good.
.
I will certainly come. back on another visit",4,2013,02,11
205,Keeping up standards: faultless.,"It's great to see the Four Seasons in Dublin keeping up their standards despite Ireland's economic woes. I first came here in the boom times, and while the Ice Bar may not be as packed and boisterous as it was in those heady Celtic tiger days, today's service, quality and attention to detail is faultless. We had a superb room with separate living area, and it was spotless. The concierge arranged pickup from the airport, room service arrived bang on time, the courtesy car took us to the theatre, and just chilling out reading the paper in the lounge with a pint of Smithwicks was a delight.
It's not cheap, but you get what you pay for, so in terms of value for money it's spot on. What a great weekend away.
And yes, the bathroom passed my ""mould in the corners of the shower cubicle"" test, this bathroom was clinically clean.",5,2013,02,10
205,Another amazing experience,Stayed 3 nights and didn't leave the hotel. Had dinner every night and room service daily. Amazing stay with exceptionally professional staff. Will be back for the rugby. Good deals on hotels.com. In a nice part of town near the Avila stadium.,5,2013,02,09
205,"Excellent Hotel, Delivers Consistently Every Year","We have been staying at the Four Seasons Dublin since 2011, and everytime we return the Four Seasons is the place we stay at. There are a number of reasons which make it stand out from any of the other hotels in Dublin, and even though its location is less central it is still very easy to commute into the city. 

Over the past two years we have stayed in 3 room categories ranging from Superior to the spacious Juinior suite's. Although slightly dated on our last visit in August 2012 we have noticed that the lobby has been fully refurbished and the Superior room which we stayed in had also been upgraded with new furniture/LED TV. 

The Spa area and swimming pool are excellent, the staff are extremeley helpful here and the atomoshphere is very relaxing. Their is a very good gym with all of the facillities in place. 

What we most enjoy about the FS is the breakfast it is delicous and is always fantastic every time we have stayed here. Overall I would rate this as being the best hotel in Dublin and after 5 return visits, with our sixth coming up on the 16th of February there is no question that the FS Dublin always delivers.",5,2013,02,08
205,Perfect week-end,Well nothing much to say about it as the Four Seasons are all of same high standards. It is located 15 minutes away from O'Connel/ Grafton Street by taxi approx EUR 20.- The ice bar is good with lovely strawberry cocktails! was empty when we were there on a Friday night but ok for us as we were tiered from shopping! The breakfast is amazing! It's great to have a SPA after an intensive shopping session :-),5,2013,02,08
205,Quick trip to Dublin.,"Stayed in the Four Seasons last Friday night.   I have stayed here a few times now and it never fails  to live up to expectations.  For me the location was just perfect , and yet the centre of Dublin was only a few minutes away by cab.  From the moment you arrive in this hotel to the moment you leave the staff  are wonderfully  friendly and attentive.   The room was beautifully appointed,  exceptionally comfortable bed and no skimping on toiletries etc that you so often see now in supposed 5 star Holes  in Ireland these days.   Did not eat in the restaurant on this occasion , but have before and the food was outstanding.  Had in room breakfast ,  eggs benedict (  one of my favourites) , have to say  superb .   This is one of my top 3 in Dublin along with the Merrion and the Fitzwilliam. Will most definitely be back.",5,2013,02,05
205,very nice hotel,"I stayed here in january this year on business and found the hotel itself to be excellent.

Very good rooms, nice lobby, restaurants and spa.

The only quibble I had was that the bar and restaurant were very expensive and could use coming into line with restaurants around the neighbourhood",4,2013,02,03
205,Very Good Hotel BUT,"We chose the Four Seasons for our trip to Dublin because we had used the Four Seasons for 15 night trip to LA earlier in the year (there are no words to explain how good that hotel was) however we did realise that it was Dublin and not LA so expectations were not as high and in the main the hotel was very good and you could not ask for much more for the money paid and would in particular highlight the food which was excellent.

However on our last day there we woke up in the morning to find the hotel had a power cut which meant getting dressed in the dark and no shower. They couldn’t even give us our bill on checkout and as this was our last day with a flight at 8pm that evening we were left to wonder Dublin unwashed which obviously ruined the last day for us. We thought we would have heard from the hotel on our return home to apologise and to give our bill to check prior to payment but that was too much to expect as they just went ahead and charged the card. When we contacted them about helping themselves to our money we also suggested some form of compensation might be in order because of the power cut on the last day however it would appear that they don’t do compensation in Dublin.

Whilst the hotel does not have control over the power companies they do have certain responsibilities to guests and I would have expected a lot more from the Four Seasons. This incident aside I would have given the hotel a 5 star rating however I think it does highlight that in the unlikely event that something does go wrong during your stay there and you need to complain it is likely that their process or lack off will mean your compliant will fall on death ears",3,2013,01,29
205,(((Exceptional hotel experience ))),"My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights last week, as we were making our way towards the hotel door a young man called Alan approached us and assisted us with our bags he took us straight to reception and checked us in himself, he then personally walked us to the lift . Our bags arrived at the room just a few minutes later. The bedroom was spacious with great furnishings and the bathroom was one of the best I have ever been in with loads of extras. Breakfast was expensive at 24 euro each but if you can put plenty away consider it a chef was in the dining room making fresh omelettes and the selection of hot and cold buffet was overwhelming . We made use of the leisure facilities a nice pool sauna and steam rooms, complimentary fresh fruit tea and coffee was available at the pool. All of the staff from doormen to cleaners were exceptional, we will definitely look forward to going back. One problem which we should have addressed immediately but did not was they gave us twin beds we booked a double king with Expedia I was unsure until checking out whether Expedia made the mistake or the hotel  staff advised it was their mistake but offered no apology 30 years married we missed our double room 336 !!!",5,2013,01,28
205,unbelievable hotel cant fault it,"superb staff, good location and excellent food what more do you want. we got married here we loved it so much. Suite room is palatial, breakfast is really well put together with a specialised omlette chef to boot!",5,2013,01,28
205,"Wow, inpressive","Came for a drink, great first impression though the staffs ( door man, front desk staff & concierge) were quite cold with the welcoming. Had to ask where was the best place to go for a drink. One gentleman offered the two options and i chose the ice. This is where the wow started. I requested a pinacolada which was not on the menu and the bar tender said no problem. When it came it was below expectation, tasted watery and without doubt the worst i have ever tasted. The waitress a lovely lady came over asking how was everything and i stated my concern and she was very professional in listening, apologising explaining what might have been the problem. Really she was the one that made everything seemed perfect. Next time definitely i would stay with fs Dublin based on what i have experience today. Though i would have preferred not to pay for that pinacolada as it was simply not worthit.
",4,2013,01,25
205,Hard not to be a happy guest,"First visit to this lovely hotel. Got a fantastic room (411) with full balcony and a great city/harbour view. The room is spacious, classy furniture, great bed and a large new Samsung flat sceen TV. Bathroom inthe imperial style but working well. 

Staff is very friendly and very service minded. Highly recommende.",5,2013,01,23
205,Beautiful hotel with warm and friendly staff,"My husband booked this last minute trip for us to see the city of Dublin.he was able to get a great rate at this beautiful hotel. We arrived in Dublin from NYC at 430 am and were able to check right into the hotel which was so nice (usually you have to wait till check in time which is usually 3pm) but they had our room waiting for us. The lovely concierge helped us book private tours and advised us of many things to see. My only problem with the hotel was 1)location-it is about 2 miles outside the city center so when I wanted to stay in my husband more or less had to stay in since there were no pubs in the vicinity. Also, we got the free Irish breakfast with our reservation and I just felt the wait staff at the restaurant were not quite on it. We chose the buffet so they did not need to tend to us all that much but they should have checked if we needed more water or coffee which was not the case at all...I actually had to get myself a fresh glass of water and also search for the waiter to finally get our bill. Those are my only complaints.....the hotel is however beautiful and was well worth the money!",4,2013,01,22
205,Beautiful Spacious room and a very helpful staff.,Staff was extremely helpful with booking tours/car service/reservations - we had a great time despite horrible weather and one of the reasons was we felt all the people we dealt with were personally invested in our having a great visit to Dublin. Highly recommended.,5,2013,01,22
205,Great hotel but what has happened to the breakfast buffet,"I believe this to be a very good hotel, but since my last stay they have changed the breakfast buffet. It has now become much less abundant with no choice of cheese, limited pastry and even bread options. Was very disappointed by this downgrading of the buffet. Everything else great as usual.",4,2013,01,18
205,Surprisingly affordable luxury at the Four Seasons Dublin,"Our family stay at the Dublin Four Seasons over the New Year was a wonderfully luxurious pleasure which was surprisingly affordable.  Room rates rather than per person means it doesn't actually cost any more to stay in this beautiful hotel than to stay in many inferior places.  I could rave about the splendour of the decor but it is really the staff who make this hotel special - well trained, competent, friendly and helpful.  Can't wait to return!",5,2013,01,15
205,See the make over at the Four Seasons Hotel Dublin.,"I recently spent a very enjoyable afternoon in the newly refurbished lounge at the Four Seasons Hotel Dublin. I love what the design team have done with the rooms. New seating using a variety of fabric textures were comfortable and smart. New flooring, brighter, bolder colour schemes, eclectic lighting and clever use of the existing art collection, all contirbuted to a very elegant  atmoshere. Well done to all comcerned.

The service was warm, attentive and efficient. We had a glass of wine and as we were feeeling peekish, we ordered some smoked salmon, which was served with traditional brown bread and real butter. We finished off with a seasonal dessert of mince pies and excellent coffee.

All in all a relaxing time-out from the mayhem of the festive season. Will be repeated soon !",5,2013,01,15
205,Four Season Dublin,"Back in July 2011 I asked for my partners hand in marriage here at the Four Seasons Dublin.  The hotel was lovely, beautiful hotel. Staff were all very well presented and polite.  Food was unbelievable, Room was huge and the Spa was excellant.  We will definately be returning to celebrate a wedding anniversaries in the future.",5,2013,01,14
205,Romantic Getaway,"It's becoming a habit to stay in this hotel as a treat once a year. This time it was New Year's Eve. It's a beautiful hotel with lots of nice touches but ultimately the big selling point for me is the friendliness and service from staff. No one hotel in Ireland does it as good. I'm surprised more hotels don't adopt a similar approach. 

Last time I stayed it was in a suite, this time kind we were in a standard room. The room looked refurbished since our last visit and was spotless. Bed was comfy too.

The hotel had arranged a band in the lobby area and the ICE bar had a DJ.

My only two complaints about the hotel is wifi and breakfast. Wifi is an extortionate price and they even have a two tiered pricing structure which is crazy. 

Breakfast wasn't great this time round. It was poor either but it wasn't up to scratch for the €72 we paid for it. I should add that the previous time we stayed breakfast was excellent

That aside we will go back",4,2013,01,13
205,"A little less formal, but still great !!!","We have stayed at the Four Seasons Dublin now 4 times, each time for a special birthday celebration. As always, from arrival to departure you are made to feel like a VIP, examples included a birthday welcome in the room and some birthday chocolates in the Seasons restaurant.

The biggest change we saw this time was the fact the hotel felt slightly less formal, this for us made it feel even more comfortable. The prices seemed more reasonable also; a meal for 2, including wine, in the Seasons restaurant came to 150 Euro, which we felt was excellent value, no compromise on quality and service.

Another great example of how they look after their resident’s was there was a rugby match on the Saturday which meant the bar was very busy late on, they kept a few tables reserved for residents which meant we never had to wait to sit down

Make sure you find an hour to visit the pool, you often get it to yourself and its ambience is so so relaxing. Not the place for serious swimming but a great place to unwind after you have hit the shops.

Beyond the hotel we visited the Guinness Storehouse, which if I’m honest my wife didn’t want to go to but by the end of the tour she had a glass of Guinness in her hand, a great way to spend 2 hrs before heading to Grafton Street, we also ate at Il Posto on St Stephens Green, which was excellent

I have stayed in Four Seasons across Europe and North America and this is still my favorite, thanks for a great birthday weekend..",5,2013,01,13
205,touch of class,We stayed in this hotel over the christmas period arriving on Christmas eve and staying for three nights it was our first time to stay away for the festive period but from the moment we arrived everything was perfect the service was spot on the food was lovely  the staff were on the ball. The rooms were well presented we ordered room service one night and it was a joy to behold. Overall it was a lovely experience so if you can go ahead and treat yourself you wont be let down.,5,2013,01,10
205,Looking forward to next visit.,"If you want luxury and excellent service without fuss then Four Seasons is for you.  Worth every penny.  Rooms are lovely and beds exceptionally comfortable.  Nothing is too much, staff are at every corner to assist if you need them but not intrusive.  Whilst I did stay with friends the hotel certainly welcomes children.",5,2013,01,10
205,amazing and very memorable,I would highly recommend the Four Seasons. I was a guest at a wedding on New Years Eve. One of the happiest times of my life because of the superb service delivered. From the moment I arrived the excellent service was evident. One of the staff protected me from a heavy downpour by providing protection under an umbrella walking from the car park.,5,2013,01,09
205,The Best Hotel in Dublin..without question,"Have stayed in all the 5 star Hotels in Dublin and this is the best by a mile.. 

The staff are always courtious. The rooms are luxourious, spacious and spotless. The food is always as requested and the whole experience is as stress free as staying in a hotel can be..

If I say anymore complimentary things about, they will think im a member of staff!!!",1,2013,01,09
205,Great stay at the Four Seasons,"My wife and I spent a night in the Four Seasons in the period between Christmas and New Year. This was to celebrate our wedding anniversary which had occurred earlier in the month.

Upon arrival we parked in the barriered car park. The sight of the valet parked cars was a wonder in itself, so many Rolls Royce, Bentley, Ferrari, Porsche cars all parked up. A sign on the way in advised that €18 parking per 24 hours would be charged.

Check in was friendly and effiicient and we were accompanied to the lift by the staff member who checked us in.

Our room was beautiful. The bed was super king sized and very comfortable. The view wasn't much but that might be to do with the time of year rather than what we looked out over. Large bathroom with separate toilet, L'Occitane toiletries.

The leisure facilities were very good. I felt the changing room / sauna / steam area was more impressive than the pool / jacuzzi. The pool area is still very nice though although not as good as that in a hotel such as the Slieve Donard but I suppose the Four Seasons is in a city where space is at a premium.

My wife was hungry when we came back in in the evening and we went to the bar beside reception. She ate and I had a pint. Her food was top quality. Really tasty. The Guinness was of a high quality too. Better than in many of the pubs in Dublin. We also got olives / snacks at the bar.

I had expected to pay €18 for parking upon checkout but was advised that this was free, which delighted me.

Negatives? Wifi is not free. €13 for a slow speed wifi or €25 for high speed per day. I appreciate that a lot of people stay at the Four Seasons and money is no object but for many people €25 makes it unaffordable. For me it was cheaper to pay data roaming to my mobile operator and tether my phone to my laptop. Also, we were offered a choice of Financial Times or Irish Times for the next morning. I chose Irish Times but did not get one. I'm not sure if it was supposed to be hung off the door or should I collect it somewhere.

Still, it was a great visit. The hotel is a wonderful building with beautiful rooms but what puts it a step above the rest is the staff.",4,2013,01,09
205,Good but some issues,"The hotel itself is about what you should expect from a Four Seasons, and the staff is very attentive and helpful.  

BUT, this hotel is a 10 Euro taxi drive from downtown Dublin (i.e. the touristy areas), which gets more inconvenient and pricy each day.  My biggest complaint is that the Four Season's website states that they have a car to take you into the city, which is the reason we chose this hotel given its more remote location.  What they DON'T tell you is that the ONE car isn't available until 1pm, cannot be reserved (i.e. first come, first served), and will not pick you up.  1pm is way too late for anyone looking see the city to have to wait for.  We ended up using the car only once, and it was to move us to the Shelbourne downtown.  Had this been clearly communicated on the website we would have chosen another hotel.  Instead we spend 100+ Euro on taxis.",3,2013,01,06
205,Great place to stay in Dublin,"This hotel is really a great place to stay, staff is abdolutely friendly and helpful, rooms are large and clean and service is definetely five stars.
The location of it can be a plus for someone like me, who'd rather stay in a quiet area, and then take a brief ( 10 mnts) commute into downtown.
Some people may not like it, but Dublin is not a large city, every deplacement is quite fast.
Will return again.",5,2013,01,04
205,Remains best hotel in Dublin,"Another wonderful stay. Staff almost flawless. Royally treated for the duration of the stay. Rooms have been spruced up, and have to say the suite was worth the extra. It was massive, like a one bed apartment. Bar still lovely and relaxing (even when busy); the Lobby Bar still a great place to meet; and the Dining Room is one of the top hotel restaurants i've been to anywhere (and reasonably priced too). Also, the Breakfast there is just superb. A real highlight, with a great choice, excellent quality, top notch service. I can not speak highly enough of the place.",5,2013,01,03
205,Never stay anywhere else in Dublin,"Simply the best hotel in Dublin. It never disappoints on all levels. The most comfortable beds you can imagine, large spacious rooms, fantastic food and a true 5 star experience. The staff are pleasent and the most courteous, friendly people you will meet",5,2013,01,03
205,Faultless!,"I have stayed in the Four seasons Dublin many a time. The staff are friendly and welcoming. The rooms are spacious and clean. The pool and bubble pool are relaxing and quiet. The only thing that is a bit disappointing is the food, its quite average for a 5 star hotel.The location is brilliant only a short walk away from lovely restaurants and and excellent shopping areas ( grafton street , O'connel street etc). Over all my stay at the Four Seasons are almost always Top Class!",5,2013,01,03
205,A little disappointed this time,"We have stayed in the Four Seasons, Dublin many times, and I have already written 2 reviews.  I was however a little disappointed with my visit this time.  We stayed in rooms on the second floor.  However when we came back to our room later in the evening, there was a very strong stench of cigarette smoke throughout this floor.  I thought it was a non-smoking hotel.  This is the first time staying that we have encountered this.  I would definetely be questioning if this was the smoking floor if I was staying again.  As there are no tea and coffee facillites in the room, I ordered a tea from room service.  I expected the tea to be free, but paid over 10euro including the room service fee!  The most expensive cup of tea I have ever had!!!  The hotel was also exceptionally busy.  They did not seem to have enough staff on in the bar and restaurant areas to cope with this and there were long waits for service.

Other than these two negative points however, our stay was lovely and the staff were extremely friendly and welcoming.",4,2012,12,31
205,Great Place to Stay on the Outskirts of Dublin,"This was the perfect place to stay since you are far enough removed from the city centre to relax and have some peace and quiet but close enough that you can ride the train in or take a cab in for less than 10€ The staff was very pleasant, the rooms were comfortable and cleanly and the breakfast was superb. My fiance has the fluffiest omelette we've both ever seen! The courtyard was lovely to look at while enjoying some coffee and waiting for a table to open up for breakfast. Overall we had a great stay and would certainly return to this hotel in the future.",5,2012,12,28
205,Our favourite hotel in Dublin ... But was little disappointed this time,"We are fans of four seasons hotels  everywhere in the world. We stay alots at four seasons Dublin and New York . But this time over our stay during Christmas , we found the service was poor.some of the staff in the spa were so unfriendly and unhappy, we went to relax to find a grumpy staff . The guy at the spa was  rude, I lost my key and I asked him if he can get me a key to take the lift, his reply was.. That was a big problem, another client was there couldn't  believe his answer and manners,  instead of helping. Next day the same unhappy guy was there, with no smile or good manners for a 5 star hotel. A girl was cleaning at the women area was so stressed and following us from place to place , it was so stressful experience. The room service was so poor too. First night, we order dinner  at our suite , the food was bad but we didnt complain as it was our first night, the next morning we ordered breakfast , the guy on the phone wasn't nice, the breakfast was appalling , Irish breakfast with no sausages, ham ,. The continental was very bad, cold toasts in top of  3 small croissants. I called him and he wasn't nice and he said he can't do anything until I called the reception , then he sent me another breakfast  and he was nice then but at that time, we were so stressed we didn't feel eating. I never write reviews or complain but I was so disappointed ...maybe some staff were unhappy because they had no Christmas but that's not our problem ...

However the good thing ...the staff at the reception ...the restaurant, the concierge, the lounge and the bar  were amazing and very friendly... I still love four seasons Dublin and i think they have the best spa  in Dublin",4,2012,12,26
205,LUXURY,"This hotel is very well situated for the city yet far enough out from the centre to enjoy easy excess
by car,a taxi ride to city centre is reasonable and readily aviable. 
from our arrival there was plenty of staff to handle our luggage,park our car which incurs a small fee. at reception we were efficently dealt with,our luggage arrived in the room very soon. the rooms are spacious and well fitted ,except that no tea making facilities aviable which is a minus,
A charge is also made for internet access which seems petty considering the rate,however this service is good ,
the only real downside is the food,the breakfast while served in a luxury setting with plenty of attension from good and very plesant staff,was not the quality of food one expects from this grade of hotel. I would ratethe Hilton breakfast as having much beter quality of food considering the price comparison. Overall i enjoyed my stay and would consider returning or tryin anothe location in the future.",4,2012,12,26
205,treat yourself to a lovely hotel with great staff,the four seasons was as you expect from such a hotel. The staff were exceptional even for the four seasons and are to be congratulated .... They really did delight with their service. the  location is a short bus ride by no. 4 or no. 7 to dublin centre. paid 480 euros for 2 nights for a triple room without breakfast ...so not cheap.... but a lovely hotel with great staff,5,2012,12,22
205,Overrated,"On recent visit found check in and staff very friendly and helpful.
Room large but impersonal..bathroom amazing and bedlinen wonderful..but an empty feel.
No tea/coffee but on request arrived at once..but how was that missed by staff when cleaning room.
Dinner in half empty dinning room..served cold and nothing special.
Breakfast..the high point..would rate it one of the best if not the best..
No great atmosphere and overpriced.
Bars almost empty.",4,2012,12,21
205,Four Seasons Quality: You will not be disappointed....,"Serene decor, big room, nice attentively friendly ""Irish"" service regardless of nationality, high quality breakfast buffet, clean modern well equipped gym. All of this at a lower price than I had expected to pay for a Four Seasons experience. Will definitely visit again next time I will be in Dublin.",5,2012,12,20
205,5 Star for Four Seasons,"Wonderful hotel, luxurious room; fabulous dining room and great food. Couldn't fault this hotel in any way; from the friendly greeting at the front desk to the ever friendly floor staff. The staff in the Spa were extremely helpful; the bar man was chatty and informative as he mixed our cocktails in the Ice Bar.",5,2012,12,17
205,Very pleasant for either business or private,"Just spent a couple of nights at the four seasons in Dublin.  10 minutes out of the center by train, and a 5 minutes walk from the station.  The hotell by itself is very nice, large room, the bathroom with separate shower and bathtub, and a closed door to the toilett, superb.
The staf friendly and very atentive.  The concierge very helpfull.  Could not been better !",5,2012,12,11
205,Good for Business or Personal,"I just spent a week at the Four Seasons in Dublin was generally very pleased by the hotel, particularly the degree of service.  The only reason I did not rate the hotel ""5"" for service is that they took very long to bring my luggage to my room after check in.  Other than that, they were very attentive, I mean housekeeping came in twice a day to tidy the room.  The Irish breakfast buffet was very nice, and the physical facility of the hotel is very comfortable and upperclass.  Another slight knock for location, as the hotel is somewhat removed from the center of Dublin, but it was very convenient as I was there to attend an event at the Royal Dublin Society right next door. Unlike many of the hotels that I've used for business, I would actually not mind staying here for personal reasons as well.",4,2012,12,10
205,Great weekend,"Lovely hotel! 
Just back from a weekend in Dublin to celebrate my husbands 40th.
Staff couldn't have been more helpful. Clean, quiet, well equipped suite. 
Would like a wider variety of healthy children's menu at evening meal (some dishes a little too elaborate for a 3 year old!) other than that we have no criticism of this hotel.",5,2012,12,09
205,Superb,"Great service and welcome from the minute we arrived until we left. Nothing was too much trouble for all the staff who showed genuine friendliness. From the door men, through checkin, bar service, breakfast, check out it was superb. Really impressed with this old charm top of the pile Dublin hotel. A well worthwhile treat if you are looking for something special. ",5,2012,12,02
205,Very nice hotel,"We spent 6 nights here and were completely satisfied. The hotel is up-scale and all services matched. Very nice room and all common areas were quite lovely. It is not in the city centre area of Dublin but there are a few restaurants and pubs within walking distance, as, actually, city centre is when the weather is clement. The restaurants are expensive but the food is good.",5,2012,11,30
205,Very enjoyable,"We stayed here last Christmas, while home visiting family and friends. The hotel is ' Four Seasons Standards' of which I am a big fan and did not disappoint in any way. Spacious and elegant guest room, with great facilities. Good pool and gym. Restuarant is wonderful, even while the hotel was busy we could still enjoy a leisurely breakfast  which was excellent both in terms of quality and service.  Our evening dining expeirence was equally a delight with wonderful service and a great meal. I think the mussels were the best I've ever had anywhere! 

My only disappointment is that the last time I tried to stay over a holiday weekend that they were already fully booked, but hopefully I will have the oppertunity to stay here again.",5,2012,11,24
205,Excellent experience,"This is a top-rate hotel, well-worth the price.  It offers every amenity possible, and the rooms are lovely.  Service is impeccable.  One can't do better than this.  The pool is warm, the fitness room well-equipped.  Lobby is elegant.  There are a lot of places to sit and read or have somethjing to eat or drink.  Altogether there is a great sense of spaciousness and comfort.",5,2012,11,21
205,"Very enjoyable, room was beautiful, service excellent - highly recommended.","Very enjoyable stay - I was attending an event in the hotel and booked in for convenience. The room was beautiful, very comfortable bed. The service was excellent, they happily organised a late check out without any quibbles.

I look forward to my next stay.",5,2012,11,21
205,Recent stay,"Spent a few nights at this hotel for a recent business trip. Lovely place, perfect service and friendly staff. Would highly recommend to anyone wanting an upmarket hotel in Dublin. Slightly out of the city centre but some nice coffee shops etc nearby and only a short taxi ride to get downtown.",5,2012,11,18
205,Simple amenities Missing!,"I am in the hotel business and very familiar with four seasons properties. I am a director at a four star hotel in the states and I was astounded by the fact that we didn't have a coffee maker in the room! Or any music docking system or even an iron. These are standards for Any four seasons not mention any decent hotel. At the four seasons where I live we have an espresso maker with illy coffee in each room and I pod docking system.
We left our room for 3 hours and came back to a dirty room!  That is sub par Service.
Overall the people were kind and the service was good but I had basic expectations that weren't meant at all. We won't be staying here again. ",3,2012,11,14
205,Will keep returning,"Well what can I say yet another fabulous stay at the four seasons! You're decor can only take a little of your credit but the majority goes to your staff, always so friendly, helpful and polite.
Great hotel lovely, rooms, tasty food and luscious wine!",5,2012,11,07
205,Best hotel in Dublin,"Close to the city centre and easy access to all of South Dublin, this hotel is just the business.  Fab rooms with every facility.  Huge flat screen smart televisions with loads of channels, just everything you could want in a room.  Nice lounge and restaurant downstairs and great gym.  Staff cant do enough for you - just the best",5,2012,11,07
205,A typical (and great) Four Seasons,"What a spectacular hotel. Beautiful, spacious, and extraordinary service.

We only had breakfasts here and they were very good.

It is a very pricey hotel - we only stayed here as AMEX had a special offer for Gold Members (or whatever) - 50% off, breakfasts included. WiFi was outrageously expensive.

There is one serious downside - location. We had turned in our car and this hotel is a 5 minute, $10 plus ab ride to city center. So we racked up a lot of taxi fees.",5,2012,11,04
205,Relaxing hotel with great service.,We stayed for a couple of nights in the summer and really enjoyed our stay. The hotel is out of town a little but this means it is quiet and only a short taxi ride with taxis always outside so no problem.  The room was lovely and the service in the restaurant just right.  Would be more than happy to stay again. ,5,2012,11,04
205,Dublin Four Seasons doesn't disappoint,"Hotel is not in the city centre so bare this in mind if you're a tourist and want to walk around Dublin. But it's only a short stroll away from Dart station (Sandymount) and few stops away from the city centre. So very easily accessible. Hotel itself is impressive and stunning. Booked a standard room (250 euro/night) which was more than adequate. Spacious, spotlessly clean, with huge bed, HD TV, fabulously stocked minibar, huge marble bathroom, literally no detail was spared to make a guest feel comfortable. I don't think that room pictures itself are making this hotel justice. What I've seen was excellent. By all means. I've been in many 5 star hotels in Dublin and for some reason this one is on a completely different level. Resident bar is open very late, Ice bar looks very trendy and funky, restaurant is very good as well and wellness lovers would definitely enjoy spa and swimming pool area. I was a bit disappointed when having a breakfast though. Service was just chaotic, I was offered complimentary orange juice while waiting which I was charged for later on. If you don't want a buffet breakfast you're not sure where to order stuff of the menu as there was no one around to ask. Maybe just a bad coincidence. Overall, this is a stunning hotel. Worth every minute of your stay.",5,2012,11,04
205,Very good,"The four seasons was a very nice hotel with lovely staff and food.The hotel also offers a lovely spa and swimming pool witch was nice. The only slight down fall was the room,it was nice but a bit small and it had no flat screen tv. We had a box tv witch was alright but the movies and games were a bit over priced,but I liked the complimentary coke and popcorn over all a nice hotel",4,2012,11,03
205,Decadent & stylish without being too pretentious,Amazing hotel massive bedrooms with king size beds.  Walk in shower & separate bath. Beautiful made to order breakfast & the staff were very accommodating & friendly. Fantastic conference facilities too.,5,2012,11,03
205,"Excellent service, comfortable rooms, inconvenient location","Rooms: comfortable, clean and with all equipment and supplies that the Four Seasons provide. The beds and duvets are very good.

Service: staff is extremely helpful and friendly too.

Location: it's not in the city centre so you'll need a cab to go everywhere.",4,2012,11,01
205,First class service,"First class hotel in upmarket dublin suburb. Room was spotless and had the requested shower for my wife. Service was very good and when a single issue did arise was rectified immediately. Very knowledgable concierge We had both dinner and breakfast in the hotel, both of which were very good although a little pricey but this is the Four seasons. Bar was small and too crowded both nights but lounge area facing onto garden and lobby area was excellent place for drinks, small meal ,afternoon tea or just to sit and people watch For our purposes, location was excellent as were travelling outside of dublin but you would need to get taxi to get into city centre(about10 mins)",4,2012,10,30
205,Sheer Luxury,"I was recently at this hotel for a week whilst on a business trip to Dublin. I am familiar with Four Seasons hotels all over the world and this establishment in Dublin does the brand proud. From the moment you arrive, you are met by friendly, welcoming staff who are eager to make your stay pleasant and happy. The decor is understated luxury; you just know that you are in a five star hotel. As for the rooms - well, I was lucky to have been upgraded to a suite. I could have stayed there forever! The entrance hall, lounge area, bedroom, dressing room and marbled bathroom (ooh, I forgot the guest toilet!) created a home away from home. It was spacious, comfortable and furnished in good taste. The breakfasts were sumptious and the spa was a wonderful haven for peace and quiet. Robert Nolan is the GM; what a pleasure it was to meet him and his staff who, without exception, were fantastic. I would highly recommend this hotel and I would not hesitate in staying there again. Thank you Robert for making it such a memorable visit.",5,2012,10,23
205,"lovely, and great service","had a lovely two night stay, and felt very well taken care of throughout.  I was most impressed when room service (which said on the door hanger began at 6 am) was willing to deliver breakfast at 4:30 because of my early flight.  breakfast was fantastic and cappuccinos (as big as your head) were great.",5,2012,10,22
205,"Beautiful hotel, friendly staff but needs some TLC.","We stayed in Dublin from October 19th through the 22nd. We found the staff friendly and accommodating but not extremely proactive. While eating breakfast, we had multiple people pass by us before we finally stopped someone and asked for water.  The room was clean and well maintained but the hallway carpeting is in desperate need of replacement. They were prompt in responding to our multiple requests.  I would stay here again...",4,2012,10,21
205,Luxury hotel with friendly staff,The Dublin Four Seasons Hotel is a wonderful place to stay.  The check in was easy and they were able to get us in the room right away even though we had arrived around 11 in the morning.  They were always able to serve us breakfast late as we were still adjusting to the time difference.  The concierge was very helpful in recommending and getting us a dinner reservation at Roly's Restaurant nearby and in getting us theater tickets.  It was a short walk to the DART (Dublin's train service) to get you into the center of Dublin.  We would definitely go back and stay there.,5,2012,10,18
205,Irish hospitality,The Fours Seasons is a haven outside the main part of the city yet close to everything.  The concierge is exceptional -- getting my lost luggage and making dinner reservations had hard to get spots or on a diffifult day (Sunday) for 10 people for a special birthday.  The facilities are beautiful.   I needed quick dry cleaning because of the lost bag -- back in 2 hours.,5,2012,10,17
205,Standards have dropped here,"I hate writinng this review as I was hoping after my last weekend there I would be really happy but no that wasnt the case .I have stayed here many times as I really love the area  and the atmosphere that WAS  in the hotel  but I think all is not as it was.... First the positives ....the rooms are still amazing and in fairness we book the basic and more often than not we get upgraded at no extra cost.Glad they upgraded the tvs .We went up to the All Ireland football match and stayed the weekend.First off the lobby/foyer bar was all boarded up for the whole weekend.This is why we stay at the four seasons ...that bar IS the reason we stay there.The ambience ,people and celeb watching is what makes this hotel so nice.Nothing nicer than your glass of pinot grigio and relaxing in those comfy chairs.No mention of the renovations when I phoned to book for the busiest weekend...I mean who wants to sit and have a drink in the Breakfast room away from all the action.The staff who used to be the heart and soul of this hotel are not happy anymore ...all the smiling faces have disappeared.On the two mornings we had breakfast we were not given a menu...we ordered bar food on Sunday evening and were in a hurry to get over to the Burlington and  the bar man forgot to put our order through to the kitchen.Also on Saturday night there was a whole mix up about paying for drinks.Some man who we know to see didnt close his drinks tab down and all our drinks and others went on his tab but WE realised the error ourselves and got it sorted.Something is so wrong here that was So right for years.this is our second visit in months that we had this bad experience and we feel with the price we pay for this 5 star hotel we cant afford another diaster.Even the concieres are grumpy.I feel this place has changed ownership in the last year.Please fix it Four Seasons.I will be keeping my ears openef to hear if you have",3,2012,10,17
205,Luxury Hotel,"The Four Seasons Hotel in Dublin is a great place to stay when in Dublin. I’ve stayed at the hotel many times and i think they’re the best in Dublin by far. They have great staff that would go above and beyond and help you check in if you arrived before the check in time. The rooms are very spacious, comfortable and clean. Their Concierge and Door men are very courteous and extremely helpful. The food is amazing starting from its breakfast that makes my mouth water just thinking of it, the lunch in the Lobby Lounge is great with a lot of options and is also filling and the dinner is great especially if you’re a meat eater. The gym has all the equipment that is essential at a hotel and the spa is great place to relax and unwind with great staff. They also have parking and great transport to and from the Airport & City Centre.",5,2012,10,16
205,Hotel not bad but incompetent and arrogant staff,"The hotel and the rooms are not bad and the position is good, but the service is unacceptable.
The food is very easy and basic cuisine and is not of the quality you would expect in a Four Seasons.
Although the people at the reception and the concierge were nice, many employees are arrogant and incompetent.
Especially the security is very arrogant and there were some children asking for pictures with players staying in the hotel ( I was there at the day of a  match) and they  were treaten like dogs by the security. This same thing happened many times: I have never seen such an arrogance by an employee of a 5 star hotel!",1,2012,10,13
205,Excellent Restaurant and great location,"We stayed at the Four Seasons for four nights during a recent trip to attend the 
Navy- Notre Dame football game. It is a very good location for attending sporting events 
at Aviva Stadium as it is within walking distance of the stadium and great pubs in the neighborhood of Ballsbridge. Dublin is a fun town and the Irish couldn't be nicer. 
We ate and drank our way through Ireland and the Four Seasons restaurant was a standout.",4,2012,10,09
205,Absolutely will go back and stay here,"Very comfortable rooms near the embassy's I stayed here for 2 nights and the service was superb. the concierge and front desk staff is very courteous and absolutely helpful.. Breakfast was perfect with many choices. 

family stay or business stay.. this is a great place to stay.. quiet rooms. We arrive pretty early and they went above and beyond and help us check in so we can rest right away.. it was a great welcome after a long flight..",5,2012,10,05
205,Excellent but why charge for the kids Breakfeast??,"I have stayed in the Four Seasons Dublin many times and it is an excellent hotel. In my opinion the best in Dublin. The rooms are superb, the food is excellent, great location, Parking...It really is a very good hotel. I have one small complaint. On my most recent stay, which was last week, I was there with my wife and two young boys ages 8+4. We booked a deluxe suite B&B for one night- not cheap, but in my opinion good value. To my amazement I discovered that they have now decided to charge the kids for Breakfeast. So the adults get breakfeast included but the kids get charged- and whilst the charge is small at €6.50 per child it seems ridiculous and whoever decided this would be a smart thing to do should really reconsider. I would imagine this will annoy everyone who has to pay it. I would guess it leads to many arguements and creates really unnecessary bad feelings towards what is an excellent hotel. I would strongly advise the manager to do away with this crazy extra charge.",4,2012,10,04
205,Nice traditional hotel,"Stayed at the Four Seasons Dublin for five nights prior to a cruise. Our room was lovely and spacious. The bed was very comfortable and we had a large bathroom with a lovely deep bath. Check in was easy and the concierge were very helpful ( the ones we dealt with were Australians!).
I did not use the gym but had a very good massage at the Day Spa and had my hair done at the salon.
Breakfast was very good with lots of choice - our breakfast was included in our room cost.
The place had a very ""proper"" feel to it. In the afternoon there were lots of little old ladies coming in all dressed up for their traditional afternoon tea.
My only gripe was the choice of entertainment on the TV. There were a couple of movie channels showing very old movies but no in house movie channel. We were very jetlagged after a long flight from Australia and like to go to bed early and watch a movie before going to sleep. There was a DVD player in the room but when I rang reception, they only had childrens movies - nothing for adults.
Overall it was a nice hotel with lovely staff.",4,2012,10,04
205,Overall Fab Hotel,Found the hotel lovely. Stayed 2 nights. Was disappointed that there was a charge for the wifi. Also there was no kettle and no iron in the room. I know its a five star hotel but sometimes you like to do things for yourself. The room and ensuite was gorgeous. Handy if there is a concert in the RDS.,5,2012,10,02
205,Splendid,"We had a wonderful one night's stay here for my father's 80th birthday.

Very posh, service outstanding, we could have turned up in sacks and the staff wouldn't have batted an eyelid.

Attention paid to every detail.

Glorious range of toiletries seemingly topped up more then once a day. Full bath and full walk in shower. 

Turn down service, chocolates, the works.

Restaurants and piano lounge bar very enjoyable. Recommend highly if you feel like a treat.",5,2012,09,30
205,Best Place to be on your Holidays!,"Love the ambience, excellent staff's service, mouth-watering menu's, and to top of it all it's a 5 star hotel at it's very best. If you are lucky enough, you might be seeing some famous stars checking-in as in my case... i saw david blaine at the bar and madonna.",5,2012,09,30
205,Fabulous hotel!,"In planning our trip to Dublin we had hoped to stay in the St. Stephen's Green area. Although this hotel is a cab ride away from the St. Stephen's Green area, it is well worth the cab ride. The hotel was beautiful, and the surrounding neighborhood was lovely. The guest rooms were spacious and beautifully appointed. I would highly recommend this property when visiting Dublin!",5,2012,09,27
205,Overall good experience but spolit by cheapstake charge for WiFi,"We stayed at the hotel just for a night attending a concert at the Aviva Stadium nearby (15 minute walk). The hotel is also convieniently located both walking into central Dublin & by car if accessing it from the North (airport) side of Dublin via the Port Tunnel.

Over all the experience was good. We had a deluxe room which was traditionally furnished to the rear of the hotel, overlooking the garden and the RDS next door. It was generously sized with a comfortable bed and decent sized bathroom with separate shower and bath. 

On the Saturday afternoon we had to wait 15 minutes to get a table to have a drink. When we tried to long onto wi-fi we were flabergated that this would incurr a separate change - unbelievable in a hotel of this class.

We ate in the restaurant prior to the concert at shortly after 6pm. Eating off the fixed price menu the service was prompt, the food was good and fair value for Dublin. 

The following morning we also had to wait for 10 minutes or so for breakfast at about 10am. That wasn't a problem as papers, coffee and OJ was provided in the bar area while we waited.
 
The staff were very helpful, the concierge acting quickly to allow us to check out with him on the Sunday as there was a queue at reception.",4,2012,09,26
205,Best Service Ever!,"I was so lucky to get to stay at this hotel as it was included in a luxury package tour we bought on SniqueAway through Sceptre Tours. And what luxury! While the room itself was not my style (a bit old fashioned) it was super, spotlessly clean and the bathroom was amazing with a GIANT soaker tub which felt great to my jetlagged body after a day exploring Dublin with no sleep.

But, it was the service that made me swoon. Upon arrival at 7:30 a.m., our room was not available (far from check-in time, but I always hold out hope...) However, the staff on duty made us feel truly welcome by showing us to the spa to freshen up and to the business center so we could print off maps and information for our day of site seeing. After our day out, our room was ready and our bags were already in our room. 

I have never felt so sincerely welcomed at a hotel by each and every hotel staff member -- everyone was friendly, helpful, chatty (in a good way!) From the welcome coffee to the complimentary bottles of water from the valet on our way to our next destination, all of the attention to detail (small and large) made for a phenomenal experience.",5,2012,09,24
205,Great property with everything you expect from the Four Seasons brand,"I stayed here for one night last month with my husband and 5 month old son.  We had just gotten off a long haul flight so we just wanted something to eat and a cozy, quiet bed for the night.  The Four Seasons really delivered.  They were extreamly accommodating re our infant -- They provided an awesome travel cot, bottle sterilizer and warmer.  We had dinner in our room and it was delicious. Breakfast was a little expensive but come on, you get what you pay for.  Highly recommended.",5,2012,09,24
205,Excellent hotel,"Travelling with work, I have had to stay on and off in Dublin for the past six weeks.  Our usual hotel was fully booked, however our booking agent was able to secure us a discounted rate here instead.

First impressions of the hotel were excellent, a grand building in a very nice area with a greeting by staff on the door.  Checked in very quickly by the very helpful and friendly staff at reception, I proceeded to my room which was immaculate.  The decor may not be to everyone's taste but I was more than satisfied with the room and marble bathroom.

The public areas of the hotel were also immaculate and it genuinely felt really nice to be there.  We ate in the lounge for dinner, and the staff attending to us were friendly and helpful.  The breakfast service the next morning was very good and the staff made sure everyone was well looked after.

There was a big event in Dublin that meant a large number of American travellers checked into the hotel on one night, however this did not affect the experience at the Four Seasons at all and the excellent service offered the first night was just as good the second night.

This was a very welcome change from our normal accommodation and if I am ever given the opportunity to stay her again I would be more than happy to!",5,2012,09,24
205,Serene Staycation at the Seasons,"Moving out of my apartment after 20 years there, I decided to treat myself to a Dublin ""stay-cation"" in the Four Seasons Hotel (to cushion the stress of the house-move). My week at the Seasons was hugely enjoyable. From the moment I walked through the doors, I felt a deep sense of calm and peace. I stayed for a week, spending about Euro 240 a night for my room. It was very spacious, overlooking the training arena for showjumping horses at the Royal Dublin Society. The room featured one of the most comfortable beds I have ever inhabited, facing a large, state-of-the-art, flat-screen television (which really ""hit the spot"" given that the swimming and gymnastics events in the London Olympics had just started round about the time I stayed in the hotel). I should also mention the alluring bathroom, fitted with a shower that was so ergonomically perfect it could have been the work of a cutting edge Copenhagen-based designer.

During my sojourn at the Seasons, I invited four friends - all of them devotees of the war game called ""Risk"" - to join me in my room to sip a few beers together, play Risk and watch the London Olympics at the same time. We ordered entrees and desserts through room service. The service was exceptional, all the entrees arriving at the same time, all of them piping hot, handed to us by a waiter with the broadest of smiles on his face (who stayed with us for a few minutes to watch one of the swimming finals on television). Towards the end of my stay, I treated a few of my relations to Sunday lunch in the Seasons Restaurant. It was a great experience, a smorgasbord of different dishes on offer and the service was sublime. We rounded it off in the glass-walled conservatory, watching some of the younger members of our party gamboling in the summer sunshine on the grass lawn outside.

During my time at the Seasons, I ordered breakfast in my room a couple of times, as well as a couple of evening meals. The food was always alluring, served by individuals imbued with genuine joie de vivre and a love of their jobs. When I was checking out of the hotel, I bumped into a friend from Listowel in Co. Kerry who observed that, ""this is probably the best Dublin hotel I have ever stayed in.""  I share her sentiments in relation to this hotel. There's something special about the place which transcends the stresses and strains of modern day living.",5,2012,09,23
205,Truly Excellent,"Had a weekend here with some girls friends for the Lady Gaga concert. Everything about the hotel was First Class. If you want some comfort and luxury you won't go far wrong at the Four Seasons. Spa area fab, cocktails in Ice bar brill. staff very discreet and polite. Bedrooms large, beds very comfortable. Bathrooms everything you would expect from a five star hotel. Would recommend and will go back if staying in Dublin. 
",5,2012,09,23
205,Slice of heaven,"We started our arrival at the hotel by heading to the spa while our room was made ready. It was great to be able to take a shower after flying in from the US even though we did not have our room yet. Our room was comfortable, clean and quiet. The bathroom was a luxurious dream but no full length mirror to our dismay. The concierge personnel were excellent at giving us directions, making concert arrangements, and just in general helpful. Our favorite part of the stay was the wonderful care the bartender, Goran, at the bar Ice gave us. He is a true mixologist and very attentive to our needs. Hopefully the hotel realizes what a treasure they have in him. The biggest disappointment was the restaurant-service was at times slow and the food was average. Worth staying at if visiting Dublin.",5,2012,09,22
205,Standards have Slipped Slightly,"I have always enjoyed staying at this hotel as is evident from my previous review giving it 5/5. 

On my latest visit however I have noticed that the standards have slipped somewhat. The gorgeous flowers that used to decorate the lobby have gone. Also, the flower arrangements in the bar and restaurant have reduced in size significantly. These used to be one of my favorite things about this hotel. 

The white tablecloths have been removed from the restaurant and have not been replaced. The standard of food has decreased a lot. I remember my first dining experience at the Seasons Restaurant being one of the most memorable ever. However, I was disappointed with the new menu and presentation of the food on my most recent visit. 

The staff are as friendly and helpful as ever. I enjoyed my recent stay but some of the things that made this hotel 5/5 total luxury have gone. I appreciate that the hotel has decreased its prices and the current climate means they have to remain competitive. However, I feel that the luxurious feel to the hotel has been dampened somewhat.

I would still recommend this hotel but I it is not what it used to be unfortunately.",4,2012,09,22
205,Great place and terrific service,Thoroughly enjoyed our 1 night stay at the Four Seasons Dublin.  Outstanding service and they were able to accommodate us for an early check in after our arrival from the States.  Downfall is location as it's not walkable to anything a tourist is there to see.  Great breakfast with the best orange juice.,5,2012,09,21
205,Best hotel in Dublin,"Great rooms, impeccable service, great breakfast, only downside is the location which is not in the city centre and views are dull. Otherwise this is the best place to stay in Dublin in my opinion. Be sure to reserve in advance as this place is always fully booked!",5,2012,09,20
205,So comfortable and relaxed,Had a great stay. The staff are so friendly and make you feel comforable. They will do anything for you. Breakfast and dinner were amazing. The food was fresh and the staff you would not notice them but would always be their to help.,5,2012,09,20
205,"Four Seasons Dublin, Fabulous","I wish I had had more time.  I was only there for 2 nights and that was work.  My room was luxurious, large comfortable and clean, wonderful bed, exquisite bathroom with beautiful province toiletries.   The staff were very friendly and helpful.  The food was superb.",5,2012,09,19
205,Excellent service and hotel very nice but not exceptional,"Maybe I'm just getting a little bored with the FS theme but I didn't think the building was very interesting or special.  Don't get me wrong, this is still a Four Seasons with lovely carpetings and nice furniture, etc. but it lacked that wow factor that I've seen in the Four Seasons in Florence, NYC or Las Vegas.

The bedrooms were nice but I would say the same as above, this time the art and decor just seemed a bit prosaic.  The bathroom was, as always, a treat with lovely marble, crystal glass and a nice shower and bath.  

The breakfast was perfect with a stationed chef to make anything you would want.  Additionally, the service was wonderful and friendly.  

On location, I would prefer to be more in the heart of Dublin.  The hotel sits in a perfectly lovely neighborhood on the outskirts of Dublin.  It is perfect for walks with great views of the ocean and there are some nice restaurants in the neighborhood.

In summ. this is a great hotel but I don't think the building and furnishings are as interesting as other hotels in the FS fleet.",4,2012,09,19
205,Excellent hotel,"We stayed only one night but the hotel was beautiful. Front desk staff were welcoming and ready to assist in anyway they could.  Concierge was extremely helpful.  We ate dinner elsewhere but did have a nice breakfast.  We did upgrade to a suite and it was very spacious.   The only drawback is that it is situated a ways from the city center.  It did not have a ""pub"" style bar and no locals so you do miss the opportunity of conversing with the locals.  We did go to Paddy Cullens Pub, a short walk around the corner.",5,2012,09,17
205,Utter Indulgence,"We have just returned from a wonderful weekend at The Four Seasons.  It was flawless.  It is a little oasis - away from all the city centre.  Although I will admit - the hotel was buzzing with excitement - with Lady Gaga staying for the weekend.  

The superior room we had was huge - with a fantastic ultra comfy king sized bed.  The bathroom was gigantic - with a fabulously deep bathtub.  The room also had a top of the range Samsung TV (with a full range of TV channels too) - we didn't use it much but it was nice to have it.  We had room service twice daily (including turn down and fresh towels every evening).  Staff were lovely throughout the hotel.  Every square inch of the hotel oozed 'luxury' and 'elegance'.  Small items in the room such as the L'Occitane toiletries, slippers and gowns, proper wine glasses and ice bucket were all lovely touches.  

I will admit that the only little gripe I had was that Four Seasons is a brisk 30 minute walk into city centre (or a €9-10 taxi ride).  They have a chauffeur who will drive you into town in their new 7 series BMW (free of charge).  It is on a first come first served basis though.  We spent quite a lot on taxi's over the 3 days we were there - as we felt we were wasting too much time walking, waiting for buses, DART etc.

We didn't eat at the hotel as we had reservations made in the city centre.  

The Four Seasons is ideal for a nice treat or a special occasion.  I would say you definitely get what you pay for!!!!!!",5,2012,09,17
205,"A bit off the beaten track, but very nice","I just returned from a two night stay at this hotel. It is about a 5-10 minute taxi ride to the city center, but in a nice a quiet area. I was told that it was a walkable distance, but I don't really think that's the case unless you want to spend a good part of your day walking.
   I was staying in their entry level king deluxe room and it was very nice with a beautiful bathroom. In my opinion, it lacked the little something that usually makes a Four Seasons hotel special. Also, they charge for internet access and if you have two devices they you are forced to take their premium internet package which costs 25 euro per day - not huge but an annoyance. It seems to be a better choice for a business traveler than for someone in Dublin for leisure.",4,2012,09,15
205,How to feel like a VIP,"I have just returned from fleeting visit to Dublin and was totally bowled over by this hotel. It has an air of tranquility and the staff are exceptionally courteous and charming - a ready and engaging smile from each and every one - front desk, concierge, waiting staff, barmen. The room - as always with Four Seasons - has a feel of luxury, but not overstated or brash in any way. I wanted to transport the bathroom home! The bedlinen is of the highest standard and I had the best night's sleep that I've had in a long time. Dinner was excellent, breakfast too. It is expensive, but I was fortunate to have been on a negotiated rate which made this extremely good value for money. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2012,09,13
205,Nice hotel - some distance from centre,"Really nice hotel, we only stayed two nights and ate out in Dublin so didn't get to try its service and evening food. Even though we opted for the cheapest room type (recommended unless you want a suite, as the only difference is the view) it was large and well appointed. We did have breakfast one morning - was very good but hard to justify the cost. You can get a taxi to the city and have an equally good breakfast with the locals and have money left over.
If like us, you'll not have chance to benefit from the 5* service, and you've come to see Dublin, not an international hotel, I'd suggest somewhere a bit more central. It'll very likely not have the elegance of the four seasons, but you'll be right in the heart of one of Europe's great cities.

None of these are failings of the hotel, and it would get a higher rating if it was more central.",4,2012,09,09
205,Best of Dublin,"This is my third time staying here for a one-week stay. It is an incredible hotel with amazing guest rooms, where you can sleep the day away (amazing blackout shades), dine on incredible cuisine and be treated far above the norm. If you have the chance to stay here, DO!",5,2012,09,09
205,Perfect stay,"My 11 year old daughter and I stayed for two nights in August 2012 during the Dublin Horse Show. Although the hotel was bursting at the seams, this did not affect the quality of the service which was absolutely top-notch. Said daughter was delighted to find a chocolate horse head in the room upon arrival. We had a superior room which looked out over the showgrounds and was very spacious and luxurious with a fabulous marble bathroom. The quality of the bedlinen was exceptional - once in bed we were tempted to just stay there! We ate in Seasons restaurant on Friday evening and the food was very good wirh a good selection for my (picky) daughter although I was a little disappointed to find a somewhat limited adult menu - presumably because of the large numbers passing through at this busy time. Nevertheless I was able to find a very tasty seabass dish! Overall the service in the resraurant was great.  Breakfast was equally good with a huge selection of hot and cold fayre. Although this is a 5* hotel there is nothing pretentious about it all. I must finally add that for the few smokers left, it is worthwhile going to this hotel simply to experience the smoking area! I have never seen anything like it anywhere else. No huddling beside a single ashtray outside the door in the rain here - rather a covered veranda with numerous padded benches, a wall heater and a flat screen TV!  We stayed at this hotel in July 2012 also. Having stayed in other 5* hotels in Dublin, this hotel wins hands down every time for me.",5,2012,09,09
205,Deserving of all rewards!,"Exceptionally grand.  Wonderful service, fantastic accommodations.  I recommend walking down the street (Merrian changes names to Pembroke Road) for dinner at the Lobster Pot!  Get specific directions to the airport.  If dropping off a rental car, KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING before hand!  We missed our flight because of poor directions/instructions!",5,2012,09,08
205,It does exactly what it says on the tin!,"Dublin's Four Season's meets the expectations of any traveller looking for the trademark Four Season's luxury and service. It is well located but it is not city centre, which is a short taxi trip away. The rooms and food are excellent as is the five star service. There a large lounge and excellent business centre. I would have no hesitation in recommending this Hotel to any traveller who hass the budget for it.",5,2012,09,07
205,All Expectations Were Met,"We stayed one night and were thoroughly pleased with our stay.  Room was large, excellent king size bed, an enormous flat tv screen...at least 45""....good internet but an additional cost of 12 euros for 24 hours. The bathroom was perfect, very large, with the deepest tub.  Separate toilet room and good his and her robes.

 In the morning, the lobby has a terrific Nespresso machine for your coffee needs, a variety of teas, complimentary small muffins and fruit.  This was all we needed before catching our flight.  The location is approximately 10 minutes from the center of town by car.  It's located in the best suburb of Dublin.  A few blocks from the hotel, there are several convenience stores and small cafes, one of which was a wood fired pizza place. 

We had just finished a two week cruise from the Arctic so we weren't interested in any gourmet type of dining so we just had a pizza; in fact, we brought it back to our room.

Excellent and courteous staff......we would definitely stay there again because it offered quality, comfort and refinement.",5,2012,09,06
205,Wonderful friendly hotel,"We stayed at the Four Seasons Dublin in July for three nights with our little dog - a toy poodle  The room was beautiful but the welcome was outstanding - even our poodle was welcomed back to the hotel by everyone in reception every time we came back from a day out. Nothing was too much trouble and although a five star hotel there was a wonderfully informal and friendly atmosphere . The food, facilities, service and room were all five star  and I would not hesitate to recommend the hotel particluarly when travelling with a small dog. I know how difficult it can be to find true dog friendly accommodation in a five star hotel but this hotel fits the bill perfectly",5,2012,09,06
205,Excellent,"Dublin is a wonderful and lovely city to live. Exciting nature, friendly people, beatifull buildings... And I want to say only one word for Four Seasons Hotel Dublin. Extremely PERFECT. Thank you for everything.",5,2012,09,05
205,Excellent stay!,While in business in Dublin I decided to stay a few extra days and stayed at the Four Seasons Dublin!  Wonderful stay!  Staff very friendly and informative--upon checkin the staff at the front desk gave me suggestions for site seeing and restaurants.  I had been to this hotel before and it is still excellent.  Top-notch service and a nice atmosphere to relax after a day out site seeing.  Food was delicious!  While the hotel is located within a 5 minute ride to the city center the hotel provides a complimentary car/driver which was perfect.  Cannot wait to go back!,5,2012,09,05
205,The Fantastic Four!!!,"This was the best place to begin my 16-day trip to Ireland!  The staff really went out of their way to give me the perfect start to my mostly amazing time in Ireland.  The stand-out people were Stephanie who I believe was a manager and Jennifer at the front desk.  They made sure that I was happy with my room and saw to it that it met my standards.  I chatted with both of them during my four days there and they always greeted me very kindly.  

Andy & Goran in the Ice Bar were also super friendly & they were fun to talk to when they weren't helping other guests.  I spent more than a couple of nights in there as I returned at the end of my trip from another hotel in order to finish where I had started.  I was disappointed that I was not told about the Ice Bar when I was being shown to my room on my first day.  I discovered it by chance on my third day.  They should mention it when taking people up to their rooms.  

I spent a lot of time in the residents bar as well.  One lead bartender was not very friendly on my first night but warmed up on the second day.  He was like that with others as well because I saw him in action.  There was another bartender there who was moving to Dubai and he was very personable.  

I had dessert outside on my second day when it began to rain hard within a matter of seconds and the staff came running to rescue me and my chocolate mousse.  The mousse was so-so but I am extremely picky about patisseries as I have amazing places in Kobe and visit them almost daily.  Ice cream on top of chocolate mousse?!  

The location of the Four Seasons was great for me.  Ballsbridge was a pretty area of Dublin and I felt very safe walking around there day and night.  I didn't find it out of the way at all.  If you can pay for the Four Seasons, you can pay for taxis to take you to/from the center of the city.  I only tried one restaurant within walking distance and the name was Roast.  It's on the Four Seasons map of Dublin.  Their pork roast was excellent.  

My room was on the 4th floor and facing out from the front of the hotel with a beautiful view.  I had a balcony and as soon as I got there, I went outside to check out the scenery and there was a rainbow over the sea in the distance.  I took that as a good sign and it turned out just right.  

Another minor thing I noticed was the cleanliness in the lobby lounge.  There were clearly two head-sized oil spots on the back of the leather sofas in the corner of the room.  We get these on the windows on Japanese trains and I always point them out to my friends which really disgusts them because they like to lean their heads back to rest during commutes until I show them the oil smears.  Well, I assume that ten years of oily heads resting on those sofas have left their mark.  Slightly nasty.

Also, when I was sitting on said sofas after escaping the rain, I was sitting lower and facing the other tables so I was able to see food crumbs built up along the sides of the chairs in front of me.  They reminded me of the first class seats on two of my flights this summer when I had to brush food off of my seats.  Also, they had food particles caked-up along the sides that I didn't dare touch.  Same feeling when I saw those chairs in the lobby lounge.  

They were remodeling the lobby when I went back on my last night in Ireland so I am hoping that means that the oil-head stained sofas and crumb-encrusted chairs will be replaced before my next visit.   

Overall, I had an amazing stay at the Four Seasons and it set the stage for an almost perfect first-time trip to Ireland.  I fell hard for Dublin due to this incredible hotel with its mostly flawless staff as well as this pretty and peaceful area of the city.",5,2012,09,04
205,amazing,"Me and my friend were not staying here but went for the afternoon-why not! The flowers were beautiful-the guy told me they have their own florist-it shows!, the service was first class. We had a wonderful afternoon. It was not as expensive as people think and a clever way to spend an afternoon in the lap of luxury! Excellent staff. Im bringing my mum next time!",5,2012,09,04
205,A very special treat,"We are not the sort of people who usually stay at luxury hotels - we love to travel, but to maximize the number of trips, we tend to choose economical places. This time, we decided to give ourselves a special treat. And what a treat it was! We received excellent value for the money. We went on a package that included two dinners for two, breakfast, and a standard room. Well, that room was anything but standard. We felt enclosed in luxury. Large bathroom - with a separate shower and tub, puffy towels, lots of room for all your toiletries. A separate toilet area. Marble, marble, marble. Lights in the closets. The world's most comfortable beds! As for the meals, they were also excellent. My daughter is still talking about the hot chocolate she had a breakfast, complete with clotted cream and a pure chocolate straw.

A unique experience, totally worth the extra money in exchange for the happy memories!",5,2012,09,03
205,one of the best,"Spent an excellent weekend in the Four Seasons - Dublin.
Decided to spoil ourselves and had booked an executive suite - but we were pleasantly surprised to find on arrival an upgrade to a premium suite.
Super room with separate bedroom and seating/dining area, two bathrooms and walk in wardrobe/dressing room plus a kitchen.
Great view over the garden and fountain.
Service all round was top class.
Main restaurant good but we also enjoyed a ""pick and mix"" meal from the grazing menu in the trendy Ice Bar. Very tasty and good value.
Spa pool a bit disappointing - adequate but doesn't really live up to the ambience of the rest of the hotel.
Breakfast was also a bit ordinary for adults - hot buffet ok .However, kids menu was super with very tasty pancakes and blueberries ordered and consumed !
Good location only 10 minutes from the city sights.
All round a super hotel.",5,2012,09,01
205,"Nice hotel, shame about the extra costs","This hotel is in a nice location if you prefer to be away from the bustle of the city. Quiet, stylish, big and comfortable room. I felt it represented poor value for money when a 220 euro room for one person does not include breakfast AND they do my pet hate of charging for wifi in the rooms! Honestly, even 3* Bewleys does free wifi. The 22 euro breakfast was unexceptional and I decided not to pay 10euro to have Internet access during my one-night stay. Shame as the place is lovely. I don't think a hotel needs to be a rip-off to be luxurious.",4,2012,08,30
205,Great Start of Our Ireland Trip,"Our family was lucky enough to go on a tour of Ireland sponsored by my husband's employer. This hotel is absolutely stunning. Service was excellent. We used the pool and hot tub every day. The gym was great! I didn't get a chance to use the facilities at the spa, but they were lovely too. Walking distance to many restaurants in Dublin, it cost 10 euro by cab to get to the main city. If you can, get the toffee-banana french toast for breakfast. Scrumptious!

P.S. While my daughter and I were entering the lobby of the hotel, Paul Simon was on his way out. He was performing in Dublin the same time we were there. Of course my eleven-year old daughter had no idea why I was so excited to walk by ""Paul Simon"". Who's that? :)",5,2012,08,29
205,City Break,Absolutely fabulous hotel.   Our room was extremely comfortable and was a great size.  We would certainly highly recommend this hotel to family and friends.  Great spa and the staff were more than helpful.  We were a little dissapointed as a family that the menu choice in the main restuarant had been reduced because of the Dublin Horse Show but the staff were very helpful in allowing us to choose from the bar menu but dine in the restuarant.,5,2012,08,28
205,Chef's Table in the Kitchen - Superb!!!,"We have stayed at the 4S's many times and always love it. Omar and Mike greet you at the front door like old friends and the front desk staff are wonderfully efficient, including Jason and Jennifer.

However, what made this stay very special was the new option of dining at the Chef's Table INSIDE the kitchen! Last night we were treated to THE most exquisite food. Executive Chef Terry White was most hospitable and even took photographs of our party to email to us. Adam and Stephane looked after the majority of our food and drink but the entire team were so good - they showed us what they were doing, let us watch and it was truly fabulous. The food was off-piste and included several dishes that they were thinking of adding to the general menu. I can honestly say that every single course and every wine accompaniment were perfect! Our party couldn't criticise a single thing during the almost four hours we were there (our choice to go slowly).

After dinner we fell in to bed. Next morning, we then had the fabulously famous 4S's breakfast to contend with - as always, Fiona was at breakfast to look after everyone's individual needs.

There is a new General Manager at the hotel - a Dubliner called Robert Nolan - he should be very proud of the team at the hotel. They are really first class and amongst the best in the world at what they do - making people feel special.",5,2012,08,26
205,Now this is what Four Seasons is all about.,"Stayed recently for three nights, but I have stayed here on numerous occasions in the past. I have also attended several functions here over the years. Excellence is the byword for this hotel. Excellence in service, dining and the property. Some complain that it is too removed from the city.  However it is really only 5 minutes by car and the courtesy car is, more often than not available to bring you into town. It is after all situated in one of the most exclusive areas of the city, so I don't see what the problem is.
A family member of mine died a short time ago. I needed somewhere central for relatives to gather to plan arrangements over a lunch. I calledto book lunch in Seasons and asked for a table in the corner. When they heard what it was for, they immediately offered me the private dining room free of charge. It could not have been more ideal. I will never forget the genuine kindness shownto my family and I by the staff, on that occasion. Since then I have been an even more loyal Four Seasons Customer. 
My most recent experience was no different from all the previous ones -perfect. And even if there is a small problem it will immediately be put right. Keep it up.",5,2012,08,26
205,A Delight from Beginning to End,"We work most of the year in the Middle East and took great pains to come up with what would be the ultimate getaway from the scorching desert during the problematical month of August, which is normally a hot, busy tourist time. We could not have done better with selecting the Four Seasons in the cool, green, fresh-air city of Dublin. We noted that reviews here of the Four Seasons were favorable and opted for a 10 day stay in a Queen Deluxe Room. We were pleased with our choice of city and hotel from beginning to end.

The breakfast is not normally included, but it can be, and we had it included in our stay. We had forgone another Dublin hotel that is known for a first-class breakfast. We actually found the Four Seasons breakfast to be among the best we've had at 5-star hotels. The Eggs Benedict and Eggs Florentine with hollandaise sauce were pure perfection, American bacon was crispy, coffee and tea were the best available, and the service was exceptional. Breakfast is served as late as 11 a.m. 

We were very pleased with the room, which had a large bathroom with privacy toilet, quality Verbena shampoos and shower gels, very ample closet and drawer space, cozy seating by the window and balcony, a desk, a very well stocked mini bar with refrigerator, a carafe to make fine coffee and tea in room, and the best of all: a fluffy, cozy bed with just the right pillows and duvet for a good nights' sleep that is neither too hot nor too cold. The reviewer who mentioned the lack of coffee and tea making facilities must have overlooked the carafe which is delivered after arrival, and contains a wonderful selection of coffees and teas. We also received a complimentary tray with ice and Bailey's Irish Cream. Nothing could be a finer end to an evening before slipping into the cozy bed than a visit to the spa hot tub relaxation, for which purpose you will find soft robes and slippers in the room, followed by a Bailey's on ice and maybe one of the fine restaurant desserts. 

The decor in the room is beautiful and thoughtfully done, with mood-lifting colors and a home-like feel. The rooms are so well cleaned that they always smell clean. The blackout curtains provide a quiet, restful sleep at any hour. We were there during the horse show and guests were very noisy up until the wee hours, but the hotel management was extremely attentive and professional in making this up to us. 

The concierge and reception services were excellent, and our requests were fulfilled flawlessly in a professional, friendly and personalized manner. Since travelers here will want to make dinner reservations in Dublin restaurants, the concierge will handle those reservations, help guide recommendations if needed, and send a printed confirmation letter. This confirmation letter is very useful with tours, as one tour operator did not have us listed but the hotel's letter cleared up the oversight. The Four Seasons concierge staff is very knowledgeable and helpful equipped with every possible means to advise as to tours in Dublin and all around Ireland, providing maps, brochures, and advise. They also assisted us with a lost item at the airport. 

The only thing we would have changed is that we would have like to have the WiFi included rather than having to pay Eur 12.00 for each day of use. If it were worked into the price and offered as a free amenity it would be smoother. There are computers available free of charge for use, however, and this is appreciated. 

We liked the proximity of the Four Seasons as it is close to some fine restaurants. Roly's in particular is quite nice and is only about a 10 minute walk. Within a five minute walk are double-decker buses and the Dart Train, from which many wonderful areas of interest can be reached. I highly recommend becoming familiar with the Dart and the stops as this is the way to experience some charming parts of Dublin and the surrounding areas which most tourists miss. Remember, people in Dublin are friendly and there are both cultural city sights and unspoiled, beautiful country settings to be seen. If you are staying at the Four Seasons and you have a beautiful day on your hands for walking, try taking the Dart train to Bray and walk to Graystones. Some friendly gentlemen we met advised us of this little-known gem. You can walk a beautiful country path by the Irish sea and pick up the Dart again to return to the Four Seasons. If we visit Dublin again, we will not hesitate to book at the Four Seasons.",5,2012,08,26
205,beautiful hotel,"Stayed one night B&B mid week and ate in the restaurant that night. The minute you arrive at the door you are made to feel welcome , and the lobby has a relaxed atmosphere also. The check-in was smooth and fast and our room was upgraded free of charge. The rooms are beautiful with many nice touches , the beds are excellent and everything in the room was neat,clean,tidy and in perfect working order. The spa and pool etc are fantastic and just what i expect from a 5 star hotel. The staff are very polite, courteous and efficient. Our only let down was the restaurant which had many of the dishes the same as on the lobby bar menu and as such it felt like pub grub and not the fine dining experience we were hoping for.. It was a disappointment that the food was not a bit more special and this meant that our evening was not just as good as the rest of the hotel experience.
Overall this is still my favourite hotel in Dublin and one i will return to many times.",5,2012,08,23
205,3 day business trip - excellent service.,"Great hotel - with a fantastic combination of rooms, people, service, clearning, bar, fitness & others. A complete package for both business and pleasure. I will be back both for business and with my family.",5,2012,08,22
205,the good life..,"simply the top one can expact.all staff is very high quality,
loby is charming food is great and almost the only place in dublin with ourdoor sitting.
if you can afford it-do not hasitate.
i visited the other luxury hotels(shulborn,merrion) sorry -non of them is even close to the four seasons",5,2012,08,20
205,World Class Hotel - World Class Service.,"World class in every way, this has changed my way of thinking. I had rather avoided the big brand hotel in the past in favour of the ""Boutique Brigade"", I had the impression they were rather soul-less places, I was wrong. The Four Seasons was full of soul - Horse Show week - of course it would be! But we had no false impressions as we actually arrived before the masses and the service was impeccable throughout, nothing was too much trouble, & we did give the concierge plenty to think about, poor thing, but she delivered every time, thank you! The room was lovely too, with a superb view of Dublin Bay. I thoroughly recommend the Four Seasons for quality, elegance, soul, and service. I didn't want to leave & I can't wait to go back. Well done guys..I won't avoid the Four Seasons brand in future..in fact I might embrace it for a change.",5,2012,08,17
205,Real 5 star hotel,"I once read a review for this hotel saying "" you walk in and float out "". That statement says it all. I have stayed hear a number of times and i can or have never found fault. Best staff and best hotel in Dublin",5,2012,08,15
205,A grand hotel with Dublin hospitality,"Just returned from a long weekend and thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the FS Dublin. A wonderful staff awaits you here. They tend to your every need and anticipate those needs as well. Having never been to Dublin, they were very helpful and honest about what should be the highlighhts of a long weekend.  
Generously sized rooms and wonderful room service - ""he best club sandwich i've ever had"" remarked my companion. 
Wonderful spa, pool, sauna etc. 
Their lobby is quite large and in the middle of a seamless renovation. We didn't even realize that it was going on.",5,2012,08,14
205,GRAND!!!!,This hotel was wonderful! I had never been out of the country and was concerned about the hotel having accessibility for my son who uses a wheelchair. They had the biggest roll in shower and even had a shower seat for us to use! The bathroom was huge. The concierge found us a tour that had a wheelchair accessible van to take us on trips. The breakfast each morning was superb. The staff were all so nice- it was like coming home every day after sightseeing.,5,2012,08,13
205,Amazing Hotel,"I have stayed and dined in the four seasons on many occasions and every time I receive unbeatable service. I get the feeling the staff would literally jump up & down ten times if you asked them to, they cannot do enough for their customers. The food is something worth going back for, I have yet to stay in a hotel that can match it. The restaurant and lobby both serve mouth watering dishes. Some may think it's a little pricey however the quality is worth it. The service at the four seasons, quality of the food and friendliness of its staff are the reasons I will continue to visit the hotel, I have yet to find a five star hotel to match it.",5,2012,08,13
205,Older Four Seasons but usual high quality,"This was an older Four Seasons but overall still very pleasant and high quality. Our suite was lovely with all the usual great amenities. We stayed there 1 week and it was a sweet, relaxing place to come back to after touring, walking all over Dublin. The spa, fitness center is a must to visit daily with warm pool and jacuzzi to relax in and nice provided amenities, lockers, including teas, coffee, fresh fruit, muffins as well as a convenient sauna, beauty salon and massages. Expect rains any time so be prepared with your own umbrella, from the room, or get one at the door. There are always cabs available for further excursions or its a 10 minute walking distances to a some nearby pubs and restaurants. The hotel has a few nice restaurants as well but the prices are higher and the food was OK. Overall service is always good, professional though not as friendly as Four Seasons staffs are known for.",4,2012,08,08
205,Great place to stay,"We stayed here for 3 nights with our two boys.  It was thoroughly enjoyable - it is not cheap, but if you are looking for a treat this is a great place to stay. From the moment we arrived, when the boys received welcome treats, nothing was too much trouble.  We had a suite, which was wonderfully large and meant everyone had plenty of space.  Indoor pool also came in handy.  Hotel is slightly outside of Dublin, but not so far that a taxi ride is expensive (or you can walk a block and catch the train).  We will visit again (in fact, we already have our next booking).",5,2012,08,05
205,OUTSTANDING Service and a Beautiful Hotel!!!,I travelled to Ireland with two friends to celebrate a 50th Birthday.  After touring Ireland for four days we arrived in Dublin for a  four night stay at the Four Seasons to see two Bruce Springsteen Concerts.  The staff from the Doormen to Diedre at checkin to Rakeesh our waiter in the bar lounge and of course the Concierge and his twin brother were fantastic.  Everything and MORE that we could have asked for.,5,2012,08,03
205,An excellent hotel in line with what I have come to expect of the Four Seasons.,"I'm always impressed by the Four Seasons and Dublin was no exception. Great service, excellent accommodations, great location, and everything else that the Four Seasons does so right to ruin other hotels for me.",5,2012,08,01
205,Fantastic hotel and beautiful location.,"Beautiful accomodations and fantastic service. The hotel is a great value for the traveller. We loved the warmth of the staff and the beauty and comfort of the rooms. The food is delicious from breakfast to afternoon tea, to dinner. Every service we received from the fine staff exceeded our expectations. Our rooms were spacious, well-maintained, and spotless. The location is in a residential area some distance from the city centre. We appreciated the quiet and the loveliness of the area. A short taxi ride or thirty minute walk gets you to the hustle of Trinity Square.",5,2012,08,01
205,Spectacular Hotel,Stayed here the weekend with our 2 little babies.  From check in to check out the staff couldnt have been more friendly. Would highly recommend this hotel got a beautiful junior suite and the decor and cleanliness was excellent.  Food was superb.  Will definately be back.,5,2012,08,01
205,Great hotel but ....,"Had a wonderful time at the Four Seasons Hotel this weekend. The hotel's decor was simple but elegant, the furniture in their lounge and in our room was plentiful and very comfortable. Everywhere was meticulously clean. Our bathroom was well stocked with L'Occitane products ranging from bath/shower gel to body lotion. A good supply of little round cotton wool pads and cotton buds were put in a small glass pot on the shelf. 

We had our Sunday breakfast brought to our room. It came on a trolley with a warming cabinet attached to one side. My husband had the full Irish breakfast while I tried the power breakfast. This consisted of a huge portion of warm oatmeal porridge made with skimmed milk. There was a big glass of freshly squeezed orange juice for each of us, a tall glass filled with fresh fruit and Greek yogurt that had been layered with a generous sprinkling of granola. A large rack of freshly malted toast with the usual small jars of marmalade and jams finished off this grand breakfast feast!!  

All the staff were attentive and eager to assist with all forms of enquiries. My husband and I were due to attend a wedding on the Saturday so we decided to make a long weekend break. We flew in to Dublin on Friday, went to the wedding on Saturday and spent a good part of Sunday in room chilling ... watching the Olympics on TV, reading the Sunday newspapers, surfing the net and of course catching up on sleep.  

The only reason I cannot give the hotel an ""excellent"" review is that the Four Seasons Hotel charge for using their internet. I have never in my life had to pay for using the internet in a 5 star hotel! I feel as a 5 star hotel, the use of the internet should be included in the price of the room. It doesn't bode well as Bewleys Hotel over the road is a 3 star hotel and the use of internet is included for free. Still, it is a minor detail about having to pay 12 Euros per day for the use of the internet. My husband and I had a fabulous stay at the Four seasons Hotel and would definitely stay there again. Thank you for a great weekend.",4,2012,07,30
205,"An oasis of luxury and exceptional service, always worth a stay.","I absolutely love the Four Seasons, from being greeted by the wonderful doormen, to the concierges who are a treasure of information. Rooms and suites are generally more spacious than other hotels of its calibre, and the decor and ambience are the epitome of understated elegance. The service, from reception, to room service are second to none.",5,2012,07,29
205,Nothing compares,"I always look forward to my stay at the Four Seasons in Dublin. The service is always exceptional and I feel at home when I walk in the door and am greeted by the staff. Next I go up to my bedroom and find Coke and popcorn is waiting for me! The beds are so comfy! The ultimate home-to-home experience. The hot chocolate is amazing and I would recommend going to the restaurant in the evening, theres a good choice of food and the prices are reasonable. The pool is nice and the dressing rooms are amazing with drinks available.This hotel is the only place where you will get Loccitaine toiletries which I love. 
Definitely the best place to stay if you don't want to be in the city centre. But is easy accessible via taxi, DART or Dublin Bus!",5,2012,07,29
205,Dazzling Dublin Hotel!,"We were given an upgrade to a junior suite upon arrival. The room was bright, clean and tastefully appointed. Our view was not wonderful as we overlooked the hotel's roof. I really did not care. Our surroundings made up what was lacking. We started our day with an abundant breakfast buffet which was the best one on our adventure.
Yummy!!! The choices are mouth-watering!!!
The service was top-notch! Even the maids that turned down my daughter's bed were polite and well-spoken. They made sure that we had everything we wanted and more!
The highlight of our stay was High Tea. It was one of the most decadent events ever. I must say that as a tea lover, I was thrilled to try two flavors that will remain my favorite ! We were served tea sandwiches, champagne and fruits. Then the sweets arrived and we enjoyed clotted cream, scones with fresh fuit preserves. The best part were the macaroons, chocolate...heaven could not be closer.
We enjoyed the foods offered at the tea. Service was tops! I love staying at a Four Seasons property as they know how to treat their guests as they anticipate everything. I appreciate that everytime we travel, I hope that these hotel properties are available.
Comfort, luxury and helpfulness is key when I visit a major city.
The lobby is inviting and immaculate. Just top notch all around!",5,2012,07,26
205,Comfortable hotel,"Beautiful 40's style hotel, a few miles south of the city,  great breakfast, friendly staff, lovely spa.  25-30 euro taxi ride to the airport and 8-10 euro to town.  Fluffy robes and slippers as you would expect, including loads at the spa.  Tip - fruit & nuts at the spa if you want a snack plus shaving gear if you forget your own. One serious downside is the lack of tea making facilities in the room.",5,2012,07,26
205,Always Delightful,"I always look forward to by next visit to the Four Seasons Dublin. Service is usually exceptional, rooms are spacious, clean and relaxing. The hotels spa and pool facility ensures it stands out amongst other hotels in the area. The hotel restaurant is lovely and Sunday lunch is a must !",5,2012,07,25
205,Another great stay,"Whilst the hotel is a bit out of the centre, the quality of service, dining and breakfast is always great and couldn't be faulted.  I'm a regular visitor staying on business and always pleased to come back",5,2012,07,25
205,Really ??,"Have stayed in many Four Seasons hotels , with mixed results to be honest . I had read excellent reviews on the Dublin Four Seasons.

Xmas 2012 we attended an event here , and had high hopes of a lovely weekend away .  Have to say I wasnt bowled over . Its adequate at best . Did not like the decor at all . Despite this being a fairly new hotel , the decor was terribly dated .Not shabby , all perfectly clean , but our room was like stepping back to the 1980's . 

Bar was so overpriced it was just laughable , and restaurant was awful. Food cold , staff with dreadful attitudes , and once again , price was criminal. 

Have to be honest , for what I paid , i would have expected a lot more . I met two lovely american girls who were in Dublin for a weeks holiday . Even though they said they booked this hotel as they knew the Brand , they also were appauled at the service & standards for what was being charged . 

There are far better hotels in Dublin at much better rates . Even in the same area . Its a shame , but the stay here has actually stopped me booking any other Four Seasons since .",2,2012,07,23
205,Loved stay at Four Seasons,"We stayed a few days last week at the Four Seasons Hotel. The room was spacious and clean, bathroom was great. The service couldn't be faulted. We were in Dublin for the Bruce Springsteen concert and we were delighted that he and his band were staying there too, although we never managed to spot him.  The only comment I would make is that the pool is pretty small, but that is not why we were there. There is a great place to have breakfast or lunch called Maia (great coffee) in Ballsbridge.",5,2012,07,23
205,Flawed Diamond,"We love the Four seasons but why can't they sort the front desk out !! Having booked through Amex Platinum that guarantees early check in (12 noon) we arrived about 2ish but were told at check in that our room wouldn't be ready for another 20 minutes, after waiting in the lobby for 20 minutes we were told the room would be another 1/2 an hour ! The most frustrating part of this was the attatude of the staff and how we were dealt with. 5 star hotels not only have great rooms but give great service from great staff. Ps this isn't the first time we have had this treatment from the four season reception, please management sort it as otherwise you have a great hotel.",4,2012,07,22
205,Lovely hotel in quiet part of Dublin,"We stayed here for a quick gate away from the kids, we had breakfast and lunch and then walked about 5 mins down the road to the French Paradox for our dinner, and also had a beer in paddy cullens in ballsbridge again 5 mins from hotel. Might not be in the heart of Dublin but lots to do and see within walking distance. The room was nice decor getting a bit dated and could do with an update flat screens etc but fine. 
Breakfast was lovely and the breakfast room very spacious so you have your privacy which is nice, staff are attentive without being in your face. Will defo be back.",5,2012,07,21
205,Fours Seasons Hotel Dublin - exactly what you expect,"We stayed here on 18 July 2012 in a suite. From the moment you arrive until you leave you are aware you are in quality surroundings and high standards synominous with the Four Seaons brand. The staff deliver in every way, attentive and very focused on making sure your experience is exceptional. The prices for food and beverage are what you expect of a 5 star hotel but the quality from everything from the breakfast cup of tea to the chips served with a sprinkling of truffles, means you are not left questioning the final bill !
We had to quickly become accustomed to wondering through the hotel and finding yourself seeing some very well known figures, Steven Spielberg is shorter than we imagined - but we didn't stare because that would be rude!
I have slightly marked the location down as it is not completely central and you may need to utilise a taxi etc now and then but nothing really to worry about.
The actual suite was fantastic, large lounge area, balcony and the adjoining bedroom and bathroom were really spacious, clean, well appointed and tastefully decorated. The public areas were also very clean and elegantly presented. 
We will definitely be staying there when we next visit Dublin, and I would highly recommend this hotel, so go on - treat yourselves!",5,2012,07,18
205,Amazing !,"The hotel was stunning, service was amazing and the entire hotel, rooms and staff certainly had 'all the little touches'. Absolutely fantastic. ",5,2012,07,18
205,Excellent hotel well run,"Stayed at the four seasons for Springsteen concert next door rds . Room spacious , and spotless , food excellent , not expensive considering 1st class service we received in every department , will definitely return when there's a concert at rds which is a two min walk away , only negative was having to pay for wi fi €12 aday which wouldn't send emails for some reason but I could receive them , ",5,2012,07,18
205,far too expensive for what you get,more of a business hotel. we paid 305€ for a junior suite which was very nice and very clean but not even a complimentary bottle of water or tea making facilities in the room as we arrived after midnight. all extras had to be paid for and not even a continental brealfast was included in this price or free wifi at 12€ extra. Ive stayed in much better hotels for less. the location was very quiet and certainty not in the heart of Dublin. we'll be back to Dublin but definitely not this hotel,3,2012,07,18
205,Best choice in Dublin,I have stayed other five star hotels in Ireland too but this is the best by far in every sense. Recommend to anyone who visits Dublin.,5,2012,07,14
205,Favorite hotel in Dublin,"Large rooms, great gym, fantastic service, good food. I try to stay here whenever I am in Dublin. 

Tip: if you eat in the Seasons restaurant, try the chowder. ",5,2012,07,14
205,Great Stay In Dublin,"Stayed at The Four Seasons Dublin in June 2010.  Very elegant hotel in a nice quiet area in SE Dublin.

Pros:
We had exceptional service over our 3 night stay.  I especially remember Lars, the head bellman, who each day coming and going welcomed my wife and I to the hotel.  All members of the staff were very friendly and courteous.

""Full Irish"" breakfast was fantastic.  We only ate breakfast at the hotel, but if breakfast was any indication as to the quality and taste of the other fare, I'm sure it was good.

Exceptional room.  We had a king bed, which was very comfortable.  Not sure if our room was a standard room or not, but it was very large with a nice writing desk, large walk in closet, and a very nice bathroom.  House keeping was exceptional each day.

Very nice pool and jacuzzi, wish we had more time to enjoy it.

Cons:
Located approx. 20 mins. walk from St. Stephens Green and the city center.  We really enjoyed the walk, but if cold and rainy, or with kids, this is a bit far from the heart of Dublin.

To sum up, this is a fabulous hotel, extremely well kept, and served by a very friendly team.  We will hope to return on our next Dublin trip in fall, 2013!",5,2012,07,13
205,Loved it,Beautiful rooms and hotel.  Short distance from the city but much quieter than being right downtown.  Fantastic service. Concierge service was excellent.  A perfect stay.,5,2012,07,13
205,A regular and a favourite,"I like to consider myself a regular of this excellent hotel, and to consider it a favourite of mine. The staff are wonderful, the food fabulous and the rooms exquisite. The pricing is good, the amenities terrific and the location fantastic. 
Really, wha more can you want in a hotel?",5,2012,07,12
205,Great Service,"We stayed here for three nights for our first time in Dublin.  The Four Seasons is in an upscale neighborhood a little out of city center (about a 2 mile walk).  We liked not staying in the bustle of the city.  It was great to come home after a day of touring to a quiet comfortable hotel. The rooms were well appointed and bed was very comfy.  We had a junior suite and it was very roomy.  We had one problem when we signed up for Wifi and the signal showed but we could not get any pages to load.  Oh no I cannot survive without internet! Sad, I know, but true!  Anyway, Beni the IT manager came to our room and tried to help us out.  Nothing was working and we were getting frustrated.  After we returned from dinner we had a nice note from Beni saying that he set us up with our own access point in the room.  Sure enough we had faster internet than we have at home.  Wow, we were really impressed with how he went out of his way to help!  Great service hotel, do not hesitate to stay here!",5,2012,07,11
205,"Very good hotel, slightly out of the way","We had a brief stay here in July 2012.  The hotel is as well appointed as you would expect from a Four Seasons, so the bed was comfortable, the shower excellent, lighting in the room good.  There is a nice swimming poo, in the hotel, and staff were friendly.  The only drawback is that the hotel is located some way from the heart of Dublin, so each time that you want to go to a restaurant or see the sights you need a cab, though it is not so very far, around a 15 minute can ride to St Stephens Green. There is essentially nothing to criticise about the place except where it is placed.",4,2012,07,11
205,Surprised at Size of Rooms,"Great hotel to stay.  If you are looking for the better than standard room in Dublin, this is the spot.  Rooms are the same size as the 4 Seasons in the US.  Bathrooms are big.  Staff is attentive.  Great spa and workout room.  Location is a bit out of the way, but nothing a $11 euro cab ride can't fix:)",4,2012,07,11
205,Excellent hotel,"Very friendly service, comfortable room, best sleep I had in Ireland. Overall a great experience.",5,2012,07,11
205,Awe struck!,"I recently stayed for two nights here with my partner. I had never stayed at a Four Seasons hotel before, and didn't know what to expect. As soon as we entered we were made to feel welcome - even though we felt slightly out of place - considering everyone else was in suits! The hotel is extremely decadent, everything is of very high quality throughout. We were in the room no more than five mins when someone arrived with complimentary tea and coffee - and a birthday cake for my partner. We were made extremely comfortable for the duration of our short stay - I didn't want to leave. We had our breakfast ordered through room service - there was enough to feed about six people, and it was gorgeous! A very thoughtful man named Jason arranged our stay, we will remember the experience for a long time.",5,2012,07,10
205,A lovely hotel,"I stayed for business recently (3 nights), very nice hotel as you would expect for the price. Very nice spa and the food was very good in the bar. The drinks prices are expensive. All the staff I spoke to were very friendly and efficient, especialy the lady concierge (Diane I think) and the spa chap was very nice and helpful. It's a bit out of Dublin centre and a cab is needed if you want to go into town. Localy there is a pub/bar up the road (roast-wouldn't eat there again) and a couple of shops and pizza take aways.There is also a restaurant or two but I didn't try them.
The one thing that I didn't like that stopped me giving an excellent rating was there was no tea or coffee facility in the room and I havn't stayed in a hotel for a long time that doesn't supply that service-very poor..take a travel kettle! Also there is an area above the mini bar that resembles a local shop as they try and tempt you with very overpriced nibbles and drinks. I'd rather they put all that out of sight. There is a local shop 10 mins walk away so stock up if you snack. If your rich then go for what they provide as it looks good:) The bathroom was excellent!",4,2012,07,10
205,High-class and excellent service,This hotel is a high-class venue with excellent staff and service. From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave they really try hard to make you at home.,4,2012,07,10
205,Excellent but expensive,Very expensive but if you can afford it you will be very pleased.  We won a 2 night stay with one dinner and we had a fantastic time.  All the staff are friendly and helpful and always willing to help and make our stay enjoyable.  The hotel is very clean and our room (a junior suite) was excellent.  Our dinner was delicious although the dining room was a little cold but when we mentioned this to the staff they told us that they had arranged for the air conditioning to be turned down and returned to us several times to ask there was any improvement. Unfortunately we can not afford to stay again as everything is so expensive.,4,2012,07,09
205,Nice Place,"This is definitely 5 star living, great staff, good facilities, great room (we were given an upgrade without asking).  I went there under a special deal they had (3 nights for price of 2) so even the price was right.  My only issue was the location, which is outside the downtown walking area, but a quick city bus or taxi ride and we were at the heart of Dublin.  The concierge staff were particularly good.",5,2012,07,09
205,Very overpriced.,I won a night here in a standard room. Room is very dated with a tv that looks about 15 years old. Food is very overpriced. Ideal location but really not as luxurious as you would be led to believe.,3,2012,07,08
205,Beautiful modern hotel,"This hotel is exceptionally clean with staff very willing to help in any way.  The rooms are spacious and the beds are very comfortable.  The junior suites have large marble baths and a large walk in closet to store all your luggage and clothing.  The fitness center is the best we have ever seen in a private hotel with a large assortment of nautilus and aerobic machines.  They even have a Concept 2 rower!  The spa salon was very nice and accommodating with a short notice cut and color on the same day which was done with beautiful results.  The hotel restaurants are expensive and the food is very good, but not exceptional.  The one drawback to the hotel is the location.  It is next to the convention center and it is about a half hour walk to the center of Dublin.  There are very few choices in the neighborhood to eat. They have a courtesy car available in the afternoon only that will take you to an area near St Stephen's Green, but no return car is available, so you have to take public transportation, taxi or walk back to the hotel.",5,2012,07,07
205,"Posh, Luxurious, and Family Friendly?  I must be dreaming...","From now on, I will only stay in this hotel when in Dublin.  My hubby and I are dedicated to keeping up our travels even with our new addition, our 9 month old son.  When we booked into the Four Seasons, we were a little bit nervous about putting people out, but we wanted to splurge in Dublin.  We need not have worried.  The Four Seasons staff are just experts.  It helps that Ireland is a very family friendly and baby friendly place, but the staff here could not have been more welcoming and helpful.  The concierge and doormen even offered to watch our son, and several times got down on the hotel lobby space to play with him.  Amazing.  I was just flabbergasted.  The breakfast spread can't be beat, and there is something for everyone in your party--picky, omnivore, fitness freak, foodie, you name it.  My son went root down on the house smoked salmon here, that is how good it was.  We also had high tea included in our package, and it was well worth it.  So much fun, a nice way to relax away and afternoon, and you will leave very full.  I love this tradition and wish we had it more back home!  My son also loved the high tea, and the Four Seasons was completely accomodating of him and his 20 month old cousin who are fun loving boys, even at High Tea.  There is a gorgeous bar here.  Even the room service is terrific--really good nosh, which is not the typical at many hotels, and very efficient.  Not to be missed are the spa services, sauna, steam room, pool and hot tub.  After a long day of walking around Dublin, it is the perfect way to unwind.  The spa services are a bit on the pricey side, but you are paying for quality here--no short cuts, no half-assed massages or facials.  Here, they treat you like a goddess.  Even if you don't get their services, guests at the hotel are able to access the gym, pool, sauna, steam rooms and hot tubs between 6 am and 10 pm, with 8-10 pm being adults only.  This was such a treat.  Even with all of Dublin's pull, I will admit, we spent a couple of afternoons in, just to enjoy this spectacular hotel.  If you have little ones, they will bring up a crib, and the cutest thing--diapers, lotions, washes, and powders appropriate for baby, as well as a rubber ducky.  How cute is that?  They will even bring up age appropriate toys.  They are completely happy to accomodate all children.   It is those thoughtful little touches that make this worth splurging--but also make it a terrific choice for families.  I am guessing even teenagers would like this stay, and that is saying a whole lot!",5,2012,07,06
205,"""The Best""","Outstanding stay. It started with us asking for a early check-in,  Andrea at the front desk was able to get us in within thirty minuets of showing up a 11am.  While we waited in the meeting area we ordered three cappuccino's when I went to pay for it Andrea had already taken care of the bill for us. Now let's see if can tell me if you know any 5 star that will do that!    The rooms are immaculate nothing is tired. ( I saw the the rant by one TA member about the decor. there's nothing wrong with it). The bathroom is large with a shower and a separate tub, bright and Super Clean. The toilet is separate from the bathroom being a plus.  The beds are the best I have slept on since living in Europe. 

The Service is impeccable.  We had some problems with our wifi connection, Jason C of the  IT Dept came to our room to help us to resolve the problem.  Because of all the difficulties connecting there was no charge for what time we did get on.   Thanks Jason 

 By far one of the best Four Seasons I have stayed in.  Every one is gracious and accommodating and that alone gets high marks.   This is probably the best bet for your time in Dublin.    A truly ""no stress"" hotel.",5,2012,07,06
205,Typical high quality from Four Seasons,"Incredibly helpful and friendly staff for such  large chain (husband's checked bag missing, they fixed everything). As expected for the Four Seasons a high quality restaurant, but the real treat at the end of a long business day was the cozy wood-paneled bar with a superb whisky selection and knowledgeable staff. Comfortable room, great bed. Only drawback seems to be if you need to go to the conference center daily (I did) and it was a bit far and cabs are expensive.",5,2012,07,04
205,Irish tourist,"Hotel staff good but always pushing for extra spend it reached the stage where I found it annoying and took exception to it  
I have stayed there before but found the sales pitch on this occasion over the top",4,2012,07,01
205,Good beginning,"Impeccable service, favorite meal was breakfast.  Do try the lemon ricotta pancakes.  Half an order was all I could eat, but my son, the bottomless stomach guy, ate the rest.  Was one of the few places on our stay that offered artificial sweetener.  Room service was excellent.  Only surprise on my bill was charges for newspaper to our room. Two rooms, two papers, two days, €19 ouch.  Especially when it was in the lobby to read. The rooms seemed to be literally sound proof.  Had room darkening shades, so a great place to stay to recoup of jet lag.   The location is too far out to walk to City Centre. We spent about €20 plus a day on cab fare. Cabbies park on street outside of hotel entrance.  The hotel offers. Chauffeur service too.  Spa was lovely.  Pool big enough to swim laps.  You. An celeb watch in the lobby.  Saw the Red Hot Chili Peppers waiting for limo one day.The cabbies were always full of helpful info, especially where to eat for a good price.  In the U.S. I never eat food at a 7-11, but for sandwiches, scones, fruit, tip of hat to SPAR recommendation.",5,2012,07,01
205,A state of the art hotel,"Located in the chic area of Ballsbridge, this hotel represents the best of hotelerie for its elegance and high level of comfort, with a personal, particular relevance regarding breakfast, with an excellent service, and the spa, with a beatiful swimming pool. A must.",5,2012,06,28
205,Very enjoyable stay,"We stayed here three nights with a family of five and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  Our package through Amex Platinum included daily continental breakfast and one afternoon tea which was a mighty welcome break after a day of traveling in the rain.  The hotel accommodated us with the room set-up requested and the room was quite large by European standards.  It is two miles from the center of action and we tried to walk it as much as possible despite the rain.  Taxis that hold more than four passengers are rare and the Four Seasons House car had a similar limit.  If your group is 5+, expect to take two $15+ taxis to get anywhere which could be avoided with one of the more centrally located hotels.  Although I would consider this if coming back with a family, I would likely stay here again if returning just with my wife.",5,2012,06,27
205,Ive been in better 3stars!!,"I cannot BELIEVE that this hotel is supposed to be a five star!! It was in fact my second time staying here (i thought the first time was just a once off bad experience) with friends!! I have been in better three star hotels! 
The decor first of all awful! The rooms are the most miserable rooms I have ever been in!! We stayed in a Junior Suite last weekend and a Double Room on our previous visit!!We actually booked a suite this time as we disliked the room so much last time and we thought the suites would be nicer!!!NOT!!! They looked like they havent been renovated since the 1950s!!! The walls are yellow, the carpet is blue and the wood looks to be mahogony!!OLD FASHIONED!!!! Nothing luxurious or five star whatsoever!!!!!
Upon check in,we were told our room would not be ready for twenty mins!This in turn tured out to be two hours later!!!4.40 we went back to reception and finally got our key!!!450euro for one nights stay in a room we didnt even get for 24hrs!!!RIDICULOUS!!!!
Arriving for breakfast the following morning,we were told there was no table available for us and we would have to wait......no problem.....until we see larger parties being sat at their tables right before our eyes!!!
The food portions were TINY for the HUGE amount of money they cost! I actually ate my lunch and ordered seconds the portion was so small! It was unbelievable!!
Also, staff at the lobby area kept exiting through the emergency exit however there was no entry point outside to get back in so in fact, while we were trying to enjoy our weekend away, we kept having to get up from our table to allow the staff, who were knocking on the glass doorb,back into the building!!!! That is ridiculous!We were waiting on them!!!! Honestly, Id say this happened 5-6times during the course of our one night stay!!!!
I will never stay at this ridiculously overpriced hotel ever again!!!Its not worth HALF the money we paid for it!!!",3,2012,06,25
205,"Very comfortable - bed just divine, good breakfast, and service outstanding.","The Four Season's Hotel in Dublin doesn't really look fantastic from the outside, and is quite understated when you get inside.   But once you're actually in - then its worth it.   First of all the bedrooms are really spacious, and the bed is large and so so comfortable.   Crispy sheets and soft quilts and pillows.  A real pleasure and just what's needed for a good night's sleep.
Breakfast too was perfect with a choice of freshly prepared omelette (option to have it made with egg whites), all of the elements for a typical Irish breakfast and of course the usual selection of fruits, juices, yoghurts etc.  There is even a smoothie of the day.  Finally, a word about the service - the concierge are really helpful, and found a solution for me to resolve a small package that needed sending.",5,2012,06,25
205,Sheer luxury,"The real luxury of this hotel is its convenience, Friendly staff, excellent food and a sense of sheer heaven.
Have stayed here on many occasions and one is guaranteed all of the above each time.
Very handy for the Dart or the bus into the city and lovely to walk to the beach in Sandymount if you want to get the holiday feeling.
Lovely to relax and watch the world go by and children are always catered for.",5,2012,06,24
205,Mid Week Luxury Break,"During a week of renovation on our house we decided we had to get away for a few days and booked into the Four Seasons - not a million miles away from our home.After check in we left the hotel by car to do some shopping and on our return the road to the hotel had been closed by police due to a major event happening nearby. We were unable to return to the hotel and missed our dinner reservation at a nearby restaurant. The hotel should have advised that this was happening but didn't. When we spoke to them about this they couldn't have been nicer - immediately accepted responsibility and offered us dinner at Seasons restaurant on them.

Overall our stay was very relaxing and we enjoyed the luxury of the room and the spa. Very nice bar also. Only thing we didn't avail of was breakfast which at €29 was a bit too expensive - plenty of places nearby for this.",5,2012,06,22
205,Sour Taste,"After 23 days around the UK we were expecting to finish with Top Notch Service at The Four Seasons.  Unfortunately, the concierge desk and the ""Misprints"" on the menus left a sour taste.  The concierge desk were pre-occupied with their computers and less then attentive to our needs.  That I can live with since everyone can have a bad day.  After ordering smoothies 2 days in a row and being charged over the menu price listed in the gym (5 euro) and being charged 6 euro.  I obviously didn't say anything as the Spa is very accommodating and what's a euro anyway's.  However, when ordering the Spanish Brandy listed at 7 euros and being charged 10 we finally decided to say something.  We were told it was a ""Misprint"" on the menu.   There we were 2 Gentlemen that did save the stay.   One was Mr. Parker at the front and the other was the Gent taking care of the Spa.",2,2012,06,21
205,Wouldn't stay anywhere else now in Dublin.,"Having stayed here for a couple of nights I now would not stay anywhere else in Dublin. It was perfect - the rooms are glorious, the welcome very warm and the hotel is in a league of its own. I'd certainly stay here above the Conrad, Shelbourne or Dylan - having stayed in them all. The only thing is that its a good 25 minute walk into Town so if you want the convenience of falling in and out of a Hotel this wouldn't suit you - but cabs are ten a penny!",5,2012,06,20
205,One of the Finest Hotels I have Ever Stayed In! Attention to Every Detail!,"This is one of the finest hotels I have ever stayed in and I have stayed in many hotels in many different cities and countries.  I must say that attention is given to every detail and every aspect of your stay here.  From opening the doors for you as you walk in and greeting you each and every time you arrive and leave, from welcoming you and eagerly answering your every question and need at the concierge or reception desk, to cheerfully calling you by name when you call any department of the hotel from your room phone, this hotel is wonderful.

I stayed here for 7 nights during the International Catholic Eucharistic Congress.  I had a King Sized Bedroom on a B&B plan (Breakfast included) with the option to either have breakfast brought to my room from the Breakfast Menu in the room or to eat in the Dining Room.  The room was large and lovely.  The bathroom was humongous with a large bathing area (shower and separate huge tub) and a large sink area and a separate water closet.  It was immaculate and all polished marble and silver faucets.  There was plenty of space for everything.  There was a long hallway with a huge closet with plenty of room for luggage or clothes.  

The bed was one of the most comfortable and soft beds I have ever slept in -- even better the beds in the Hyatt or the Sofitel hotel chains.  The linens were fresh and crisp and the comforters were lovely.  There were 6 large pillows on the bed and you fell asleep as soon as you hit the pillows.  The room was amazingly quiet and you never heard any noise from the hallway.

Each morning I had ordered one of the 3 choices for breakfast and it was brought promptly at the time I selected on a hot cart that was actually a table with silverware, flowers, a hot plate, a hot tea kettle, and served and placed for you by a server until it was to your satisfaction.  I had never had room service like this anywhere in the world.  And the portions were HUGE!  Two scrambled eggs were more like four or five scrambled eggs back in the USA and the sausages and patties of Irish varieties were wonderful!   Everything was perfect.  Even the hot tea came with a ""tea strainer"" and stayed hot for a good long time.  It was more than enough to keep me satisfied for the entire morning or more.

The concierges were very helpful and very nice in making arrangements for you at restaurants, or helping you with trains, cars, taxis or whatever you needed and they would do it with a smile.

The tea service and bar service was out of this world.  The servers were all so special especially a young lady name Lara who knew that I liked a particular kind of drink and their vanilla bean tea that I had every day.  When it was my last day there, she gave me a small container of the tea as a parting gift.  I thought that was so very nice.

The Dining Room turned out to be one of the best restaurants in town.  I usually do not eat in hotels and go elsewhere but this restaurant was magnificent.  Their duck pate and their lobster dish were 5 star.  The maitre'd was well versed in the menu and would help you with the right pairing of wine and entree and would help special order any items on the menu to suit your taste or to notify the chef if you had special allergies or dietary needs.  The menu was fantastic.

The spa was fantastic, peaceful, quiet, private and included (pool, sauna, steam) for guests.

Everyone at this hotel were all 5 star employees and the prices were quite reasonable for a hotel of this calibre.  I think this is one of Dublin's best kept secrets.  I'd stay here again in a minute!",5,2012,06,19
205,The cheeky smile,"Enjoyed the stay with very lovely staff and prompt service. The good
- stayed there for 1night, checked in near midnight and left by morning yet the service was prompt with 24hr room service and housekeeping. Well done!
- good spa, friendly and welcoming staff who allowed me to walk around the spa with a cuppa tea in hand. Thanks!
- had an unpleasant shock when our room was serviced with items and bags being reshuffled/moved/ emptied, BUT the manager on reading my comment form came running to the carpark to sort out the problem. Brilliant and constructive.

What could have been better
- tv was ""scratchy"" my metaphoric description as ""worms"" running across the screen! But great selection of channels.
- It would have been brilliant if a nicer, higher up room was allocated. 

Otherwise, thanks for a warm welcome, we needed the ""recharge"" and Four Seasons did just that - even in those 8hrs, well worth it! The story of the cheeky smile? There is a member of staff at Front desk, with a cheeky smile, in general, the staff in Four Seasons have been very welcoming and so warm that allowed me to candidly comment on the staff's cheeky smile. One would recognise that cheely smile, no doubt!",4,2012,06,17
205,a better managed property doesn't exist.,"despite the rain, a recent 4 night stay at the dublin 4 seasons was a delightful experience.  The Seward Johnson statuary around the property , the delightful ice bar, and the indoor swimming pool gives  one the feeling of total luxury.  The staff are as professional as they can be, not a blip in any service.  A smile goes a long way  from staff members as they treat you as royalty.",5,2012,06,15
205,Less than Perfect,"The Four Seasons in Dublin is a below standard Four Seasons hotel.   If you are use to staying at the Four Seasons you will quickly notice its not like the ones in London, Paris or Florence. 

The hotel is clean, reasonably priced, well located, and has excellent food. The rooms are large. We were in an Executive Suite and it was very roomy.

Now some of the problems   

The water pressure in the showers is very low which makes taking a shower unpleasant. Charging for Wifi per day with no free Wifi in the lobby is just annoying when you are paying Four Seasons rates.  The front door staff are non-existent. Several times my wife returned full of bags and no was was there to open a door or assist.   

Some of the staff members need further Four Seasons training especially in the dining areas where service was average.  There were exceptions for example Jean in the seasons restaurant was great.  Another example is on our last day we went down for breakfast at 8:30. The dining room was half empty but they made us wait 10 mins to set up a table.  You would expect tables to be ready especially when it's not so busy.   It just seemed there was a lot of variation in staff. 

Finally the turn down service is unusual for a Four Seasons.  Usually you would expect a complimentary bottle of water, chocolate on your pillow, and a card with the weather for the next day.  It was not done.  Also the TVs must be 15 years old with bad audio.   

The hotel is not bad but it just does not live up to the Four Seasons name.  

",4,2012,06,15
205,Stunning Hotel,"Everything was impeccable at this hotel. The staff, the building, the rooms, the fittings...everything. If you like luxury then this is definitely a great place for business stays and couples. I would not recommend as a family hotel unless your kids are fancy!",5,2012,06,14
205,Beautiful hotel with wonderful food and service but a tad far from the central sites of Dublin.,"We had a wonderful stay at this hotel where a continental breakfast and afternoon tea were included with our package. The rooms were lovely with great amenities and charming staff-very helpful concierge who reviewed on a map for us where the highlights of the city were and gave us pointers for our stay. The food was fabulous at breakfast(must- eat Danish) and the afternoon tea delightful with warm scones and assorted sandwiches and pastries. We felt utterly spoiled from the plush slippers to the calming pool area so that we didn't mind so much having to take cabs or walk 2 miles or so to get to the main sites. But one minus I need to mention is costly wifi and you need to pay per device not per room- 20-22 euros each which seemed steep. But truly otherwise we loved it!
",5,2012,06,09
205,superb family stay!,Exceeded expectations!  They are great with kids.  We all had a relaxing and wonderful time. Food was nice.  Loved the two different menus for the kids.  Drinks were the only thing I thought was a bit expensive.  We would definitely stay again.,5,2012,06,05
205,Going downhill.,"I have stayed in the Four Seasons Dublin several times before, however it is probably about 2 years since I last stayed there.  Unfortunately I think the rooms are getting a little tired/dated and are definitely due an overhaul.  Canary yellow walls in a Fours Seasons?  We asked to be moved room from our first room.  The second room was a bit better.

Service and hotel facilities remain very good.  Breakfast was excellent and the main dining room and bars, lobby remain very nice.

My wife tried the spa and said it remained excellent, however the beautician spent a lot of time trying to sell her product which marred the experience.  I realise these people are on commission but surely Four Seasons knows this is not what customers want when they are already paying a significant premium for a Four Seasons treatment?

I have stayed in many Four Seasons hotels around the world but unfortunately the Dublin hotel is not up to standards any more.",3,2012,06,05
205,Very Nice,"Great service, easy to find.  Rooms are what you would expect.  Food is rather limited and expensive in the restaurants in the hotel but not a ton more then I would expect to pay.  I would stay here again.",5,2012,06,03
205,Afternoon Tea,"(No accommodation comments).  Visiting Dublin to attend a Consulate on Ailesbury Road, we happened across the Four Seasons.  Dropped in for afternoon tea in the Lobby Lounge to relax.   The service was prompt and friendly, the location was ideal for what we needed and the food was very good as well.  

I wasn't a fan however of the buildings architecture or atmosphere, while it was nice, and somewhat inviting, it lacked the quality and charm that I had experienced in other Four Seasons in the US and Asia.   

Overall, it was a pleasant experience with no faults to mention, but lacking that special touch that one would expect of the FS brand.",4,2012,06,03
205,One of the finest hotels in Dublin,"Just completed a stay this month at the Four Seasons Dublin.  THis was our first time at this hotel. All is as you would expect from a FS.  The hotel is very nice, very clean and rooms are generous size.  Seasons was excellent for breakfast and lunch.  Also, try the bar menu in the Whiskey Bar (they have nearly 100 Irish Whiskies).  Food quality was outstanding.  The complimenary driver was almost always available if we wanted to go somewhere outside walking distance.  

Also did Tapas in the Ice Bar.  Great venue to watch sports or have casual conversation.  Take some time to stroll the grounds as they are beautifully manicured.  Embassy district is also nearby and is a great walk through lovely homes with 100 year old trees.  

It was our daughters graduation trip and they made her feel special with amenities in the room and true Irish hospitality!

We will definitely return",5,2012,05,31
205,Good but not special,"Stayed in the four seasons for the weekend. The room was impressive - large, quiet and very nice decor with a tastefully appointed bathroom. The location of the hotel is in Ballsbridge, very handy for concerts or events in the area although it is a medium walk to the city centre. (20-30mins)

I have to disagree with other reviewers on the service level. I did not feel like I was in a 5 star hotel. A reoccuring problem I encounter is that if you are not a tourist or over a certain age, then the staff seem to feel that they dont have to extend the same service that they provide to other guests. This is always frustrating.

We also had an issue with the air-conditioning being stuck on warm and the room heating in our absence to nearly 40oC. Even though it was after midnight i have to say that maintenance repsonse was very quick and the problem temporarily fixed for the night. There was however no full repair or mention of the issue for the rest of our stay.

The car park is also a little annoying as it doubles as hourly parking with a seperate ticket required and to be validated each time you come/go.  We had parking included but on coming back in the evening the  car park would have full signs and you would have to go and get a staff member to let you in and try and find a space.

We did not eat in the restaurant or use the spa so cannot comment. There was a function in the hotel so we encountered a lot of very drunk, black-tied revellers which again wasnt the expectation in a 5 star hotel.

In summary, excellent rooms, good location, 3 star service.",4,2012,05,31
205,Fairy-tale,"I stayed at the Dubllin Four Seasons just this weekend: wow! Unfortunately I'm not an experienced five star guest, I won this stay. The place is spectacular. The staff are all fabulous, from running to open your taxi doors to asking what papers you want next morning to running up with ironing boards. I was surprised at the size of the hotel, how big it is. The decor all over the place was fabulous, not at all flashy, just classic and there was great light about the place. The bed and bed clothes were beautiful, as were the curtains and carpet. I loved the flowers everywhere. The bathroom was stunning, I got a laugh out of how there was nothing so vulgar as a toilet brush there! The one thing was the shower; it wasn't as good as I would have expected. The dinner was great, but the breakfast was amazing. The quality of the fruit especially. Alas, reality dictates that this cannot be my standard abode for my trips to Dublin, but if it's a special wedding anniversary or anything similar (or you can just plain afford it) I couldn't recommend it more!",5,2012,05,27
205,Lovely Hotel!,"We loved the Four Seasons Hotel in Dublin. It was charmingly decorated, with a beautiful lobby and public rooms.  Our room was spacious, comfortable, quiet and clean. I loved the cabbage rose drapery and coordinating bedskirts.  The gray and white marble bathrooms were luxurious. This hotel is in a great location walkable to many lovely pubs, restaurants, and shops.  It also has several great restaurants onsite. The staff here are wonderfully responsive and helpful. We especially appreciated the complimentary chauffeured drive to downtown.  We highly recommend the Four Seasons in Dublin.",5,2012,05,26
205,Good hotel - but where is the real Four Seasons experience?,"I was thrilled when my company booked me into the Four Seasons Hotel in Dublin. I like the hotel chain with their comfortable bed-and bathrooms as well as sumptuous styled lobbies and restaurants.

The Dublin Four Seasons was somewhat disappointing though. The bed was comfortable as ever, the room generous and the bathroom very spacious. The rest, forgettable. Friendly, but slow staff, worn down ambience in the hotel, located outside city centre etc. Not a bad hotel, but not special at all.",4,2012,05,26
205,I wish I could give it a million star rating!!,"An amazing hotel, in an amazing city! The staff was among the best in the world that we have encountered-never missing a beat. I was riding the elevator down (to mail a postcard) and the staff member saw what I had in my hand, and asked if he may put it in the post for me?! When i was swimming in the pool, I had placed my robe (Four Season ammenity) on a lounge chair, a staff member came by, picked it up, folded it neatly and placed it back-wow. Now none of these actions are needed (as I could have easliy done them myself) but what a beautiful touch. Oh and the sheets were more than 600 count Egyptian cotton, I am almost certain-perfect. The food was amazing and Guiness chilled to perfection. A magical experience-I cannot wait to return!!!!!",5,2012,05,23
205,Really great hotel,Definitely recommend this hotel. Spacious rooms. Friendly and very helpful staff. Great food and bars.,5,2012,05,17
205,"Facts - The Four Seasons Hotel, Dublin","The following is an honest accurate review. I travel for business up to 12 times per year and take at least 6 personal trips every year. I aim to stay in very good 5* Hotels, my last trip was to  the Jebel Ali 5* in Dubai in August 2011.

FACTS

1. This is a 5* Hotel. It is by UK/European standards 5*.

2. The key asset this hotel are its people. The majority are friendly, hard working, passionate and energetic - Thank you to Mr Tony Coveney for his assistance.

3. The property is situated in the embassy belt of Dublin, perfectly situated 15 Minutes from Dublin City Centre. The rooms are aptly decorated..The grounds are clean.The reception area is functional but not as welcoming as those in other 5*s

4. The food is excellent. The service levels are excellent.

I would recommend this hotel for both personal and business travellers.",5,2012,05,15
205,Meets all expectations,"The Four Seasons in Dublin is a superlative hotel.  It is well-built, perfectly furnished, with spacious rooms, a superb gym, a huge pool (with a hot whirlpool pool attached), and all the fine dining you need.

Most of all, the service is absolutely what you would expect at a Four Seasons.

Unfortunately for two of us on a romantic getaway--it is the perfect hotel for businessfolks or a retired couple or a family vacation--it is in the Embassy part of town, sleepy and residential and fare from all the happening in Dublin.  We checked out after one night to a city center hotel.  (Bad idea--see next review)",5,2012,05,12
205,Beautiful hotel in a stunning location,Stayed here on a business trip and the hotel was lovely. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that my bed was a single (very comfortable but small) and check out was slow. Breakfast was very good and the service was attentive without being over done. The ice bar is nice and has a good atmosphere.,4,2012,05,11
205,Bar food is simply stunning,"Went today to conduct a business meeting...met in the bar/lounge...service attentive yet unobtrusive. 

My guest had a tuna toastie and fries (not on the menu but no trouble) I had the best burger ever, cheese, bacon , mushroom and the best slow cooked onions ever...not cheap but impressive ..will return.

When my guest left carried on working on VPN...wifi could be free is the only development comment I have.",5,2012,05,10
205,Very Good--but some quirky service issues,"Just back from a long weekend in Dublin and had the pleasure to stay at The Four Seasons.  The hotel is beautiful and in a lovely leafy location just outside the city buzz--but still within walking distance.  

We stayed in a deluxe king room and had pre-arranged for a bottle of champagne to be waiting for us upon arrival.  We arrived at roughly 8PM and the room had been turndown and very welcoming.  The concierge had also provided a welcome note and complimentary chocolate covered strawberries--nice touch.    The L'occitane  products were wonderful and the linens and towels were in pristine condition--what you would expect from The Four Seasons.

We had a late dinner in the cafe restaurant--very nice selection on the menu.  

We met with the concierge briefly the following morning to get an understanding of the area and some of the things we wanted to do.  He was friendly and helpful and really made us feel comfortable in getting around  our plan for the day.

The only reason I am not giving this review a 5 is because of the service at the breakfast buffet and then in the afternoon in the lounge for bar/tea.  They seemed to have plenty of staff, but just not attentive. The breakfast consisted of a buffet and if you finished a plate and left it by the side of your table they never would come to collect it.  I thought that was odd.  Just not what we have been used to from a service perspective.    

We also had afternoon tea which was average at best.  The presentation was just average and there didn't seem to be any attention to detail.  It was okay--but nothing to get excited about.  And once again, the wait staff just appeared to be unengaged and did not follow up enough.  We found ourselves waving them down to many times--just not what we expected.  

The room was quiet even though the hotel was busy--so that was a plus.  

Check out was at 12  and at 11:30  we waited in line for 10 minutes to check out because there was only one person working at the desk--at check out time.

We checked on Saturday to see if we could get a spa treatment on Sunday and he advised that they were booked--so if that is what you are looking for--book early!
 
Other than those few quirks I thought the hotel was in a great location and beautiful atmosphere/grounds.  All other aspects of service are what you would expect from the Four Seasons other than the service in the restaurant.",4,2012,05,10
205,luxury wonderful hotel in dublin,"We stay in the four seasons Dublin regularly for rugby weekends and concerts, it is without doubt one of the best hotels in Dublin.  Slightly out of the main shopping area but certainly worth the taxi fare into the city centre.  The staff are great, the food is great and the atmosphere in the ice bar is buzzing.",5,2012,05,10
205,Excellent,"I headed to Dublin for one night to watch the Heineken Cup semi-final with friends. The hotel and facilities were first rate, and I was particularly impressed with the restaurant which I thought provided Michelin star quality food. The concierge was great and not only held my bags beyond check out, but also provided a jogging map which kept me busy whilst I waited for my flight",5,2012,05,09
205,Excellent,I stayed in this hotel several times last year and could not fault it on anything. Nothing is too much trouble for anyone of the staff.   The food is excellent and all the staff are so friendly. I will be staying here again in July and I cannot wait,5,2012,05,07
205,Nice stay & friendly staff,"Stayed for one night to meet up with friends. The room was nice; very comfortable. Pleasant ambience. Staff were friendly & helpful. In saying that, there were times you felt that staff were trying too hard. It is not necessary to make idle conversation all the time!! 
Breakfast was very nice, I have to say.
Bar ambience nice. 
Maybe some slight negatives:
The decor feels a bit 'forced' to make the hotel feel 'aged' & classical. Don't think this works. It doesn't really feel 5 star - perhaps a good 4 star. 
The car parking is very expensive at €18 per day. 
Nice room but bit of a crappy shower - the flow was a bit 'prostatic' - dribbling! I know it is only the shower & maybe they are trying to save on the impending water charges!!
Have to say, overall, it is overpriced. Could have got the same for a lot cheaper elsewhere.
Gets good score mainly due to a) decent /nice staff b) comfortable rooms c) good breakfast.",4,2012,05,06
205,Excellent; Baby Friendly,"Our stay was perfect.  They had a high chair, fridge, and microwave waiting in the room for our 17 month old daughter.  They also had a crib, rubber ducky, kids bath products, diapers, diaper cream, and a cookie and juice for her. I cannot say enough about how family friendly and welcome we felt at such a nice hotel with a toddler.  Everything was amazing; the staff woudl fill my sippy cups with milk and wash the cups for me.  A perfect stay and a great vacation!",5,2012,05,03

205,Pure Escapism,"A Five Star that deserves every star. Service first class, food excellent, staff courteous, helpful, friendly. Hotel was so nice postponed shopping trip to avail of pool and spa. Look forward to return trip.",5,2012,05,01
205,One night wasn't enough - what a gorgeous hotel.,"This hotel has it all - helpful, friendly, conscientious staff; great location for the Aviva Stadium; lovely restaurants nearby (you can't beat Roly's Bistro or the Lobster Pot); sumptuous rooms with spacious, palatial-esque bathrooms. Our deluxe room had a great view over the front of the hotel and the walk-in shower is heavenly.

One niggle - the breakfast selection is vast and there is something for everyone, but be prepared to pay. We paid 57 Euros for breakfast for 2.

The car parking is free - the staff at reception just validate your ticket for you.

Overall, we just cannot wait to go back - this is now our favourite hotel in Dublin.",5,2012,05,01
205,Perfect Spa,"The Spa at the 4 Seasons was superb. One of the best most relaxing spa treatments I have ever had. The inclusion of the sauna, steam room, private locker and relax lounge as part of the swedish massage was utopia itself.",5,2012,04,30
205,Lovely hotel but why charge extortionate prices for breakfast!,"Superior room was large & spacious. Not a great view overlooking warehouses & recycling bins.
Liked the Ice Bar- busy & great service. Tapas dishes very tasty.
Dinner in Seasons restaurant was of a good standard but service could be improved - silly mistakes made with order.
Feel that to charge for Internet in this day & age is an insult.
Breakfast ridiculously overpriced at £29 euros. Go to a cafe & get better value for money.",4,2012,04,30
205,Exceptional Service,"We enjoyed four nights at the Four Seasons Dublin last week, and every day we were treated as if we were truly special guests.  The room was beautiful and spacious, the food in the lobby and cafe was delicious, and the service was sincerely polite and responsive to our requests.  We've never stayed at a Four Seasons before, and now I wish we always could.",5,2012,04,29
205,Truly five star in every detail,"I stayed two nights at Dublin Four Seasons Hotel between 20 and 22 April 2012, and I just cannot find the appropriate words to describe how wonderful time I had at this marvellous place. Even though my stay was relatively short, it was fairly enough for me to be convinced that Dublin Four Seasons is definitely among the best and most prestigious hotels in Europe. The main purpose of my visit to Ireland was to take part in the Titanic Walking Tour at the Harland & Wolff Shipyard in Belfast, but this fabulous hotel in Dublin was also an attraction in itself.

Location

The hotel is located in a nice and calm area in Ballsbridge, Dublin. The neighbourhood is lovely and elegant, with lots of embassies, brown brick houses and beautiful gardens nearby. The hotel is easily accessible from Dublin airport, and at first I did not even realise how easy it is to get there. On the basis of the information supplied by route planner Dublin on the internet, first I took bus no. 747, then bus no. 7 to get to Merrion Road. I got off at the British Embassy, and the hotel is about five minutes walking distance from the bus stop. Then it turned out that I was not even supposed to take two buses to reach the hotel from the airport, as the Aircoach bus service can drop you off directly in front of the hotel at Simmonscourt Road. It is comfortable, cheap, and reliable, with buses passing every twenty minutes even on Sundays, so it is a reasonable alternative to taxis. The Sandymount DART suburban train station is also within a few minutes walk from the hotel, so I had no difficulty with getting to the city centre and Connolly train station.    

Interior design

I am confident to say that Dublin Four Seasons is one of the most beautiful hotels I have ever seen. If you are into traditional elegance, this is undoubtedly the place to go. The interior is quite like a classic, aristocratic, elegant country estate, but at the same time it is so cosy and warm that you are never intimidated by the grandeur of the design. All the fittings and decorations are of the finest materials, carefully selected and beautifully maintained.   

My room

I have originally reserved a superior room, but on my arrival I was told that I was upgraded to another room which belonged to a slightly higher category. This was certainly a great start of my stay, although I am pretty much sure that all the rooms in this hotel are splendid, so I would have been absolutely satisfied even without this upgrade – but it was of course even better with that! My room was spacious, clean, and perfectly equipped, with a huge comfortable bed and a beautiful marble bathroom. The only objectionable element might have been the view from my room, as it faced a courtyard, but I did not mind it at all, as it was so peaceful and quiet during the whole night, with no traffic noise whatsoever from the street. When I stay again at this hotel, I will surely ask for a room facing the courtyard. Before I left the hotel on Sunday, just for curiosity I whished to have a look at the Presidential Suite, so an extremely nice and kind lady from the reception desk showed me around there as well. I looked at it with the greatest admiration, it already resembled a castle, but you will definitely have the most enjoyable stay in this hotel even without having the highest category of rooms. 
     
Service and staff

I leave the finest and probably the most amazing feature of my stay in Dublin Four Seasons to the end of my review. I was simply enthralled and deeply touched by the hospitality, friendliness, politeness and professionalism of every member of the staff I ever encountered during my stay. When I arrived in the evening to check in after my long journey, they greeted me with such a smile that I immediately felt at home. I had a friendly chat with the gentleman who showed me into my room, then later on I entered into a nice conversation with the lady at the restaurant reception. She was so kind and helpful that she printed me the schedule of DART trains, and she has also sketched me a map of the neighbouring streets so that I could easily find the station next morning. It was not even part of her job, I just happened to talk to her about my journey plans for the next day and she was simply keen to help me. I already had highly positive feelings about Ireland even before my visit, but this friendliness and helpfulness of Four Seasons staff has just strengthened my conviction that I will definitely return to this wonderful country. And there is no doubt about which hotel I will choose!",5,2012,04,27
205,A Class Establishment,"Visited Dublin for a special occasion (Birthday) and this hotel was the perfect base.  Staff were all amazing, the hotel itself is beautiful.   Our room was on the front of the hotel, with its own Balcony... large in size, massive bed and all the trimmings!

 It is about 10 minutes by car from Dublin centre, and about a 25-30 minute walk (which is nice).

Didnt take advantage of the car service due to the times it was operating (the only thing I can fault).

Had a meal at Seasons Restaurant, and the food was lovely.  Would definitely stay here again!",5,2012,04,26
205,Timeless elegance,"Classic hotel, comfortable rooms, marvellous bathrooms, big wardrobe. Service and concierge are impeccable. Gym and spa area - pure bliss. Good food. 

Tuna steak salad in the lobby is amazing, as well as the cocktails.",5,2012,04,24
205,I fell in love with the Emerald Isle!,"This was a special birthday that my sister and brother kindly treated me with for a weekend away. The hotel was luxurious. Food to die for...SPA was excellently equiped with nice pool and sauna and steam rooms. Plenty of gym equipment. Staff could not do enough to please you. Bedrooms spacious, we had room service one evening and it was first class service. Courtesy limo into City Centre from 1pm until 9pm was a great help but my sister and I enjoyed using the local bus service which ran every 10mins. Fabulous restaurant nearby if you fancied a change from dining in the hotel called Roly's. As for Dublin you must go to the Guinness Storehouse - good value for money and a free pint when you reach the 7th floor with panoramic views of the city. Plenty of lively shopping bars and clubs to visit. Temple Bar,O'Connell Street, Grafton Street, Henry Street to name but a few. Dublin has everything and more...similar to Covent Garden. And the coast is not too far away if you want to have a different kind of day out. It left me feeling there is so much more to do and see but beware now its the Euro it is very expensive so make this trip a special one and it will leave you wanting to go back for more! I certainly would not stay anywhere other than the Four Seasons when I return next year so I shall get saving!",4,2012,04,23
205,SUPERB,Everything was wonderful - we had invited friends for the weekend who totally enjoyed their stay from arrival to departure - the only problem was our stay was too short (2 nights),5,2012,04,19
205,"The ICE Bar in Four Seasons Hotel, Dublin","Great service, nice atmosphere, quite and relaxing, very tasty and suprisingly cheap food (2 up to 6 euro for tapas). Recommended.",4,2012,04,16
205,Wonderful,"Stayed just one night in Dublin, had two children with us...had a great time the family room was huge and we did'nt want to leave!!  Boys loved the pool.  We ate in the a lovely room adjoining the lounge area and boys could watch dvd's etc and not disturb anyone. We will be back!!",5,2012,04,16
205,Idyllic,"My second stay at the Four Seasons proved as enjoyable as the last, if only for one night.  Divine food, attentive staff, beautiful hotel and surroundings. . . . all great!
However, I stayed in a superior room, yet for the price I didn't appreciate the contrast from a moderate room (the reason given for the upgrade is the view).  I know it's a luxury hotel, award-winning and five-star accommodation but can the exorbitant prices really be justified??",4,2012,04,13
205,"Simply the best hotel, anywhere!","Enjoyed a short stay with my wife and two daughters. We don't travel often but when we do we like to spoil ourselves and the Four Seasons Dublin is the place to be spoiled. Service, attention, helpfulness and friendless of all staff is 100%.
",5,2012,04,08
205,Ahhhhh!,"We had a wonderful time. The service in the restaurant and tea room was superb. The servers were as nice as they could be.  Our room was soo comfortable and luxurious. We've stayed in hotels where we could hear our neighbors but not here - it was blissfully quiet. Three negatives - location wasn't great. It was a bit of a hike to walk to the city center. Also, the hotel did not provide free wifi in the room. They charged us 12 euros per day which I though was ridiculous. In this day and age in a luxury hotel, wifi should be a given. There was also no in room tea or coffee service which I also found annoying.",5,2012,04,07
205,Restful stay,"Quick check in and out. Free valet service. Nice bathroom. Good toiletries. Good breakfast. Helpful staff. Nice leisure centre. Room itself not very impressive for a five star. No free wi-fi. I feel if you choose to stay in five star hotels you expect free wi-fi, a feature you'd get in basic four stars for much less! ",4,2012,04,05
205,Outstanding as usual - everyone should have the Four Seasons Dublin experience at some stage.,Just outstanding as usual! This is a true 5 Star experience.,5,2012,04,05
205,Always great service,"We recently stayed in a Junior Suite at the Four Seasons. Check in was seamless, efficient and the staff were very friendly. Junior suites are great here....large bathrooms, walk in wardrobes with safe and really good sized bedrooms. 

Dinner in the restaurant was excellent and the wine list was competively priced. Service was friendly and efficient. I noticed that the lunch menu is extremely good value - something like €22 for two courses. 

There was a good buzz in the bar and it appeared that many there were regulars - guests and people living close by. We didn't have breakfast as we slept it out!!! But, I'm sure its as good as on our previous visits. We'll be back.",5,2012,04,05
205,Much improved - an excellent effort,"I stayed here last summer and my stay was a bit of a comedy of errors and I was not at all impressed, having, at that stage, found the hotels money grabbing antics completely off putting.

Some nine months later, I decided to give it another go, and am really pleased that I did.

I arrived at the hotel, and found check in warm, friendly and efficient, and was very quickly settled in my room. It really is worth upgrading for the extra space if you can, and the fruit plate was a nice touch. Televisions were still big and bulky, and the lack of free wi fi pretty annoying, but the beds are big and comfy, and the bathroom well appointed. Good hospitality tray, with amazing tea that I'd never had before.

Ordered breakfast, and have to say, was mega impressed  - great touches like home made yoghurt, and what tasted like freshly squeezed orange juices. Breakfast selection was well cooked and tasty, a specific vegetarian breakfast would be a great option - I usually stay at the Merrion when in Dublin and to be honest, this breakfast was better.

The biggest difference this time was the attitude of the staff - lots of warms smiles, greetings and hello's. questions were answered politely and getting a lift into town in the Hotel car was well organised and efficient - no mean feat given it was a Six Nations Weekend. 

Service in the bars was efficient and friendly.

In conclusion - did I get it wrong last time, no not really, however the improvements in service have put the Four Seasons close to the top of my must stay places list in Dublin, I really enjoyed it.",5,2012,03,28
205,Wonderful visit,"My daughter and I stayed at the Four Seasons during a visit to Dublin. I could not have had a better experience. The staff was exceptionally courteous and helpful, especially the concierge! The food was delicious and the room was very comfortable. They even left a note in our room to alert us that the time was changing to Daylight Savings.",5,2012,03,27
205,Personal Touch,"I stayed here after seeing the reviews and found it as good as I read. They staff go extra mile in every aspects. I checked in early. I was given the directions to go to the city patiently.

The rooms had the contemporary style decor with great comfort. Couldn't have asked for me.

Two buses 4,7 go to the city from the hotel. It takes about 20 mins to reach the city centre.",5,2012,03,26
205,Wonderful,"Everything was wonderful - the room, the service, the amenities. Jacuzzi and steam room were a definite highlight. Rooms are very spacious!

The location was a little bit of a hassle though. They offer a free limo service Tuesday - Saturday into City Center but coming back to the hotel is a $15 cab ride. You can take the DART but it runs rather infrequently.",5,2012,03,25
205,Fabulous Service in Dublin!,"In a nutshell, we were very pleased with this hotel.  I have been to Dublin several times and this is my favorite place to stay.  What stood out the most is most definitely the staff.  They were always smiling, friendly, and helpful, and they seemed enthusiastic about striking up a chat.  The amenities were also very much appreciated.  There is a spa as well as room service and all the other usual hotel services.  The room and bed were very comfortable and relaxing.  We also enjoyed the location, being offset from the city center, because it was away from all the noise and congestion.  There are a few neat pubs up the road worth walking to if its the sort of thing you are into. 

My only complaint is that the style of the rooms and hotel is a tad dated.  Of course, Four Seasons are never going to be that boutique-y modern chic, but I do wish they would make some updates.  This is hardly something to complain about, as the rooms were spotless and clean.  It is nice to know that you get what you pay for with this 5-star hotel, since I have stayed in others (different chains) and it has not been the case.

I would definitely recommend this hotel!  We will be planning to stay here for our future trips to Dublin.",5,2012,03,21
205,"Faultless Service, Service Service! - food - im not so sure.","It's always nice to be invited to lunch, especially if its to celebrate a family member's promotion. So as a treat we headed to ""Seasons"" restaurant at the Four Seasons Hotel Dublin.

We had booked ahead earlier that Saturday morning, which was a pleasant surprise, then again there was a major rugby match at the nearby Aviva stadium where Ireland were playing, no doubt where the focus of the nation was for the afternoon.

Upon arrival at the restaurant reception, I was immediately greeted by the hostess by my name, in addition the restaurant manager was also passing by and did the same.  Very Impressive as I am definitely not famous! and don't know them.

Our coats were checked and we were escorted to our table.  What I noticed about the service from start to finish was how unhurried and completely flawless its execution was from every single staff member.  Restaurants such as this charge top dollar, therefore it is only right, that clientele are able to relax and enjoy a meal in comfortable surroundings with excellent service.

Now to the meal itself - Having selected a nice wine for the main, we first had a Kir Royale as a little celebration.  A selection of freshly prepared hot breads were presented as we perused the menu and iced water was poured by our server.

For the starter, each of us were all drawn to the prawn cocktail, some may say an archaic starter but I cannot recall the last time I had one, so was curious as to how this would be presented here.  We were not disappointed - I counted circa twelve king prawns and boston shrimp in mine, cooked perfectly along with a generous crisp salad and all important citrus marie rose.

For main I ordered the 10oz Irish Rib-Eye - comprising of a home spice rub, black truffle mac and cheese.  I was disappointed in the steak which was quite tough, however I persevered but didnt touch the mac & cheese which was presented in a little pot.  This is the second disappointment for me regarding Rib Eye steak in Dublin, I think Fillet next time.  Afterall our Nation is renowned for the qualify of our beef, what is going on !  The side orders we all shared - truffle fries, mixed green vegetables, roasted mushrooms and garlic were sublime and made up for the medicore steak.

The two ladies for main had: 8oz Irish Beef Fillet - Chorizo Baked Potato, Butter Injection and the Salmon - Soy Lime Vinaigrette, Avocado, Seeds - which thankfully were excellent, tasty, well presented and sizable portions.

As i mentioned at the start of my review, the service was impeccable, unobtrusive, friendly, natural.  The impression I was left with, was that these people enjoyed their jobs, were very well trained and wanted to be there.  The manager briefly stopped by to ask how we were enjoying our meal and general pleasantry, she also mentioned that she was going to telephone us, to enquire if we wanted a taxi to collect us in case traffic was a problem due to the match.  That is service that stays in one's memory!!

As we relaxed after our main course we ordered a coupe of Bellinis prior to dessert, at €20 each a little on the expensive side once we reviewed the bill, i started to wonder if the barman had imported the peach puree or Prosecco by private jet !

Dessert comprised of Spiced Pear Crumble - Custard, Vanilla Ice Cream and two of us opted for the selection of Ice Cream & Sorbets, presented to us by the wonderful and delightful ""Apple"" one of four servers who tended to our needs for the afternoon.  

Overall apart from my disappiointment with my main, the other guests thoroughly enjoyed their meals from start to finish and we all agreed that the good manners, excellent but not overly formal service not just at our table but noticably the other diners with children was second to none.",4,2012,03,19
205,Very good but could do better,"My wife and I stayed for a 2 night mid-week break last time I was in Ireland. The hotel is very well appointed and the superior room was capacious and everything was of an excellent standard. The staff were very helpful and friendly although almost 100% non-Irish,Valet car parking was most efficient and convenient.

The only grouse was at the booking stage the contact pushed the breakfast included option.
This seemed expensive at €40.00 each, and so it was,paying separately for what you had would have been more economical by far. The traditional full Irish breakfast was not well presented and did not live up to the rest of the facilities. We had to get up and take milk and butter from an adjacent table as it was absent from ours. This on a quiet morning when there were almost a1:1 customer staff ratio.

Don't let this put you off it,. was probably just a blip and did not spoil the overall enjoyment",4,2012,03,14
205,A great stay with service fit for a king.,The title says it all really. On a family break in Dublin we were well cared for by staff and the kids were treated wonderfully. Each were given a cookie with their own names iced on. All beds were turned down in a very profesonal manner and in general you were made feel very wolcomed by all the staff.,5,2012,03,14
205,Bliss!,"My husband and I spent an idyllic weekend in this our favourite hotel, in February. The weekend got off to a very good start when we were told at reception that we had been up-graded from a Junior Suite to a Deluxe Suite! 
The accommodation was luxurious and comfortable.
We ate in the casual restaurant on the Friday evening and the more formal Season's Restaurant on the Saturday night. Both were excellent, lovely atmosphere, friendly attentive staff and delicious food.
We both indulged in treatments in the Spa and I had one of the best facials I have ever had - I felt very spoilt!
Breakfast as ever was a delight with a huge range of lovely buffet choices (a la carte is also available).  
Although this is an expensive hotel, we both feel it is worth every penny for a special treat. I can't wait to return!",5,2012,03,12
205,Excellent place to stay,"The Four Seasons in Dublin is an excellent place to stay.

We arrived after a very long series of flights, missing luggage and getting lost and we were greeted by friendly, welcoming staff and superb facilities.  The hotel even followed up on our missing luggage for us.

The breakfasts are spectacular and you're guaranteed to leave bursting!  The food available during the day is also lovely and a decent size quantity is served.

The rooms are a decent size, the bed and pillows are fabulously comfortable and the bathroom is huge.

I would definitely stay here again and strongly recommend it to others.",5,2012,03,10
205,Comfort and luxury without a hint of stuffiness.,"Stayed for a long weekend. Superior king room was tastefully furnished and bed was excellent. Second floor room had a reasonable view over the adjacent flat roof which had been 'landscaped' to make it less of an eyesore.  Room was pretty perfect. Air con worked without us even knowing it was there. Nice touches were complimentary newspapers each day, free overnight shoe cleaning service and the spa and swimming pool with a really peaceful, restful atmosphere. Only niggle was that the sauna and steam room were single sex in the changing rooms which meant my wife and I were separated without  having made a pearrangement of when to meet up at the pool.
A tip - Ask for tea and coffee facilities in the room and they will be provided free without question. Negatives, the buffet breakfast was good, but not as good as it should have been for euro28.50, although the a la carte was better. Service at breakfast was faultless with juice and coffee refills without prompting. We really enjoyed our stay And would certainly come back.",5,2012,03,09
205,Attentive staff; relaxing stay; comfortable surroundings,"This is one of my favorite hotels.  The staff is the best part.  They are very attentive and friendly -- from the cleaning crew that organizes your hotel room impeccably, to the friendly and helpful concierge and doormen; to the bartenders and waitstaff that give you excellent service (especially when you're trying to figure out which whiskey to try!).  The rooms are spacious, well-laid out, and very comfortable.  This hotel can't be beat!",5,2012,03,07
205,Very good short stay,Very good short stay - staff very friendly and good service,5,2012,03,07
205,Excellent Stay! Will stay again in the near future!,Wonderful hotel and friendly staff. Looking forward to staying there in the future!,5,2012,02,29
205,Excellent,"As expected, The Four Seasons was a great hotel experience.  The concierge staff was more than helpful and took care of several reservations over email before we arrived.  The room was very nice and the restaurant was great.  The only reason I'm witholding a star is due to the fact that they charge 15-25 euro/day for Wireless internet which was surprising since many cheaper hotels provide this for free.",4,2012,02,27
205,If only we could have stayed longer....,We were lucky enough to spend one night in a deluxe suite. The furnishings and facilities in the living room were truly 5star. The bed was huge and so comfortable. Separate dressing room - really felt special. What luxury. Fantastic service - very attentive but not at all pushy.Food was delicious we had room service early evening - presentation second to none. Best breakfast ever. If only we could have stayed longer....,5,2012,02,24
205,"Beautiful Hotel, Good service","First of all, the only reason I'm not giving this hotel five stars is because they charge 15 dollars a day for wireless service. Many lesser hotels have wifi for free, and I would really expect to get that since the Four Seasons is quite expensive. That said, the hotel is really beautiful and the staff was very helpful. While the decor and our room (a junior suite) were very spacious and nice, they were not very modern/hip.  I have been to other Four Seasons locations that had a trendier vibe. That isn't really a plus or minus in my view, but something to think about when choosing where to stay.  The concierge was helpful with directions and places to eat. My boyfriend and I also went to the spa and we got great massages. They have a beautiful indoor pool and hot tub as well.",4,2012,02,21
205,Very Good Hotel,"I stayed here as my usual hotel was fully booked. I was impressed. 

Checkin was an exercise in excellence, superb front of house staff.

The room was spacious, welcoming and finished to the highest standards, simply excellent rooms. Felt really comfortable in the bed too. Bathroom was a delight.

I visited the bar. Lovely plush area. Got my first drink no problems, but table service was lacklustre. Staff seemed to avoid eye contact and seemed pre-occupied. Had to go to the bar to get a refill. Again when paying bill had to wait at the bar while someone tidyed something in the backroom.

But this minor blip aside, this really is a superior hotel, in a lovely area. I might have found a new base in Dublin.

Oh complimentary shoe shine and newspaper were a welcome bonus too :)",4,2012,02,20
205,Great Hotel,We stayed at the four seasons Dublin with our three children. The staff were very friendly and helpful and it was a very enjoyable weekend.,5,2012,02,20
205,Great Hotel,What can I say...perhaps a little daunting on check in but I cannot fault this hotel other than the residents bar...,5,2012,02,17
205,Pricey but excellent service,"I stayed here for a conference in January 2012 and was overall very pleased. The service was excellent, most meals were good (but pricey), and the hotel was very nice. The hotel is in a suburb about ten minutes outside the city center but you can get to town by a long walk or short train or taxi ride. Overall, I would recommend it for someone looking for a luxury hotel in Dublin. ",5,2012,02,11
205,Not even close to being the best,"I spent two nights here and have to say I'm more than a little shocked that it gets the raving reviews it does. I must have missed something. Over priced and lacking any modern features was the overall impression I was left with, so far off the mark compared to other Four Seasons. The rooms were desperately in need of a revamp, I thought I'd checked into my grandmothers spare bedroom, and the price didn't match my expectations. 12 Euros a day for wireless...really? I was told that this was because of the provider when I mentioned my above feedback at checkout.

If you're looking to stay at a 5 star hotel and under the age of forty then I would look elsewhere in Dublin!

The staff were great, and this is in no way a reflection of them.",2,2012,02,11
205,Fantastic,"I cannot say enough about this hotel.  The staff are exceptional, the rooms are luxurious and the spa was expensive but terrific!  I went on business for a meeting at the hotel (terrific meeting arrangements by the way) but I would love to go back for pleasure. Just top-notch all the way.",5,2012,02,08
205,Fab Hotel,"If you want to see service at it's best , this is the best of the best .Seasons restaurant is just fantastic for dinner and breakfast .We had a junior suite that was beautiful.we had our daughter with us and she loved every bit of the luxury the hotel had to offer.Can't wait to return.Fab staff",5,2012,01,30
205,Four Season's Spa,"I went to Four Season for a spa. The staff are very nice but its not the aromotheraphy massage is not worth €145 I should say. I would have expected a superb ambience and great masseuse. Comparing it with the spa in The Heritage Hotel in Kildare, The Four Seasons spa will come as a disappointment.",3,2012,01,30
205,Top class again,"I can't say kind enough words about our stay again. Top class staff, large room, fantastic breakfast. Every member of staff make you feel welcome! You won be disappointed, book it!!",5,2012,01,26
205,Amazing Accomodations!,"The Four Seasons staff were wonderful, made us feel right at home!  We were really spoiled and loved our stay at this beautiful hotel!",5,2012,01,26
205,The hotel is fabulous - but it's dwarfed by the quality and friendliness of the staff.  It's my home away from home!,"It's a great hotel with high quality rooms, fitness, spa and restaurant - but the staff makes it a home away from home.",5,2012,01,25
205,RElaxing heaven,"I am affirm believer of, if it isn't better than home it isn't a holiday. The Four Seasons in Dublin is exceptional in every sense from service to pillows.  I have been many times and each time I am impressed all over again.  From my sons name on the cookie waiting in his bedroom for him to the fact that the bar man remembered what my husbands and my drinks were from our last stay.  The staff always go the extra mile.

I am a complete foodie and just love the breakfast.....I am still trying to make my scrambled egg as good as theirs....what do you use??  Only change I would not be as keen on is the change from fine dining to grill concept.  I feel it is not as special a dining experience and very limited, especially of for example you like to eat fillet steak, it's the same sauces as last time and very simple but still brilliant cooking....I can have fries at home I want emulsions, foams and  samphire things I dont get every day.

Anyway not since the Four Seasons Chiangmai have I come across such a consistent level of great service....look forward to seeing you soon.....please change the Seasons Restaurant!

205,Great Stay,I stayed here with my husband for 1 night in December. The staff were extremely helpful and all keen to assist with every need. We had afternoon tea which was a treat and the place was oozing with a delightful athmosphere. We attended a function in the hotel and again the food and service was top class.The room was very spacious and comfortable. Overall a great stay in a lovely hotel.,5,2012,01,19
205,"Top, Top, Top","Stayed here a few weeks back. Very professional service throughout without being at all annoying. I stayed 2 nights for business and would definitely look to stay when staying in Dublin on a private account. The large open reception areas impresses upon entering the hotel. This having now moved to the right hand side of the hotel upon entry. With a hotel bar (old cigar lounge style) and an excellent restaurant this hotel could be used for personal or corporate travel. 
Whilst it is possible to get cheaper and more central hotels in Dublin a stay here is really worth it.",5,2012,01,14
205,"Lovely Hotel, Rooms basic..","Stayed here recently with friends it was our christmas present to ourselves... hotel lovely we had bar food because we were at craft fair all day and didn't know what time we were dining at, food was good and the waiting staff excellant. However the rooms were basic enough and after ordering and paying for a triple room what greeted us was a twin room with a camp bed.. not exactly 5 star material....My other little gripe wi-fi 12euro... fairly serious in the economy we find ourselves in.... Although on a brighter note, Breakfast was amazing!",4,2012,01,11
205,"Always the most attentive service anywhere, staying here is sheer indulgence of the very best kind.","We absolutely love staying at this hotel.  It is not the most convenient location but the amenities more than make up for this.  Service here is completely marvelous,  no detail is overlooked.  The concierge staff will go to great lengths to customize your stay and get you reservations anywhere.  The hotel is excellent for families travelling with children (a lovely pool, the best children's menus we have ever seen, movies, games, toiletries.....) but luxurious enough that it is a real treat no matter what the occasion.  Food and drinks at all of the hotel's outlets are flawless.  We have stayed here yearly for the past 6 years and look forward to each return visit with great anticipation, in no small part because of the outstanding staff.",5,2012,01,11
205,Top Notch Dublin Hotel,"On a family trip to Ireland we stayed for 2 nights. The 2 rooms we had were large and beautifully appointed. From check-in to check-out the staff was professional, friendly, and accommodating. We had a wonderful dinner in the dining room although the service there was a little slow. Breakfasts were amazing. 
Only drawback to the hotel is it is a little far from the center of Dublin. The hotel does have a complimentary car available to shuttle anywhere into the city , but it is on a first-come, first served basis.",5,2012,01,11
205,Subpar by Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton standards,"The property is dated Yes I know it is an old building and everything blends in but for the price, a flat screen tv and basic amenties that a Holiday Inn provides is required. One thing I can't stand is the varying degrees of major hotel brands standards. When you goto the Four Seasons, you expect all that goes with it. There were times the front desk area and concierge was a ghost town during the day. I was going to stay 2 weeks but I decided to leave elsewhere.",3,2012,01,09
205,Not up to Four Seasons reputation,"A group of six flew to Dublin from Boston for a quick 4 day get-away to Dublin on an Aer Lingus package that included 4 nights at the Four Seasons Hotel.  This hotel is very nice but not exceptional.  It is a very corporate/business traveler type hotel with very little charm or unique appeal.  The hotel could be in any location in the world and you would never know the difference.  

The location in Ballsbridge is just a bit outside of the action of Dublin.  So for a group of six, this meant always having to get two cabs into the city and back for sight-seeing, dinners, etc.  We did have dinner in the hotel's Ice Bar one night which was very good, but again, you could be in Seattle, Toronto, Frankfurt, etc..  

Overall, we had a great time and many good memories of Dublin but I would probably stay  closer to Dublin Centre (perhaps the Shelbourne) had I to go again.",4,2012,01,09
205,Friendliest Four Seasons in the World,"Stayed in the beginning of December and had wonderful trip to Dublin. We had never been to Dublin and we count on the hotel with good advice on transportation, resturants and sights. The staff didn't disappoint us. They answered all our questions and offered good suggestions. While they are polite and professional their Irish warmth and kindness show through. The hotel is a bit outside of the sightseeing areas but the convenient bus service makes it easy to get there. And Aircoach from the airport pickups and drops off across the street from the Four Seasons. We found the food at the hotel to be delicious and a good value. We have stayed at many Four Seasons and when it comes to service and friendliness this one can't be beat.",5,2012,01,09
205,Fantastic hotel with excellent service,"My wife and I have recently returned from Dublin following a 3 night stay at the Four Seasons- this is the first time we have stayed with this brand.

I made the booking via telephone in November 11 to see if calling the hotel direct could offer any deals- we were upgraded to a Junior Suite. The rate included breakfast.

The bus dropped us right outside the hotel as it is on the airport bus route. We were greeted as returning customers by the doormen and were greeted in the lobby area and directed to Reception for check-in.

We had a room on the 4th floor which had already been turned down for the evening (we arrived at 8pm)- which was fantastic- plenty of space, couch, writing desk, dining table, LCD tv, mini-bar and drink prep area. The bedroom was large with it`s own TV (not LCD), I-POD docking station, chairs and bureau. 

The bathroom was lovely with marble, separate WC, glass panelled shower (great shower) and soak bath, gowns come as standard and there was a plentiful supply of toiletries- some of which came home with us!!

There is a turn down service and tea,coffee and fresh milk replenishment each evening

Issues we had with the room were the sink plug wouldn`t stay in place and one side of the mattress sagged more than the other (too many heavy business men I fear). Both problems were rectified within a few hours.

We had breakfast in our room on all 3 days- tray charge is 4.50 euro and is well worth it- as the in room table is laid and breakfast served on that- which is nice as you can open the curtains, sit in your dressing gown, read the paper and relax as if your own home- but with that added bit extra. Breakfast was excellent on all three occasions.

We ate `in-house` on the 1st & 3rd nights- the first was in the Cafe Bar where we both had steak- both were lovely- service was excellent.

The other time we ate in the Ice Bar and had tapas- these were quiet bland- nothing special versus say a High St joint like La Tasca- 

The parmesan shavings with the beef carpaccio was actually grated parmesan (piled high) and really lacked taste- like it came out of a catering pack. 

The Albondigas (meatballs in tomato sauce) were weak- the meatballs lacked flavour and sauce was very runny and looked like tinned soup- I wouldn`t have them again unless there is an improvement here. 

The Tortilla Espanola was excellent as was the melted whole brie with bread sticks and jam.

The service was excellent- just the food quality let this bar down a little.

My wife used the spa and gym on two occasions- both times were very good- free towels, slippers and gowns.

My only real complaint with this hotel (and most hotels actually) is the lack of free public wi-fi. I normally stay at Holiday Inns on business and these usually always offer a free period of use or have free wi-fi in public areas.

Overall we were very satisfied, the staff were excellent across all staff groups we encountered and would definitely stay here again when we next visit Dublin.",5,2012,01,08
205,"Close, but no cigar.","My partner and I had the pleasure of staying at the Four Seasons Dublin on New Years Eve 2011 as part of a last minute trip to the capital. The rates on offer were on par with other five star properties in the city, if not a little lower so we settled on the FS. Needless to say, my expectations were high, something which shouldn't be trouble for any Four Seasons to meet.

The hotel itself is quite deceiving from the outside, but has been constructed with consideration to blend in with the local red-bricked houses of Ballsbridge. On arrival, I parked in the hotel car park which is located very conveniently close to the main entrance. On my approach with my bags and suit carrier, no member of the concierge team offered to help nor extended a 'hello' - quite basic for a five star property. 

Upon entering the lobby which is elegantly decorated, I was directed towards the reception desk where I was to check-in. The process was very efficient, and the lady who checked us in was very pleasant and extremely obliging as we had arrived early. She directed us to our room (no rooming here) and off we went. No inquiries were made with regards to lunch or dinner reservations which we had to make at a later stage. 

Our room (a deluxe) was quite large, with a fantastic bathroom complete with walk-in shower and a separate bathtub. The room also had plenty of wardrobe space and a huge minibar with great choice for the guest. The bed was an extremely comfortable king with the right amount of linens. The rooms are equipped with climate control supplying cool or warm air instantly and very quietly. My only disappointment with the room was the television - talk about a '90s flashback, it was an ugly old CRT unit. I feel that an LCD/LED television would have finished the room off nicely. 

My partner and I were both anxious for lunch, so I phoned down to make a booking. Unfortunately, Seasons Restaurant was closed this particular day which was disappointing, so we had to make do with the Café. Upon entering, we were seated efficiently - this was the best part of the Café experience. From then on, the service we received was nowhere near what Four Seasons pride themselves on - something which we were looking forward to experiencing in Ireland having visited other Four Seasons properties in Europe. We were served by a total of three members of staff, each of which made no effort to make polite small-talk and name usage was non-existent in the food & beverage outlets. It took a good 5 - 10 minutes before a member of staff came to top-up our water, something that constant table checks should pick up on. The food itself was very nice indeed. Chouder & Crispy Pork Belly for starters, followed by Venison for main course. Chocolate yule log and Christmas Pudding to follow, both of which were nice but very sweet. An espresso finished our lunch, which came to a total of €85.50.

Following this, we decided to take the house car to the city. Unfortunately, at the time, the driver was already on a trip but we were informed at the concierge desk that he would be back in 20 minutes. An offering of a tea/coffee while we waited would have been nice, but that never happened. After about 40 minutes, the car returned and we headed to town. Our driver,  whose name escapes me (Irish gent with silver hair and glasses), was extremely pleasant and made plenty of chat to pass the time away as we went to the city. 

The following morning we went down for breakfast with high expectations once again. However, what greeted us was far from impressive. A self-service, yes, self-service hot and cold buffet with a limited enough choice for Four Seasons standards. Of course there was an A La Carte menu available, but that didn't appear to be included in our Full Irish for €26-29 per person. The service was also very sloppy here, with a good ten minutes passing before replacement cereal bowls were brought out and plates appearing not to be polished. This is what I felt let the hotel down a lot, and again, is something so basic. 

Our check-out was very efficient, with Damien (I think) extending a warm welcome back before we see the New Year again. I know that this review may seem overly picky, but for the Four Seasons, these basic problems should not exist. I do recommend the hotel, but would be slow to return unless the service improved dramatically.",4,2012,01,04
205,Perfect as usual,My family and I make this an annual event after the madness of Christmas over the last few years and as always return home completely relaxed - Breakfast is superb - staff as always a pleasure from arrival to departure. Housekeeping excellent. Surprise Four Seasons 50th Birthday Invitation to use on future visits appreciated.,5,2012,01,04
205,Four Seasons Dublin- OK but not great,"Our family stayed for three nights at the Four Seasons Hotel in Dublin in August 2011  The main areas of the hotels are gorgeous.  We stayed in a one bedroom suite which was extremely large, but a little outdated.  Furniture was worn, etc...  The service was impeccable, however the hotel was not as ""kid friendly"" as it claims to be.  Although Dublin itself is expensive, we found the prices for food and beverages at this hotel to be extremely costly.  Dinner in the lounge for two adults and one three year old (childrens menu) with a few drinks, far exceeded 100 euro.  The hotel is located a bit out of the City Centre but we found the 20 minute or so walk to be enjoyable.  All in all, it was a nice hotel but for the price tag there are better places to stay in Dublin.",3,2011,12,29
205,Best Experience - Cant Wait To Go Back.,"My holiday really started when I contacted the sales team at the Four Seasons Hotel, their professionalism was outstanding in looking after my holiday requests and my children especially loved their stay. They were greeted at check in by Preetam, with their own step and check in card and they were sent to their room with choclate coins from a pirates chest and a balloon, a great start and without doubt the best breakfast I've ever had, the kids are still talking about their chocolate pancakes! Very child friendly and I can't wait for my next visit. My only reqeust would be that whilst the hotel does have a business center with free internet service it would be more convenient for guests to have free internet in their rooms.",5,2011,12,28
205,Christmas Party at the Four Seasons.,"Had a recent Christmas party where the staff, accomodation, food and overall experience was exceptional.",5,2011,12,28
205,Nice hotel but a little dated.,"This was my first stay in the Four Seasons and it was a treat for my parents as my father was celebrating his 80th birthday. Check in was efficient and friendly. 

My brother and I stayed in a twin room and our parents in an executive suite. Our room was bright and spacious for a twin room and the bathroom is an good size as well with a walk in shower and separate bath. My brother and I both agreed that the room could do with being refurbished. Purely from the perspective of what one see's in other 5 star hotels, this one is dated.

Our parents were delighted with their room which had a spacious lounge, separate dressing room and walk in wardrobes. Again whilst my parents were delighted with the room, knowing what is out there in more modern hotels would again suggest that the room could do with an upgrade. Having said that, both rooms were comfortable and provided a good night's sleep.

The food was excellent, both for breakfast and for dinner. When confirming our reservation I advised that the reason for our stay was to celebrate my father's birthday. The hotel of their own accord kindly left a small birthday cake in my parents room on our first evening. It was a nice touch and is a good indication of the service one can expect. The service is excellent throughout and aside from the need to upgrade the rooms, the hotel is value for money.

Our rate was a room basis including breakfast. There are many other hotels which are more expensive on the basis that they charge on a per person basis which is something which I frankly find annoying and would not deliver half the service that the Four Seasons deliver.",4,2011,12,25
205,I expected nothing less...fabulous :),"The room was a decent size, and very comfortable beds. The food was outstanding. The staff were very friendly and helpful. My kids were given treats, which they loved. We had lots of fun here, a great place. (well, duh, it's the Four Seasons)",5,2011,12,23
205,"The best hotel, perfect stay from start to finish","This was my second stay at the Four Seasons in Dublin and, as remembered, every detail was perfect from start-to-finish. I arrived in a taxi before my friend and my bags were immediately taken so I could check in with ease. Check in was entirely pleasant and without complication. I was able to leave a keycard for my friend who would be arriving later. We also received a room upgrade on arrival.

, I had to send some documents with some urgency so I went straight to the spacious and comfortable business centre to do so without any ahssle before going to the room. When I got to the room on the second floor it was spacious and well-appointed with high-quality furniture and the wonderfully-spacious bathroom one comes to expect from Four Seasons.

When my friend arrived we had a few drinks in the lounge area as the Ice Bar was jam-packed with people enjoying pre-Christmas drinks. We were eating dinner that evening in Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud and when I asked for a taxi to the restaurant the concierge immediately had one of the porters show us to one of the Four Seasons cars (a luxury seven-series BMW) which drove us to the restaurant.

When we returned after dinner the Ice Bar was a little bit more quite so we had a couple of extra drinks there before retiring to enjoy a wonderful night of sleep.

Breakfast the following morning in the Seasons restaurant was up to the usual standard and every enjoyable In addition to the cooked breakfast (which was presented in a wonderful way) there was the continental buffee, a hot buffee, and a chef on-hand to cooks eggs to the guests' preference.

From start-to-finish the service in the hotel was exceptional. All of the staff members we interacted with were extremely pleasant, competent and efficient.

My only regret was that it was only one night.",5,2011,12,23
205,Good stay! Room ok but loved spa,"My husband and I stayed in late August for two nights celebrating a special anniversary.  The hotel was difficult to find by car from the airport with directions from the website but it was also crowded due to a rugby game.  Our room was medium sized and bright on a lower floor.   There was a deck which would have been nice to go out on to see the grounds but the door was locked.  The staff at the front desk was very pleasant and helpful and there was a handwritten note and plate of chocolates in our room...very nice touch!  We loved the indoor pool and spa...so relaxing after a long trip.  We did have breakfast our first morning while we waited for our room to be prepared...portions were large but food was not great and very overpriced..$50 for breakfast and coffee for two people.  Service was ok.  Overall the hotel was very nice and we enjoyed our stay.  It was located in a quiet area outside the city center but is only a 10-15 minute bus ride to the sights.  They have a free, secured parking lot at the hotel.",4,2011,12,22
205,Best Hotel in Dublin,"Service, atmosphere, overall trumps the Shelbourne, Westbury and the Westin by a long way.
Only 2K from town, if you can deal with a short taxi journey, Four Seasons is a must.
Shelbourne a 4 star mascarading as a 5 star.",5,2011,12,21
205,very comfortabe and relaxing!,"Fabulous place, but my expectations were obviously too high. Booked a junior suite, was so not what is pictured on the website, suite was nothing out of the ordinary, bed was amazing though, super comfortable with down duvet, bathroom amazing, although let down by cheap toilet paper and tissues, no coffee making facilities or complimentry water, disappointing!  the garden view turned out to be a view of the roof of the building! The staff were amazing too, so helpful.",5,2011,12,18
205,Just Average,"Accompanied my husband on a business trip so we were booked into the Four Seasons. Read the many reviews here and thought it would be a very nice choice to stay. I wa quite disappointed. We checked in late because our flight from London was delayed. We arrived at the hotel at around 11:30pm and was not greeted with what I had expected. We had 2 large suitcases and carry ons that we took ourselves to the room. No one made it a point to take them away from us. The person behind the registration desk was not very welcoming and projected an ""I can't be bothered"" attitude when asked a few questions about getting to the heart of the city in the morning. There is a car that will take you there, free of charge, but no one on this site or on any notice at the hotel has mentioned that it is not available until 1:00pm, so do not depend on it for early morning ventures. The room is nothing at all to brag about, typical room. Fancy marble bathrooms, clean, comfortable bed, safe, dryer, sure nice robes and slippers, but that is not what makes a stay. For there to be NO coffee/tea service in the room was unbelievable, not to mention that you must pay for Wi-Fi service. These two ammenities are so common in so many other hotels in Europe of this standard, even not so..that I was rather shocked that a hotel of this standard has the audacity to charge, and 13 Euros a device !...The hotel is not near the heart of the center, so if you are looking for quiet then this is it. There are buses that stop right around the corner, a few minutes walk. There are no close restaurants or cafes, so if you plan on using the buses,,.I suggest purchasing a 3 day pass so that you never have to worry about having the exact change. We never ate on the premise so I cannot comment on that. The women at the registration desk were helpful with giving me info on shopping. All in all I would not stay here again. I do not know what all the fuss is about. This Four Seasons hotel is average. Nothing fancy, nothing oh so elaborate,  and the charges for the ammenities that they do have is over the top. I would not choose to stay here again when I return to Dublin.",3,2011,12,18
205,Relaxing Night away,"We booked into the Four Seaons as a treat, and mostly due to location, i was attending Vincents Private Hospital the next morning for Minor Surgery and it suited fine.  Also since we had holidays cancelled on us already this year it suited to just treat ourselves for one night.  We arrived at the hotel and parked in the car park outside and went in to check in.  Check in was very fast and we were offered help with our bags, but we were fine... 

We followed the directions to our room... was a lovely room, however the view was not wonderful, we were looking into the back of RDS  and the skip and bin area for the hotel... but if you looked up you could see the Dublin Mountains so this was nice... 

We had afternoon tea in the hotel which was nice, we were not hungry enough for the full afternoon tea so went for a mini one.. 

We dined out of the hotel that night, in Ballsbridge, it was only when we arrived back that we read that there was a Car available to bring us if we wished.  Also at this stage we read that there was underground parking also, these should be highlighted better. 
I was a little annoyed that there were no tea making facilities in the room... I understand that maybe people attending this hotel do not make their own tea... but lets be honest, most would if it were available.  I didn't spend the 5.95 plus 4.50 room service charge for a cup of tea!

The Bathroom boasted all marble tiles, a separate bath and shower and a separate toilet..  There were lovely tolietries, but i have to say i could have done with a little more shampoo as they were small bottles for 2 people.  

The bed was very comfortable and the arm chair was too... 1 comment i would make is the Four Seasons should move with the times as should many hotels for plug sockets.  most people like to keep their phone at their bedside at night and normally charge it, we couldn't as there were no bedside plugs.  This was never an issue when this hotel was built, but now phones are used as Alarm Clocks, mobile offices and much more...   

It was a lovely hotel to say we have spent a night in.  Our Breakfast was a bit of s shocker, i don't eat hot food in the morning so i said i would go for cereal from the Buffet, this proved to be a very expensive bowl of cereal at €22.00, I wasn't aware of this, but we just paid it as my partner pointed out i could have eaten anything from the Buffet for this price, I wish i did now!!!   
I have no real complaints about the hotel, just some observations.  I won't be in a rush back to it as as previously said we only booked it as a treat.  It was a very nice hotel and finished to a very high standard, but everything is additional after you book, apart from the news paper which was delivered in the morning, this was great.",4,2011,12,15

205,"One of the best stays I've ever had, anywhere, ever.  Amazing service, even in advance.","I can't say enough good things about this hotel.  Family of four, treated like royalty, in luxurious but comfortable Four Seasons style.  Impeccable service, and the food was outstanding.  Beautiful facility and spa.  Personalized kids treats and robes.  (Don't listen to concerns about location.  Not in the heart of the city, but such a short-ride (5-10 mins) into town using the courtesy car or cheap taxis.  Dublin is small and manageable.)  Impressively, the hotel responded immediately to very specific advance requests made via email, including keeping a specific holiday menu open for a couple days.  I will find any excuse to return to this tremendous hotel.  Thanks for an amazing stay.",5,2011,12,07
205,"The staff is exceptional, stay could not have been better.","Our company hosted a meeting here and the staff were exceptional.  We have used hotels all over the world for such events and I have never worked with a more helpful, accomodating and professional staff.  The food, the rooms, the service were all amazing - I don't give a good review lightly and honestly had no complaints, my stay was both relaxing and comfortable with no fuss and no hassle.  Hats off to the exceptional management and team and the Four Seasons.  Also FOOD IS AMAZING!",5,2011,12,07
205,was not expecting any less,"stayed in this hotel with my partner and our 2 daughters, for 2 nights only, but we will be back for sure. The level of care is really amazing, all staff members are so friendly and welcoming.
The check-in was very efficient, the room was lovelyand in good condition, just quiet surprised with old style tv, but that did not affect our stay. Went for a drink in the bar before dinner, Laura was very charming.
Then on to dinner in the main restaurant (not cafe), the food was really special, they had some lovely herbs on the steaks, different but gave the meat a lovely taste we had never experienced before. Our server Andre, showed the girls the pastry shop, and they all came back with their own selection, that was a lovely touch, our daughters are still talking about it. 
Johny was very helpfull with our dietary requirements, and with his team made our experience a very pleasant one. Due to the kindness of all employees, we felt we had to go for dinner again the next day, and as the previous one, we all enjoyed the food and hospitality. Due to family arrangement, we did not avail of any other facilities, but we'll return to do so. I would not hesiate to recommend this hotel for families, kids are made very special, not like in some other places.",4,2011,12,07
205,Simply amazing,"Best hotel I've stayed in a long time. The huge marble bathrooms, the décor throughout the hotel almost make you feel at Windsor Castle. It's so cosy and warm, you'll love to spend an evening with a brandy in the lounge/bar downstairs.
Staff extremely polite and helpful, and I slept on the fluffiest bed/pillows ever.
Also the breakfast has got plenty of choices, without the usual low-quality buffet, and reasonably priced too.
Definitely recommended, will be back here again!",5,2011,12,06
205,What an amazing hotel!,"This hotel certainly lives up to the Four Seasons expectations.  We only spent one night here (unfortunately) but it was the best night's sleep we had all trip.  The most comfortable bed, pillows, comforter i have ever laid on.  The concierge was very friendly and helpful - they recommended local restaurants and city tours.  The best part was that our room was ready for us upon our arrival at 7am!  We were expecting to have to drop off our bags then head straight into the city after our overnight flight from NY but the front desk checked us in at 7am and handed us the room key - allowing us to take a quick nap before heading out for a full day in Dublin.  What else could you ask for?!  There was a safe and hair dryer as well as the necessary toiletries in the room.  The hotel has a free shuttle bus that drops you off in the center of the city also.",5,2011,12,05
205,High Quality hotel and Service,"The rooms and general areas of the hotel were in great condition and kept to a high standard. At all times the staff were very helpful and courteous. The hotel is located just outside the city centre but was perfect for my meeting in the Ballsbridge area of the city.
The hotel was very quiet and as I like fresh air it was nice to have a hotel where you can open the windows.
While it was not a cheap hotel, the stay was excellent.",5,2011,12,04
205,Great hotel with a great staff,"We stayed at the Four Seasons recently . We flew in from Boston and got there around 10am 
the staff let us check in early and were very accommodating . I was with family and booked 3 rooms. The Spa was excellent . The rooms large and well decorated. Concierge was most helpful.",5,2011,12,03
205,A horrendous dining experience,"I attended a professional award evening at the 4S Dublin that regrettably proved to be an unforgettable experience. The room for the venue needed an urgent refurbishment; the evening started with ""Champagne"" that was a barely passable Proseco. Dinner itself was extremely disappointing with a 5 oz piece of beef, overcooked, served with appalling veggies. All this for an incredible €250 per person... I know that the organisers must have had a nice cut on this but I find particularly outrageous that the 4S participate shamelessly to such a masquerade. I have been to quite a few 4S properties around the world; this one is very, very substandard regarding food and business venue. The only plus: service was good, professional and friendly.
Never again",2,2011,12,02
205,Didn't quite meet expectations,"This hotel is only worth the money if you are staying in a suite. If you can only afford a moderate, superior or deluxe room, book somewhere else as you will get more value for your money. Although the prices for the suites are extortionate!

We stayed for 3 nights in a Superior King room and it was somewhat disappointing.  The room was nice enough, however not what we expected for a five star hotel - no free wi-fi, extremely old-fashioned tv, dated decor, no complimentary tea/coffee making facilities, no complimentary water in the rooms.  No complimentary anything!!

We have stayed in far nicer and larger rooms in 4 star hotels. This was our first experience of Four Seasons, we have booked a week long stay in the Four Seasons Las Vegas next summer and hope it meets our expectations more than Dublin.

We arrived late, no-one held the door open for us, check-in was quick, however we were not offered any help carrying our 3 bags to our room. Not five star service. In fact we found throughout our stay that the service was very hit and miss.

Our deluxe room was basic, The hotel website promises ""Deluxe Rooms offer a variety of views over the landscaped gardens or the tree-lined neighbourhoods of Ballsbridge and Donnybrook"", we had no view whatsoever, unless of course you count the corner of the RDS carpark.  The bathroom again was basic enough and the shower extremely disappointing for five star hotel.  The room however was comfortable and the bed especially was very comfortable. 

Location wise the hotel is a good 20 minute brisk walk from the city-centre (Grafton Street).  The Aircoach from the airport stops right outside the hotel (€8), and the hotel is next door to the RDS and convenient to Lansdowne Road. 

The ICE bar has nice decor but no real atmosphere on the Saturday night we visited.

We highly recommend the restaurant Hugos on Merrion Row for dinner, approx €8 in taxi from the hotel.

Taxi from hotel into Grafton street approx €14.

Taxi to airport approx €18.",4,2011,11,28
205,Very nice hotel - great service & not far from City,I recently stayed in the Presidential Suite of the Four Seasons with my partner for two nights and found it very luxurious.  We were very lucky to have stayed here and the first night we made the most of the suite and stayed in and ordered room service.  The service and food was very nice and we were given a complimentary bottle of champagne with strawberries.  The room (or rooms) in this suite are decorated in an old english style and are truly lovely.  We also had breakfast at the hotel which was very nice too.  The only bad thing to say is that the porridge is made with water and not milk but that's just a very small criticism.  We had a great stay here at the hotel.  Ooh a note for the girls - the bathrooms are stocked with Bulgari toiletries  :),5,2011,11,23

205,Warm and friendly staff,My stay at Four Seasons Hotel Dublin was relaxing. The staff were warm and friendly. I would gladly recommend it anyday,5,2011,11,20
205,Born to serve!,"My question is, how do they select the employees to work in a Four Seasons? Or maybe it is the pay? Anyhow, service is what this property is all about, yes the rooms are a bit old fashion, yes it is not located in the city center of the city, but if you are looking to have a memorable stay, do not look anymore! ",5,2011,11,17
205,AWESOME hotel,"though not exactly close to the city, this Hotel is one of the best i've stayed in. Alan was so friednly when we checked in and accomodated us quickly even though we got there prior to check in time. Overall a GREAT experience, highly recomended.",5,2011,11,16
205,The Four Seasons is back to its original buzz,"...its full, the new tapas bar is great (much more welcoming than the old ice/vodka bar) and the levels of service have returned to their original levels.  Its back!",5,2011,11,16
205,Super Excellent Service,"I was staying at the hotel for 3 nights in May, with my doughter. The staff was fantastic, clean and elegant room. The location is a bit far from the center of Dublin, but if You have feet You can walk or take the rail from Sandymouth (very close to the hotel) so the location is no problem.

The stay was great !",5,2011,11,15
205,"Beautiful hotel, with a friendly and helpful staff.","The rooms were beautiful, the bed, very comfortable, and the staff was very helpful.  They answered all our questions, were extremely helpful and pleasant.",5,2011,11,13
205,"Excellent food, warm, friendly atmosphere and staff, perfect location- I highly, highly recommend it!","This was an absolutely perfect place for two overworked young adults juggling careers and graduate school- the staff treated us like royalty, the room was warm and immaculate, and the location was perfect, just a few blocks from the center of Dublin. Everyone greeted us like we were old friends, not guests in a hotel- if you find yourself looking for a hotel in Dublin, I highly recommend this one! I admit it's a bit pricey (we booked it as part of a trip through a travel agent so we got a sizeable discount on the room), but it's worth every penny.",5,2011,11,09
205,Superb service,"The level of attention to detail was excellent. The cleanliness was superior to even other Four Seasons that I have stayed at. The desk staff was by far the most personable and helpful that I have ever encountered. They took their time to help me with Internet issues and cell phone problems without handing me off to phone support. The gift shop staff were eager to help. The bartender in the Ice bar treated me like a long lost friend, offering excellent advice on the suberb food. The hotel is beautiful, the Ice bar is worth the trip.  When my allergies started bothering me they came to my room immediately and changed the pillows and comforter from down to foam ones. Great towels. Only thing that I found bothersome was to sit at the desk on an old fashioned chair. After 15 minutes it was uncomfortable. They should upgrade these to stylish task chairs for the people who come on business and even the pleasure crowd who cruise the Net for local info.",5,2011,11,09
205,WOW!  This place was fantastic.,The service was great.  The location was perfect for us.  We were right next door to the RDS where the marathon expo was being held.  They were also only 1.4 miles from the start of the race.  The only downfall was that they charge you to connect to their Wi-Fi. And they charge extra to connect more than one device.  This is a service that should be FREE in a hotel of this level.,4,2011,11,09
205,Four Seasons,"Lovely hotel, spacious rooms. Had to pay for internet though. Very expensive but a nice treat.",5,2011,11,09
205,The best ever! And I'm frequent traveler...,Best hotel ever. Luxury rooms and everything's real :),5,2011,11,09
205,Very good,Stayed on a 3 for 2 night deal and the whole experience was excellent. Highly recommended.,5,2011,11,09
205,entry level Four Seasons,pretty good property - a little old school but nice price point for Four Seasons due to Irish downturn.  not centrally located so it's probably 10mins to the late night bars/restaurants.  wrong side of town for quick access to airport.  good service and nice facilities.,4,2011,11,08
205,My wife and I stayed on the 18th Oct for a special birthday.,This is a top quality hotel in Dublin. Our suite was truly magnificent and the service superb. The spa is one of the best I have ever used. This hotel costs a bit more than others but delivers in every possible way. We have stayed before and we will be back again soon.,5,2011,11,07
205,"ONE OF THE BEST HOTELS NOT ONLY IN DUBLIN, BUT IN ALL OF IRELAND.","Every staff member in this hotel were extremely professional. They made my children feel very special and couldn't do enough for us. Excellent room, great spa, fab meals. Our children are ages 6, 11, 14.",5,2011,11,02
205,Fab hotel with fab staff!,Myself and my husband had a short break in the Four Seasons.... what a beautiful hotel and wonderful staff.  I cant fault anything about the hotel.  The prices were quite reasonable for a 5 star... i did expect them to be a little more expensive but there was very little in the difference in having a drink in the bars in the city and the hotel!!.  The lounge was a lovely place to relax and read the paper and have a drink.  We're going back at the beginning of December..... cant wait!!,5,2011,11,02
205,One of the best hotels in Europe,"As a seasoned traveller who spends over 80 days  yearly in hotels globally , this is without doubt one of the best . Hardworking polite staff, incredible luxury ,excellent food, great location.  .  Treat children as though they are royalty .",5,2011,10,31
205,Beautiful hotel in beautiful area!,"We arrived last Saturday, Oct. 29th.  There were alot of activities going on in the area so traffic was horrendous!  Courtesy car took us into Dublin Saturday night, which was nice.  Sunday morning had a delightful breakfast at Roly's on Merrion Street, a short walk from the hotel.  Lots of friendly locals there!  Pastries to die for, too!",5,2011,10,31
205,It is everything you could expect from Four Seasons,"The hotel seems located a bit outside of the city centre but it is only 10 min driver and 20 min walk from Grafton Street.   Rooms are very spacious, bright and comfortable. Service in each department is absolutely amazing! Exactly how you expect it to be in Four Seasons. 
I had a chance to have dinner in their restaurant and the food was gorgeous! The waiter was very helpful and his recommendation a perfect choice. I also tried their Room Service Menu and again it was beautiful!",5,2011,10,31
205,Friendly and Fabulous,"We stayed here for three nights with a lively five-year-old and two grandparents. The hotel was superb. We stayed in adjoining rooms, which were beautiful and impossible to fault. Our arrival was meet with a lovely warm welcome, and a baked cookie in the room for my little boy (with his name in icing). During our stay the concierge service was outstanding, along with the doormen and the restaurant staff for both dinner, and breakfast. We were able to book out children's films on DVDs to view in the evening and the leisure facilities were first class. The DART train to Dublin is just minutes away, taxis were in plentiful supply and the location is just minutes from the seaside as well, so we could enjoy being close to the city and get some fresh sea air too. I cannot wait to go back.",5,2011,10,31
205,Everything One Would Expect from the Four Seasons,"This hotel was everything we wanted and more.  Prior to our stay, we were warned of two things.  First, the hotel is located outside of Dublin.  This was not an issue at all.  The car at the Four Seasons was available to us whenever we wanted it, and cabs were freely available.  More importantly, it was only a 15 minute walk from the hotel to the center of the city.  Second, we were warned that the hotel lacked some of the character of Ireland that other hotels offered.  While the hotel may seem like generic luxury at first glance, it is much more.  The staff members were all so warm and helpful.  The indoor pool was beautiful.  We ate at the casual restaurant, formal restaurant, and at the bar.  There were traditional Irish selections and other food options.  Everything we ate, including breakfast, was outstanding.  This hotel was everything we would expect of the Four Seasons; it was perfect.",5,2011,10,27
205,Unforgettable hotel,We had a wonderful stay at this hotel. Everything was perfect and especially the staff. We hope to go back soon,5,2011,10,25
205,Great Hotel,"Beautiful hotel, nice location.  Truly top notch service.  WIFI is an extra charge which I always find to be an irritation.  Front desk staff was terrific, as were the valets.  We ate breakfast at the restaraunt, and everything was excellent.  Approximate $40 per person so not cheap, but very good.",5,2011,10,19
205,Four Seasons Hotel - Dublin,"Business or pleasure - I love this hotel.

The service is excellent and the staff are really pleasant.  Makes any trip enjoyable",5,2011,10,19
205,It's the Four Seasons,Gorgeous hotel with some interesting sculptures on the grounds.  The service was wonderful.  The concierge gave us some great restaurant recommendations and made dinner reservations for our family.  The rooms were fantastic and the most comfortable beds we slept in during our Irish holiday.  The location isn't ideal for walking into the city center but a short cab ride will take you into the city center.  We would stay at the Four Seasons without a second thought.,5,2011,10,13
205,Lovely Hotel Lovely Food and great staff,We found this hotel to be a great expirence and would have know hesitation in recommending it.,5,2011,10,13
205,outstanding,"visited the four seasons last week from cork with my husband , son and partner for dinner, it was the first time my husband was with me and he was blown away with the reception at the entrance and the staff and management in the fine dining restaurant.....as always the quality of the food was exceptional and presentation a delight to the eye. its hard to describe the dtaff as all of them are just wonderful, friendly, efficient, professional and unique. conor the manager on duty visited the table regularly to meaksure all were happy, jj, ken, john and the girls were so nice..even adam the chef visited our table . i met a new memebr of staff james i think who had recently joined the team and previously worked in canada and i hope he will enjoy working in dubllin,.  once again i would like to extend our sincere thanks to all the staff and cant wait to return, the hotel really deserves the hihhest of reviews",5,2011,10,12
205,superior service,"We stayed for two nights at this wonderful hotel and it set a new standard for excellent service.  Aside from the lovely rooms and fine dining, the staff was consistently some of the finest personnel we have encountered in our many years of travel. Although it is not in city center we enjoyed a walk along the sea and lunch in the little town of Sandymount, a short walk from the hotel. The final special treat was when we stepped out of the hotel into a misty rain and the doorman came over and offered us the courtesy car and driver to take us into city center for our date at the Abbey theater.  I would rate it a 5 star plus.",5,2011,10,09
205,DUBLIN AT ITS FINEST,Four Seasons Hotel Dublin was a wonderful experience for both my husband and myself.. Wonderful helpful caring people. The standard that the hotel sets did not disappoint! The grounds were lovely as well as the interior of the hotel. To see the finest in the hotel industry be sure to visit with the Four Seasons Dublin where everyone will make your stay memorable!,5,2011,10,05
205,Nice but expensive,"I know that when you book a Four Seasons, you expect to pay a little more, but this was different. We paid a LOT more and got an average 5 star hotel with 3 star service. We liked the hotel itself but the staff were not up to the standard you expect in 5 Star.",3,2011,09,30
205,"excellent on all counts, hospitality and luxury","enjoyed tea daily with excellent attitude and service, amenities are luxurious and the location is a good distance from the busy city central...however a driver can take you within 20 minutes to the center....there wasn't much to walk to from the hotel, but a stroll in the neighborhood was delightful....the staff and service were impeccable and dining was a real pleasure too....business and phone center is convenient and I can't recall the name of the bar on the right wing, but we enjoyed an evening drink there and the atmosphere was a more modern vibe then the regal hotel itself. really had a great time and will return without question.",5,2011,09,23
205,Truly great service,"My wife and I stayed for only one day at the Four Seasons Dublin, but wished we could have stayed much longer. We received an upgrade to the suite and it was extremely large ( I am guessing over 1200 sq ft) and well appointed. The bed and pillows were top quality and we both had a great nights sleep.
Our flight landed ealry and they were good to let us check in at 12:00. We had a chance to check oout the hotel - the pool is an excellent size and good temperature. We used the hot tub and it was the perfect temperature. Although neither of used the gym, it was top quality. The changes room in the pool were also top quality and the provided fruits and coffee and tea were a pleasant touch.
The concierge was very helpful to give us infomraiton about short walking trips and we enjoyed the recommnedations.
Please note that the Four Seasons is not that near the downtown. If you are looking for lively atmosphere (Temple Bar, etc.) it would be a cab ride back and forth. However, there are a coupl of nice restaurants around the corner.
This hotel is well deserving of 5 star, service was excellent from all staff and we also enjoyed a drink in the beautiful lounge.
All in all, an excellent hotel and highly recommended.",5,2011,09,23
205,Nice place to stay,Stayed for three days during a conference which was held at the hotel. The conference facilities were comfortable and roomy. Great rooms and a nice spa with pool and sauna. Breakfast was great!!! Good thing it was a bit of a walk into town...,5,2011,09,20
205,First choice for Dublin,Top quality hotel. Service and rooms are of the highest standard. Location is a short trip to the centre but not inconvenient overall.,5,2011,09,16
205,Four Season dublin,Excellently run hotel. Just a bit out of town but quiet. Food is superior.,5,2011,09,16
205,Inconvenient location,"We stayed one night in September, 2011.  Although we arrived early, they got us into a room by 11:30 am.  The room is the usual Four Seasons layout and decor, all very nice.  The front desk staff are excellent.  However, while waiting for our room, the four of us each ordered a cup of tea in the parlor area.  $40.  A bit much- it was just a cup of tea, nothing else.  They do have a complimentary car into town but it wasn't available when we wanted it.  So don't count on this service.  The breakfast was nice but the service was not good.  We had to flag down our service twice to get his attention.  It's a great Four Seasons hotel but not convenient to visiting Dublin.  The walk is more like 45 minutes, not 20 minutes, into town.  This is my second time to Dublin and I would not stay here again, primarily because of the location.",4,2011,09,15
205,Short & Sweet,"We stayed the weekend of the Ire v Eng rugby match, it was brief, just one night but very pleasant. All of the staff we encountered were very friendly and we had a lovely welcome in our room on arrival of handmade chocs a lovely surprise for my boyfriend who was celebrating his birthday! Beds were really comfy and huge! showers and bathroom were spacious. The hotel was perfect for our needs as the stadium was within walking distance.",5,2011,09,13
205,Fantastic experience - highly recommended,"As a final treat following our holidays in Madeira, we decided to book into the Four Seasons in Ballsbridge, Dublin for a night..  The reservation process was extremely efficient, the flexibility w.r.t. early check-in was most welcome (as we arrived into Dublin on an early flight); the room was amazing (offered upgrade to suite but declined as it was a further €200 but it was asked in a very nice way and in no way push); the food was excellent; service was superb... the staff were extremely courteous... did I mention the complimentary car to take you into town...   but just wait for the breakfast - and order it to your room...   it's brilliant and highly recommended.... and in case you haven't picked up on it as yet - I would ""highly"" recommend this hotel..  May be a bit on the expensive side, but worth it for that special treat...",5,2011,09,12
205,Wonderful hotel for family visit,"This hotel really exceeded my expectations in the way they treated the children.  Extremely friendly and welcoming ,we really enjoyed staying here with our 3 year old and 6 month year old. They can provide everything kids need and all the staff we great with the kids.
Fabulous place to stay if you are Dublin.  Even though the hotel is not in the center of town it is not far away, and for those minding their pennies, there is a bus that is easy to catch and goes right into central Dublin.",4,2011,09,12
205,Sorry we only spent one night here!,"We spent the first night of a whirlwind one week trip to Ireland here when tired after the trip over and a day touring Dublin.  The room and bathroom were large, up-to date, and very comfortable.  It is away from downtown but I cannot say how far as we came by rental car with GPS (you can park downtown for a price if you do not wish to take a local bus or the hotel van-both hotel and downtown parking were pricey-I would take the bus another time).  
Breakfast was not included and even continental breakfast was more than 20E but very early (I was down by 6 to look for a coffee shop), there is free coffee and tea available in the lobby as well as some delicious muffins and fruit.  None were replenished so this treat was for early birds and a pleasant surprise for me.  Around the corner and to the left of the hotel entry, you can walk a block and a half or so to an area with pubs, restaurants, some small stores and some decent morning coffee places.  We ate at one of the pubs as we wanted just one drink and light dinner before hitting the bed.  It was fine and friendly.  The neighborhood was nice for a morning walk or run.  I like that it is not downtown and that you can use the hotel facilities or nearby places for food etc.  I would have been happy to stay here longer.",5,2011,09,12
205,Whata great place to stay,"We enjoyed five nights at the Four Seasons and it was wonderful.   The room was very comfortable and well-equipped. While the area of Ballsbridge is not in the centre of town it is quiet and safe and only a 10 - 12 Euro cab ride away. The staff were all very helpful and friendly from the doorman to the reception staff  to servers and all seemed to enjoy their work.  

On several nights we took advantage of the complimentary limo service downtown to the theater which was great. It is helpful to let the doorman know in advance that you want to use the limo and they will let you know when it will be available.

I had forgotten to take an adapter to re-charge my camera battery and the hotel sent one up on a platter.  No kidding! The concierge(s) were great in suggesting restaurants in the hotel area, telling us where to catch the bus and arranging tours.  If you feel like walking ( about 20 minutes), get directions to Sandymount where there are several good neighborhood places to eat  and a Tesco grocery store.",5,2011,09,08
205,Excellent hotel for families.,"We stayed at this hotel after our original hotel was double booked. it was a rainy Saturday night with a rugby match on but they found us a lovely suite and our 2 young children were well looked after. We really liked the personal touches - mini bathrobes, cookies with their names iced on, colouring and crayons in the coffee lounge, and even their own keycards. The concierge gave me a good map and marked on where the duck pond was! We had a great night and I would love to return.",5,2011,09,08
205,Everyone should experience a Four Season's breakfast!,"I  stayed here during the RDS Horse Show recently for one night with a friend.  I used to stay a few years ago regularly during the Horse Show week and I have to say that the service during those ""Celtic Tiger"" days often left a lot to be desired.  However, on this occasion it could not be faulted.  Even when we were leaving and waiting for our jeep to be brought up from the car park; a particularly obnoxious man (unfortunately Irish) harangued the staff member and the said staff member remained polite and courteous!  A  feat I commented on and was informed that this is something they regularly have to deal with? 
The rooms are superb, slightly dated but very luxurious and I found the big ""clunky"" tv in the cabinet a bit of a surprise.  I love the robes provided and the marble bathrooms with lovely toiletries (not the usual cheap, nasty ones).  
The breakfast - oh the breakfast is truly glorious, especially as I had a severe hangover and a lovely waiter laughed when I told him and kept me supplied with fresh pots of tea made with tea leaves (tea should never be drunk from a bag in my opinion) in a glorious silver tea pot and service.  We sat there for hours reading the papers provided and  just people-watching, nibbling on lovely pastries after having enjoyed a blow-out, full-Irish and fresh fruit juices.  The staff were lovely; so natural and welcoming and very efficient.  
Later we came back after a morning at the show and had lunch in the bar and it was delicious with huge portions and again fantastic friendly service.  (Even though it was very busy).  
The night before as we were very late getting back from the show so we ordered room service and got delicious and beautifully presented club sandwiches.
The room rate was quite expensive as it was Horse Show week but they always seem to up the rates for this week.  I will be back again, hopefully, at the better rate.",4,2011,09,08
205,Excellent.  recommended.,"Excellent service .
Recommended - rooms extremely comfortable.",5,2011,09,07
205,rooms were great and quiet - service was great. I was able to relax and rest. The staff went above and beyond to help.,The people who work here are very helpful. In spite of ongoing construction outside when the windows were shut we could not hear the noise outside. We stayed here at the end of our trip so it was good to have the relaxing bathtub and shower available here. Although there is a lovely spa and hot tub and pool  (I went to look) I did not use them.,5,2011,09,07
205,We had a ball !!!!!,"Stayed for two nights with my husband.  On arrival car was parked for us, bags taken to our room, prompt check-in.  The room was very comfortable, clean and fresh.  Bathroom was large and immaculate.  Dining was excellent.  All the staff just could not do enough for us.  Whilst there there was an electrical fault and when the generator was switched on,  it did go on fire.  We were all evacuated immediately and weren't delayed too long while the fire crew arrived to sort this out.  The electricity did take some while to be switched on thus no hot food for the breakfast etc...",5,2011,09,05
205,Want you be pampered ? This is the place for you,"Great welcome, service second to none, friendly helpful staff, most comfortable beds, and the breakfast never to be missed. Great buzz about the place during the horse show week in august.",5,2011,09,02
205,Amazing Hotel,"Second time to stay and the Four Seasons hotel and from the moment you make your reservation you know you are going to stay somewhere special.  The attention to detail at this hotel is amazing, Children are make to feel so welcome in the Four Seasons which adds to the enjoyment of a family stay.  The Bedrooms are very spacious and the bathrooms are beautiful. The breakfast is an experience and staff are so helpful and friendly.  I love this hotel and if you are looking for the wow factor the Four Seasons really has it in abundance.",5,2011,08,29
205,Very nice...,"Was in Dublin for a quick business trip.  Stayed at this property.  Quite spacious, old school lobby/foyer - very nice layout. Has a pianist in the late evening, good selection of appetizers and ofcourse whiskeys. 

Spacious rooms, toilet/bath/sep shower. Courteous staff. Our company corporate rates were very competitive - value for money was very high. Gym is adequate, nice pool and jacuzzi - but one could run outside as streets are not very crowded.  There are several pubs and restaurants a few blocks away.

Only minor negatives would be the old school TVs (CRT) - could use flat screens and there was a bit of a delay at checkout in the morning...",5,2011,08,27
205,Great hotel and staff.,Great location which is quiet and only a 15 minute walk to St Stephen's Green. Try the bar menu or one of it's restaurants. One of best hotel fitness centers in Dublin but not up to US standards,5,2011,08,26
205,Luxury and excellence awaits you at the fabulious 5 star Four Seasons Hotel Ballsbridge,We had a wonderful time at this hotel and everyone was so friendly and welcoming at the hotel and we will certainly return in the future.,5,2011,08,25
205,Excellent,"My first trip to Dublin was unfortunately for a close friend's funeral. But staying at the Four Seasons made all the difference and it certainly help make the visit much easier for my wife and me. We had a junior suite and it was very spacious. The bed was extremely comfortable! The staff were excellent and very helpful.
We will be visiting Dublin again and will certainly be staying there again.",5,2011,08,24
205,Want to rate it heigher than 5 stars,"Stayed here the weekend of 19th & 20th August.  Oh my god what a hotel.  Staff so friendly, food excellent, rooms out of this world.  If you need or want a treat this is the place for you.   Everything was to the highest of standards have nothing bad to say about this hotel just wish i could stay more longer.    City Centre only about 7-10 taxi journey.  Don't have to wait for taxies as they are always outside the main gate of the hotel.   But the hotel has a car that will bring you from the hotel to the city centre free of charge (nice to give the driver a tip as he is so friendly)  oh & what a car that is BMW fab, you might have to wait if they car is gone on a journey into the city centre.  Loved every single thing about this hotel.   'We will be back in the near furture'.  Didn't go to the spa which will be done next time",5,2011,08,23

breakfast the next morning was lovely brought up on a lovely laid out trolly ....",5,2011,08,21
205,Did not live up to it's brand,"The accommodations were mediocre, the food was nothing to write home about, and the staff acted as though they didn't want to be bothered. The Four Seasons brand attracted me to spend a bit more money for what I expected to be a luxurious stay. It was a disappointment. The rooms were dated, they charge for Wi-Fi, and the food was bland or drenched in sauces. I would not recommend staying here for the money. Use your money to stay closer to the heart of the city (recommend Westbury Hotel) and spend the money you'll save enjoying the sites and local pubs.",3,2011,08,20
205,4oth birthday party in style in The Ice Bar,"The Ice Bar was the venue for a 40th birthday party. The service from Jose and his team was outstanding. They made amazing cocktails and tapas for our guests. They were also able to work to our budget with guests still getting the wow factor. 

As always the bedrooms were very clean and had all you would require for your stay. The hotel has the added benefit of a pool and spa.",5,2011,08,20
205,Excellent hotel with very friendly staff. Suberb location next to RDS,"We return time and time again to this fab hotel. The staff, rooms, food and atmosphere are great. The hair salon downstairs is very handy. The breakfast is superb. ",5,2011,08,18
205,We loved it and we´ll be back!,"4 adults and 1 baby on tour - all of us smiling and totally content with our fabulous 2 nights at Four Seasons Hotel Dublin. We had connecting rooms; worked to perfection. Before arriving, we were a bit uncertain about the distance between the hotel and the city centre, but it turned out to be an easy and even pleasant walk. This was important to us, since we are keen on discovering the environments in cities on foot, and not by car.",5,2011,08,17
205,Lives up to the brand,"If you can, enjoy this fantastic property just on the outskirts of Dublin.  Brilliant service, kid friendly and excellent food and concierge assistance.  ",5,2011,08,16
205,"Amazing property, outstanding employees","My husband and I decided to take vacation this year in Ireland, and we asked around and looked at reviews on this site and others to make our choice.  We were torn between being in the city center, near the action or choosing a luxury hotel that  allowed for quiet peaceful evenings away from the city noise.  After reading several promising reviews about the property we decided on a Jr. Suite in the peaceful quiet of the Embassy District, far away from the city center. My husband and I, have been known to spend entire evenings reading in the quiet of our home, we remarked on how we were able to experience the same quiet here even with hotel guests on either side of us.  Quiet evenings were very important to us and this Hotel certainly delivered.  We were extremely pleased with every aspect of this property.  The staff was friendly, helpful and provided prompt service when we needed it.  They gave us all the amenities we expected from a 5-Star facility.  The grounds were immaculate, the rooms spacious, quiet and lulled us into the relaxed mood we look for when getting away on vacation.
While I hate to point out specific ppl in this review there are always people that  are able to make you feel special during a visit.  I must reiterate that the entire staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome and show us every courtesy during our stay but  Emien, Omar Hans and the Concierge that talked at length with me about the ""gift of gab"" certainly helped to encourage us to recommend this place highly to our friends and others that are trying to make a decision on where to stay when visiting Dublin.",5,2011,08,15
205,Outstanding,"This is truly 5 star. From the valet parking, to the bellboy's attentiveness to our two small children on arrival, through check in, where they were both presented with their own room key cards (They're 3 & 4!). The free drink in the bar, the exceptional maid service. I could go on and on. Every staff member we met, asked if we were OK,. needed any assistance, needed anything further. 
If you are looking for somewhere to be confident of a capable team, and clearly briefed to ensure the customer is happy, where the staff really, genuinely, go the extra mile. This is it. Food and accommodation was great, but most of all, the staff enjoy the customers having a good time. It radiates throughout the place, which is credit to the hotel and its senior management. 5 Star hotels that really are 5 Star and that haven't given in to recessionary cutbacks are few and far between in Ireland today. This is one of the few.",5,2011,08,15
205,A little Gem in FANTASTIC city,"We greatly enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The hotel room was nicely decorated (we were upgraded to a suite so the room was very spacious for dublin). The staff was very warm, friendly and helpful. The breakfast was also good.",5,2011,08,15
205,Going downhill fast,"I want to love this hotel. I truly do.    Flying overnight from Newark, the steam room, sauna, pool, hot tub and chaise lounges located in the solarium, ease the transition to Ireland and the new timezone.  Were I able to sleep by the pool perhaps I could give this a more positive review.  I note that this was not my first stay at the Dublin Four Seasons. I am afraid to observe that with each stay it gets worse, while the price gets higher.  I have only myself to blame: I will not be staying here at Christmas time when I return to Ireland.  In the past our room has been ready early which helps the sleepy American.  I understand that no guarantee can be made but not having the room ready until 5:30 p.m. was going a little too far in the other direction.  I guess the Dell employee convention that populated the lobby also took over the rooms. Funny that Dell would choose to convene at this hotel as the technology is circa 1987.  There is no wi-fi in the public areas.  I purchased wi-fi for my room only to learn that it did not support Face Time on my ipad2.  Really? After meeting with hotel staff and speaking with the Internet provider I needed to upgrade my wi-fi purchase in order to stay in touch with my family back in New Jersey. The price for this convenience: twenty-five Euro for twenty-four hours.  We stayed in 3 other hotels during our June trip to Ireland. Everyone of them offered (at no cost) wi-fi, fast enough to allow me to Face Time. Moy House a 200 year old gorgeous manor (go here: now: amazing) wi-fi connection was better than a hotel that holds itself out as a business hotel.  Maybe I should have been clued in to the Hotel's Luddite approach by the ancient televisions in our Suite.  I would have looked past the sorry state of the decor, the tiny airless bathroom (yes in a Suite, bathroom was the size of a linen closet), the lumpy mattress, if I wasn't paying 700 Euro for the room. Although this may  be a pathetic American sensibility, I typically choose a Four Seasons for the comfort of home. No such comfort is afforded at the Dublin Four Seasons. With the Dublin Four Seasons: expect local B&B offerings, at London prices.  Sorry, next time I am staying at the Merrion.",3,2011,08,14
205,Stayed here for concert in RDS....perfect location!,"The main reason we stayed in this hotel was because of its proximity to the RDS as we were attending a gig there. (FYI if you want a cheaper alternative Bewley’s is just across the road). However, if your budget can stretch it, the four seasons is well worth it, it’s a beautiful hotel with brilliant staff. The room are nice if a little dated. The bathrooms are stocked with L'Occitane products, which was nice! The lobby area is very comfortable and the bar food is really good. We’ll be back!",5,2011,08,12
205,Nice Place,"We had a weekend here, and obviously our expectations were high as it was ""Four Seasons"" we had a suite which was enormous and clean but a little dated, no flat screen Tv! but this is being picky.

The staff were all very friendly, the service was excellent, and the Hotel is nicely located, food and drink was expensive but again the food was very good, and drinks were served top notch!

Would recommend as a good Dublin stop.",4,2011,08,09
205,1 night stay,"Fantastic hotel, food amazing, service excellent, rooms dissapointing.  I'm sorry but every hotel should have a kettle.  No slippers, TV old, furniture old. Bed very comfortable. No iron in the room.  The spa was lovely, had a very expensive treatment but there was a drill going next door. Nice ambience but treatment did not warrant the price.  Breakfast was fantastic",4,2011,08,09
205,Indeed five-star worthy!,"The Four Seasons Hotel Dublin was indeed a pleasant place to stay during our visit to Dublin. All though the hotel is located not that close to city center (45 min walk), there are many other good reasons to choose this place. The staff (all of them) acted very friendly and correct. The services of the hotel are overall very high and the atmosphere is in any way luxurious. The rooms are nice and spacious all though there are some lacks: There are no electric outlet for the hairdryer in the bathroom(!). And the TV and DVD-player are very old and in poor quality. Our room faced a giant ventilation shaft on the nearby building. The noise made it impossible to open the windows (a problem for about 30 rooms I guess) however it wasn´t  a problem thanks to the very efficient air condition in the room. Choose The Four Seasons Hotel when visiting Dublin next time.",5,2011,08,08
205,"Loved it, Far from City Center.","Great room and service. Another reviewer mentioned they had car service into the city center, which is true, but not on Sundays. Had to take a cab instead. Plenty of parking lovely park like area. Away from the hustle and bustle. Only hotel we stayed in in Ireland that did not require using the card key to turn on the electricity.  Great bed. True Luxury.",5,2011,08,01
205,Look forward to going back soon,"I travelled to Dublin on business and was lucky enough to be booked into the Four Seasons Hotel.

The staff are very friendly and helpful and were more than happy to suggest other bar/restaurants to visit.

I would certainly recommend this Hotel and will be visiting again very soon.",5,2011,07,31
205,"Great people, great hotel","Easiest review I can give -- If I ever go back to Dublin, I will not look for another hotel.  It would be a complete waste of time.  We've been home for about 3 weeks and I think I actually miss some of the people at the Four Seasons.  You really have to spend a few minutes with the doorman and you'll understand.  One thing that may surprise you: the lobby bar really isn't that expensive (no...really) compared to other bars in Dublin.  The only inconvenience, if you want to call it that, is that you must ask for an iron and ironing board.  And... you better use it while it's available because the staff will take it the next time they service your room.  Overall, it was a fantastic stay with some new friends.",5,2011,07,30
205,a wonderful experience,"Everything at this Four Seasons was enjoyable.  The food was fantastic and the staff was very helpful.  I have never been to a hotel where so many guests were enjoying themselves in the lobby bar.  Some people were having cocktails, Guinness, or a shot of Irish Whiskey and some were having tea served in the best silver teapot.  It must be the great Irish hospitality.  I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2011,07,29
205,Surprised and delighted,"I stayed here with my husband when going to a concert in the RDS as I saw it was quite close. When we got there we were amazed at just how close it was- right next door! Very handy! We were dressed for the concert when we arrived-ie jeans and t-shirts, so expected some funny looks when checking in. Suprisingly, we were given a warm welcome and made feel right at home (despite all the polished marble and chandeliers). We were extremely impressed with all member of staff we came into contact with. The ice bar was fantastic for a cocktail after the concert. Also, the swimming pool (if maybe a little smallish) and the sauna were a lovely treat the next day. I'd re one end this hotel to anyone going to the RDS or travelling by cat, but it is a little way from Dublin city. Lovely hotel. ",5,2011,07,29
205,The Best Hotel in Dublin by a mile,"Stayed here for one night in early July, and have to say this hotel comes out on top in every category! From the staff, to the rooms to the bar. a real 5 star hotel.",5,2011,07,29
205,Didn't want to leave....,"I could very easily get used to staying in this standard of hotel.  From the minute you entered the staff were attentive and helpful without crowding you.  
The rooms are spacious and bright with very comfortable beds.  Breakfast was excellent, make sure and try the scones, they are the I have ever tried!!

We had an excellent room rate (as participants at a conference in next doors RDS) but the bar and restaurant don't come cheap.  Not a complaint just a comment.",5,2011,07,28
205,Great Hotel,We stayed at this hotel for a week.This is a great hotel and the food and hotel staff were wonderful. I would have liked to have had coffee in the room and fox news on the TV other than that it was great.,5,2011,07,28
205,Excellent Hotel,"I've been at the FS for a 3 night stay last May.
This is another FS gem: top notch service, big rooms, wonderful bright furniture and everything you can expect from a FS.
As already written in other reviews the hotel is not downtown located (we knew that); it is not more than 10 minutes by train from the city center (the train stop is not more than 5 minutes walk).
I didn't rate 5/5 because I prefer buffet breakfast than the ala Carte option (but this is another thing you should expect in a FS).
On Sunday we tried the Sunday brunch: great choice of dishes, dessert buffet to die for, highly recommended!",4,2011,07,28
205,A hotel of impeccable standards throughout.,A very high level of service and attention as you would expect from this hotel group.,5,2011,07,27
205,Best hotel in Dublin - will not stay anywhere else!,"Look, it's the Four Seasons, so you expect the best.  The Four Seasons in Dublin is the Four Seasons on steroids!  It's as if there's a competition amongst the staff to see who can be the most helpful.  Immaculate, spacious rooms - impeccably clean and incredibly relaxing!  The staff treated our entire family as if we were their family.  This is hands-down the only place to stay when you visit Dublin.",5,2011,07,20
205,Amazing,"Anything and everything you could want they have.  Was there for 10 nights and had a wonderful time.  Service was amazing, food delicious, and drinks....oh so good.  Rooms were large and had everything you could think of in them.  The rooms were very quiet, which I think is priceless when traveling.   Can't wait to return.",5,2011,07,19
205,Sheer Bliss - a night of pure luxury,"Just spent a fabulous night at Four Seasons Hotel, Dublin.  Everything from check in was just perfect - comfortable rooms, beautiful pool and jacuzzi and wonderful breakfast and impeccable service.
The best hotel in Ireland!!!",5,2011,07,19
205,Fantastic from beginning to end,"Just back from a weekend in the Four Seasons which was faultless. Suite was gorgeous and staff are always so friendly. Ate both nights in Seasons. The food is always so good we have never had a bad meal in all the time we have been staying there.
Only comment is that if you are paying a lit of money for your suite the Internet should be free. Apart from that I would have no problem recommending this hotel for families and couples.
PS Hans is brilliant at meeting and greeting!!!!",5,2011,07,18
205,"Easily the best hotel I've ever stayed at, with minor hiccups","The hotel is physically very well designed, and a beautiful building.
Check-in was one of two frustrating experiences for me at this property. I was checked in to a room that had not been cleaned. I returned to reception, and they sorted this for me with their genuine apologies.
The room was large and fantastically clean. Everything seemed very well maintained. As I was in Dublin on business, I was in a rush to get online. The process of paying for internet, which was not cheap, was not working, and after several calls to reception, a member of staff came to the room to set it up himself. All in all not a great start. This put a damper on the stay for me, but everything else was simply beyond reproach.
Once I was settled in, the quality with which all the staff worked was apparent in every experience at the hotel.
Despite being out-of-town, the hotel car service was wonderful - a real benefit, and made the distance worthwhile for such a superb hotel.
The spa is the best spa I have ever had the honour of being in. The facilities are second-to-none, and I have never been so relaxed. Truly a wonderful experience.
I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone. My only negative comments were the check in experiences.",5,2011,07,12
205,"Truly a welcoming, comfortable stay","Stayed a few nights with friends and everyone from the concierge, the restaurant/bar staff and the maids cleaning the rooms made us feel welcome. The room was great, however the internet was not working consistently. They offered to come up and fix it, but I ended up linking into my friend's access which worked fine. Would definitely stay again. Second time at a Four Seasons and this one was better than the first.",5,2011,07,11

205,One of the best hotels I have stayed in!,"The hotel staff was super friendly and helpful, the room was a true delight, the bed and pillows was to die for and that bathroom..OMG..heaven!
Being a Norwegian I am used to stiff prices in hotel mini bars and hotel bars and restaurants, to my big surprised the prices at this hotel proved to be LESS in hotel bars and mini bars than a regular standard hotel has here in Norway, and the restaurant? Price range about the same as any  normal restaurant here in Norway. I never thought I'd stay in a luxury hotel and thinking food & drinks were reasonable! Loved this hotel!

Only downside, no free internet but then I guess those who uses this hotel can afford paying for wifi...",5,2011,07,06
205,Good Deal for a Four Seasons,"When we arrived in Dublin, Bon Jovi was getting ready to play at an outdoor venue next  to the Four Seasons.  Traffic was horrible.  We were tired, stressed, and hungry.   Upon entering the gates we received first rate service from everyone.

This is a an older building with old world charm and decor.  The room was large and nicely appointed.  Although, the living room furniture is quite worn and should be reupholstered.

One glitch.  The room AC was not working when we arrived.  The living room AC compensated and the next day engineering had solved the problem.

Breakfast was included in our rate.  There was a large variety of breakfast items, it was displayed beautifully, and service was impeccable.",5,2011,07,05
205,"Only 10years old,very beautiful,wonderful staff.The best hotel in Dublin.",Stayed four nights. Hotel made reservations for local restaurants in advance for us.We had breakfast in our room each day as it was included in our room charge.,5,2011,07,04
205,Best hotel I´ve ever been,"Complimentary valet parking, fast luggage service, friendly staff, even faster checkin. In total outstanding service, what has to be honored. The rooms design is more classical, but spacious and very clean. Especially I can recommend the breathtaking breakfast, try the pancakes and you´ll be happy for the rest of the day!",4,2011,07,01
205,"Always a treat to stay here, no where else compares!","My husband and I frequent this hotel on a regualr basis throughout the year, I have to say there is no other hotel that quite matches it! We have stayed at all the others at one time or another just to see if we're missing out on something but everytime I have always regretted the move and wished I had stuck with the Four Seasons. Always end up going back to the old reliable and compare every hotem we stay in around the world, to it. We travel extensively throughout the world for work and pleasure and so feel qualified to make judgement.
Did have a query about internet access but I have to say the Manager here is truly a professional and knows how to please his customers, I was utterly satisfied with him
The attention to detail and service throughout is unequalled and I truly love staying here.
I was disappointed recently as was in the area and tempted to stay over but we were not permitted access as there was a concert on next door I really was looking forward to a stay but had to go elsewhere which was such a shame. Hopefully next time we will get to stay. We had a wonderful stay during the snow last winter and I have to say there is no where I'd rather get snowed into!",5,2011,07,01

Even though it was an exceptionnally busy week end ,the Four Seasons maintained its high standards and excellence.The Four Seasons always makes you feel special-as if youve really had a treat and been indulged. Would recommend it to couples and families alike. Will certainly return.",5,2011,06,28
205,Lovely event pity about the parking charge,"I was attending the Vintners Black Tie event on Tuesday night and due to commitment the next morning I had to leave after a function to drive home. The service and food were very good as you would expect from 5 star hotel. 
On departure I asked for my parking to be validated which is normal practice in every hotel when you attend a function. However I was extremely annoyed that both the Duty Manager and security person informed me that the organisers had made no arrangements for parking. I was charged €12 for 4 hours parking. In any other premises, in my experience, car parking is validated without charge when using hotel facilities.
O have used the Four Seasons Hotel both as a resident and a casual visitor on  a number of occassions without incurring this charge. I would be reluctant to use the facility in the future.

205,A totally wonderful experience!,"We have frequently stayed at the Four Season's in Dublin and usually it has been great but this time the experience was just wonderful. Tony Coveney and his team ensured that our stay was so special. All of the staff were so friendly and welcoming and nothing was a bother to them. We stayed in a Premium Suite and it was supberb. Champagne, chocolates, chocolated strawberries, beautiful flowers all there to welcome us.
The restaurant team were just great and the chef could not have been more friendly or obliging. In our whole stay we only encountered one unfriendly waiter in the resident's lounge and we think he may just have had been having an off day or two. Everyone else could not have been more obliging or friendlier. Our dining experience could not be topped both in terms of food experience and great staff. We so admired Fiona Coyle who despite being very pregnant was a delight to be around - she was so funny and caring towards all of our dietry needs.
From the moment we were collected from the train by Patrick to the moment our concierge arranged our transport back to the train we had a ball. This is 5 star treatment at its best. Guess who will be back and will bring more friends and family?
A sincere thank you to all of the Four season's team as we do know that it is a team effort and to all of the team we never see in the background please know that you are genuinely appreciated.

205,Great Hotel,"Myself and my wife were in Dublin for a short break and to get to a rugby match. We have stayed at The Four Seasons before and it's just a great hotel. It's 5-star, you get what you pay for. The rooms are large, very very comfortable, and the overall hotel is a pleasure to stay in. The staff are generally lovely although you can come across a few snooty ones. The bar is quite expensive but there are some lovely restaurants and bars in the locality. Overall, I cannot recommend this hotel enough.",5,2011,06,19
205,Excellent ! This is what all 5* hotels should aspire to.,"Stayed here on the saturday night take that were playing Dublin, and they were also staying at the hotel. The hotel was at maximum capacity so you might think that standards could slip slightly due to the vast number residents and visitors roaming around but this couldn't be
 futher from the truth. From the moment we arrived we found each and every member of staff eager to help, from door staff, receptionists, room service to the bartender. I believe that apart from the beautiful surroundings, it's excellent staff like these that make this hotel so special.",5,2011,06,19
205,Fantastic Stay at the Four Seasons Dublin,"We had a fantastic stay at this property in early January, 2011.  From the moment we checked in, we couldn't have received better treatment.  

The room was very spacious, and the bathroom had a great soaking tub as well as a shower.  We had an end room which allowed us to look out our window and see some of the winter fest that was going on next door.

We took advantage of the fantastic indoor pool / hot tub, and had it to ourselves most of the time.

The food/drinks in the restaurant bar were pricey, but that is to be expected at a 5 star hotel.  We had the best adult hot chocolate - worth the insane cost in euros, as it was a really nice way to end the day - lounging in the bar with a delicious warm drink.

Even though this location is a bit far from the main city center, it was very easy to get back and forth.  Unfortunately, the private car was out for service the entire trip, but we were able to take either the train/tram or bus with ease.  The train/tram was much quicker, but it did stop running late at night and earlier on Sunday.

It was very easy to get to this property from the airport via the shuttle, which dropped you off pretty much right in front of the hotel.  AND the airport shuttle had free wi-fi - a very nice treat after a long international flight.

I'd highly recommend this hotel if you want to treat yourself for a lovely weekend getaway.",5,2011,06,13
205,One of the bests!,"This hotel is amazing... Everything is just perfect... The location: @ embassy area, the service fast and very friendly, the meals: breakfast, lunch and dinner were great, room service 7x24 and the whole hotel is decorated with an exquisite taste.
I enjoyed a lot staying in this hotel.",5,2011,06,12
205,Losing its sparkle,"First of all the positives on this my first stay, great location, friendly receptionist. Impressive entrance. We also got a pretty good deal on the room - 3 nights for the price of 2.Great pool.

The room itself was OK, television very big, bulky and 1990's fashion. Good sized bathroom, comfy bed. No tea or coffee facilities in the room, because they can charge you 10 Euros to deliver some. No bottled water provided if you are on this particular package.

Negatives - extortionate breakfast not in the room price (Tip - go to Ballsbridge Road - three or four good Breakfast places at a fraction of the price, or The Bewley over the road), extortionate wifi (tip - nip over the road to Paddy Cullen's its free), extortionate mini bar - like 33 Euros for a half bottle of wine (tip - Spar shop over the road miles cheaper), bar prices very expensive - the afore mentioned Paddy Cullens and Molly Moggs over the road, offer pints for around 4 Euros.

Staff not that friendly, and impossible to work out when and where you can use the house car (a free service to get you to the centre of Dublin), which they offered grudgingly.

These may all sound pretty trivial, but the lasting impression is that if you get a room package, they are doing you a favour, and paying for all the above soon takes away any saving. 

The receptionist who checked us in, Louise, is the only member of staff who treated us like we were valued customers in a five star establishment, and is a great asset to the hotel.

We won't be dashing back as a result of this, shame, could be outstanding,",3,2011,05,30

205,1ST CLASS. NO ONE CAN BE DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS HOTEL.,"Went to Dublin for the weekend for a quiet escape. This hotel is a bit expensive but well worth the money. 

We booked in the best weekend we could ever have dreamed of as the Ireland Ruby Team and New Zealand Team were here for dinner after the match.  So my husband was delighted to meet all the players.  

Rooms, food and staff First Class.  Heaven............",5,2011,05,20
205,Perfect,"The Four Seasons Dublin is the standard by which all other luxury hotels should be measured.  When I arrived by taxi for a 5-night stay, I was greeted by the doorman who introduced himself and escorted me inside to reception.  My bags were mysteriously whisked away and had appeared in my suite before I arrived there myself.  From the moment I entered the gorgeous reception area, I was greeted by name by every employee I encountered in the hotel.  I have no idea how they manage to orchestrate this, but it is very comforting and most impressive.  At check-in, the receptionist was extremely pleasant and friendly, and after I was registered, she walked me down the hall to the lift and directed me to my room.  

I had booked a junior suite, and it exceeded my greatest expectations.  It was very large, with french door windows opening out to the lovely landscaped entrance to the hotel.  The room had every modern luxury and the most comfortable king sized bed I ever slept in.  The bathroom was also large and luxurious and there was a separate walk-in dressing room.  There was a fully-stocked mini bar that included full and half bottles of wine and champagne, with every other type of snack also provided.  There wasn't a single detail omitted from the suite.  It was perfect.  

The food at the Four Seasons is incomparable, as is the service.  But what makes this hotel truly special is the level of care and consideration bestowed on guests by the management and staff.  For example, one afternoon I was in my suite writing out postcards when the housekeeper came to tidy up.  We had a short chat and I found her to be a very lovely person with an interesting background (she was from Budapest and had worked at the Four Seasons there before moving to Dublin).   After a brief but very enjoyable chat, she said that she had enjoyed meeting me and hurried along back to her duties.  The next afternoon when I returned to my suite, I found an absolutely gorgeous bouquet of pink hydrangea blooms sitting on my secretary desk with a note from her, saying how much she enjoyed talking to me.  I was simply overwhelmed.  This is just one example of what makes the Four Seasons in Dublin such a rare gem.  

Simply stated, the Four Seasons in Dublin is perfect.",5,2011,05,19
205,"Top luxury hotel in Dublin, trades location for first-class service and facilities","Stayed at this hotel on 15+ occasions over ~6 months, and in that time also tried the  Westin, Merrion, and Conrad Hilton - this is definitely one of the top luxury hotels in Dublin.

Pros:
- excellent service and attention to detail e.g. name recognition, no request too much trouble (e.g. found saline from a first aid kit at 11pm when I'd forgotten my contact lens solution!) - To be fair, Westin/Hilton also friendly, but lack special touch of the Four Seasons, matched only by Merrion who walked me to my room!
- fantastic facilities, including pool, jacuzzi, sauna, steam, (with range of toiletries in changing room) all kept in top condition - blows away Westin and Conrad, though Merrion spa/gym also very good
- modern building therefore very comfortable and spacious, with big luxurious beds/pillows, large bathrooms with L'Occitane toiletries (Bulgari in the suites which are enourmous, make the Westin suites look like a bedsit!), big bright windows - Merrion very spacious though less modern, Hilton modern and bright, virtually all Westin rooms are small and dark with average beds
- excellent food, first class breakfast although cooked (e.g. scrambled eggs) not always available at the buffet (usually only on weekends) - Westin and Hilton both have the standard buffet type breakfast including eggs, but the quality doesn't quite match the 4S

Cons:
- location - its out of town, about 30 min walk to centre, 10 min taxi for EUR7-8, whereas Westin, Hilton and Merrion are all in centre (Westin in particular has a fantastic location)

So in summary...
Four Seasons: an outstanding hotel which beats Conrad Hilton and Westin on everything except location
Westin: best location, right by Temple Bar, but for that you'll need to put up with small poky dark rooms
Merrion: luxury and location, but is accordingly slightly more expensive, and slightly less grand/spacious as Four Seasons
Conrad Hilton: modern, comfortable, spacious, but nothing special",5,2011,05,06
205,Very Comfy - still!!,"This was a return visit. I had stayed here in October 2010 on a business trip, and I was so impressed that I decided to stopover for a night here with my wife whilst we were on holiday in Ireland.
As before, the room was clean, well appointed, and the bed was very comfortable. However, I'd echo the grumbles from other posters rearding lack of tea/coffee in-room availability.
Each member of the staff was brilliant throughout, and had a clear focus on customer satisfaction. Whilst there, we were told that the Hotel would carry out a test of the fire evacuation drill. We were given the option of joining in - which we did. I'd advise others to take up the opportunity if it arises - it's an interesting experience.",5,2011,05,02
205,Another wonderful Four Seasons experience,"We stayed here three nights the week before Easter.  The hotel is like other Four Seasons' properties we have visited.  Service was impeccable, all facilities were in perfect condition, and our stay was perfect in every respect. 

My family enjoyed breakfast and dinner at the hotel as well as an afternoon in the pool and hot tub.  The food was reasonably priced, compared to other Dublin dining experiences, and was very good.  The children's menu is priced very attractively, and offers fare appealing to picky eaters.  Although the hotel's decor is formal, dress is informal in the Cafe and Lobby Lounge.

The hotel is a ten minute (or less?) taxi ride into city center.  Taxis were always available outside the front door and it was equally easy to find a taxi back to the hotel at night.  I had read about the hotel's car and driver but had forgotten about its availability until it was offered to us one evening.  Wonderful ride with an entertaining driver in the spacious comfort of a 7 series.

I feel the need to comment on some of the other reviews I have read.  Although the view from our rooms was not attractive, I didn't expect anything else as I knew I had booked the lowest room category.  The hotel's website clearly describes the view associated with each room category.  I would have had to pay more if I had wanted the garden view; I actually thought the old stables were interesting.

Someone else commented about the 18 euro/day parking fee.  My email confirmation referenced parking for 18 euro/day so I called the receptionist who confirmed that parking for one car is included in the room rate.  I do not know why the reservation confirmation quoted a charge since the hotel's website also states that complimentary parking is included.  I was not charged a parking fee during my stay.

I also noticed a post about the minibar prices.  I generally avoid minibars because of the astronomical mark-ups, but found this one reasonable.  A bottle of soda that sells for 1.69 at Spar was 4 euros in the minibar.  I think they could have gotten away with more of a mark-up.

I would agree with others that my only complaint is the 20 euro/day charge for WiFi.  My husband's phone is set up so that it can rebroadcast to my children's iPod Touches, but the resort's WiFi blocks that feature. We would have needed to purchase the WiFi at 20 euros/device, and that is just a ridiculous amount of money for something we might have used for perhaps an hour per day.  We weren't in the rooms all that often, so we didn't buy the WiFi after the initial trial.  We had just traveled from London where the hotels also charge for WiFi, so I realize that the FS is not alone in this but it is still frustrating.

The only other issue which was somewhat frustrating is that the hotel will not allow more than three people/room.  The rooms are huge and could easily have accommodated a family of four, but the hotel limits guests to three.  I knew this before I booked, and the 'third night free' promotional rate was so attractive that the two rooms at the FS didn't cost much more than one small room for four would have cost us in the center of the city.  We did enjoy the indulgence of all the space offered by two adjoining rooms, but I fear that my children may expect the same in the future.

I will close by saying how much I enjoyed the nightly turndown service.  The nightly refilled ice bucket  may have been my favorite service.  These little touches are what make a FS stay worthwhile and memorable.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2011,04,29
205,Nice price for luxury in Dublin.,"The only free facility at this hotel is the spa.  It is a nice hotel but 18 EURO per day for parking and 20 EURO per day for Wifi soon bumps up the price of your visit.
Breakfast seemed overpriced in the room service menu so I passed.  The mini bar was well stocked up on overpriced food & drink such as malteasers for 6 EURO, or a half bottle of champagne for 55 EURO.  If your into throwing money around you on stupid things you'll enjoy this hotel.  The bar downstairs is reasonably priced, 6 EURO for a pint isn't bad.  The room was spacious, the cleaners were great (cleaned twice a day) but views from the room weren't great.
Overall I would stay here again.",5,2011,04,27
205,FABULOUS - TREATED LIKE ROYALTY,"Had a great time at this hotel and in Dublin.    It is a bit out of the city center, but the bun fair was only 1.20 Euro and easy to catch the bus right outside the hotel.   We took a cab back from the city center every night and it cost us about 7 Euro.  The Hotel itself is gorgeous and the food was fabulous.   The attentiveness from the staff was extraordinary.  They didn't miss a thing.   The value of the price of the hotel was great because we booked the hotel with a package from Aer Lingus.    I don't know if we would have chosen it if we had to pay the regular nightly rates.   This hotel truly was a great place to stay during our trip.",5,2011,04,17
205,Did not measure up as a five star hotel.,"My daughter and I stayed for 4 nights in this hotel and it was a disappointment.  There were several factors involved in our disappointment.  We were given a room  overlooking the back of the hotel where there was an eyesore of old unused equipment, building supplies, etc. piled up next the stable (next to a horse race track).  After we complained they offered to move us to another room but for a five star hotel this should not have happened in the first place.   Next we paid for an afternoon tea which we confirmed a date and time prior to our arrival.  Upon arrival we received a letter with a different date/time and we complained.  We were then given a $70 Euro credit and made a reservation for the restaurant at 12:30pm.  (When you think about it we already paid for the tea so how does giving us a credit make up for the loss?) Upon arrival, the restaurant was not yet open, they did not have our reservation, but we could be served in the lobby--very unacceptable to us.  Also no one was aware of the Euro credit we were quoted.  Also, we made several attempts to use the concierge who was very friendly but lacked knowledge nor provided written materials about area events/sightseeing (I am sorry I gave him a tip).  We made a reservation for a cab pick up which was never completed and we were charged an extra $ 8 Euro because the people who were going to the airport did not show up but it was the first available cab.  However we did have a nice comfortable bed, quality daily room service, a fully stocked bar, and friendly service.  I would recommend this hotel with reservation--we did not receive five star service.  As far as it's location for a conference it is great but we were not close to any of the sites we wanted to visit.  (We did know that it was not centrally located.)",4,2011,04,16
205,Great value and service,Incredible attention to details. Impressive number of staff who remembered our names. Service always impeccable.  Hotel in excellent condition.  Had one room with two young kids and it was spacious. It also had all the ameneties for young kids (eg cot diapers etc),5,2011,04,06
205,Drop the extortionate Wifi and tea & coffee charges and this will be best,"I stayed in the Four Seasons in Dublin for three nights.

Firstly, make sure you check the location on a map of Dublin beforehand and are happy with it. The hotel is outside of the City Centre. It's in Dublin 4 (D4), which is a beautiful area and it's about a 10 minute cab ride to the centre. As a result the building is huge and the rooms are large and clean.

The staff were wonderful throughout and there is nothing I could fault them on.

The spa is nice and relaxing, although I prefer the option of mixed sex sauna and steam rooms rather than have my partner sit in one empty room and me in another empty room.

Shoe cleaning overnight is complimentary and a nice touch.

My experience was mostly positive, but as with most reviews I feel it is always good to concentrate on the negatives as improving these are what makes our stay even better.

Although I stayed in a suite and the bathroom was large, it had just a single sink. Two would be much more convenient for two guests as most of the time two people stay together at a hotel they are getting ready to go out at the same time.

The Wifi in this hotel costs in excess of EUR 20 per day. And if that is not excessive enough, each purchase entitles you to access on one machine i.e. Laptop or Phone. So if you are coming from abroad and want Wifi access to both of these it will cost you close to EUR 50 per day. This is insane, especially in a country in the midst of a major recession and especially given most of us can wander down our local coffee shop and get free Wifi. Even most budget hotels offer it.

Tea & coffee. This problem is not exclusive to the Four Seasons, in fact many five star hotels suffer from the same problem. I like to drink a lot of tea and I like to drink a lot of coffee. There are no tea & coffee making facilities in the room. I realise an argument can be made that in a luxury hotel like this the point is that you don't do these things yourself and can have it done for you by picking up the phone, but come on, it's not a difficult thing for any of us to do ourselves or at least have the option of doing it. Even if I was a billionaire I would find it difficult to justify paying EUR 10 per cup of tea/coffee and another EUR 5 to have it brought to the room each time. In fact, I'd go as far as saying that I'd rather pay more in the room rate and having free Wifi and tea & coffee built into the price I paid because as least then I am not aware of the ridiculous amount I am being charged for these things.

Finally, although the TVs are in perfect working order (but the picture quality is not particularly crisp), they are the old style TVs with the big backs on them. I would much rather see a luxury hotel is making more of an effort to upgrade TVs to take them into line with the modern world and what is offered at hotels which are a fraction of the price.

Overall I would recommend this hotel if you don't need to be in the City Centre. It's staff are its biggest asset and although I have gone into detail above, these are the only things I felt could do with some review.",4,2011,04,06
205,Refreshing!,"This Hotel is expensive but if you want to treat yourself do so here.  The Four Seasons could not do enough for us and are super friendly and chatty - which is a bonus!  
Rooms are lovely and refreshing when you have been travelling as we have in the last 4 months hotel to hotel.  Food could be seen to with some flavours but the service is great - not robotic with sour faces of distaste because you are in their restaurant as other hotels have done because we do not fit their image. 
The beds are fantastic and I could almost say they come very very close to Sofitel beds and they are scrummy! Bathroom had Bvlgari products that were very good, especially the shampoo and conditioner.
The decor is comfortable and charming with some great antique pieces and art work.  Great Whiskey selection in the bar as well as the staff serving them. The grounds will be lovely in the Spring and can see lots of weddings being held there.
All in all lovely place.",5,2011,03,16
205,Great for a nice family WE... But value for money ratio could be better,"Great for a nice family WE.... Kids loved swimming pool and room service..... Wife loved spa...and the quality of sleep is great ( very quiet place despite being in central Dublin)

However wifi is very expensive..... I really can not believe that the hotel charges for Internet access (welcome to 21 century!)",4,2011,02,20
205,keep going back for more.....,"our second time at this hotel for afternoon tea and we weren't dissappointed we didn't think it could get any better since the last time we were there however they have switched things up a bit and it was amazing. The selection of sandwiches were just gorgeous so good in fact that we had to ask for a second serving of the ham and cheese with bechamel sauce, so so good. The selection of pastries were delicious so were the home made scones. Everything was presented perfectly, the service was brilliant, cant fault a thing. Loved it all and will definitely be back. Will highly recommend to everyone who will listen.",5,2011,02,16
205,Absolutely fabulous!,Probably the nicest stay i have ever had - anywhere. I could not fault one thing. Staff were fantastic - we were treated like royalty. Breakfast was amazing. Rooms were stunning. Hoping to get another chance at some stage to stay here. Thanks for a wonderful stay xx,5,2011,02,03
205,perfect service,"Four seasons was really what we were looking for. The service was great. The SPA facilities were very relaxing. One day we did not leave the hotel at all... I booked the room through WhataHotel  and got free breakfast and lunch and upgrade offer.
Our room unfortunately had a minor cleaning problem. After I reported this to the manager, he upgraded our room to a very nice suite. I recommend dining in the room. It was very different experience to dine in the room. Breakfast, lunch and dinner were great. Please note that food proportions are so big. At lunch I was full already with starter. Service and people were excellent. Please note that hotel is not in the city center. They say they offer free service to and from city center however, when I called for that service they told me it is not available on Sunday and Monday. To sum up, I highly recommend this hotel for leisure travellers.",5,2011,02,01
205,TOP QUALITY HOTEL IN DUBLIN,"Last weekend we had the pleasure of staying at this wonderful hotel. We had the use of a executive suite with wonderful views across the city and towards the harbour. The room was spacious, well furnished and had a bright living room, big bedroom with large comfortable bed and en-suite with all facilities. The restaurant was excellent, very attentive staff and wonderful food - they obviously have a top class chef. Within the hotel is a lounge with big comfy furniture and where afternoon tea is served. There is a lounge bar and also the ever popular ICE bar. The staff throughout the hotel were friendly, happy, charming and always there to help. We had a delightful stay and will definitely stay here again next time we are in Dublin.",5,2011,01,29
205,Wonderful classy hotel.,"Of course Four Seasons is never cheap but the quality of the stay at Four Seasons should never be coampared with any hotel either. My Colleagues and I had a very nice stay here and the concierge service is fantastic because for a change in this hotel they know everything and if they don´t they take a few moments and get back to you with the correct information. The food and service at the restaurant are just fantastic. 
Whwn you are on business, it makes a world of difference when your business partners know that you stay in such hotel and that is a reality. Even the taxi drivers treat you differently when you ask them to drive you to Four Seasons.",5,2011,01,20
205,Fantastic Hotel with Great Service,"My wife and I recently traveled to Dublin for a long weekend and stayed at he Four Seasons Hotel.  Our flight arrived at 5:20 AM and we actually arrived at the Hotel around 6:00AM.  To our delight our room was available and check in was quick and easy.  The quality of the room was outstanding with a king sized bed, ample workspace, and a very large bath with a soaking tub and separate toilet.   The room was immaculate, bright and when available sunny.  While at the hotel we used room service several times and the quality of the food was fantastic as was the service which was prompt and efficient.  

The hotel is a little ways away from the down city part of Dublin but it was easily walkable if you decided to get some exercise (about 50 minutes) or a 10 to 15 minute cab ride.

We had a very enjoyable experience at the hotel and when in Dublin will stay there again.",5,2011,01,20
205,"Exceptional place to rest, to do business and to enjoy life.","I have had an outstanding experience with the hotel. I bought a Russian TV crew to film about my company, our services and about Ireland. Four Seasons helped immensely in making this trip a success.",5,2011,01,19
205,An exceptional hotel,"I guess it""s the old story, you get what you pay for! Wonderful hotel and perfect for us ,we were attending the Royal Dublin Horse show and the FSH coulden't be closer to the event. The staff coulden't be more accomadating,the food and service excellent.",5,2011,01,12
205,SPECTACULAR,"From start to finish, the service here was outstanding.
The hotel staff made us all feel so welcome, with very personal and generous service. The hotel is very homely, with great care a detail put into all aspects of our stay. I cannot say one bad word about this hotel. Simply perfect. I will be recommending it to anyone who visits Dublin, and wouldn't stay anywhere else in Dublin.",5,2011,01,08
205,What a refuge!,"While experiencing burst pipes no heat & no water it was the perfect time to experience the hotel around the corner as a well deserved treat during the clean up!!!
The four seasons Dublin was the perfect escape from the musty smells for a couple of nights at least.
Children got great welcome at the spa pool , I got a great massage from very kind annmarie, super room service choice of 100 DVDs free for the kids, fab breakfast & when staff heard our story went out of their way to cheer us up & had a great sense of humour ....& we still managed to go to & fro to sort hassles of the house in comfort!!!
A piece of heaven!!",5,2011,01,04
205,perfect place,this is one of the most pleasant places i experienced. been in this hotel for few times now and i must say it always been an incredible high quality experience,5,2011,01,04
205,Great stay in a wonderful hotel,Stayed here in march and had a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Breakfast in the morning was to die for! ,4,2011,01,01
205,Great hotel but it's the little details that they need to work on,"Four Seasons is a great hotel.  We stayed here to celebrate my parents wedding anniversary and everyone thoroughly enjoyed themselves.  Given the fact that it was the week when snow was falling heavily and the airports were closed a lot, we weren't sure if my brother & his family would be able to make it over from London.  The hotel reservation staff were very friendly and helpful and extended our cancellation period, finally in the end saying that if they couldn't make it over and we had to cancel everything last minute (we weren't even sure if we'd make it up ourselves from Wicklow!) they wouldn't charge us anything.  Luckily we all made it.
Staff are very helpful & friendly and nothing is too much trouble.  They are very child friendly in the hotel, providing little ones with colouring books and crayons at meal times, going out of their way to give them little treats (chocolates & cakes) and no objections to bringing them in to the restaurant at any time. 
Although they do not provide tea/coffee facilities in the room (which I think is weird given that 3* hotels here do) if you request it they will provide them.  Something to bear in mind given that a cup of tea is over €6 which I think is a bit exorbitant! 
The advertised complimentary transfers to city centre are available but it's only a sedan so only holds 4 people which was no use to us with 6 adults & 2 children in total and it doesn't start running until noon.
Rooms are a decent size and we had booked our parents into a junior suite which was very spacious, with a separate walk-in wardrobe!!  Bathrooms were however the same size as our rooms, which I was told were deluxe although we'd only booked superior so not sure.  Toiletries provided are L'Occitane with plenty of towels available.  Air conditioning is controlled from within the room.  Strangely enough we didn't have a flat screen tv in our room, but the junior suite did.
The restaurant food is lovely and the menu quite comprehensive.  Food portions are a decent size with some very generous - beware if you order the balinese mussels starter - it's enough for 2 people! The night of our arrival we opted to dine in The Cafe but they had no room for our party size so seated us in the main restaurant but with The Cafe menu which we thought was good - some places I'm sure would probably try and push the restaurant menu on you just because you were seated there.
A few negatives - on checking in, they give you a form to fill out and one of the questions is which complimentary newspaper would you like.  For both myself & my parents I requested Irish Independent, but it never got delivered and although my father got it when he requested it at reception, they charged for it.  Why bother asking if you're not going to give the paper of your choice??  On one of the days for the turndown service we got 2 little bottles of still water, but on the other days we didn't, so not very consistent with things.  Maybe it was a freebie thrown in and I didn't know!  A couple of misunderstandings as well due to non-nationals not fully understanding what was being requested eg, we got a shaving kit although we asked for a sewing kit and when we asked for a hot water bottle we got hot water in a glass, but eventually we did end up with what we wanted even if it did take 3 attempts!
Overall we enjoyed our stay and hopefully we'll be able to return!",4,2010,12,12
205,As always a beautiful experience,"Perfect no negatives whatsoever, as always the four seasons delivers. A welcome break after a particularly horrific experience in an awful hotel in Italy.",5,2010,11,21
205,"Excellent stay, wonderful Spa","We had a wonderful experience at the Four Seasons - no complaints.  Others have described the accommodations and spa adequately, so let me give a few words about getting downtown.  Although the hotel offers the services of a car to take you downtown, we found it very difficult to get it.  Either someone was already using it, or it wasn't there when we needed it.  However - the bus stop is right outside the hotel, and for E1.60 you can get a ride into downtown in about 10 minutes or so.  It is very easy and no hassle at all.  You just have to make sure you're on the correct side of the street, as there are 2 bus stops across from each other to handle both directions.  Also, if you're coming from the airport, AirCoach is a cheap way to get to the Four Seasons, and they have a stop right in front of the hotel every 15 minutes.",5,2010,11,18
205,Luxury,"As you would expect it's excellent,relaxed service and lovely rooms.It's a bit of a trek to the city centre but there is a courtesy car.Close to the RDS for concerts.It can be eye wateringly expensive but recent economic woes in Ireland seem to have reduced prices to something approaching realistic.If you want a real treat,give it a try.",5,2010,11,17
205,Exceeded Expectations,"We had always wanted to stay here. We had tickets for a concert nearby so it was the perfect excuse to stay.   We only stayed for one night.  Check in was fine, no complaints.  Our room was lovely,  very spacious with twin beds, very comfortable. Bathroom was huge with separate bath tub and shower, robes and slippers and lovely L’Occitane toiletries.  
The food in the restaurant was lovely. We arrived back to the restaurant after the concert and the restaurant was getting ready to close but they accommodated us without a problem. The food was cooked fresh to order and delicious.  We had a few drinks in the residents bar afterwards and  
Breakfast, which was included on our rate was a buffet with juices, cereals, fruit, croissants, bacon, eggs and omelette station – all totally delicious of course.  
Cannot fault this hotel in any way.  We have stayed in five star hotels before and they always seem to fall short but the Four Seasons certainly lived up and exceeded all our expectations.  Would definitely stay here again.",5,2010,11,15
205,Still the top of list in Dublin,"Stayed here again after a long gap - Still a top class hotel that is well managed with superb staff - Check in quick and efficient - Staff friendly and good natured without being overwhelming 

As per a recent comment i would agree the rooms are a little tired, especially things like the CRT TV rather than a flatscreen - bathroom was fine, a good size but the shower was a little weak (i mentioned this and it was improved within the hour) - not much in the way of 'freebie's like toothpaste etc - and the wifi is a riduculous EUR22 for 24 hours (though you can use the business centre for free). 

the Hotel itself is pleasant, with the lobby area nice for a coffee - And it is the best hotel breakfast i have had anywhere - a good selection of favourites, some healthier than others - all served by friendly, efficient staff

overall its still an execellent hotel, and looking forward to my next trip",5,2010,11,15
205,Perfect stay,"Four nights at the Four Seasons Dublin. Staff is on top of everything , well done!
Rooms are clean and spacious . Ask for a room on floor four with a view of the city. Bar area has nice views and is a great starting point before a night out on the town.
Top quality hotel and everything you expect from a Four Seasons , nothing less .Thanks for a grat stay.",5,2010,11,13
205,Dissapointed Bedrooms in need of a facelift,"Stayed with my husband for 3 nights in September.  It has been about 5 years since my last stay, i was very dissapointed, on entering the reception area still looks well, the hotel is very clean.  I was very dissapointed with the bedrooms they are very dated and very floral and still dont have flat screen televisons.  Batrooms was very spacious.  A turndown service was available but i was dissponted  that it did not include a chocolate on the pillow.  I had 2 treatemetns in the Spa, the therapist was very good and very friendly but i couldnt belive the relaxation room consisted of 4 cane arm chairs with can footstools.  There was a can shutter blocking it off from the changing room.  I would have expected a far superior relaxation room, this is the worst one i have been in.  I only statyed there for a few minutes as it was not  a relaxing area.  I just dont feel it warrants 5 star anly longer",3,2010,11,11
205,The best hotel in Dublin,"Exceeded our expectations. Compared with other 5* hotels this is 6*. Service/staff top notch. Ambience/food ? actually no need to leave the hotel at all. Spa first class, luxurious and very peaceful. Away from city centre but in our opinion a bonus. Courtesy car service superb . We turned up at the Guiness Storehouse in a BMW limousine ! DART station 200 yards away. We visited most of the recommended pubs but I think the Guinness here was the best. We will return !",5,2010,11,10
205,"Poor location, too expensive for what you get","I stayed here only because it's where the company goes for business.  However, it's a hike to the main city areas (25min fast pace, 45min meandering), or you can take a 12-15euro taxi ride.  Pretty much need to do this because there's nothing interesting in the immediate area.

The hotel is very clean and staff is friendly, but it's so expensive and they charge additional for everything (22euro/day for internet).  I thought there was free coffee and wifi in the lounge so I could just relax and get my email in the morning - nope.  I paid 7euro for a coffee and got  no wifi.  The staff I asked failed to mention I could use the business center for free and get online with their computers (can't use your own, though).

The hotel is also very generic inside - you could be anywhere in the world.  I didn't feel like I was in Dublin.  BORING!  So if you want to experience Dublin - music, pubs, Irish food and atmosphere, St Stephens and other sites - stay in the city center.  You can surely find a good place for the same price you'd pay to stay here.",2,2010,11,08
205,excellent hotel,"our first time to stay here but not our last. expensive ....yes
but worth it !!
excellent service, rooms large and very clean.breakfast again excellent .for me the best hotel in dublin by far !!",5,2010,11,07
205,"A great hotel, but at a price","I visited Dublin with my two children. The four seasons was clearly the right choice.
The suite was big and well -decorated, and the service was spot on. Not once did they say no to my requests.

The room service was excellent, despite the wait being a bit long (50 mins) on Saturday & Sunday.
The in-room massage was simply fantastic and left me relaxed and calm.
The swimming pool was a big hit with the kids, despite the steps being wobbly.
Going to the city centre was easy and cheaper than expected (around €10) and you can see taxis everywhere in Dublin.
Being back home, I miss being able to request anything at the touch of a button!",4,2010,11,01
205,Another fantastic stay,"Excellent service, gorgeous food, excellent ambience.  Another fantastic stay in the Four Seasons, Dublin.  It never fails to meet your expectations!",5,2010,11,01
205,Very enjoyable overnight stay,"Recently spent Saturday overnight in Four Seasons and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We arrived at 11.30 am and were able to check into our room straight away. We had booked with Whatahotel and they had promised us some perks including an upgrade to a higher standard room and we were given this. Our room was large and contained everything you would expect in a 5star hotel. Another perk given by whatahotel was a voucher for a complimentary lunch which again was excellent and a really unexpected bonus. food was of a very high standard at both breakfast and lunch, staff were friendly, helpful and efficient. Facilities in the spa were also excellent. We would have no hesitation in staying here again and would recommend booking with whatahotel for the considerable perks they give.",5,2010,10,24
205,Six Stars,"Having just stayed at two other luxury hotel chains on this business trip that paled in comparison, I must give Four Seasons Dublin six stars.  They are in a league unto themselves.  My nonsmoking room smelled vaguely of smoke... they upgraded me to an enormous Executive Suite complete with sofa, arm chair, business table, two TVs, marble bath, you name it.  Even before the upgrade, which happened on night two, I was vastly impressed... from the smallest detail such as ice already chilling in my room; my breakfast hot chocolate including a delicious side dish of fresh whipped cream; the man from reception coming round the desk to hand me my room key in person... no stone has been left unturned.  I have written dozens of hotel reviews in my head, but have never taken the time to actually put them on Trip Advisor or elsewhere-- was inspired to do so today.  Four Seasons Dublin= a class act.",5,2010,10,21
205,Wonderfully friendly and helpful staff but not a Spa destination.,"Staff very friendly and courteous for check in.  My sister and I here for a leisurely weekend for 2 nights.  Despite requesting a non smoking room, we were first showed to a room which on opening the door immediately smelled of smoke. the room was on the 1st floor and whilst roomy and well equipped, was dark, gloomy and looked out on to a roof.  We were then moved to a beautiful room which was bright and airy and had a much better outlook.  
Breakfasts superb on first morning but a bit haphazard the next morning.  Wonderful selection of fresh fruit, croissants, full irish breakfast, cooked to order (absolutely huge portions) as well as pastries, croissants, fresh yoghurt, honeycomb and an omelette station.

Dinner on first night very good apart from the family who were having a rather heated argument which the other diners could all hear.  

The Spa.  Without doubt the worst spa I have ever been to.  the reception area and corridor to changing rooms carpeted.  The pool is to the left of the reception area with only 4 loungers.  A few tables and chairs scattered around with no lighting above them made up the remainder of the seating arrangement.  The steps into the pool were loose at both ends.  From the pool area you go out of the pool area past the reception into the changing area (carpeted) where the relaxing room is situated right in front of where guests dry there hair and are changing.... this surely cannot be classed as a relaxing area!  From here into a wet area is the sauna and steam room.  Most spas have the sauna and steam room around the pool area so if you wanted to use these, you would then have to dry yourself off and go back past reception to get to the pool.  The whole spa area is in dire need of a major refurbishment and a better design.  We only stayed half an hour as we couldn't even get a lounger to sit on.  Who wants to sit around a table and hard chair in a swimming costume to read a magazine and relax.

Expect to pay Euro 25 a day to and from main shopping area in Dublin.  There is a complimentary car but on both occasions we tried to avail ourselves of it we were advised it was running either 2 hours later or had left an hour earlier. 

All in all, would not recommend the hotel as a weekend destination for 2 reasons, the appalling Spa and the distance from the centre of town,.

All in all not the calibre of hotel we were expecting from a  Four Seasons.",3,2010,10,18
205,Nice hotel,"Hi I have stayed in this hotel quiet a few times. It is a lovely hotel. The conceirge are very friendly as are most of the staff. There is one girl who works on reception and one guy on night duty bar who are most unfriendly, which is very dissapointing. You pay a lot of money to stay here so it would be nice if more training was done with these members of staff. Overall I do enjoy staying here.",5,2010,10,18
205,Very Comfy!,"Stayed here in mid-October on business trip. Huge room, very clean, nicely lit, quiet, and well appointed. A minor quibble: one thing missing was in-room tea/coffee facilities - would have preferred that to the bar & snacks that was available.
Staff were polite, helpful, and attentive throughout - I rang down to housekeeeping for an iron, and it was delivered inside 5 minutes.
Good range of breakfast options, and all tasty.  
Would recommend to anyone.",5,2010,10,15
205,A good value in Dublin,"We stayed one night en route to Europe and it was perfect. We had a junior suite with a very nice bathroom. We didn't use any of the dining rooms or other facilities, but they certainly looked very nice. 
We have always considered Four Seasons hotels better than Ritz Carltons, but the Dublin Four Seasons is more on par with a typical U.S. Ritz Carlton. While it is very very nice, it just didn't have that extra edge to it that most Four Seasons have. 
City center Dublin is a 10 minute cab ride from the hotel. Ballsbridge is a nice area with many good restaurants.",4,2010,09,27
205,overrated,"i thought this hotel was completely overrated,nice and comfy but no different to any other 4 star hotel in ireland
exorbitant prices for everything , 6 euro for a pack of maltesers in the room and 33 euro for a half bottle of wine
rip off ireland still alive and well here",3,2010,09,27
205,Great Hotel,"Just back from an over night stay in Dublin at the Four Seasons Ballsbridge. Both my wife and I have stayed in a number of other five star hotels here in Ireland and in the U.S and we both agree that our stay was one of the best we have enjoyed at a five star. Staff were fantastic and genuinely helpful ( one of my pet hates is being hit with ""helpful"" staff at five star hotels who want to loosen your wallet the minute you check in.) Four Seasons staff did not crowd us out but made sure we checked in quickly and started to relax from there on in.

Suites are very comfortable and while very well appointed the look is a bit dated. Went out for dinner and had drink afterwards at the bar - again lovely atmosphere with excellent staff.

Breakfast was exceptional and again service was great. Well worth visting.",5,2010,09,21
205,Dublin in Comfort,"I checked in with no delay and even had to change room type. Wonderful staff, took very good care of me while I was there. Food was good, the bed felt like a cloud. I did not have any problems with any of my meals. I was always greeted when I returned for the night by name and with a smile. I was made to feel very welcome. I have stayed in nice hotels before but this one is top on my list so far.",5,2010,09,19
205,Very disappointed.........,Very welcome reception on check in. Room was booked 2 weeks ago and had specified that we would be checking in at 2:15pm. Arrived at the hotel at 3pm and had to wait 45 minutes for our room to be cleaned. Received a complimentary drink for the delay. Booked dinner that evening in the hotel cafe restaurant. On arriving in the restaurant it seemed like no table had been reserved and were brought to a large table which had four settings on it. Sat down at 7.45pm. Really enjoyed our starters and couldnt wait for mains to arrive. 5 star hotel so understandably there is normally a few minutes between courses. But for some reason it was 15-20 minutes before our mains arrived. Immediately I knew there was something wrong with my dish. My partner tasted it and agreed. Either the dish was cooked in a burnt pan or it had been overcooked. The smell of burnt food was disgusting. I was immediately turned off my food. I called the waiter over and informed him of the problem. I was offered another choice but my partner was enjoying her meal and I didnt want to delay the meal any further. Had a lovely souffle for desert. Asked for the bill at 9:50pm and after getting the wrong bill then getting a bill with extra items on it we finally left the restaurant at 10:25pm. Restaurant was far from full at this stage. Large number of staff but very little work being done. I was fuming but didnt want to upset my parntner by blowing a fuse and causing a scene. Went to the Ice Bar for a drink. I ordered a lager which was tastless and was all foggy. AKA DIRTY BEER LINES!!!!!! I went to bed and all I could look forward to was my breakfast. Thankfully it was very nice. Having stayed in many 5 star and even 7 star hotels around the world I would have to say that The Four Seasons is a very poor 5 star. I would not recommend it to friends or family.,2,2010,09,18
205,You feel your welcome at four seasons,"have stayed in Four Seasons in Puerto Rico so thought to treat my family during trip to Ireland. Four Seasons hotels are without out a doubt very beautiful yet comfortable hotels. The staff are very friendly and helpful, even random staff you meet in the corridors/driving, etc. Treated our little daughter of 2 very well with a biscuit present. She stay in her bed which was great. We relax by the pool for the entire day. Wife enjoyed her spa treatment. Very very enjoyable stay",5,2010,09,04
205,Unbeatable,"I loved this hotel and would go back in a heartbeat. I walked in of the street and as they quoted me such a good rate for B&B and parking I couldnt refuse.
Azzaya at the front desk was so pleasant 
 The room was perfect and we had alovely view towards the port. As we had our teenage daughter with us they left a soft drink and popcorn.
 We walked down to see the pool, I mentioned we had no swimmimg suits with us,and it wasnt long before they kitted us out with togs and towels.
It was a gorgeous evening and we had a drink outside in the lovely garden
Unfortunately the Ice Bar wasnt open but we had a lovely Mojito in the bar
Check out wasnt until 12.00 which also suited us
Its only a short walk to the Dart where we took one of the nicest train rides in Europe. It hugs the coast most of the way to Greystones through Blackrock and Dalkey. As the weather was sunny it was a lovely trip",5,2010,08,31
205,Amazing,"Offered an upgrade at reception , beautiful corner suite, food and service amazing in the bar and restaurant.  The best hotel in Dublin. The best room service breakfast ever!",5,2010,08,29
205,"Fabulous experience with lots of little extras and very efficient, friendly staff with extremely reasonable rates.","Our overall experience at the Four Seasons Hotel Ballsbridge was fabulous. The staff are very helpful without being too overbearing.  The Spa experience in particular was wonderful - with lots of little extras including fruit, drinks and luxurious toiletries, bathrobes etc. with even combs and razors and whatever one needed in that line.",5,2010,08,18
205,A nice hotel in the 'burbs,"Had a nice stay at the Four Seasons Hotel in the Ballsbridge neighborhood of Dublin.  The hotel itself was great and the room (a Deluxe) was very spacious.  Typical four seasons service made the stay even nicer -- fantastic service, complimentary shoe shine, and well equipped gym/spa.  My room came with complimentary breakfast which was pretty standard but the only full meal I had in the bar was fantastic -- much better than normal bar fair.  

The only drawbacks to the hotel are the location, which is pretty removed from central Dublin.  Cab far to Grafton street ran about 10 Euro.  I'm also still amazed that top-end hotels continue to charge outrageous rates for wireless internet.  The Four Seasons rate of 22 Euro for 24 hours is an antiquated and outrageous fee.  It's 2010, free internet should be standard.

All in all though, a great hotel.",4,2010,08,14
205,A Romantic Getaway,"My girlfriend and I had a wonderful stay in the hotel. It was a night away as part of a Romantic Getaway package for her birthday. We were greeted by a  genuine welcome at check-in and treated like stars. We were upgraded to a deluxe room and it was magnificent. Spotlessly clean with a large, sparkling bathroom and a number of comfortable chairs and a large mahogany table added to the splendour  of the experience. As part of the package, when we arrived, there was a lovely rose laying on the kingsize bed with petals placed in a heart shape. Also awaiting us was a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries!
The food in the restaurant was of a very high standard and the service was impeccable. The next morning we ordered room-service breakfast and we were treated to the best Full Irish breakfast I ever tasted. The only negative of the stay occured here as we discovered some mould on the brown bread. We rang room service and they apologied profusely and seemed mortified claiming this had never happened before. They delievered a lovely bottle of wine to our room as a token of apology. 
This didnt take away from the experience and we were stayed until 4pm as the package included a late check-out. All in all, it was the most fantastic hotel I ever had the pleasure of staying in. Thumbs up!",5,2010,07,21
205,"Elegant, comfortable and grand 5-star hotel in a pleasant part of Dublin!",Stayed here for 4 nights in June 2010. It was an unforgettable experience! Elegant 5-star hotel with wonderful staff. Room was very comfortable and spacious; the bed was super-plush! Room service was quite good and the service was prompt. A little far out from the city center and the tourist attractions there but is located in a pretty neighborhood.,5,2010,07,19
205,Consistantly Excellent,"The Four Seasons is consistent in its delivery of excellence. I have been fortunate enough to have stayed here many times since it first opened - but of course, when things are excellent - one tends not to review  - so here goes! -  Its rooms are really nice, particularly the bigger rooms (cost more of course).  The food in the main seasons restaurant - I think is the best in Dublin and the last time that I stayed - the breakfast had improved immensely from the previous time - with greater selections offered and it was served in the main seasons restaurant again (the previous time I stayed during a quieter period - it was served in the tea room in front).
This is a good time to get a great rate and to try this hotel.  Try to get the breakfast included in the booking price as it is way to expensive to pay for it separately!! (there are good offers to be had)
The hotel is in a nice area - with nice walks to the sea - if you have the time to find them out.
It is a good walk to the centre - thought.
For me, this hotel is the best in Dublin! I have stayed with my two children and the attention given to children is fantastic!  They have received tee-shirts - toys at Christmas - cookies with their names on them! - really nice touches.  (Stay at Christmas time - for a really festive atmosphere - ginger bread towns etc...)
Go on - give yourself a treat!! It is worth it!!",5,2010,07,17
205,Lost its shine,"This is my second stay at the four seasons Dublin and what a change from my first stay a few years ago! Gone was the automatic valet parking, the reception staff seemed confused and tried to convince me i was receiving an upgrade when in fact i had booked the larger room and although the room was large it was uninspiring and looked dated, also there was no free wifi something you would expect when paying hundreds of Euros for a room, the bed was uncomfortable and seemed to me it needed a new mattress. We had dinner in the restaurant on two nights and i must report we found the staff very friendly and helpful but the food let it down, great hotels have great restaurants unfortunitly this is no longer a great hotel.",3,2010,07,13
205,"Fabulous,very child friendly.","We arrived here for a 2 night stay to celebrate my five year old daughters birthday,it's only a few minutes walk from the DART station or bus stop.
First impressions it was luxurious from top to bottom,on walking up the walkway the courteous and very pleasant bellhop met us and relieved us of our lugguage.
.
Check-in was great the receptionist was friendly,she gave my little girl a kids check in form and had a little step up for my daughter to reach the desk pointed out resturant and explained everything.The bellhop got us ice & couldn't have been more helpful
.
My daughter got a surprise when she discovered a big cookie and sweets with her name on it wishing her a happy birthday!The room itself was wonderful plenty of space bed and pillows wwere the most comfortable I've ever experienced in a hotel,the bathroom was a dream,bathrobes/towels soft including a kiddie sized one,there was l'occitane toileteries for us and jungle care toileteries specifically for children.Shower was wonderful and buth tub was lovely and deep.

The tea room where we had afternoon tea have wonderful staff who gave great advice regarding the menu,served our order promptly didn't rush us & the ambience was beautiful and comfortable.

Room service at night was quick, food hot and tasty.Option to have breakfast via room service also,newspaper left outside.Breakfast was great the first morning with separate menu for kids and kid friendly cartooned plate/cup service was good other than having to request butter to be brought to table which was rock hard but food was delicious, on the second morning however even though it was quiet we were left waiting to be seated for ten minutes while the manager was talking on the phone then once our coffee order was taken we were left with the menu only nobody came to take our order despite waiting for ages ,eventually we just went to the buffet which was disappointing.

The swimming pool was nice,changing room was fab with everything you could really hope for the staff member on duty gave my daughter a kids float the first day although on the second he was quite brusque informing us we could only stay a half hour, I was quite aware going down that kids were only allowed up to 8pm which should have gave us an hour,no offer of a float this time,opps!! 

Smoking area is in the front of hotel complete with tvs and cushioned seating.

You can access your bill through your tv so thatt's handy,you have to watch out for the extras because they really do add up quite easily.

Concierge very friendly had a folder with lots of kids dvds on lend which we used both nights.

Courtesy car into town which we requested doesn't operate until afternoon I think it's 1pm so we made do with taxi.

Security great,access to lifts by keycard only.

Checkout was quick.
 
All in all a very pleasant stay the majority of the staff are friendly and helpful. :)",5,2010,07,09
205,A special & relaxing treat for adults & toddler !,"This hotel is located in an affluent & peaceful area about a 20 min (pleasant) walk from the city centre. 
You are special the moment you arrive at the door of the Four Seasons!
We have stayed many times & the service is fantastic. Lobby/Bar area is fantastic for all day food. Ample portions, so tasty & a really watch the world go by atmosphere. Outside & indoor seating. Breakfast buffet is ample too (better if you have a B&B rate) as it's pricey. Dining room is beautiful. We usually do one night room service becuase it is simply great food & served so nicely to your room.

Rooms are spacious, v. comfortable & peaceful. Turn down service is the best with everything replenished. Bathroom amenities are L'occitane,gorgeous! 

We have stayed with our toddler most recently & also when she was a few months old. Each time baby cot /crib provided as well as some baby amenities. Children's menus are also provided at all meal times. Staff are extremely welcoming & friendly to children. I would highly recommend this hotel because if children are happy parents can relax & be happy!

We also stayed here to attend a concert at the RDS. This is a brilliant idea combining the concert with the luxury hotel next door  (esp in Ireland when it might rain). It's a nice idea to dress up after the concert & go to the ICE bar for a few drinks. ICE bar is stylish so it's nice to make the effort. Staff there are super friendly, not the 'too cool' type staff you get in some establishments.",5,2010,07,07
205,Spacious elegant accomodation,"From the moment we arrived we felt the Four Seasons touch: attentive and very professional service from the staff. The hotel is beautifully decorated, with numerous well-chosen pieces of art. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a couple of Junior Suites: these were substantially larger than the website suggests: I reckon about 120 sq m each including bathrooms, foyer, walk-in wardrobe, alcoves etc. Huge comfortable beds.

The spa only has a narrow pool but it was generally quiet and so was uncrowded. It has its own secret sunken garden. The saunas and steam rooms are separate in the male and female change areas. Restful music gets one in the mood.

The excellent breakfast consisted of a cold buffet and a served hot breakfast on weekdays but was ""enhanced"" by a hot buffet at weekends, although a served breakfast was still an option. 

We ate once in Seasons Restaurant at lunchtime and once in Seasons Cafe in the evening: expensive even for Dublin, but really good ingredients very well cooked and presented, so we felt it was worth it.

The location is somewhat out of the centre. Options for getting in to Dublin include the free chauffeur-driven limo (just ask at the door, if he is there he will take you, no reservations), a taxi from the rank just outside (€10), or three stops along on the DART train - a short walk away.

€22 per day for Wifi (ouch), but there are three computers with free wired internet in the business centre.",5,2010,07,06
205,"Excellent Stay no Issues to Report""","Stayed on a 1 night business trip, eat in the lobby bar, excellent food & service. My bedroom was what you would expect, clean, quite and well laid out. My room rate was a competative against other 5 stars in Dublin, but added extras (Breakfast & Car Parking) increased the value. Over an excellent stay.",5,2010,07,02
205,Typical Four Seasons except Location,"My wife, daughter and I stayed here from June 9-11.  It was a typically lovely Four Seasons stay.  The hotel is beautiful and the staff is extremely professional and polite.  Other than the location it is a typically perfect Four Seasons Hotel.

Rooms:  We had an Executive Suite on the 3rd floor and it was very well organized, sized, and appointed.  I have no complaints whatsoever with the room quality.  There was an atypical glitch in our room on the final morning of our stay, which actually ended up illustrating what Four Seasons service is all about.  We had no hot water in our suite due to a malfunction in part of the hotel.  As we had a flight to catch we did not have time to wait for the issue to be fixed and brought it to the staff's attention at check-out.  They apologized and sent us on our way.  I was frankly a bit underwhelmed by this reaction, but since I didn't request any compensation I wasn't upset as much as surprised.  So I wrote to Four Seasons upon my return to the states just to inform them of this issue.  Within an hour the hotel's General Manager called me, apologized all over himself, and mandated that we accept the entire night's charge (500 euros) as compensation for our inconvenience.  Anything can happen (and often does) in a hotel stay.  All you can do is ask that the response be courteous and professional.  In my opinion, this was overly gracious.

Service:  Not surprisingly service was top notch.  Every employee we ran across was professional, polite, efficient, and competent.  The hotel is obviously very well run and they do an excellent job of selecting their employees.

Location:  While in a beautiful neighborhood the location is not ideal for a quick visit to Dublin.  It is about a 15 minute and 12 euro cab ride from the part of town that most folks are coming to visit.  For me the Four Seasons quality makes up for this but my wife would have stayed closer to town center.  It is simply a preference issue but one should be aware of this potential drawback.

Food:  The restaurant was very good.  My daughter had room service one night and was very satisfied.  The bar is very good and a nice place to hang out.  I had to work most of one of the days I was there and went to the bar with my computer for a few hours.  It was constantly active and seemed to have a very nice vibe.

Spa:  I got a 45 minute deep tissue massage one day and worked out in the gym the other day.  Very nice facility and my treatment was better than average.  Not an ""over the top"" spa that one sees in newer hotels (this hotel seemed about 10 years old) but one that is very comfortable and nice.

Overall:  I would recommend this hotel for folks who value the ""Four Seasons"" experience.  It compares favorably to most in city Four Seasons Hotels in the states and Europe.",4,2010,06,29
205,Now I know what the 'Four Seasons Service' is!,"Before our trip to the Four Seasons Dublin, I have read many reviews on the property which highlight how brilliant and special the FS service is; and indeed, how this service has become associated with every property in the FS brand. As this was my first time to stay in a Four Seasons hotel, I was eager to find out what made the brand stand out, and also why the 'Four Seasons' name is now synonymous with luxury and service and has such a revered reputation. Well I must say, after 2 nights at the FS Dublin, now I know!
                   We arrived and the car doors were opened for us, luggage whisked away, and car valet parked. Check in was a breeze- lovely receptionist and she informed us that we had been upgraded to a deluxe room (Had old them previously that it was for a birthday) and our room would be ready in half an hour. We were graciously showed to the lobby lounge and we were offered a free tea or coffee with a lovely chocolate biscuit. When we went to our room a personal happy birthday note was waiting and a plate of goodies! The room itself was lovely, spotless and spacious- the bathroom is the crowning jewel- absolutely gleaming with marble and complete with lovely toiletries. The beds were really comfortable and antique furniture was pristine.  
                The public areas are fabulous and have a sense that they are well maintained. The carpet everywhere still has that 'just new springyness' underfoot- a small point maybe, but after 9 years since opening this is a great achievement! 
                All these little details, however, are what Four Seasons excel in. We even spotted a man sanding and painting 2 bedroom doors opposite ours which I can safely say did not really need to be. And nowhere are these little details more prevalent than in the beautiful spa. I always think that an accurate measure of luxury in these areas can be obtained by seeing how abundant every amenity is. In every locker in the lavish and pristine carpeted changing rooms is a fresh robe, slippers, towel and laundry bag. You just know no locker has been left out. Around the corner the are rows and rows of more towels, robes and slippers. Pure luxury. Also what I find most rare in these spa areas, there are people regularly coming in and making sure everything is still pristines for every guest's visit. Outside the steam room and sauna are a plate of iced towels- never experienced these before- just ice normally. If you ask for more at reception, within 5 minutes someone is in replenishing them. Attention to detail from the staff is absolute and just amazing. Four Seasons staff are to be applauded. 
                             The pool area and whirlpool were beautiful, looking out onto a outdoor courtyard and in this area there are yet more towels! The actual spa facilities like pool, jacuzzi, steam room and sauna may not differ from other hotels but it is the way in which they are displayed to the guest and the experience they create that makes the spa so relaxing and decadent.
                             The staff also get to know you throughout your stay, and they recognise you and take an interest in how your stay has been. If they find out your name, such as on your credit card, they use it. When we walked into the lobby lounge again, one staff member always said 'Welcome back.' Moreover, you really get an overall feel that every staff member genuinely cares about you and your stay, which is extremely rare.
                              The public areas also have a great atmosphere and the food is amazing -try the prawn cocktail! I also had the pleasure of eating the best dessert I have ever tasted in the cafe on the first night- it would be heaven for chocaholics! (Hot chocolate molten dessert!) Also, the hot chocolate was an experience in itself! 4.75 euros for flavoured hot chocolate with truffles and vanilla cream and marshmallows with enough for 3 medium sized cups is good value if you ask me! 
                           You want to know the best bit? I got a room only rate for 3 people for 2 nights for 240 pounds sterling on expedia. 40 pounds per person per night in a place such as this is such a steal!! 
                          Overall, I'm sure you can tell I enjoyed my stay and the location a little out of Dublin was no problem- the drive into city centre was actually quite nice!  I would encourage anyone coming to Dublin to give this a try. I have truly found out what Four Seasons is really all about!",5,2010,06,27
205,WOW,"We went for our annually trip to Dublin and once again stayed in the Four Seasons and once again we knew the minute we arrived why we chose to stay here again.
We handed the car keys over to the concierge and we didnt have to worry about our luggage and parking the car.
The front desk stay was very friendly and after checking in we were shown to our room. To our surprise we had been upgraded to a Junior Suite which was brilliant.
Large living room and bedroom and an even bigger bathroom with bathtub and shower.
Our rate inclueded breakfast and I can say for sure its the best I've had so far. All you can think of for breakfast and the quality of the food is just mind blowing. No surprise it took us nearly 2 hours to have breakfast!
Our stay also included lunch and at check in we were told the lunch voucher was  85 Euro. On checking out we were then suddenly told the voucher was only 85 Dollars. We told the front desk staff that we specifically had asked what currency the voucher was in and they took off the extra charge from our bill after being prompted.
The Spa and Wellness Section of the hotel is fantastic, swimming pool and jaccuzzi area are very clean and the staff looks after you. The special extra touches in the changing room make the expierence just that little bit more special.",5,2010,06,25
205,Still 5 star,"I first visited this hotel some 5 years ago. During the intervening period I had stayed in other hotels principally because of their location closer to the centre of Dublin. On this occasion I decided to retry the Four Seasons and was not disappointed. The Four Seasons remains resolutely 5 star. The room was comfortable, the lounge area relaxing and themed with different types of purple plants, the spa and pool were not too busy, but the best part of the hotel remains the excellent, welcoming front of house staff. Just one example: when we were leaving the hotel on a shopping trip, the concierge laid on a free hotel limousine. It is that kind of touch, without him being asked, which distinguishes a proper 5 star experience.",5,2010,06,09
205,The best place to stay in Dublin!,"I had been conflicted as to where to stay when I read about the commutation needed to travel downtown for sightseeing but selected this hotel based on the glowing reviews. I was not disappointed on any count. In fact, when we were downtown, we were glad to leave the busy streets for the quiet of the suburbs.

The car was available to drop us off two of our three day stay. The concierges helped with  restaurant recommendations and were most efficient coordinating messages amongst themselves when working on a task for us. They are the best we've encountered in our travels.

Room service, something we ordinarily do not do, was so graciously served that we availed ourselves twice.

Everything was immaculate- from the fabric placed on the floor alongside the bed so that one's feet need not touch the carpet- to the elegantly designed robes left in the room.

We had not one complaint and would stay there again.",5,2010,06,06
205,Sharp price - classy upgraded room,"My husband got a sharp price on Expedia: 141.15 euros/night with the 3rd night free! Our stay here was a welcome treat after some lackluster nights in B&Bs in small Irish towns. We used the gym twice, which had well-maintained equipment that provided an excellent work-out. WiFi in the rooms is extra, so we just used the 3 free computers in the business center. In 1 month of travelling throughout England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland, staying in B&Bs and hotels/motels, I have to belly-ache that the Four Seasons was the ONLY accomodation that didn't provide an electric pot in the room for coffee/tea service. This really peeved me to have tea bags that I couldn't use. We did pay the 6.50 euro coffee price/cup in the lobby one morning - after that we walked the 8 minutes to Insomnia. Great, well-trained staff helped make this a memorable stay.",5,2010,06,01
205,5*Elegance,"I have stayed here on a number of occasions and love every visit.  The staff are very courtious and helpfull.

The rooms are spacious and sparkle clean.  It has everything you want.

The breakfast is very tasty and its elegance at its best.

I will be back",5,2010,05,21
205,Quiet elegance away from the tourist sites,"Four Seasons is a lovely, classy hotel in an upscale residential neighborhood a bit too far to walk to the downtown tourist sites.  Our room for three was large and well furnished, but didn't have much of a view.  The distance from City Centre requires a taxi or bus ride or driving your own car and parking downtown; the hotel does have a free town car which was great one day but wasn't operating the next.  The concierge gave great restaurant recommendations (although there isn't much to eat or to do in the immediate neighborhood).  The business center had great free computers, and the spa and fitness center looked good (although we didn't use them).  No coffee maker in the room, and the free coffee service in the lobby was only available for a few minutes in the morning, so we got soaked 25 Euros to have 3 coffees brought to our room from the bar.",5,2010,04,17
205,All you expect from a 5 star Hotel!,"Stayed at the Four Seasons Hotel, Dublin this Easter from 3rd to 5th April 2010.  From the moment we checked in we were given the service you would expect from a 5 star hotel.  We stayed in interconnecting rooms with our 3 daughters.  On arrival to the rooms there were home-made chocolate cookies with each of our childrens names in chocolate, along with a selection of sweets and chocolate eggs.  This was a lovely touch, and impressed our children!

The staff were all extremely friendly and helpful, especially conceirage.  The spa area is beautiful, and the selection of herbal teas, spa water and snacks is especially luxurious.  We had a lovely relaxing break and were sorry to leave on Monday.",5,2010,04,16
205,Perfect from start to finish,"This was a wonderful experience at the Four Seasons in Dublin. From the moment we arrive the doorman took charge of the car and had the bags delivered to our room.
The hotel is beautifully appointed and very spacious. We had a drink in the lounge before going elsewhere for dinner we had pre-arranged. The staff were very helpful and pleasant. After cming back late from dinner we had a few more drinks in the lounge and nothing was too much trouble for the staff.
The room was very nice and spacious with a mix of contemporary and traditional furniture. The bathroom was beauitful with a deep bath and a separate shower. Toiletries were of excellent standard (L'Occiatane).
We went down for breakfast the following morning (our first experience of the restaurant) and were immediately greeted by friendly staff and shown to a large table in the well-spaced and airy dining room. I was delighted with the fact that the breakfast was cooked to order. Many hotels in Ireland (including top class hotels) have opted for a breakfast buffet which is sub-standard. The Four Seasons provided a wonderful leisurely breakfast experience with newspapers provided by the waiter.
Overall a very pleasant experience and I can't wait to return.",5,2010,04,10
205,Well worth the expense,We stayed at the Four Seasons March 28-30 (a three night for the price of two special).  The only complaint that we had was that the weather was too bad to walk so we took cabs everywhere.  One word describes the hotel-excellent.,5,2010,04,08
205,best hotel in dublin!,"we stayed for a weekend here and absolutely loved it! we eat here for my partners birthday and got a free cake with candles...was a nice touch! the fod was amazing and when asked about wine to go with the food i was recommended the best wine i've ever tasted and not the most expensive one on the menu either.
staff were very friendly and our room was spacious and spotless! can't fault this hotel at all apart from it not being in central dublin, but its great to get away from the noise.
loved it!",4,2010,04,08
205,Great place to stay,"Lovely hotel well worth a visit,if traveling without car will need taxis to get to town",4,2010,03,29
205,"Amazing Hotel, Just a bit too far out",This hotel is everything that you would expect from a Four Seasons. Everything was simply perfect except its just a bit far out from the city centre. We would have prefered if it was within walking distance. Still we had a great 2 nights here and one of the most comfortable beds ever.,5,2010,03,24
205,"Very nice hotel, very knowledgeable staff, and those great beds!","My daughter and I stayed for three nights over the St. Patricks holiday. Your staff was very knowledgeable and treated us royally. We had many questions and all were handled very nicely. One of your waiters, Oein (Owen in English) was pretty amazing. He knows his wines, he knows his golf, and he KNOWS the food. Hats off to him!! We always found our room clean and teh cleaning staff very friendly. those beds were great! No problem sleeping!

It was apparent you and your staff run an excellent hotel. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. thanks again for treating us so well, it will be remembered for a long time.",5,2010,03,23
205,Suberb stay,"Me and my wife stayed for three nights at The Four Seasons Dublin.
While booking online I asked for a romantic touch to the room since we just got married.
Upon arrival we were upgraded to a suite and had a warm welcoming letter from the manager alongside a great weddingcake. A fabulous start of a wonderfull stay in a great environment with extraordinary service. We dearly recommend this hotel and will return as soon as we can. About the objections from former critics concerning the pricelevel we can only say that 8 euro for afternoon tea in the Lounge at four seasons is money well spent since it is not just a cup of tea but another great experience.

Great hotel, superb staff - truly recomended!",5,2010,03,19
205,"Nice hotel,",Arrived at hotel around half 2 and room wasn't ready. Were told to wait around and should be ready in 2 hours! Walked around the area and came back to hotel bar to be told there was a room ready. Fast check-in. Room was VERY spacious and the bed was sooooo comfortable. Staff werent the friendliest for a 5 star hotel. Obiviously for a 5 star hotel you are paying the prices for food and drinks. Hotel is out of the city and 15 mins in a taxi into city. There is nothing really in the area to do. Didnt think it was the best value for money not like some of the 4/5 stars in the city,3,2010,03,10
205,What a lovely way to spend a weekend,"It was sunny in Dublin in March and staying at the Four Seasons was a treat. This weekend my friend and I enjoyed staying at the hotel. 
As in all Four Seasons there are wonderful flowers that greet you in the lobby.
We tried out the cafe restaurant and enjoyed a lovely dinner.  I had the fish and chips and mushy peas and my friend enjoyed the schnitzel. We had tea and mochas in the tea lounge following dinner. It was enjoyable.
We decided to order breakfast room service and went with the Full Irish Breakfast. with Irish Breakfast tea of course. It was all  yummy. I really liked the sausages and the giant cooked mushroom.  It came with a basketful of toast and lots of little jams.
One afternoon we had a scones and tea in the lounge.
The hotel has a length pool and whirlpool but also a full spa. I made sure that I used the steamroom and sauna.  
 I was surprised to see so many families with small children at the hotel but it wasn't unpleasant for travellers without children. It was not loud or crowded in any of the areas. You can borrow from the DVD collection if you don't want to pay for a movie from their on-demand collection.
The hotel is located just outside the downtown area which allows for a feeling of spaciousness throughout the hotel.  It is also very quiet. There is no street noise at night or during the daytime hours.
We got especially good service from the concierge. We decided the night before to go on a tour outside the city and got a lot of personalized service to help us find an enjoyable tour (even though several companies were fully booked).  
I would stay here again without a doubt.",5,2010,03,07
205,remember you are in Ireland.  This is a safe bet.,Dublin accommodations are not rated as high as US accommodations.  This hotel is very comfortable with amenities and location.,5,2010,02,27
205,I recommend this hotel 100%,"I just had the most fantastic 3 night stay.
 I travelled with my sister who I had not seen in 16 months, being a special get away I expected even more from the hotel.
The staff were everything I expected, professional, freindly, courteous, helpful and efficient.  The room I stayed in was a junior suite, very spacious attractive décor with multiple little nuances from L'Occitane in the bathroom, to the weather report daily.
Lady Gaga was staying at the time as was West life with Louis Walsh.
Breakfast was lavish with a taste or diet to cover any whim.  Even though the hotel was completely full the dinning areas are so large and light it felt we easily found a secluded quiet spot.
We ended up eating at the hotel at night twice, simply because the food was excellent we ate seafood then steak both were delious. The waiters were highly proffessional and very at ease with there customer service.  
I’ve stayed at multiple hotels from the Mandarin in New York to the Ritz Carlton in Half Moon Bay, CA, mostly business but leisure also.  Enough 5 star hotels and your expectations become very high. 
We taxied and walked into town innitially I thought this would be a negative, however it ended up feeling like a hotel in the country within a town!
The Four Seasons just gave me a fantastic stay. Thank you.",5,2010,02,25
205,The staff without exception are wonderful!,"I visited the hotel as part of a conference and I must say the entire experience has been wonderful I would easily come back for a weekend and bring my family along.

The food throughout the week was absolutely fanstastic, mostly dined in the conference area but the times I tried room service it was equally good.",5,2010,02,01
205,one of the best hotels I've seen!,"If you're looking for a hotel in the city centre...look further
But if you want a luxury hotel, with friendly staff, good food, clean and spacious rooms, stay at the four Seasons!",5,2010,02,01
205,Best ever hotel experience.,"W hat a marvelous experience.  My wife and I spent a lovely weekend in the Four Seasons celebrating our 30th. wedding anniversary..  We live only 5 miles from the hotel and after checking out all the alternatives decided we would check out the 'FOUR SEASONS EXPERIENCE'.  From the time we arrived and our car was valet parked we were addressed personally by every member of staff during our stay.  Our junior suite was presented immaculately with pristine white bed linen. .  The marble bathroom was enormous and was more than adequately stocked with 'high end' toiletries.  If you would enjoy relaxing in a lobby lounge in front of a blazing open fire with a nice bottle of Rioja this is part of the 'experience'. The service is exemplary, not over the top or false..  We felt we were in a home away from home.  Breakfast and dinner is served in the plush dinning room.   I requested a couple of soft poached eggs for breakfast and after a few minutes a chef arrived at our table with two perfectly shelled and cooked eggs.  I fell that it is very difficult for hotel management to get the perfect balance in hotels.  The food may not be as tasty as in a restaurant or service as its limitations, but our overall experience was perfect.  With all the fantastic deals hotels are offering in Ireland - check out the Four Seasons, you will not be disapointed!!",5,2010,01,28
205,Was A Rip Off! Easy see times are hard for this hotel!!!,"The staff were as expected very good. on check in I was asked if I wanted to upgrade my room! For an extra charge!! a little odd i thaught!!  The decour is awfull even though i fell for the trap and upgraded my room to a suit it was all very bland. dated curtains bright and flowery with a blue carpet and magnolia walls.. was quite an eye sore also the tv's were old no plasma's. the bath was deep however short. And the view was of a wall. 
Overall I was a little dissapointed the last rung on the ladder was the filthy yellow duvet cover wrapped up in clean sheets if people are considering 5 star treatment here it is important to look at the wider picture the four seasons needs work and is not good value for money. There is no customer comforts the mini bar menue is scary you would need to re-mortgage to afford a bottle of pop at 5euro, parking is 18euro breakfast is a buffet breakfast way over priced skip this at 30euro per person, parking is 20 euro and to top it all off broadband is 22 euro for one night! all things that are included almost everywhere else for free",3,2010,01,04
205,Heaven for Coeliacs,I'm allergic to Wheat and have found this hotel to be a refuge bordering on heaven. Well Done on the service and knowledgeable staff. Wonderful gluten free food. Staff are very helpful too.,5,2009,12,23
205,Disgrace to the Four Seasons name,"Like the previous reviewer's annual Leo, we have always had a pre Christmas girls get together at the Four Seasons.  This year, the cost cutting measures are evident everywhere in the hotel and sadly reflected in the quality of the food and service.  Shortly after 10:30 pm, while our table of five were still eating, the two waiters in the restaurant started preparing for the breakfast buffet.  Heating lamps were brought in and set up over large pastry/read baskets directly behind us.   Toasters, water dispensers, tea bag selection boxes etc were all brought out.  There were at least three tables with guests still in the restaurant.  We tried to ignore what was going on but it was so off putting.  We were given the distinct impression that the staff wanted us to leave as soon as we finished eating.   We did, at around half eleven.  When we asked for our coats, only one was tagged properly and brought out.  The other four of us were told to go into the cloakroom ourselves to get our own coats!  Unbelievable!",1,2009,12,17
205,Yearly Leo,"This is the third time we have booked the restaurant for our yearly Leo. Leo is rhyming slang for Leo Sayer - an all dayer. The last two occasions were exceptional. We start with drinks in the bar with tempting nibbles; then a very late lunch - which begins with the superb hors d’oeuvres table; then back to the bar till late. Not this year. No nibbles apart from peanuts – which we had to ask for; no hors d’oeuvres table; very very mediocre meal – with a restricted cheap menu; surrounded by a barrow-boys convention in the bar afterwards. All in all – an extremely disappointing experience. Even in a recession, you expect standards from a hotel such as the four seasons portrays itself to be. No standards. No quality. No fourth Leo here. Although three meals were deducted from the bill – it’s not the point. We were looking for what the four seasons used to be – the price wasn’t important. A special occasion ruined by a now less than special hotel. We will repeat our Leo in the Merrion in January 2010.",1,2009,12,13
205,SUPERB IN ALL RESPECTS,"I attended a convention here in late November and found the whole experiences to be excellent. The bedroom was spotless and had absolutely everything that I needed. If one was to be REALLY picky, I might suggest that it was a long haul from the elevator - and maybe the artwork on the walls was a bit too generic, and not Irish enough, given the location of the property. Attended a banquest dinner for 300 guests that evening in the main Ballroom, and the food, service and ambience was excellent - as good as it gets for this type of function. After dinner we adjourned to the Ice Bar. Super place, but boy, do they know how to charge!! Overall thugh, a great time, and one I would look forward to again",5,2009,12,07
205,Not a single complaint!,"The Four Seasons was previously rated No. 1 in Dublin and I'm amazed that it has slipped to No. 19.  I have stayed there several times and have never been disappointed.  My latest visit was for three nights at Hallowe'en (30 Oct.-2 Nov 2009).  I have, as always, found the staff welcoming, friendly, professional.  The room (a junior suite) was lovely, quiet, and included everything that we could possibly have needed.  The breakfast buffet was second to none, the evening meals which we took in the cafe were cooked to perfection.  We availed of the special offer 3 nights for the price of 2.",5,2009,11,05
205,A little out of town but a stunning hotel with Wonderful staff,"I can not speak highly enough of my experience of this hotel - I only stayed one night but from Start to finish it was a pleasure - the staff in the hotel were wonderful and helpful without being intrusive - they got the balance just right - 
I would have expected a ""stuffy 5 star"" atmosphere but it was the complete opposite",5,2009,11,02
205,Worst SIX euro pint of Guinness ever and actually the only one ever,"I recently attended a wedding in this hotel of good friends of mine. Before I get into the issues I had, I have to say that it was a very enjoyable wedding and the food was of a very high standard except for the coffee. My problem is that we were being charged 6 euro for pints of terrible Guinness. As a regular Guinness drinker, I can honestly say that you would find it difficult to find a worse pint in Dublin. Also, there is no reason why a pint of Guinness should ever cost 6euro, that is a complete rip-off. The main reason why the quality and price of the pint really annoyed me is that as a proud Dubliner, I know that it is still one of Ireland's biggest selling points (God knows we need everything we can get in these difficult times) and the visitor numbers to the Guinness store house each year prove this. A number of tourists are excited about samplying a true pint of Guinness in its spiritual home of Dublin and I was very disappointed when I realised that some tourist first pint is in this hotel and it is probably their last. This is very disappointing from supposedly one of the ""best hotels"" in this great city.",2,2009,10,30
205,Surprised how good it was.,"This hotel is expensive, but then you are staying at one of the best global Hotel brands in the world and there is very good brand awareness of this company especially in North America.
The rooms are very chintzy, with a mixture of old and new furniture designs, they are spacious, depending what room rate you have agreed to pay, with all the usual services that you would expect. Beds and bathrooms are very good, although the location of the Lounge TV in a low level armoire is not functional, so you end up staying in the bedroom instead.
Breakfast is good & at the weekends is a mixture of Served and Buffet style, there is a large range of items on offer, but often a request for some item that is not standard will result in a communication problem with the many of the foreign staff.
Dinner was reasonably good as was the service and the Hotel manages to give the Restaurant an intimate feel, dealing with the sheer size of the area well.
Food quality was good, as was the variety.
The Spa is small but good, and the staff here are excellent.
Overall I would recommend.",5,2009,10,30
205,You get what you pay for,"I had a great stay at the Four Seasons and the staff couldn’t have been more helpful. I stayed in a suite and the room was huge. The furnishings were comfortable and we had a television in the lounge area and the bedroom. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept on.
However, you do have to pay out for things like room service and the food in the restaurant is expensive. The breakfast, which was included, was delicious but I’d never be tempted to pay over 20 Euro for a full Irish.
The spa facilities are excellent and the pool with Jacuzzi is a great place to relax. I had a great massage in the spa and spent most of the afternoon enjoying the facilities on offer including the steam room and sauna.
I think the Four Seasons is the kind of hotel you stay in if you really want to spoil yourself. If you’re just looking for somewhere to rest your head for the night you might be better off with a more basic hotel because you need to spend time in the hotel to make it worth your money.",4,2009,10,21
205,"Wonderful, but waitstaff needs help","My husband and I stayed here one night before heading into the country to visit family.

Pros: I arrived early before my husband and the front desk did all they could to accomodate the type of room we wanted (we had several requirements).  They so wanted me to be happy with my room, I was escorted by the front desk person to my room, and along the way she gave me a tour of the hotel.  The room was quiet, beds comfy, bathroom clean with plenty of towels, nice water pressure.  The strange thing was that the clock radio was a small cheap little thing---not the ones you see in other Four Seasons. Concierge and bell folks were all wonderful.  Check out was easy and the woman did all she could to ensure we knew where we were going.  She made great restaurant recommendations for us in Kilkenny.

Spa: After I got to my room, I called the spa to see if they had anything available in the next 2.5 hours before my husband arrived.  She said she'd check, called me right back, and fit me in 1/2 hour's time.  I had the most wonderful massage of my life (and I go quite often at home) by Rose. At 135 Euro, it was expensive, but worth it!

Con: The ONLY thing I can fault this place on is their lower level wait staff.  One at the lobby restaurant forgot to submit half our order and seemed to have her mind elsewhere. Another at the main dining room was so snotty to me.  Another brought us scrambled eggs clearly made with cream, although we asked for eggs without.  The trend in Ireland seem to be that they hire folks from Eastern Europe; I'm not sure if it was a language issue or what, but they don't seem cut out for the work (I am currently reading Isadore Sharp's book, and I know the Four Seasons is more concerned with hiring the right attitude than experience).  I am not looking for the waitstaff to be my new friends (as is the trend in the US) but simply to be attentive.  And snotty service reminds me too much of the Ritz chain, which is why I prefer the Four Seasons in the first place.",4,2009,10,19
205,Luxurious but expensive,"I stayed at this hotel in March 2009 on a business conference and as expected from the Four Seasons brand it was luxurious, elegant and had very attentive staff. Rooms were large and well appointed. The food was also excellent, particularly so as the hotel was catering for a conference of over 100 people at the same time. The most disappointing aspect was the very poor soundproofing in the bedrooms where the sound of the TVs from rooms on either side could be clearly heard - not at all what I would have expected.",3,2009,10,15
205,"Lovely hotel, out of the way location, odd billing practices","The Four Seasons Hotel Dublin is an elegant, quiet, luxurious hotel.  Guest rooms are well decorated and spacious, with comfortable beds and large marble bathrooms.   Most rooms have nice views and many have balconies.  Public areas are attractive, decorated with original artwork by top contemporary Irish artists.  Staff is friendly and helpful.  Check-in was quick and easy.  Room service was excellent.
The hotel is located a considerable distance from the tourist center.  This is a plus in that it is in a quiet area, a minus in that it requires a taxi ride to get most places.
When I checked out, I was presented with the bill, which I reviewed and approved.  A week later, I received an additional bill of over 100 Euros, with a note that it had already been charged to my credit card ""for your convenience.""  Apparently, these were charges for wifi, minibar, etc. that had been incurred at various points during my stay and had somehow been left off the bill they showed me when I checked out, but it was rather confusing and difficult to verify.  I called the hotel to ask about it, and was told that the manager would call me back, but he or she never did.  Given that other reviewers also had complaints related to the hotel's billing practices, I think the hotel needs to address its procedures in this regard.",4,2009,09,22
205,The most professional and friendly Hotel staff I have met recently,"We had a fantastic time at the hotel with excellent staff throughout in a beautiful appointed room.  My only gripe was a mistake on our dinner bill, being charged for 2 rather than 1 bottle of wine, which was rectifyed.    Dinner was excellent despite being very busy.  Breakfast service was excellent at 11AM in the room following a great night out, however the rashers / sausages were cooked at 9 AM!!!!  At €32.50 pp for breakfast , I would have expected it to be freshly cooked.
Would I stay again?  Definitely.",4,2009,09,16
205,Four Seasons was first class all the way,"The staff at the Four Seasons were courteous, friendly and efficient.
The room was immaculate and a welcome retreat for 4 consecutive days of sightseeing.
The only regret was that the food (albeit good) was a bit too cosmopolitan and not the authentic Irish fare I found elsewhere.",5,2009,08,28
205,Charming Staff Lovely Hotel  Horrible Wine!!,"Having relaxed in the lovely surroundings of this hotel, I decided to order a glass of  white wine. It was  strong both in taste and odour. I changed it for a Pinot Grigio, funnily it didnt taste much different. Then, I reluctantly went to the bar and changed it for a New Zealand wine. It still didnt taste much different. Now mindyou, I asked two different friends to assist me in forming these opinions and we all agreed that the wine was horrible.
I switched to water for the first time ever at a function in a five star.
The glass of wine cost  between 10-12 euro a glass, for that amount it should be palatable.",3,2009,08,28
205,The Over Priced rubbish food says it all,"Checked in here to go to a concert. Prices are a rip off for what you get. Room was nice but over priced. Hotel was empty with no atmosphere. Decided to eat in their ""Award Winning"" Restaurant. This had even less atmosphere with not enough staff to cope. Food was overpriced and came out cold and overcooked. Obviously it had sat in the kitchen as there were barely any staff to take it to us. Had Dover Sole which at 38 Euros only came with two potatoes and some burnt butter. I asked if I could have ""Meuniere"" Sauce which is my favourite and was sent out this yellow Lemon Butter sauce which turned my stomach when I tried it as it was so bitter. I asked again for Meuniere Sauce and was told quietly by the waiter that the executive chef who was on duty told him that i had been given Meuniere Sauce. Obviously this Chef hasnt a clue and I was disappointed that an Executive Chef from a 5 star property doesnt know his basics.
I wouldnt recommend this hotels food to anyone. Overpriced Rubbish cooked by an Amateur.",1,2009,08,21
205,ABSOLUTE RIPOFF - DO NOT BOOK WITH CREDIT CARD,"Booked a room in February as we were meant to be going to a concert in the RDS
It ended up that we decided against spending cupulous amounts of money for the tickets, so infact agreed upon staying in our usual hotel by the Quays.
I checked availabilty at the Clarion and as usual, was offered the highest standard of proffesionalism.
We agreed to go there for two days  and so I proceeded to cancel my booking at The Four Seasons.
I first tried to cancel via their website - but it said there was an error so I phoned the hotel and confirmed the cancellation.
After returning last weekend from Dublin, I checked my email - only to find that The Four Seasons had charged my credit card a 340euro charge for a no show!!!!
I couldn't believe it!
After numerous emails - they refuse to refund my money!
I explained that I had cancelled - they said they had no recollection of it.
They asked me the name of the person I had talked to - I didnt realise that I needed to ask such details!
They also told me that someone from their hotel had spoken with me personally on the Friday night (10th July) - absolute nonsense, as I was at home and nobody called - when I pushed the matter further to find out and speak to the ""so called"" person which had supposedly made the call - they said they'd deal with that themselves and wouldn't give me any further details!!! I have asked numerous times for a name - they refuse to give me one - simply because they know that nobody did phone me, just as the person I had cancelled my booking with, never bothered to do their job correctly
It has been lie after lie
I am proceeding with legal advice as they have actually taken 340 euro from credit card when they know they shouldn't have - it is no more than theft!
If you are looking a great place to stay - there are plenty of beautiful hotels in Dublin, many which I have stayed in and all who offer honest service
Stay clear of this hotel!!",1,2009,07,18
205,A Rare Treat,"Stayed here with my wife who is expecting our second baby. Went to the Bruce Springsteen concert in the RDS which is about a 60 second walk from the hotel! Had a great experience.  Hotel is very expensive but worth it if you treat it as a treat!  Staff were very friendly and couldnt do enough for us.  Breakfast is amazing, dont miss it!",5,2009,07,16
205,Fabulous! 5 Star Service,"As always you can count on superior service!  The hotel is just minutes from the DART station and across the street from a bus stop, so getting into Dublin center was very easy. Being able to come back from a day of sightseeing to enjoy the hot tub and pool were a treat! Ate several meals there and they were absolutely delicious.  The chef was featuring an Indian menu. I am not a huge fan of Indian food but decided to try it and was SO glad I did. The meal was delicious, so I recommend trying the chef's special menu. One evening there was a piano player in the lobby area - so relaxing. Unfortunately I destroyed my curling iron with with the wrong converter.  The staff came to my rescue and provided us with two different sized curling irons for our use --- going beyond what was expected.  Just ask the staff and they will assist you with any small detail concerning traveling and suggestions. I would DEFINITELY stay here again.  It was pleasant to get away from Dublin center for a relaxing evening after sightseeing.",5,2009,06,26
205,Disappointing,"We stayed here on the first night of our honeymoon before flying out from Dublin. We were really tired after our wedding and looking forward to putting our feet up and being spoiled with a little luxury. The lobby area is beautiful with a great buzz around it. Checkin was average, pleasant receptionist however he took our credit card and gave us our key and sent us on our way, no information about hotel services, dinner booking etc. We had been 'upgraded' to a junior suite which was slightly larger than a normal room however there was nothing about it that made it extra special or luxurious. Bathroom was fine with the standard toiletries, robes and slippers. We had room service that evening which was the highlight, great food and wine served on a proper dinner table in our room with candle etc. We checked out very early the next morning to go to the airport so didnt have breakfast. On checkout we were told that we were being charged €18 for carparking and €22 for internet!! What a rip off, we didnt mind what the stay costed as it was our honeymoon, however we really felt annoyed that these hidden costs are not included in the already expensive room rate. I have stayed in other 5star hotels in Dublin - Westbury and Shelbourne and will definitely be returning to them and not the Four Seasons. Overall nothing really bad about this hotel but it definitely doesnt live up to its name of being something more superior than the rest. - nice hotel but no 'wow factor' here",3,2009,06,20
205,Nothing is too much trouble,"Have stayed here since it opened, more often than not with some of our dogs in tow, while attending dog shows in Dublin. Even the dogs are made to feel special. 
The service is exceptional and discreet, food is fab, and the rooms so comfortable.
The ONLY bug bear is if you have a room overlooking the RDS next door you will probably hear the clock tower chime every 1/4 hr, and if you are having a sleepless night that can be a problem. but that is hardly the fault of the hotel !
The Spa is great.
Wouldnt stay anywhere else in Dublin, it is like home from home.",5,2009,06,17
205,"Good, but missing the ""wow"" factor","When I found out that I I was going to be staying at the Four Seasons I admitidly got quite excited.

The property is great and there is no faulting it.  Courtious staff upon arrival and all the way through.  I used the gym and it is quite well equipted, the machienery is up-to-date and well maintained.  The room itself is quite impressive and would be more suited as a small conference/meeting room.

We had lunch in the Ice Bar that was not overly impressive in terms of decor but the set menu we had was very good.  Ingredients were local, fresh and prepared to a high standard.  As well as being very tasty.

The conference facilities were very good and staff were attentive to our needs.

You have to Pay for WIFI.  €22 per day.  Although I do believe that the hotel is there to make money I believe that a business traveller would sooner choose a hotel that has free WIFI opposed to those who make you pay.  They do however have a free ""business centre"".  Basically three cubicles with PC's connected to a printer where you can browse and print from free.

All in all I would say a nice hotel, good service, however no memorable ""wow"" factor that would push my rating from a 4 to 5.",4,2009,06,16
205,Absolutely Fab!,"On this trip I traveled with 2 classmates of mine. I am age 28 and my friends are ages 25 and 45. 

Everyone knows that at any Four Seasons in any country is going to be an experience to remember. Well I was right! Everyone was sooo helpful and amazing it was almost scary. The staff makes sure that you have everything you need 24/7. The hotel is in a good location only 2 blocks from the DART train station, which takes you to Tara Street (where all of the good shopping stores are).  The bathroom was my favorite place...I chilled in my robe and slippers they had for the guests. I soaked in the awesome giant size tub next to the glass door shower.  the view from my room was spectacular! 

We are an active bunch and walked around the neighboorhood and saw beautiful houses and sat in pubs and chatted with the locals. Everyone was very friendly. If you don't mind walking you can save a lot of money by not taking the taxis. Plus its great exercise for you!!

So overall the trip was amazing and the sites were beautiful!!",5,2009,05,07
205,"You pay for it, but neverending service is more than worth it.","Hotel is nice -- typical Four Seasons.  Location is in suburbs -- is about five DART train stops outside of city centre.  Not a big deal.  Takes 10 mins into city by taxi, 15 by DART train, and 25-30 by foot.  Neighborhood is beatiful, and hotel is very nice.  Onsite, had multiple bars and restaurants.  I travel tons for business, and have to say that the beds in this hotel were the best I've ever slept in -- even compared to other Four Seasons.  But what makes this property worth it is the large rooms (by European standards), the modernized marble bathrooms (great shower; has separate tub, too), and the neverending service.  Typical to the Four Seasons name, service happens everywhere without you having to ask for anything.  Everything you need is just done for you, and you get lots of nice surprises -- fresh popcorn left by made one night, etc.  Highly recommend this hotel.  I stayed with a teenage daughter, and we were both very happy.  Oh yeah, Dublin is fun, too.",5,2009,04,11
205,Best Hotel in Ireland,"This is an absolutley beautiful hotel. Relatively new, we have stayed here every year for the past 5 years! The reason for Dublin? Family, otherwise we would never go. The hotel location is fantastic for us because our family lives in D4 (area of the city). However, if you are looking for proximity to downtown Dublin (Grafton Street, etc..) try again. It is a good 10 minute cab ride to get there. Back to the hotel itself, the service is amazing. Any thing that you could want, they deliver with Irish hospitality. The indoor pool, while in the basement, is lit by sunlight if it is a sunny day. The restaurants are fantastic. We have Afternoon Tea in the Lobby Lounge at least twice per stay. Usually right when we get there and then take family later in the week. Seasons is the formal restaurant and serves great breakfast/lunch/dinner. Although I do prefer room service for breakfast. Now, in terms of rooms, we have had suites and then just two rooms all varying in cost and availibility. The year before this stay, we had two Deluxe Rooms, they are spacious and new and have gorgeous views of the gardens. The year before that, we had a Deluxe Suite which was extremely spacious and had a King bed and sofabed. This time, we had two Executive Suites. Very nice, again the whole hotel is relatively new and spacious. On a last note, the Spa was excellant for reflexology/massage/mani/pedi and facials. We had a Spa day on a rainy day. 

Would definatly go back seeing as we go there pretty much every year!",5,2009,03,19
205,Just perfect,"My husband and I stayed there from 2-4 January with our 3 year old daughter and it was perfect.  From the moment we arrived with the door of the car being opened for us, to the moment we left it was just  wonderful.  

It was bliss staying somewhere with a 3 year old where children are welcomed and indeed made a huge fuss of.  Our daughter was given her own ""check-in card"" to complete and given colouring books and crayons at every meal.  She had a cookie in the room with her name on and her own little dressing gown.  She even had her own set of children's soaps in the bathroom, although she insisted on putting all 6 in the bath at one go!

All the staff, without exception, were wonderful with children.  They spoke to her and not once was she ignored.  She had her own childsize cutlery, plate and cup at each meal. 

We have stayed at other ""child-friendly"" hotel but nothing like this.  There was no lip service paid to being child friendly, it was genuine.

We had an executive suite which was perfect as it meant our daughter could sleep in a separate room from us - she had an extremely elaborate cot but equally could have slept on the double sofa bed.  The food was delicious and the service excellent.

I really cannot recommend this hotel enough. If we go away again we shall check first whether there is a Four Seasons nearby.  

If you want a top class hotel where you and your child are made to feel welcome, where you're not stressed because you have a small person in tow but equally where it is also a ""grown up "" hotel, then stay here. You really will not be disappointed. 

Thank you for making our stay so fabulous.  If only other ""child friendly"" hotels mirrored their service on yours.",5,2009,02,15
205,Very nice overall,"Lovely hotel, great staff and the spa area was just great. But all this I would have expected at the prices charged.

Most reviews here are full of praise, and rightly so, but I do have a couple of niggles when looking at a hotel at this level.

I booked a deluxe room which was nice but nothing brilliant. Good bathroom but cramped 3/4 length bath, decor was average and the TV was a very old fashioned thing which didn't actually work properly. I have stayed in rooms better than this at much less than half the price.

My main niggle was the lack of tea/coffee making facilities. The mini bar was extensive and expensive (Mars bar for £3 anyone?) but why no facility to make a drink? OK so room service could whizz a cup of tea up but I'm sorry but I'm not paying £7 for a cuppa!

I don't mind paying for quality, and I do understand that the Euro rate has made a big difference... and that Dublin is VERY expensive, shockingly so.... but I'm afraid that the Four Seasons pushes it just a tad too far.

So in summary, a really good hotel with great staff but just a little too expensive for my taste.",4,2009,02,03
205,Pure Luxury - perfect spa break,"Beautiful hotel, courteous and helpful staff - falling over themselves to fulfil guests' desires.  Room was beautiful - bathroom wow!!  Spa facilties were very sumptuous - treatments were unhurried and girls were very pleasant - especially Cathy. Breakfast was heavenly - every whim catered for. The perfect hotel to treat yourself to. City is just a taxi ride away but plenty to do in hotel if you don't fancy anything too raucous! My mum and I had a fantastic time.  I would definitely put this hotel at the top of my list to stay in Dublin and I have stayed in quite a few!",5,2009,01,30
205,Christmas in style,"Myself and my husband decided to say in a hotel over the Christmas period and I am so glad we choose the Four Seasons.  It wasn’t too busy but not by any means empty, just nice. Christmas dinner was fantastic as was breakfast. The spa was open all days so you could avail of the pool etc. This is certainly a five star hotel with all your needs catered for. Attention to detail is top noch as are the staff. I would certainly return next Christmas.",5,2008,12,31
205,good hotel,booked hotel and got a discount as I worked for AIB This made the hotel very reasonable Good all round hotel,5,2008,11,27
205,Amazing art collection,"Stayed recently for a night in the 4 seasons in Dublin, and agree with the other reviewers about the excellence of the staff and the comfort of the rooms. The collection of modern Irish art on the walls in the public areas is priceless, and makes wandering around the hotel a more visually exciting experience that it is in other hotels. 
One quibble though, the hotel pool is about quarter the size that I would expect. This was OK while I was alone in the pool, but even one other swimmer would make this feel crowded. 
The location of the hotel is good, interesting pubs and restaurants within strolling distance. Taxis are plentiful around the main entrance, and public transport connections to the city centre are pretty good alos.",4,2008,11,26
205,High quality five star hotel,"Service level is excellent and unquestionably 5-star, with staff who are polite and in abundance.  Check in was very fast.

Rooms are typical cookie cutter shape/layout hotel rooms, albeit well furnished ones (however, quality wise can still be topped, for example by the Park Hyatt Hamburg).  One observation quality wise however was the use of white plastic electrical sockets (which seemed a bit cheap, metal ones would be more in keeping).  The bathroom was a good size with marble floors and shower walls.  L'Occitane soaps and shampoo were provided.  The air conditioning cooled and heated the room relatively quickly compared to other hotels I've stayed in.

The bed was comfortable.  Use of the TV internet is chargeable (which I found somewhat inappropriate considering the cost of the room and that some other 5-star hotels, such as the Rocco Forte Edinburgh, don't charge extra for this).

Room service was excellent.  The menu is the same as the ""cafe"" downstairs and prepared to a high standard  (you are eating a restaurant meal in your room).  The restaurant and bars themselves were exclusive looking places.  Piano music played in the bar, which appeared to be filled with a somewhat elderly crowd.

This hotel is definitely 5-star and I recommend it, but it can still be topped.",5,2008,11,23
205,Great,"Yes...great. Service, food, comfort....PERFECT",5,2008,11,13
205,Just Perfect,"It’s a Four Seasons so you know it is going to be great. 

We had a massive room and the comfiest bed ever. The location was great for us close enough to the centre to be accessible but far enough away to be quiet.

The outside is a bit ugly but the inside more than makes up for it. I would highly recommend to anyone. A great place to spend a weekend and explore Dublin from.",5,2008,09,08
205,Exceptional experience...,"The property is exquisite, the facilities first rate and the staff are born to serve. The hotel is in a very quiet residential/embassy area and adjacent to the home of the Dublin Horse Show - which we were advised by staff is a good time to NOT stay at the FS unless you are a horse-person.

Five of us spent three nights in two rooms - we booked moderate and were upgraded to deluxe. We took advantage of a ""stay three nights, pay for two"" promotion; which we appreciated at 1.60USD to the Euro.

The rooms were immaculate and tastefully decorated, the bedding (including one rollaway) was comfy with very high quality linens. Our room looked out on the main drive into the property, but truthfully there is not much to see in this part of the city. Bottom line - exactly what you would expect of the Four Seasons. (standard TV's though - suprised they have not upgraded to large flat panels - but I'm quibbling now - who's going to watch TV in Dublin, unless of course hurling is on the tube...) but I digress.

Omar took VERY good care of us and was the consummate bellman, doorman and all around caretaker - omnipresent and completely unobtrusive. In fact the front desk, concierge, and housekeeping staff were, at worst, extremely pleasant and, at best, thoroughly accomodating and instructional (we REALLY appreciated the suggestions for sightseeing, dining and a lovely 1/2 day trip to Howth - by train which stops 300 yards from the hotel - including a remarkable lunch at the renowned King Sitric). We thoroughly enjoyed the sushi hour in the appropriately named restaurant, ICE (our first experience pairing sashimi and Guiness).; drinks in the Lobby Lounge and our numerous excursions to what we came to refer to as ""pub row"", a mere 5 minute walk from the hotel.

As for getting around - we took a taxi from the Dublin airport - cost efficient for five of us at ~€30. The hotel offers complimentary transportation around the city - first come, first served - in a brand spanking new 7 series BMW. The hop on/hop off bus tour is a must. And, for the hearty, I recommend heading off to Trinity College and the Book of Kells on foot, pausing only to scarf a delicious Irish breakfast at Roly's - believe me, you'll walk it off...

Other notable amenities: the Spa, although we did not take advantage of individual services, the workout room was one of the best we've seen; the business center - three workstations, we never had a problem getting online... FYI

Without hesitation I give the Four Seasons Dublin 5 circles (stars? splats?) This property defines the phrase ""exceeds expectations."" And with promotional rates and off-season specials you can enjoy the best of both worlds - limited financial damage and the FS experience.",5,2008,08,13
205,Almost perfect,"We booked 2 roomsin this hotel for 3 nights. The hotel is a truly 5 star hotel in all aspects, except the lack of tea and coffee making in the rooms. That is a pity because it would have made our stay even more enjoyable. After a long day sightseeing it would have been so nice just to relax with a cup of tea before going downstairs to the bar. Even a B&B provides this service!!!! Luckely we always travel with an electric kettle in the car.",4,2008,08,11
205,Wonderful Hotel,"This was a wonderful hotel to stay in.  The service was very personal, but not in your face.  There were some lovely touches, from the upgrade on our arrival, to the doorman having bottles of water on hand for when we returned from a run.  Our room was gorgeous, the gym well-stocked, the sauna was lovely, and food was of a very high standard. Loved this hotel.",5,2008,08,11
205,Really enjoyed our stay,"It was a birthday treat to stay here and I really enjoyed. We treated ourselves to the Romantic Escape package and the late check out facility was great. The atmosphere, food and service in the restuarant was excellent and I would highly recommend it.",5,2008,08,07
205,"Lovely hotel, but a bit mean ?","We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights in June, 2008. I have to say it is a beautiful hotel. Staff were very professional and friendly.

My only gripe is that we had to pay €18 per night just to park our car there, and the bedroom had no facilities for making tea or coffee... not even a complimentary bottle of water.

Considering that we paid €280 per night I thought this was just a little bit mean.",3,2008,06,25
205,Charm & Elegance,"Four Seasons – Dublin
May 16-21, 2008

My wife and I stayed at the Four Seasons – Dublin from May 16th to May 21st 2008.  The hotel and grounds were both beautiful and very well maintained. The lobby reception area included a large very comfortable piano lounge overlooking a lovely back garden.
The room we booked was a Deluxe Double room. When we arrived the room was unfortunately not ready so we dropped our luggage off in the secured lock up and proceeded to spend the next hour or so exploring the area surrounding the hotel. When we arrived back the room was ready and off we went. We were more than pleasantly surprised to arrive and see how spacious and clean the room was.  The washroom was beautiful and included a deep bath tub and a separate shower. Of course the Four Seasons kindly provide designer toiletries, slippers and very soft terrycloth robes.  The bed, duvet and pillows were to die for. All were extremely comfortable and the duvet was changed daily which was a nice touch. When we returned to our room on the first night we experienced what a first class hotel really is. In our room we found a bottle of Bailey’s Irish Cream and two really nice Bailey’s glasses left for us because of the inconvenience of not having our room ready at check-in. Nice touch for sure. 
The mini-bar was well equipped, the TV had many channels including first rate movies and the closets had plenty of hangers and storage space. The hotel offered a free shoe cleaning service. All you had to do was hanging your shoes outside the door in the evening and you’d get them back clean in the morning. The only issue we found with the room was that it didn’t have its own iron and ironing board. On our first night we called down to request an iron only to be told that they were all loaned out at the time. Fortunately a staff member showed us shortly after with one however I thought it was odd that a hotel which offered so many amenities failed to offer a iron and ironing board – oh well honestly no big deal.
The gym was nice and the spa, pool and hot tub were well appointed. The pool area had wonderful padded lounge chairs looking out into a lovely court yard with a fountain.
We enjoyed the vast breakfast the hotel offered before venturing out for a day of sightseeing. The hotel as others have mentioned is approximately 15 minutes away from the city centre. We found it rather easy to take the public transportation to and from the heart of the city back to the hotel. 
While in Dublin we course enjoyed the Temple Bar and Temple Bar district, the Guinness Storehouse (great panoramic view of Dublin from the top level’s Gravity Bar), Grafton Street, golfing at Druids Glen, a trip up the northern coast to Malahide Castle and a wonderful trip to Trinity College. We ate at some fabulous restaurants like Fire and the Mansion House. 
The hotel staff arranged for a car to take us to the airport for our 0700 flight to Barcelona, Spain.

All in all we had a great time at the Four Seasons and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone seeking a wonderful holiday.",5,2008,06,12
205,Up to Four Seasons High Standards,"The Four Seasons Dublin will provide the classic Four Seasons experience. This particular property has quality rooms of a moderate size. One side(the front) of the hotel has street views. The other side(the back) overlooks a courtyard and portions of a horse race track. The dining room was elegant with good service.
Very friendly and helpful staff. We had an excellent experience with the concierge, who guided us to the hotel over the phone as we navigated the Dublin traffic.
The Ballsbridge area of Dublin is upscale. For example, there are a number of embassies nearby.
In planning a stay at this property, I believe the main consideration is the purpose of your visit. This hotel is perfect for the business traveler. For the classic tourist, including travelers with families, you might consider a more central Dublin location.",5,2008,04,26
205,Sour note,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel for the weekend on our wedding anniversary.  Enjoyed the stay and experience very much, however the only sour note was the fact that my wife left some of her jewellery behind in the room after we checked out.  The items were not expensive, but were more of sentimental value. Unfortunately, it was a few hours later before we realised our mistake and after contacting the hotel, they checked the room, but sadly the items were no longer there, despite the fact that the room had not been reallocated to new guests, since the time of our departure. Management were apologetic and we accept the mistake was entirely ours.  We were offered a further complimentary weekend by hotel management, but alas, every time we subsequently contacted the hotel to avail of this offer, they could not accommodate us.  Despite the initial satisfaction with our stay, the experience left us with a sour taste and little ambition to ever visit these premises again. We are regular visitors to Dublin, but have never used this establishment since.",4,2008,04,12
205,Complete comfort,"The Four Seasons Dublin was located in the neighborhood of Ballsbridge.  We enjoyed walking a few blocks to several dining options, including Roly's Bistro, where we had excellent baguettes and a delicious raspberry tart.  Herbert Park is just around the corner from Roly's and is a beautiful place to sit and watch Dubliners play.  The hotel was beautiful, the service was attentive and friendly, and we were very comfortable in our room.  We enjoyed the bed and breakfast rate and were thrilled with our in-room dining experience.  We were driven in to Dublin's city center by a delightful man in the hotel car (complimentary service) and he shared some Dublin history with us and also provided several recommendations as to what to see and do in the city.  We walked back to the hotel from the city center and found the walk long but enjoyable as it took us through several different neighborhoods.  This was an excellent property and no exception to the Four Seasons level of comfort and service.",5,2008,04,05
205,Fantastic,"This is an amazing hotel, it is without doubt the best hotel I have ever stayed in.  Considering what you can pay for some awful hotels in Dublin, this was not too pricey at all.

The room was huge, with a dressing area just off, a ridiculously big bathroom (the size of your average hotel room) and then the loo was seperate to that again.

The service was impeccable.

I will definitely be back here.",5,2008,02,28
205,Classic Four Seasons Experience...,The location here is great and as usual with Four Seasons you will get excellent service across the board.  The staff was extremely accommodating throughout our stay.  Ask the staff for some local restaurant recommendations as there are many within walking distance.,4,2008,02,24
205,gorgeous hotel,"if you want luxury then look no further than this hotel.  From the minute you drive into the premises you are taken care of - you don't have to lift a finger.  Staff are extremely professional and friendly.  The bedrooms are amazing - bathrooms probably the size of other hotels whole bedroom.  Separate bath, shower area and sink area - high end bath products and body lotions.  Beds were extremely comfortable and we got the feeling we were the first to sleep in them.  Room extremely spacious.  the only odd thing was the old fashioned tv's (well not old fashioned, but not the plasma that you get in most hotels now) but the tv worked and we had no complaints.  Mini bar in room was massive but very pricey - the candy was probably 8 times the price in shops.  

Overall the hotel is a bit pricey for lunch but Im sure you are paying for the surrounds and excellent service - fresh flowers everywhere and professional services.  There are two bars - the ice bar, and the regular bar, with a large lounge area.  We preferred the regular bar.  

The breakfasts were amazing - although extremely pricey again (but again you are paying for the excellent service - 32 Euro for full Irish breakfast - compared to probaby 10 in a regular cafe).  However the breakfast we received was fantastic and their potato scallion hash was to die for.  Also, if you order breakfast as room service they come up with a large table, lay it out for you in the room (thats how big the rooms are). 

Overall, although a pricey hotel, you certainly will not be disappointed if you stay here for a special occasion and you probably won't want to leave.",5,2008,02,21
205,Very relaxing - well looked after.,"I can highly recommend this superbly run establishment. They have paid great attention to detail and the staff were certainly professional and courteous.
Cleanliness was also very good and although well established the furnishings were well maintained and very comfortable.",5,2008,02,06
205,Outstanding value - superlative service,"The hotel deserves its top ratings for all aspects. From check-in when they took me directly to the room where the forms were all ready with a quick imprint of the credit card to the outstanding service in the restaurants, the hotel lacks for nothing. Rooms are fairly large sized with bathrooms that feature separate shower stalls and tubs the operation of which was fairly intuitive - not something that is always the case even with expensive hotels. The slight negatives, if one could term them so, are the fact that there is only one elevator bank and if a room is not close to the lifts, it can be a long walk and they still have standard TVs instead of flat screens one would expect in such a high-end establishment.  Room service is outstanding and food was always brought in almost exactly when promised.",5,2008,01,25
205,Best Hotel in Dublin,"Just returned from a week end in FS Dublin and I could say this a lovely hotel to stay. It is located in a nice suburb of the city (actually we were not amazed by Dublin - nevertheless people are very friendly and smiley...) and all areas plus rooms are impressive, spotlessly clean and comfortable . Service is excellent (as normally in FS) slightly less than experienced in other FS hotels...  In case you would like to have fine dinning please avoid Seasons. It is expensive and not really good. Desserts are not good in general in this hotel (not in the restaurants neither during Hight Tea). We tried  Thornton's restaurant which was expensive  but the food was outstanding. Painting all around this property are fantastic....",4,2008,01,21
205,wow,"ive stayed here a couple of times, and the most recent was for my wedding anniversary. lovely superior room. they knew it was our anniversary, and there was a plate of homemade cookies in the room, with ""HAPPY ANNIVERSARY"" written in chocolate on the plate- nice touch. excellant service from we walked in to the hotel from the doorman, the porter, resturant staff. it is pricey, but you really get what you pay for.",5,2008,01,16
205,Great! (but a tad pricey),"An automatic choice given our view that a FS Hotel cannot be beaten for service and quality. This did not fail on both counts....although parking was a little tricky - didn't tell us that valet parking was available (we should have guessed!).
Lovely deluxe room - questionable view (we weren't bothered) and great bathroom. We did have to ring down for slippers and for a nail file, but these arrived within 5-minutes of request - nothing too much trouble. Had a great meal in the Cafe.
Breakfast was a little disapointing - chose room service. Although nothing wrong with the breakfast, it just didn't hit the spot.
All in all, if price wasn't an issue we'd stop at the FS at every available opportunity!",5,2008,01,15
205,Great Dublin Hotel,"As always, the Four Seasons delivers the quality and service you would expect from this chain.

The suite we had was huge, with a separate bedroom, large bathroom, sofa bed, work table and bar.  Quality is on par with other five-star hotels we've stayed at.  The staff was nice and met our expectations.

The only downside, as mentioned many times here, is the proximity to city centre.  If you are visiting Dublin to tour the sights, expect a 10-20 minute cab ride into town.",4,2008,01,15
205,Always Perfect!!,"My boyfriend and I stay here whenever we have a special occasion to celebrate eg anniversary,birthday. We both absolutely love the Four Seasons!! The reception area is gorgeous and the rooms are luxurious.. especially the deep soaking tub!!! The inclusive full irish breakfast really sets you up for the day and the staff in the restaurant are extremely friendly and helpful! you feel really looked after! The swimming pool and spa area is a real treat in the morning! The bar is okay but lacks atmosphere and the notion of good auld irish craic cannot be found here!! The only negative thing that we have experienced every time we stay here is that a certain doorman is extremely arrogant towards us and in my opinion this is solely because we dont pull up in a bentley!! I get a real sense of snobbery when pulling up outside the hotel and the doorman in question,who I will not name, merely looks at us as if we are lost and could not possibly be staying in this hotel!! This really dissappointed my boyfriend and I as this hotel is not cheap and is a special getaway for us! Apart from this member of staff, our stay at the four seasons has been absolutely brilliant and I will definetly be returning in the near future!",5,2008,01,10
205,Always Amazing,"As usual, The Four Seasons is just an amazing place.  Every time I come here, the staff is so friendly and accommodating.  The rooms are extremely comfortable, and the lobby bars are extremely inviting.  Though this hotel is a few minutes drive from city centre, it is definitely worth the minor inconvenience.  There is a bus stop just in front of the hotel which makes it very cheap to get around the town...not to mention extremely efficient.  Also, the Ballsbridge area is an interesting place to explore.  If you need a great place to eat, Rolly's Bistro is probably the best meal you will have in Ireland.  And if you want to feel cool, just treat yourself to a cocktail in the hotel bar ICE.",5,2008,01,03
205,Nice but stodgy hotel,"My company stayed here for a conference.  It is a lovely hotel, well-run, with friendly, good service.  The rooms are pretty large, the common areas are well-kept up, and the food for the most part was quite good.  A very pleasant experience, but the place does feel very stuffy, compared to the more recently remodeled hotels in town.  It is a bit of schlep into town, even though it's only a 25 minute walk or so.  Taxi's run about $15 each way, which adds up if you go into town twice a day.",5,2007,12,10
205,Gorgeous Hotel,"Just got back from a 2 night stay at the Four Seasons. What a fantastic hotel. I was very impressed. The staff were friendly, the rooms were very large and luxurious and the bathrooms too.

Had breakfast there one morning and although it was very expensive it was a great experience. 

This is probably the most beautiful hotel that I've ever stayed in. I'm just sad I didn't get to spend longer exploring the hotel as I was in Dublin on business and hardly got to spend time in this lovely hotel.

Only downside was that there was no kettle/coffee machine in my room. And no trouser-press or iron either.

But the beautiful surroundings within this building by far made up for this.

I would definitely recommend a stay here.",5,2007,12,06
205,Unbelievable!!,"Stayed 2 nights at the Four Seasons on business.  At the rate that our company received, it was an unbelievable value.  The hotel is more luxurious than any other that I have stayed at, with very large rooms, an enormous bathroom, robes, and all of the Four Seasons amenities, down to the L'Occitance bath products.  Of special note was a beautiful new, huge fitness room and a terrific restaurant with a very nice lunch and dinner selection.

I only hope that I will be going back to Dublin soon, so that I can visit the Four Seasons again!",5,2007,12,02
205,"Really great hotel, both for business and pleasure","I stayed at the Four Seasons for a business conference, but I had to take my four-month old baby with me. I had a fabulous stay. the conference facilities are really very good, good sized rooms with natural light in most, good catering, excellent service. The hotel provided a lovely baby sitter for my son, she went out of her way for him and even bought him a little gift at the end. There is even a baby changing table with nappies (different sizes provided!) in the ladies' bathroom in the lobby, which is something I haven't seen anywhere else.
It didn't hurt that I had the most massive suite I ever stayed in... A family of 6 could have stayed there without any problem.",5,2007,11,16
205,The best in Dublin,"We've stayed in a few places in Dublin (inc. The Conrad and The Merrion) and quite simply The Four Seasons is head and shoulders above them all. And actually both the Conrad and Merrion are excpetional themselves. 

The Four Seasons is just pure quality - staff, rooms, food, spa - it's just 5 star+ all the way.

Only minor downside is location which means a 10 minute taxi ride to the city centre.",5,2007,11,07
205,Hotel for All Seasons,"After rejecting a trip to London as a matter of principle ($1600/night for a non-suite in Hyde Park, based on Pound/Dollar conversion), I happened to check the Four Seasons web site for promotions and found a 3-night, 4th free in Dublin.  This worked out to roughly 1650 Euro for a 4-night stay for a two-room suite.  

(Apparently breakfast was included in the promotion, but I only learned this upon checking out.  This is the second time I've experienced this phenomenon this summer.   There may be a new don't-ask-don't-tell policy making the rounds, much like the $10/sauna use now cheapening many luxury brand hotels.  Note to self: always ask if there are any amenities included at time of check-in.  Oversight cost me about $200, but I shouldn't have had to ask.)

4S Dublin is located southeast of downtown, while the airport is well north.  Taxis are plentiful and run about 40 euro for the ride, which was pleasant.  Cabs themselves run from E-class Mercedes to undersized Toyotas, but the taxi line (ok, queue) was well-managed and brief.  Bus service is cheaper, but cattle-callish.  A private car-service company, Pro Motor Cars, operates out of Four Seasons, and you can arrange personal pickup for double the cost of a cab.

The hotel was built in 2001, roughly five floors of rooms (private 4S residences occupy at least the top floor; Dublin doesn't really have high-rise buildings, yet.)  Place is immaculate, but rapidly approaching the need for makeover mentioned in earlier posts.  Sculptures from J. Seward Johnson decorate the parking area, and the ambience upon arrival is instantly soothing.

We arrived at 10:00 AM, with a projected 3PM check-in.  We thought we'd leave bags and walk downtown for some coffee.  Not necessary:  a suite was available, just finishing up house keeping, if we would be so kind as to have some coffee in the reading room for a few minutes.  Common areas are indeed opulent in 4S tradition, and this is a business meeting destination, so expect to see suits and dresses in these areas.  If you feel self-conscious wearing jeans and a t-shirt surrounded by better-mannered locals, perhaps you'll pack a tad more carefully (and it's colder, so bring sweaters, jackets, etc., even on Labor Day).  If you're like most Americans, however, you'll flop down and start gabbing on your cell phone, oblivious to the quiet conversations of your neighbors.

The hotel is known for meetings and weddings, and our weekend was no exception.  The main areas had a bridal party on Saturday, but it was easily handled by the number of rooms and attentive staff.

Our suite was clean, comfortable, and ample.  The bathroom had only a single basin, but closet space was larger than expected (a full-blown walk-in with racks and storage bins.)  Housekeepers obsessively kept every towel and toiletries refreshed.  Twice a day we would return to find fresh ice in the bucket.  Iron and board were not stocked, but one phone call remedied the omission.

The spa is limited.  An advance call to set up treatments was a study in ""no.""  The lap pool, like so many hotel lap pools, has in fact become a splash ground for kids.  The whirlpool is surprisingly cool (maybe 80, hardly a hot tub experience.)  The steam and sauna rooms are well-maintained, as are the locker areas.

Concierge service is efficient and courteous, what one would expect from 4S.  This includes reservations, car service, even getting security to resolve minor problems.  The best buy is the courtesy car to downtown (best buy, as in, free).  The two drivers are fine professionals who know every inch of the city, and they'll drop you where you like after a short ride in the hotel's Jaguar.

We tried walking downtown the first day.  Frommer's and front desk staff suggested it was an easy 15-minute stroll.  The reality is more like a 30-minute power walk.  Bring good hiking shoes.  Note well:  there is a DART station one block from the hotel which drops you behind Trinity College for about $2 (roughly $10 for a day-pass).  It's more comfortable than the myriad busses, and it can get you to shore towns north and south of the city for excursions in less than an hour.

Walking downtown, we saw the hotel alternatives around St. Stephen's Green and near Grafton Street.  There is your range of tres chic and grande dames to choose from.  They are more convenient to the city centre.  But at the end of the day, Four Seasons brings consistency, reliability, and an understated professionalism all too often lacking at home and abroad.  I had some niggling complaints, but they don't bear mention here (except perhaps the poor service and food quality at breakfast).  Value is a relative concept.  Dollars are not competing well against the Euro these days, so it's hard to say 4S represents a great value in Dublin.  But compared to what else is available in the EU, this might be Europe's best-kept secret.

205,Just perfect,"The 3 night stay was everything you would wish for a relaxed and romantic weekend getaway - Large and well furnited room, very friendly service, nice in-door pool and spa. The hotel is located in a quit area just outside the city centre. We very muched enjoyed the elegant yet relaxed atmosphere in the hotel. Loved the beautiful lobby lounge and the breakfast in the Seasons restaurant was excellent.

205,Hard to beat,"Hard to beat the Four Seasons chain. Dublin one very good, though getting a little tired around the edges. Rooms are great. loads of room, with huge bathrooms. restaurant fine, though only had breakfast. service slightly patchy, and found it very pricey for what it was. staff generally are friendly and professional, which is not as common as it used to be in Ireland. don't bother with the Ice Bar, a dreadful wart on what is otherwise a great hotel. location fine if you know Dublin. can walk to city centre in under 30mins. taxi's difficult to get from the hotel at peak times (morning check out, and then aroun 7-8pm at night). great spot overall.
",4,2007,08,02
205,Great hotel,"Spent 4 nights here with my wife and 12-year old son in July.  The weather was awful but the hotel was incredible.  Great service throughout.  The restaurant was superb.  Everyone was friendly and helpful.  We frequently stay at the Four Seasons around the world and this one met our expectations.  This is the only hotel chain in the world which gets it right most of the time and when they make a mistake, they correct it.  The only time we don't stay at the Four Seasons is when there isn't one where we are going.   They make children feel happy that they are staying with them and that is very important.
",5,2007,07,27
205,Top Class - extremely child friendly,"We stayed in this hotel a number of times with and without children. We have never been let down and will definately return. We recently tried another five star dublin hotel (the Merrion) and there was no comparrison.  We did find the Seasons restaurant a little bit dissapointing but everything else was top class.

205,Four Seasons delivers!,"Lovely hotel and staff.  A nice change from the city centre.  Encountered a problem with the heating system in our room, and were promptly relocated.  Oppulent common rooms, and attention to detail everywhere!  Hans, the doorman is magnificent and always has a smile on his face!  A nice walk surrounds the Four Seasons, and thoroughly enjoyed a meal at Roly's Bistro.  This truly is a lovely hotel with an ever-accommodating staff!
",5,2007,07,11
205,Absolutely wonderfull!,"We stayed here for two nights in June with our son ( 10 years of age). The hotel is absolutely wonderfull. Very nice hotelstaff, and spotlessly clean. We stayed in a deluxe room with a view of the courtyard. The room was very nicely decorated with a very complete but most of all massive bathroom ( especially loved the magnificent bathtub!!!) When we arrived they already knew our names and when we got up to our room, my son was pleasantly suprised with a huge chocolate chip cookie with his name on it. He also loved the mini sized bathrobe :) When our son asked the concierge for a toystore in Dublin  he patiently explained to him on a map were he should take us. After he did that my son asked for a taxi and he said that  he had an better idea. Next thing we knew the hotel Jaquar drove up with a lovely man named Ron as  Chauffeur and brought us to the game store in the city centre.  Allong the drive, Ron gave us a private tour through Dublin , explaining all the highlights we passed. As you can imagine this exceeded our higest expectations. But even without this highlight it tops every 5 star hotel we've ever been to!
I have to say that the four season's even tops the Fairmont hotels, which I thought were the best ever... 

It is slightly expensive I guess, but I think its not ""over""priced though. To us it was worth every penny and would surely book other resorts from this chain!

205,Wonderful hotel - THE place to stay in Dublin,"Just had the most wonderful stay at the Four Seasons Dublin. Check in was swift, polite and friendly and we were delighted to discover, when shown  to our room, that we had been upgraded to a suite! This sort of thing rarely happens to someone like me, so we were over the moon. The room was spotless, with a huge lounge, bedroom, dressing room, bathroom and seperate toilet with quality fittings throughout. In fact so taken was i by the bathroom, most in particular the deep soaking bath, that i got my tape measure out and started to plan my own bathroom with similar fittings and layout! 
I have stayed at a fair few Four Seasons over the years, and although it doesnt beat the Four Seasons in Chang Mai (it has to be the best hotel in the world!), it definitely comes a close second.
",5,2007,05,07
205,Best of the Best!!!!!!,"The Four Seasons in Dublin is definitely one of the nicest hotels in the city.  It is first class all the way.  Rooms were perfect, service was extraordinary, atmosphere was incredible.  I would stay there again in a second.  Just keep in mind, it is not cheap.  The extras are very expensive as well (i.e. room service, laundry, in room bar, etc...).  You only live once!
",5,2007,04,26
205,Amazing discreet service,"My five year son ranks the Four Seasons Dublin as his favourite hotel ( I won't bore you with his travel experiences but they involve many lovely hotels). We have stayed about six times ( we are Irish but live in the States so are home frequently). It is absolute luxury but not in an over the top way. The staff are amazing - the doormen always (much to our amazement) greet our chidren by name as we get out of our rental car to check in and then they have their own VIP check-in!! The staff are so well trained and welcoming. It is charming, well located in one of Dublin's most attractive suburbs and in my opinion the best hotel in Dublin.

205,Just Perfect,"I just stayed at the Four Seasons in Dublin for 5 nights and have nothing but wonderful things to say about the hotel and the staff.  The room was very pleasant and the bed was incredibly comfortable.  The bathroom was huge.  The room was spotless. The bath products were
pleasant. The slippers (which you must request from houskeeping) are lovely.

The staff at the hotel is fantastic. Everyone at the concierge/
bellman desk were wonderful. They all knew me by name, and were very helpful with everything I needed. Patrick, the driver, was also very pleasant, and informative.

While the hotel is about 10 - 15 minutes from the main downtown area, it is a lovely place to come home to, and is very quiet. The location was never a problem.

The bars and restaurant were very pleasant and breakfast was nice.  

The fitness center was also great. The equiptment was nice and the little extras, like Evian water and headphones, were appreciated.

This hotel is a greast place to relax. I returned home feeling wonderful.",5,2007,03,12
205,"High Expectations,mostly met","Beautiful room, very good size and décor beautiful Bathroom was fab with lovely products and lots of towels, very deep bath and separate shower. Had everything one needs for a very pleasant stay. Very peaceful, literally did not hear a pin drop while we were there. Paper outside door when we woke up was very welcome and set the mood for a nice leisurely day.  Bed very comfortable.
Breakfast was superb, the most beautiful arrangement of fruit on offer I’ve ever seen in any hotel and that was just the tip of the iceberg. Staff were very courteous. 
Pool very quiet when I was there and perfect for relaxing. Lots of towels provided.
Check out was pleasant and efficient. Location excellent for Dublin.
However my expectations were high and would point out the following:
I had booked a Superior room and view was of a neighbouring business yard, their skip etc. 
Reception on TV was not clear and remote control buttons were very difficult to press, so much so I didn’t bother with it.
No complementary drinking water in room and at €7 per small bottle from the mini bar, I was inclined to go for something stronger!
No tea coffee making facilities, which I always like to see. 
Robes provided but a little on the skimpy side and no slippers although I did get a pair at the leisure centre, which I took back to my room.
Had ordered a cot for room, did not supply any blankets for baby so remember to bring your own if required. 
Internet could be accessed via the TV but at a cost of €20.  I have not seen this being charged for in any hotel before.

205,what a wonderful hotel,"Wow I loved the four seasons they gave us first class service. Me and my husband booked the romance package and we got dinner and breakfast included there was also a bottle of champagne chocolate covered strawberries  and some chocolates. They had the room laid out beautiful. I would stay here again.

205,Dublin's best,"Stayed here again with my family recently. This is the fourth or fifth time to stay here and will be back. Everything about the hotel is great. Rooms beautiful, service great, best breakfast ever experienced. Leisure facilities very nice. Location is good but not city centre. Only a short taxi ride out. Merrion hotel offers best city centre option.
",5,2006,12,21
205,Beautiful hotel; flawless service,"Just stayed at the Dublin Four Seasons one night last week during  a quick trip to Dublin.  As noted in other reviews, the room was beautifully decorated and the lobby/common areas were also lovely.  Front desk staff and concierge were impeccably professional, knowledgeable and helpful.  Hotel is somewhat inconvenient for walking to the City Center (maybe 2 miles away) which is the only potential downside (Merrion Hotel is also very nice and a much easier walk) but there are several restaurants just down the street and within walking distance if you're looking to eat somewhere other than the hotel and get some exercise at the same time.  I wasn't in the room much and so the view did not matter, but I was on the first floor and the view out the window was of a roof.  Other rooms face more attractive surroundings, and requesting one of these rooms for a longer stay would probably be worthwhile.   I'd definitely stay here again and can't imagine there are nicer accommodations in Dublin.
",5,2006,11,13
205,Not worth the money,"An OK hotel - but we spent 50 euro on two cups of coffee on a Sunday evening. This included one scone between us. Beautifully served but rather overpriced.

205,Four Seasons-Always impressive,"From the moment you enter the gates, this hotel sets out to impress you beyond belief. Drive up, abandon your car to the valet parking people. Before you are properly out of the car, the porter is already loading your bags onto the trolley. They will sneak a quick look at your luggage tags just to make sure they can address you by name.

Check-in is a breeze. They keep good records of your previous stays and will ask e.g. how your children are if you've been there before wth your kids. A tip for those bringing kids. Tell the hotel in advance and they may have a nice surprise awaiting them. Our guys got complimentary t-shirts, caps and hugh chocolate chip cookies with their names in chocolate icing on them! Our son got a comic book and some complementary drinks on another visit.

Very impressive collection of contemporary Irish art in the lobby and bar area. Rooms are a good size, even the basic ones, but if you can strech to it go for a superior suite. Outstanding  furnishings and very comfortable beds. Speakman showers are excellent. Very good toiletries by L'occitane and Bvlgari in the larger suites. Free shoe shine if you remember to put your shoes outside the door at night. Staff are simply outstanding!! Very attentive and observant. You'll never have to wait more than a few seconds before a staff member spots that you want their attention. Easily the best hotel in Europe!! GM very attentive. Typically sends a note and some fruit for returning guests.
",5,2006,11,02
205,Doesn't get better than this!,"We recently traveled all over Ireland and enjoyed 7 different hotels during our stay.  We decided to stay at the Four Seasons for our final night stay.  We we're hesitant at first do to the price which was slightly higher than the Westin which we stayed on upon our arrival.  I can't tell you enough how ""worth"" the Four Seasons was.  The service was beyond belief,  although we couldn't get into the fine dining resturant on the premisses, they gave us another option within brief walking distance.  We had trouble getting our rental car back to the agency, they took care of it.  In our final moments before leaving one of our suit cases had a zipper that broke, they helped us fix it.  Basically anything they could do to make the stay a great one...and it was.  I have traveled all over the world and stayed in hundreds of hotel rooms and suits but this was unbeatable.  Treat yourself sometime and experience it.  It was worth it.  If you go to Dublin, I would recommend getting a taxi however.  It is a challenge to find!  
- Be good!
",5,2006,10,26
205,Dublin Luxury,"We had booked into another hotel in Dublin, but upon arriving at the hotel and being displeased with the upkeep of a suposedly 5 star property, we immediately left and went to the Four Seasons.  One always expects the best from the Four Seasons, but I must say everything was perfect.  The service was immpecable and friendly, the room was huge and luxurious, the pool was very nice, and they even arranged a horse back riding afternoon that was the highlight of our stay.
The Four Seasons will always be our home when we return to Dublin.
",5,2006,10,25
205,The Best!,"Stayed four nights in Oct........For the splurge, there's no better place to stay!  Terrific staff, dining and room.  The Ballsbridge area (classy area, a few miles out ) is fabulous for easy public transport into town (DART or bus), and great places to eat, all within walking distance!  Very glad we didn't stay @ the Clarence in town....Dublin is a very busy and late-night noisy, place to stay.  
Have stayed @ many Four Seasons...this is @ the top!

We can't wait to return soon and completly relax.

205,Tops In Dublin,"My family and I stayed at the Four Seasons in Dublin for one night in July 2006. This was the second year in a row that we stayed here. Like last year we booked an executive suite. The hotel and its staff lived up to the Four Seasons reputation. Naturally they remembered us and welcomed us back with snacks waiting in our suite when we arrived along with a note from the manager. The suite was total luxury:  beautiful linens on the bed, L'Occitane toiletries in the bathroom, and space galore. Naturally, we had dinner in the Cafe, a restaurant that doesn't accept reservations, but if you mention a time you'd like to eat, they will call you in your suite and let you know that a table is available. I would make two suggestions to the hotel. First, if you're paying over 500Euro a night, why would you want to charge a guest another 20 Euro for wireless internet? Secondly, time to take out those old tv's and put in plasmas!
",5,2006,08,01
205,Loved the Four Seasons - but.........,"We visited the Four Seasons for two nights in July. it was our first visit to Dublin. The check in experience was smooth, the staff were pleasant and aware we were coming, despite the fact we had booked through an agency. The public areas are very upmarket. There are two bars - the Ice Bar and the main hotel bar. The Ice Bar is very modern - this is the place to be seen in Dublin on a Friday and Saturday night apparently.  We were told that just weeks before, Liam Neeson had stayed at the hotel, followed by Pam Anderson a few days later. So this is the hotel to stay in if you fancy a bit of celeb spotting (although we didn't see anyone famous when we were there unfortunately!).

Everything is very comfortable in the hotel. With the exception of the Ice Bar which is very modern, the decor is oldy worldy - it's a bit like staying at your ultra posh granny's mansion for the weekend! The staff are wonderful and just can't do enough for you. The spa is just to die for - words cannot describe how lovely an afternoon I whiled away in there!! The room we had was lovely and blissfully quiet. I was delighted to be out of the vicinity of town once I visited and realised just how big and noisy Dubin is!!

We had booked bed and breakfast. This was delicious and the choice was plentiful. As well as the standard hot and cold breakfast fare that is offered in hotels, there was also a separate menu including such delights as Eggs Benedict etc. We found this filled us up until dinner time. 

The hotel offer a courtesy car into town. This is not a favour offered to the more well off guests - it is something that is available to all guests (although the staff don't exactly shout about it). The hotel information book in your room clearly states this. I did notice though that we had to prompt the staff a couple of times to get them to organise it for us as they did seem keener to phone us a taxi sometimes!!  

So, there is much to say which is positive about the Four Seasons - and so why have I only given it 4 stars? Well, whilst the staff and the hotel environment were just wonderful,  unfortunately, there are some things which just aren't right. Althugh the price of a drink in the hotel bar is reasonable (ish), the price of other extras is just too high. By that I mean room service and other services such as ironing. There is no tea and coffee making facilities, so expect to pay 10 Euros for a pot of tea for two - without biscuits!

As far Dublin....well, for me, it is no longer a visit to Ireland, but more a visit to a European city. I found it quite hard to find any Dubliners in Dublin! It is almost exclusively foreign tourists/students/staff.  If you are seeking a true Irish holiday, I think Galway (staying at the G hotel) might be a better option. Dublin is fun, but you have to look hard to find Irishy fun. 

I had a great stay at the Four Seasons. The staff were wonderful, the hotel envionment was glorious and the staff were extremely pleasant. I would stay at a Four Seasons again, but I'll be keeping my eye on the cost of those ""extras"".

I hope you find this helpful.
",4,2006,07,18
205,Lovely Hotel,"As usual the Four Seasons sets the standard of comparison for hotels. Room great, amenities great, public spaces great, staff terrific and helpful. The Irish breakfast was excellent. Our only complaint was that the dinners we had there were nondescript. The hotel did offer one peculiarity I've never run into before - free or costly Internet access. If you used the access in the room, it cost Euros 22 for 24 hours. On the other hand, if you used the business center computer or your laptop with wi-fi, it was free.

The hotel location is in the embassy district, about two miles from downtown. Taxis, along with everything else in Dublin, are expensive. Public transportation via bus or train is readily available within one block of the hotel.

Although the hotel experience at the Four Seasons was top notch, Dublin itself left us cold. For our interests, the city offered little. Museums are not world class, the best shopping area is mediocre,  and there are not many sights. The people were very nice and the food was good. But certainly not a place for us to return to. Had we had a better understanding of what there was, we would not have gone to begin with.
",5,2006,07,08
205,Opulent but uptight,"There is no doubt that the decor is pleasant and of good quality,  room (deluxe)  large, with sizeable ensuite.  However, the staff leave something to be desired.  There is an art in welcoming visitors to a five star establishment, but unfortunately the Four Seasons  staff are not well-practised in this.  They come across as uncomfortable, and over-anxious to please.  Having said that, they are efficient, but just too 'in your face'.  

The food (room service for dinner and breakfast) was disappointing, of  poor quality and very bad value for money.

The bath products were excellent, and the place was spotless, with excellent air conditioning.  Soundproofing was perfect (despite two concerts taking place nearly not a sound could be heard).

Better value and a warmer welcome to be had at Bewleys Hotel across the road.

205,Dublin At Its Finest,"My wife and I recently returned from a vacation in Ireland that included a two night stay at the Four Seasons Dublin.  This hotel is excellent, I wish we could have spent more time there.  Upon arrival we were warmly greeted by the staff and brought to check-in where they informed us that our room had been upgraded.  This was a nice surprise that was only the start of our wonderful experience at the hotel.  The lobby was beautiful and the hotel was nicely decorated and clean throughout.  Our premier room was very large and clean, and turndown service was provded twice daily.  We had dinner in The Cafe Restaurant and breakfast in the Seasons Restaurant.  The food was excellent and the wait staff was as good as it gets.  We also spent some time in the Ice Bar, which was great.  The atmosphere was perfect and the staff was exceptional.  The drinks are expensive, but it was a very nice place to relax.  We also took advantage of the business center, which is a private area with a few computers with internet access that guests are free to use at their leisure.  They also provide printing, faxing and copying.  We had a wonderful experience at the Four Seasons Dublin.  The location of the hotel is also nice, its far enough removed from the busy downtown area to be away from all the hustle and bustle, but still provides easy access to all the major attractions. The entire staff was first class all the way, always polite and willing to help. They made our stay a truly memorable one.  If you are in Dublin this is definitely the place to stay.

205,The best hotel in Dublin,"My wife, our two kids and I stayed here for a weekend in a deluxe suite. As usual the children were made very welcome with cookies in the room and a digital photograph of them was taken and left up in our room later. Since I hadn't originally planned to take the kids I had booked a romantic package with chocolates, champagne and evening meal included. I called the hotel only two hours before leaving to inform them our two children would be coming. The Hotel said this would be no problem and offered to change the package to a bed and breakfast deal at a very good rate. I declined this and the romantic package was very good (even with the kids). We all had a very nice meal in the main restaurant that evening. Service and food were both excellent. The next morning we went down to the lobby and I ordered a taxi to take us all to Dublin city centre. Instead the Hotel offered to take us by their chauffeur driven courtesy car ( a very plush jaguar) for no charge due to lack of taxis  . It is this kind of service that makes the Four Seasons stand out from the other 5-star hotels in Dublin. 
           The room was immaculate and passed my wife's exacting standards!   Concierge service was fantastic. Once again we could not fault this hotel! We have already booked a Christmas break.
",5,2006,05,23
205,Great hotel for children and adults!,"We stayed at the hotel with our 2 year old active son, and all staff treated us kindly; always remaining helpful and very sweet.
Breakfast served in our room was beautiful and delicious, and both rooms (we stayed at the hotel on 2 separate occasions aduring our vacation) we had were equally nice-very clean and fresh-smelling with great bathrooms and toiletries. 
The hotel really knows how to treat children!  They take digital pictures of all child guests and treat them to a cookie in room upon check-in.
We have taken our son to Spain, Italy, and all around the US and heve never stayed at a hotel that handles families this well.
We loved the lounge with the piano, and the Ice bar.
If one can afford it, this should be the only place to stay in Dublin.
",5,2006,04,19
205,Disappointing!,"It is with regret that I write this report!  I have just returned from a weekend in the Four Seasons and I was very very disappointed.  Anytime I have stayed in this hotel I have loved it, but unfortunately we didnt this time, and there was eight of us who regularly use this hotel and the concensus is that we wont be back.  We could not fault the reception, concierge nor the bar staff in the Ice Wharf but the staff in the restaurant were very, very disappointing. The service did not reflect the price!  When we entered the restaurant, we gave our name and our details, the hostess greeted us and then proceeded to bring another group of people to their table, they arrived after us!  There was no apology, explanation or acknowledgement, it was just very bad manners!  Some of us could not eat our starter as rubber prawns would not be our cup of tea!, this was not even questioned!    The menu was very limited.  I was really annoyed as it was a special occasion and I thought we'd chosen a special place, not so!  The rooms in the hotel do need restyling.  Its a pity cause our last visit was great.

205,The best hotel in Dublin,"We used to live in Dublin and are very familiar with all the city hotels. The Four Seasons is Dublin's only true 5 star hotel. The cleanliness, atmosphere, facilities and food are faultless. 
If I had to make one complaint, the room decor, whilst very comfortable, is slightly chintzy. I agree with previous reviewers who suggested a more comtemporary style. However, above all else, the service better than any we've experience anywhere around the world (including Asia).
There is no choice, this is the only place to stay in Dublin. It may be expensive but it represents excellent value for money.
",5,2006,02,03
205,Lovely Hotel,"Lovely hotel with all the personal touches one would expect of a five star hotel.  I didn´t particularly like the decor in the room - a little too flowery for me and as I was comparing this to the Four Seasons in Canary Wharf, I was a little disappointed.

205,Nirvana in Dublin,"Our UK trips always start with a stay in Dublin in the beginning and on the return before going back to the USA.
After a long week of go-go-go in the UK, we decided to do our one night stop over in Dublin at the Four Seasons. Our Four Seasons Sydney and San Diego experience convinced us to try the Dublin Four Seasons. No regrets except we wanted to stay longer...much longer.  'Nirvana' best describes the Dublin FS. Once you enter, you know you've arrived! The guest rooms are a delight to the body and mind. Furthermore, the spa is a must! The food is excellent. Hats off to the chef and his staff for his unique version of 'chicken soup' -a true signature dish that looked as good as it tasted. And that was just a starter.  
The staff and management are to be complimented - personalized service at its best.
We'll be back in May 2006 to do it all over again!
This time - my wife and I will start our UK trip with Four Seasons Dublin and end it with them.

205,The Best Hotel in Dublin....?,"Well given this is the ONLY place we have ever stayed in Dublin, l wouldn't even bother trying anywhere else....as this place is just perfect. The room was great...plenty of room, the bathroom was large with a separate toilet which is always a nice touch. Staff are friendly and helpful, and the meals in the 2 dining rooms was just beautiful. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin even if it is a tad on the expensive side.

205,Fantastic for the family,"We stayed at the Four Seasons Dublin this past August.
My thoughts:
Fantastic hotel and staff. We paid a lot for the service, and we got it. My three year old son loved the room/suite - it was huge. ""Hans"" made sure there were milk and cookies every night awaiting our return. Whatever request we had, they took care of it. Also, the concierge staff did a great job of helping us plan our driving tours, as we found that road signs are almost non-existant once you leave dublin.
The food was good, although we only ate breakfast at the hotel (it was included in the rate).
The hotel is not in the center of Dublin, but that was OK with us. It's all of a 5 minute cab ride to most sights, and a walk would be possible without children.
One negative, though: The hotel is next to a local concert venue. On our last night there, Iron Maiden had a show that was easilt heard - and almost seen - from our room. It was a complete madhouse surrounding the hotel for a few hours before and after...Needless to say, it was rather noisy that night. I would not have mind 15 years ago (when  I actually went to Iron Maiden concerts), but it was a bit much for the three year to handle.
If we return to Dublin, we will stay there again.

205,"Nice hotel, minor service problems","My husband I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in early November, 2005. It is exactly what you would expect from a Four Seasons: beautifully decorated public spaces, a gracious staff and nice sleeping rooms with great beds. Our bathroom was clean and modern, with ample counter space for toiletries. We ate two breakfasts in the hotel and found the a la carte entrees to be well-prepared, but service was a little slow. There was also a breakfast buffet which had meats, cheeses, cereals, yogurts and fresh fruit. We had a problem when we asked the concierge to arrange tickets and transportation to a concert. We were told the seats were pre-assigned and that we needed to be at the venue by 6:45 p.m. We rushed through our dinner only to learn that the concert didn't start until 8 p.m., and what was worse, when we got there we learned our seats were in a section of ""festival seating"". The upshot of this screw-up was that we paid for a private car and driver for several hours longer than we really needed to, and what could have been a very nice dinner was instead, a ""hurry up and eat"" situation because of the mis-information we received from the concierge. We also paid a lot of money for some very poor concert seats. We are chalking this up to a simple mistake or misunderstanding and not holding it against the hotel but it does suggest a lack of attention to detail on the part of the concierge. The only other minor criticism I have is the location of the hotel. We had to take cabs everywhere we wanted to go, which gets old. I think if I were going to Dublin again I might consider a hotel that is more centrally located, though it would be hard to give up the luxurious atmosphere which this hotel exudes.",5,2005,11,22
205,Excellent,"A very good Four Seasons (they tend to copy concepts across hotels, but this one really does most things right).

Rooms are luxurious and in typical Four Seasons style.  Food is of high quality (we had dinner at the Café and Seasons, afternoon tea in the lounge, excellent breakfast buffet + à la carte). The best smoked wild salmon ever. Very good and elegant spa (some fitness equipment slightly dated).

Service for breakfast was poor most days (something I have experienced at several Four Seasons): long waiting times for food ordered à la carte, junior  waiting staff. Turndown service is inconsistent and, as in other Four Seasons, not elaborate: no bottle of water, chocolate, etc. 

Superior concierge and doorman. One great feature is a complimentary Jaguar to bring the guests to the centre of Dublin, something I have never seen at any hotel.

The atmosphere is typical of Four Seasons: beautiful floral arrangements, live music, candles lit in the evening, a mix of tourists and locals (clearly a place to be seen in Dublin, top-level corporate events were held at the hotel while we were there).     

This was my first time in Dublin, but it is hard to believe that other hotels can do better than Four Seasons (with some minor points to improve).
",5,2005,09,23
205,One of the best Four Seasons Anywhere,"We spent four nights at this hotel in mid-June and have stayed at a number of Four Seasons Hotels before (New York, Phil, Los Angeles). Dublin is as good or better than the others both from a facility and staff perspective.  The overall property was top notch, the staff was extremely friendly and the gym was excellent.

Not much more to say, we will only stay here when next in Dublin.
",5,2005,08,01
205,Best hotel I've ever stayed in by far,"I was working in Dublin and lived weekdays for a month at the Four Seasons.  Apart from the fact that it's reasonably expensive, I couldn't find a bad word to say.  The doormen  and concierge knew everyone's names - I never could work out how they remembered them all.  The staff were incredibly friendly and efficient.  Nothing was too much trouble.  As I wasn't keen to pay the 5euro cost for morning coffee in the room, they were happy to supply a kettle and tea/coffee to the room - though this isn't standard and has to be asked for.  Friends of mine were provided with sterilising equipment and other baby bits and pieces - all free of charge.  The pool and jacuzzi are just the ticket after a long day at work.  The rooms were always spacious and spotlessly clean, with great bathrooms and walk in showers.  The beds are absolutley fabulous - massive and extremely comfortable - I was always disappointed that I had to spend long days in the office and couldn't lounge about at the hotel all day.  Breakfast was always great - plentiful choice.  I had a fantastic meal in the restaurant one evening - belgian white chocolate soufflet to die for!  Finances meant that I spent most other evenings in the more reasonable bistrot or out in local restaurants.  Oh to be rich and stay in places like this all the time!
",5,2005,08,01
205,Wonderful,"I stayed at the Four Seasons with my father and his company and it was wonderful. The staff was very friendly and always addressed us by name and the hotel bar was lots of fun. I would definately recommend going to Paddy Cullins which is just down the road.
",4,2005,07,31
205,Always excellent,"I have stayed at the 4 Seasons Dublin more than 15 times over the last 15 months and have not been able to fault it. Great service and amenities. Not centrally located but only a 10 Euro taxi fare away.

",5,2005,05,03
205,A plus hotel!,"We just returned from a fantastic trip to Ireland.  The Four Seasons is a beautiful first class hotel.  I can't say enough about the friendly, helpful, courteous staff.  They are some of the best.  The hotel rooms are great, the bathrooms spacious and beautiful.  The beds and down pillows and comfortors are heavenly. We loved our stay there!
",5,2005,04,22
205,Worth every penny,"Just got back from The Four Season's Dublin and can't say enough nice things about it.  From the great doormen to the wonderful food, rooms and service.....it was all terrific.  We were there on business and I wasn't paying for the room, but it's truly one of the best hotels I've stayed in.
",5,2005,03,19
205,"Excellent, world-class service","This is a delightful hotel, with excellent service and attention to detail. It has a gracious, civilised yet friendly atmosphere and I really couldn't fault anything. 

Our suite was spacious and well-appointed and kitted out with a range of ""home from home"" entertainment devices - CD player, DVD player and Play Station.

Concierge were really helpful about restaurant bookings and everyone went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable.

Another notable fact is how welcoming they are towards children, without sacrifing the very high standards that are synonymous with Four Seasons hotels. As well as treating our 5 year old son like a prince upon check-in, I noticed that they had brought a couple of toys into the Lounge for a toddler to play with whilst his parents had some tea.

Another point I like is that if you book the bed and breakfast rate (which we always do), you can either eat breakfast in the restaurant or have room service for no extra charge (provided you eat within a generous limit!) - most hotels in my experience that offer breakfast inclusive rates will not offer room service within the deal, so that's another plus for Four Seasons.

Re other people's comments on its location, this hotel is a 5 minute cab ride into the City Centre  - hardy arduous! There are also plenty of restaurants within walking distance, including the excellent Roly's Bistro whch is well worth a visit.

I would strongly recommend this hotel and would choose to stay here if I returned to Dublin.
",5,2005,02,21
205,Almost perfect,"I stayed at the Four Seasons Dublin for six nights over Chirstmas.  It was a very good experience.  The staff could not possibly have been friendlier or more helpful.  The housekeeping staff in particular were outstanding:  warm. flexible, nice.  The food was excellent, with the exception of the steak which was awful.  Stick with the salmon, which is sublime, no matter how it's fixed.  Ditto the onion soup.  The (deluxe) room was spacious, tastefully decorated and very comfortable.  The bed and bathroom were top notch.  The only built-in negative is the location:  far from the center of town, but I knew that before I went.  One glaring glitch which can be easily fixed:  while there, I asked the concierge to help with two things,  1.  Postage for a single letter, 2.  A replacement for the toothbrush I inadvertenty left behind in Washington.  In both cases, I was directed to the gift shop.  So I dutifully went away, bought the stamp and brought the letter back to the desk (I was happy not to be pointed to the letter box on the corner) and I bought a toothbrush -- for 6 Euro -- in the gift shop.   Even most 4 star hotels know that an occasional letter left at the desk should be posted gratis...and that having a complimentary toothbrush or comb on hand is hotel common sense.  Especially if guests are paying Four Seasons rates.  The stamp and toothbrush incidents left me feeling, for lack of a better word, gouged.  Still, this is a great place to stay.
",5,2005,01,04
205,corporate ambiance and spotty service,"If you are willing to spunk this sum of money you will be better off in one of Dublin's other hotels.  While the rooms are adequate there is nothing really special about the hotel, service or food.   The ice bar is quite the place with the older singes crowd and the sunday brunch is big for now for dublin families, but I really was disappointed with the service and the hotel.  It is however, quite convenient for the rugby--- however, you'd be better off saving your money, staying across the street at Bewley's and drinking at the four seasons.
",2,2004,11,16
205,Fantastic,"We stayed in the Four Seasons on the first night of our honeymoon, They could not have been nicer, they gave us a free room upgrade, champange and chocolates. The room was fantastic with great views over Dublin bay. The staff were all very helpful and friendly and the service was excellent. 
I could not fault this hotel on any level. We ate in the Seasons restaurant in the evening, food and wine excellent.
",5,2004,10,26
205,a wonderful experience,"Having prided ourselves in staying in some pretty spiffy hotels in north america and europe, my family and I take our  collective hat off to the four seasons  hotel in Dublin.
From initial check-in on the 20th of OCT  to check out 4 days later  the staff could not have been more friendly and attentive . The concierge staff were some of the most helpful I have ever come across . Nothing was too much trouble . 
Food in the hotel was of a consistently high standard.  The breakfasts are wonderful with a wide variety to choose from . The lunchtime menu in the lobby was excellent but the star of the show has to be the exceptional Seasons restaurant which was faultless . Again nothing was a problem as  main menu items were happily tweeked to suit the tastes of our daughter (NO mushrooms please!) Our accomodation ( a standard room) was spacious and beautifully appointed and the  little welcome touches of a fresh basket of popcorn ,smash hits magazine and 2 bottles of fizzy juice thrilled our 12 year old  !
The spa was heaven on earth with lovely touches such as a calming corner with an aroma therapy candle and a good selection of magazines to peruse ..
The only thing that could have enhanced 
our vist was an improvement in the Oct Irish weather ...but we were offered the use of four seasons umbrellas !
",5,2004,10,25
205,We wouldn't stay anywhere else!,"We just returned from Dublin and stayed two nights at the FS. We had purchased their luxury package that included a massage for each of us and an aromatherapy facial for one. Our massages were so relaxing. Our package also included breakfast and one dinner in the Seasons Restaurant. We found the food to be absolutely outstanding. We had a wonderful three course dinner and the only thing we paid for was our wine. Our 18-month son with us and he was treated like a little prince (they sent him a lovely bath basket and cookies and milk at night). While the decor of the hotel is not to my taste (very grand, but country) it is still a lovely hotel. We had tea and drinks often in the Lobby Lounge which was always bustling with guests, but still quite relaxing.

The hotel was full to capacity and we noticed several large tour groups. Also, the big screen version of the Honeymooners is being filmed in Dublin and several of the cast and crew were registered guest at the hotel (we saw Eric Stoltz twice in the Spa/gym).

The hotel is about 21/2 miles from the center of Dublin. There is a free shuttle bus you can take if you are not up to the 25-30 minute walk. We knew this when we booked our package, but we love the consistency of the Four Seasons group. We stayed in FS Maui in May and the new FS in Budapest in August. The service is always wonderful and we appreciate that even more now that we are parents.

205,Refreshed at the Four Seasons D4,"My wife a I spent Friday May 28th last at this hotel.
We were attending a dinner at the hotel. It was just fantastic, the food excellent and the room was amazing. It had a huge bathroom and also had double doors which led out to a patio area. We were on the 1st floor looking out over the entrance to the hotel. The hotel is in Dublin 4 postcode, Ballsbridge area which is a lovely setting. I can sincerely recommend this hotel, though not cheap you do get what you pay for and more.

205,Excellence in Dublin,"I stayed here on business for a week, and really tested the hotel by flying out my young family for the weekend to join me.The service here is even better than the service at the Four Seasons in Paris (my favourite hotel in Europe). They are exceptional at meeting any need you may have, and boy did we test them!Kids are made to feel welcome (little dressing gowns, kids cutlery and crockery in all the dining areas) and as a business guest, the place was sublime, returning pressing in under 10 mins., fixing the broadband (which worked perfectly for all but a few moments) in seconds and it seemed that every member of staff knew your name.The roomservice was prompt (although the range was a little limited), and the spa was a welcome relief. The rooms were so well insulated that you thought that you were the only people in the hotel-no noise from above or around-superb.The decor is a little too 'Irish country house' for my taste, and goes aganist the more modern design of the public areas and of the building itself. They should have been far more bold and gone for a contemporary design, as there are few top Dublin hotels that have had the 'Phillip Starck' treatment.It is a little out the way, but in Dublin, everyhting is 2 mins. away by axi, and there was never a delay in one arriving at the front door. And the country park type setting, makes it a relaxing place to arrive after a busy day.For me there is a now benchmark in service, and I dont think many hotels are going to be able to compete with the Four Seasons.",5,2004,03,08
205,"Elegance, comfort, and pure Irish hospitality!","With only a weekend to spend in Ireland, the concierge at the Four Seasons Hotel Dublin listened carefully to our interests and created a perfectly balanced itinerary that provided a country day trip as well as a true city experience complete with Irish music and dancing. Our mini-vacation started with a delicious dining experience in the Hotel's Cafe. The food was delicious. Here, even the bread basket provided a sampling of some of the most delicious baked goods imaginable. The hotel is truly jolly ... yet elegant. The appointments are timeless and tasteful and the Irish paintings in the public rooms are especially lovely. This is Irish hospitality at its best!",5,2003,07,20

En relación a los desayunos, nosotros lo llevábamos incluido, y nos pareció muy completo y todo de muy buena calidad.

Aunque el hotel no está en el centro, hay una parada del tren cerca que te deja en el centro en 3-4 patadas.

Finalmente dar la enhorabuena de nuevo a todos los profesionales que tratamos en el hotel, recordamos por ej. a Marian, de recepción, muy agradable. Y por supuesto, un abrazo fuerte a Isaac, no se puede estar más atento a todo, nos hizo sentir fenomenal.",5,2022,12,08

Lo malo nos tocó en las zonas comunes del restaurante de recepción, son muy amplias y preciosas, comimos allí y el precio era asequible y por la noche puedes tomar una copa, pero... estaban allí alojados un grupo de música e incomprensiblemente dejaban entrar a las fans no alojadas en el hotel a molestar por allí. Mal vestidas, ruidosas, maleducadas y molestando a los que nos alojábamos allí. Es algo que no entiendo, si no se alojan allí no deberían dejarles entrar, el alboroto del bar a la noche y al día siguiente fue de vergüenza. 
Los del grupo musical fueron muy correctos y educados, tenían una zona de los salones privada para ellos pero que dejen entrar a los fans sin alojarse en el hotel es horroroso, estuvimos muy incómodos esos momentos, incluso se colaron en el buffet del desayuno.

Está situado a unos cinco kilómetros del centro, pero está perfectamente conectado con 'dublinbus' (parada a 100 m) y con el tren de cercanías 'irishrail' (parada a 200 m).

POSITIVA:
Die Mitarbeiter in allen Bereichen tun ihr Möglichstes; sind freundlich, kompetent und bemüht. Besonders MR. RICARDO kümmerte sich großartig um uns, hatte stets ein offenes Ohr für unsere Anliegen und suchte immer eine positive Lösung zu finden.
Zimmer: groß, sauber mit genügend Stauraum , gut strukturiert.
Bad: ebenfalls groß, Wanne plus Dusche - sollte sowieso Standard in dieser Kategorie sein; WC getrennt davon durch Türe, gut so!
Großer Flatscreen mit über 60 Programmen .
2 Queensize-Betten - ganz nett, aber nicht nötig.
WLAN im Zimmer bzw ganzen Hotel kostenlos.
Viel Platz beim Frühstücken im Restaurant.
Spa mit Innenpool und anderen ""facilities"".
Busse Nr. 4 oder 7 halten quasi vorm Haus und fahren in die City von Dublin - praktisch und Nerven schonend.

NEGATIVA:
Laute Hauptverkehrsstraße direkt vor dem Hotel. Kann störend sein, wenn man hellhörig ist.
Hotel liegt ziemlich weit außerhalb des Stadtzentrums Dublins.
Wenig Einkaufsmöglichkeiten bzw Restaurants in der Umgebung.
Essen im Intercontinental ist sehr, sehr teuer !
Ebenso teuer der Parkplatz mit 17 Euro pro Tag.

205,Luxushotel? Na ja...,"Die Lage des mächtigen, labyrinthisch verschachtelten viktorianischen Hauses ist tatsächlich erstklassig. Im vornehmen Botschaftsdistrikt Ballsbridge gelegen bietet es den Vorteil einer raschen Erreichbarkeit der Innenstadt per Bus oder Schnellbahn und trotzdem eine ruhigere Umgebung als das hektisch-lärmende Zentrum.

Unser Entrée war allerdings bereits verunglückt. Das Hotel rühmt sich zwar seines vielsprachigen Personals (Originalzitat: „VOM PERSONAL GESPROCHENE SPRACHEN: Chinesisch, Kroatisch, Niederländisch, Englisch, Französisch, Deutsch, Hindi, Indonesisch, Italienisch, Polnisch, Rumänisch, Russisch, Spanisch , Lettisch, Litauisch, Schwedisch“) -   davon haben wir allerdings nichts gemerkt; lediglich ein netter ungarischer Barkellner, Herr Gabor, sprach gut deutsch. Dafür überfiel uns die Rezeptionistin mit einem Schwall amerikanischen Slangs, der mit Englisch außer der Bezeichnung kaum etwas gemein hatte. Luxushotel? Na ja...

Wir hatten die teuerste Kategorie eines Doppelzimmers ( „two queen beds“) gebucht (bereits fünf Monate im voraus!), das auf der website des Hotels ausdrücklich beworben wurde mit einer schönen Aussicht über das Ausstellungsgelände der Royal Dublin Society. Das Zimmer (zum Preis von über € 400,- nicht gerade ein Billigangebot) mussten wir zunächst einmal mühsam selbst finden –  dass man in einem 5-Sterne-Hotel selbstverständlich ins Zimmer begleitet wird, hat sich hier noch nicht herumgesprochen. Die „schöne Aussicht“ erwies sich dann als Blick auf eine beliebige Häuserzeile; vor allem aber war unmittelbar vor dem Fenster eine sehr große und sehr laute Abluftanlage einer Großküche oder Garage oder dgl. positioniert, deren Lärm völlig untragbar war. Nach unserer sofortigen Reklamation bei der Rezeption wurden wir zunächst – im schon erwähnten schwer verständlichen amerikanischen Slang – belehrt, dass eine „schöne Aussicht“ kein Reservierungskriterium sei. Erst nach geraumer Zeit gelang es uns, die Rezeptionistin in das Zimmer zu lotsen (im wahrsten Sinn des Wortes – sie selbst fand nämlich nicht dorthin) und sie von der Tatsache der inakzeptablen Abluftanlage zu überzeugen. Luxushotel? Na ja...

Daraufhin wurde uns Tee angeboten, immerhin, und wir konnten eine knappe Stunde (!) lang beobachten, wie eine immer größere Zahl „wichtig“ erscheinender Herren offensichtlich die Situation diskutierten. Wir selbst wurden allerdings originellerweise in diesen Disput nicht einbezogen. Luxushotel? Na ja... 

Schließlich wurde dann eine bedauernswerte junge Dame aus Rumänien, die immerhin sehr gut Englisch sprach, aber nach eigenem Bekunden erst seit ganz kurzer Zeit im Hotel arbeitet, an die „Front“ geschickt, die uns schlussendlich ein upgrade in eine Suite ankündigen durfte.

Diese Suite war dann durchaus angenehm, abgesehen davon dass sich das Badezimmer in den kühlen Dubliner Morgen- und Abendstunden nicht heizen ließ; nur hatten wir erst wieder nicht die gewünschten zwei Betten. Auf meine Frage, wieso eine Reservierung fünf Monate im voraus nicht zufriedenstellend durchgeführt werden kann, erfuhren wir lediglich ein Achselzucken.

Anzumerken ist noch, dass ich auch Mitglied im IHG Rewards Club bin, der u.a angeblich folgenden „Vorteil“ bietet:  „Ihre Aufenthalte bei uns sind immer unkompliziert, angenehm und komfortabel.“ Ach ja?

Unser weiterer Aufenthalt war dann durchaus in Ordnung, wobei der Housekeeping-Service zwar nett, aber doch immer wieder leicht chaotisch agierte. Das sind aber Peanuts im Vergleich zur sehr unbefriedigenden Anfangserfahrung. 

Bemerkenswert finden wir auch, dass sich erst bei unserer Abreise der Front Office Manager, Mr. Gaurav Joshi, nach unserer Zufriedenheit mit unserem Aufenthalt erkundigte. Das wäre wohl in der dokumentierten Entrée-Episode deutlich angebrachter gewesen. Luxushotel? Na ja...

Ein Wort noch zu unseren kulinarischen Erfahrungen. Das Frühstück war sowohl hinsichtlich Angebot und Qualität als auch in puncto Service durchaus zufriedenstellend. Im Pub haben wir angenehm zu Abend gegessen mit gutem Service durch den schon genannten Herrn Gabor; nur die Rechnungslegung verlief dann leicht chaotisch, wofür aber nicht Herr Gabor verantwortlich war, wohlgemerkt!

Das Seasons Restaurant hat uns zunächst irritiert, als nämlich bei unserem Erscheinen zum vorreservierten Termin weder Gäste noch auch nur ein einziges Mitglied des Personals anwesend waren. Luxushotel? Na ja... 

Um so positiver erlebten wir dann das Abendessen selbst. Die Speisekarte war angenehm überschaubar und doch sehr vielfältig und originell zusammengestellt und die Gerichte selbst waren von bester Qualität, was auch für den Service gilt. Auch das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis empfanden wir als durchaus angemessen. Völlig überzogen hingegen waren die Weinpreise – offene Weine von durchschnittlicher Qualität für einen Preis von € 12,- und mehr pro Glas (!) sind nicht wirklich argumentierbar.

Der Afternoon Tea schließlich, den wir in der angenehmen Atmosphäre der Lounge genossen, war – sagen wir es freundlich – ganz nett (sehr gute Sandwiches, mäßige Scones, dünne Schlagsahne statt der vorgesehenen clotted cream, belanglose petit fours), allerdings wieder von reichlich chaotischem Service geprägt. € 50,- pro Person, wenn auch incl. eines Glases Champagner, sind da doch etwas übertrieben. 

Fazit: Wer in Dublin ruhig und dennoch City-nah wohnen will, liegt im Intercontinental nicht ganz falsch. Man achte aber auf die Zimmer-Zuweisung und erwarte sich nicht unbedingt wirklich luxuriöses Ambiente und Service –  Luxushotel? Na ja...",3,2016,06,26
205,perfettamente in linea con i migliori Intercontinental,"L'hotel Intercontinental di Dublino è un buon esempio per questa catena alberghiera. Immediatamente si nota la gentilezza del personale, dato non scontato neppure per questa fascia di hotel, gli arredi ben curati e la comodità delle stanze oltre alla loro ampiezza offrono una grande comodità. Buona la colazione, eccellente la spa, che pur avendo una piscina non grande offre ogni possibilità per tenerti in forma con delle splendide macchine per palestra di marca Technogym.",5,2016,06,24
205,Genial!!,"Muy buen servicio y muy amables. El hotel precioso, la piscina y el gimnasio muy bien. Fuimos con los niños y elegimos una Junior suite muy acogedora. El salón música en vivo (piano). Como siempre la cadena intercontinental no nos defraudó. ",5,2016,05,01
205,Visto desde otro punto,"Mi experiencia es como empleada, es un muy lindo hotel, con excelente equipo de trabajo. Los mozos y la gente que te atiende son lo más. Creo q como huésped se puede disfrutar al máximo de todas las instalaciones y tratar recibir un excelente servicio.",4,2016,01,29
205,Excelente,"Excelente experiencia en el hotel. Personal muy amable y atento, habitaciones estupendas y super amplias. Las camas muy cómodas. Hotel muy limpio.

205,Alti livelli,"Premetto che ho soggiornato in quest'hotel quando era un Four Seasons, è veramente fantastico, reception pronta a soddisfare qualsiasi esigenza del cliente, non centrale ma autobus vicino che in 10 minuti porta in centro. Molto lussuoso sembra di vivere una fiaba, camere speciali e interni degni di nota. Budget alto ma senz'altro mi sento di consigliarlo a chi vuole passare un soggiorno da sogno!",5,2015,11,04

205,Stilvoll und 20 min. zu Fuß nach Dublin City center,"Top Service, tolle Zimmer im viktorianischen Stil und sehr gutes Frühstück, mit 28 EUR pro Person aber zu teuer.
Ruhige Zimmer mit großem, tollem Bad wie man es sich wünscht.
Die Bar bietet eine sehr große Auswahl an irischen Whiskeys",5,2015,08,01
205,Gutes Hotel in dezentraler Lage,"Ich war geschäftlich in diesem Hotel und dafür ist es auch okay. Das Convention Center ist zu Fuß allerdings nicht erreichbar.

Leider ist die Lage für eine private Reise nicht sonderlich gut. Das Hotel liegt etwas außerhalb und in den umliegenden Straßen habe ich keine Einkaufsmöglichkeiten oder Restaurants gesehen.

Das Zimmer war riesig, das Bad groß und das Bett gut.

Das Frühstück war leider (abgesehen vom Kaffee) nicht besonders gut. Für ein Hotel dieser Kategorie und Preis absolut inakzeptabel.

Die Bar hat stolze Preise, aber gute Drinks. Sie ist weder besonders gemütlich, noch sonderlich modern und könnte eine Renovierung gut vertragen. 

Das Hotel ansich ist eher gediegen. Alles in Allem ein gutes Hotel mit Verbesserungspotential.",3,2015,04,20
205,Sehr traditionelles und stilvolles Hotel,"Von aussen sieht das InterConti beeindruckend aus - zwar nur 5 Stockwerke, aber ein massiver Klnkerbau mit mehreren Flügeln und weissen Sprossenfenstern. Grosse repräsentative Vorfahrt, wenn man wie ich zu Fuss von der nur 100m entfernt liegenden Flughafen-Bushaltestelle kommt wird man von dem livrierten Personal schlicht übersehen. Der typische InterConti-Gast fährt mit einer schwarzen S-Klasse (Langversion, Vorhänge im Fond) mit CC-Kennzeichen vor, Ballsbrige ist das Viertel voller Botschaften. Innen feinster viktorianischer Hotelstil, sehr gediegen, dunkles Holz, dicke Polstermöbel und Teppiche. Mein geräumiges Zimmer lag im ersten Stock zur Gartenseite hin, sehr ruhig und hell, wie ein Wohnzimmer. Auch das Badezimmer bietet viel Platz, und kaum ein Hotelzimmer hat heute noch so viel Platz im Kleiderschrank.
Schönes Frühstück, ""continental"" vom Buffet, oder ""full Irish"" a la carte. Heller Speisesaal mit grossen Fenstern zum Garten.
Beim Check-out um 5:30 morgens beinahe ein Malheur: der Concierge nmimmt mir mein Gepäck ab (ich hatte ein Taxi zum Flughafen bestellt) während ich auschecke. Leider lädt er mein Gepäck in en falsches Taxi, zu einer anderen Gruppe die gerade abreist. Gerade noch wird mein Koffer gerettet...
Fazit: für einen Städteurlaub mir etwas zu fein und zentrumsfern gelegen. Für Botschaftsangestellte aber ideal.",4,2015,04,07

Alles war perfekt.,5,2015,02,15
205,"Super bis auf das Frühstück, aber außerhalb gelegen","Ich war geschäftlich wegen einer im Haus stattfindenden Sitzung und Konferenz Ende September im Four Seasons. WLAN (warum muß das in den teuersten Hotels immer noch extra kosten) und Frühstück waren in der Konferenzrate inkludiert.

Wegen der zum Stadtzentrum und zum Flughafen doch etwas abgelegenen Lage wäre das Hotel für einen touristischen Privataufenthalt nicht meine erste Wahl. In der Nähe ist allerdings eine DART Station und zum Flughafen kommt man mit der Air Coach Linie 702 direkt vor Bewleys Hotel gleich gegenüber.

Das Zimmer 423 zur Simmonscourt Road raus (Deluxe King Room) war großzügig geschnitten in jeder Beziehung. Sehr großer Kleiderschrank, großes Bett, Schreibtisch, Sitzecke mit Sessel und Leselampe, riesiges Bad mit getrenntem WC, Dusche und extra Wanne. Bei geöffnetem Fenster hörte man zwar den Verkehr unten, aber nicht so laut, dass er mich beim Schlafen gestört hätte. Aprospos Schlafen: Schöne feste Matratze.

Der Service war fast durchgehend sehr gut. Vom Empfang bis zum Zimmerservice (bei dem man die Tee-/Kaffeezubereitungsuntensilien bestellen muss, die aber binnen weniger Minuten vorbeigebracht werden) und zum Konferenzbereich.

Eine kleine Enttäuschung war das Frühstück, sowohl hinsichtlich der Auswahl als auch des Personals. Hier habe ich, als einzige Stelle im Haus, muffeliges Personal gesehen, dass man aktiv herbeibitten mußte, um wenigstens nach einigen Minuten Warten seinen Tee bestellen zu können. Auch die Auswahl war eher beschränkt. Die Qualität von Wurst und Käse war sehr gut, die Brotauswahl dagegen karg und das Rührei am sehr reduzierten warmen Buffet an beiden Tagen labbrig bis fast flüssig.",4,2014,10,29

La experiencia fue positiva sobre todo por el personal que fue en todo momento extremadamente amable y  cooperativo. Una de las empleadas incluso me ayudo con una impresión de mi tarjeta de embarque. En cuando a los servicios de comida, cena y café todos fueron excelentes. La bolleria simplemente extraordinaria. Por supuesto que espero volver esta vez como huésped para disfrutar de toda la experiencia completa. ",5,2014,10,09
205,Muy buen hotel,"El hotel tiene un muy buen nivel. La pieza es amplia y cómoda, aunque se ve un poco antigua. El baño también es amplio, con ducha y tina separadas, pero también con un look un poco antiguo. El servicio es excelente, solucionaron todas mis dudas y el desayuno también es de muy buena calidad. Fui a un Congreso que se hizo en el centro de convenciones de Dublín y el hotel esta lejos, pero no cuesta nada tomar un taxi (por unos 13 euros) para ir al centro o al centro de convenciones. Totalmente recomendable, quedaría aún mejor si renovaran un poco algunas instalaciones. ",4,2014,05,10
205,Opportunamente fuori dal centro,"Dislocato nel bel quartiere delle ambasciate e a 10 minuti di bus dal centro, l'hotel offre una calda ospitalità ed è molto popolare per cene di classe anche fra i dublinesi.

Wirklich super ist die Belegschaft, die äusserst freundlich und zuvorkommend ist. Unsere Family Suite war relativ gross aber ein wenig dürftig eingerichtet. Ansonsten ist ein typisches Four Seaons... Das Zimmer war auf die Hauptstrasse, was bei dem Strassenbelag und offenen Fenstern nachts nicht sonderlich ruhig war. Positiv aufgefallen ist, dass teilweise ein ""Courtesy Car"" Transfer in die Stadt angeboten wurde. Es ist alle sehr schön, jedoch ein bisschen steril und das die Auswahl beim Frühstücksbuffet und -karte eher dürftig. Beim nächsten Mal werdne wir ein direkt in der Innenstadt ein Hotel buchen, da die Lage vom FS Dublin für die Stadtbesichtigung nicht optimal war. Wir haben stets ein Taxi genommen, damit wir in die Innenstadt kommen (ca. 10min Fahrt).",4,2013,07,20

Alla domenica addirittura sono finito alle 10:00 in waiting list per la prima colazione causa eccessiva richiesta in contemporanea. Possibile? Per il resto direi un buon hotel con relativa area wellness e fitness, una buona concierge e dei prezzi accettabili.",3,2012,10,07
205,"Fabelhaftes Hotel, perfekt!","Wir haben eine Irlandrundreise über fast drei Wochen gemacht, insgesammt sieben 5 und 4 Sterne Hotels besucht. Das Four Seasons hat uns am besten gefallen. Das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis ist spitze. Der Sevice war grossartig, das Personal sehr zuvorkommend. Wir haben uns im Hotel sehr wohl gefühlt, das Essen war sehr gut, das Zimmer und die restlichen Räume waren nett eingerichtet. Wir haben das Hotel für das Ende der Reise gleich nochmals gebucht.",5,2012,07,24
205,Un Four seasons non all'altezza del nome,"Si sta parlando della catena Four Seasons e quindi ci si aspetta sempre la perfezione; qui invece si ha tutto ad un altissimo livello che altri alberghi solo si sognano ma manca quel qualcosa che altri Four Seasons hanno...; forse la gestione se ne rende conto ed infatti i prezzi non sono per nulla incredibili (per essere un 5stelle lusso ed un Four Seasons) ed in linea con glialtri alberghi dublinesi della categoria
Siamo a Ballsbridge  (Dublin4) nelle zona delle ambasciate e quindi un po' fuori mano dal centro (se siete in città per turismo) ma finalmente si puo' contare su  un parcheggio taxy al di fuori dell'hotel (all'inizio dell'attività toccava aspettare molto a lungo nelle ore di punta...) e su un'auto di lusso che porta gratuitamente solo verso il centro in determinati orari.
Le camere sono molto ampie ed i bagni in marmo mentre moquette e tapezzerie lasciano  (ma sono gusti personali) un po' a desiderare nei colori...
Buona la SPA anche se la qualità dei massaggi non è eccelsa, anzi; gratuito l'accesso alla zona piscina (assai piccola, non certo praticabile per nuotate) ed idromassaggio come a quella della sauna/bagno turco
Troppe le scivolate di qualche addetto sul servizio ai tavoli, soprattutto al bar ,anche se la cosa sta migliorando
Internet a pagamento (caro!); business center con quattro postazioni ma a volte con qualche attrezzatura fuori servizio
Servizio in camera veloce e puntuale ma la carta è invariata da tempo immemorabile....

El hotel esta en muy buen estado, aunque el estilo "" georgiano"" esta un poco pasado ( sorprenden las TV de tubo en un hotel de esta categoría).El servicio es excepcional tanto en las habitaciones como en los bares/ restaurantes. La piscina y el Spa son magníficos.
La carta del restaurante es un poco limitada, pero no tenemos que olvidar que estamos en irlanda, que destaca mas por sus bebidas (cervezas y wiskey) que por sus cocineros.

205,A colpo sicuro!,"Mio marito ed io abbiamo trascorso un lungo weekend (3 notti) a Dublino e abbiamo scelto il Four Seasons hotel, ubicato in località Ballsbridge. 
La nostra scelta si è basata su precedenti esperienze presso altri alberghi della catena Four Seasons, sempre più che positive; è per questo che abbiamo pensato di scegliere questo  albergo a Dublino per andare, come si dice, ""a colpo sicuro"".
Le nostre aspettative sono state pienamente soddisfatte.
Anche questo hotel, infatti, soddisfa tutti gli elevati standard che contraddistinguono la catena alberghiera.
In particolare, l'albergo di Dublino è posizionato in una assai piacevole zona residenziale piena di verde, che abbiamo trovato nel suo massimo splendore per la stagione primaverile al suo migliore esordio.
Il centro della città non è certo vicinissimo ma è sicuramente ben collegato (bus e treno urbano); in circa 15 minuti - senza però contare i tempi di attesa - si riesce a raggiungerlo.
L'hotel è sicuramente confortevole e i servizi sono tutti di alto livello; tutto è molto curato e nulla è lasciato al caso. Come richiesto, ci è stata assegnata una camera non smoking con letto king con una gradevole vista verso l'esterno.
Il personale della reception si è dimostrato molto disponibile così come quello della concierge, quest'ultimo caratterizzato da un calore tipicamente irlandese. 
Ogni nostra richiesta è stata prontamente soddisfatta, inclusa quella di eliminare un fastidioso cigolio del letto. Un paio di volte abbiamo pure potuto fruire del comodissimo servizio di limousine di cortesia per raggiungere il centro urbano.    
Molto buono il ristorante interno, dove abbiamo potuto gustare degli ottimi breakfast (non inclusi nella tariffa giornaliera) e una cena, in una atmosfera molto intima e rilassante.",5,2011,04,26

Aber die Kompetenz der Angestellten und die Freundlichkeit lässt keine Wünsche offen. Kinder werden in diesem Hotel wunderbar aufgenommen. Man könnte meinen Kinder wären hier offensichtlich erwünscht. Von einem herzlichen Willkommen bis zu einer netten Verabschiedung das Hotel liess keine Wünsche offen.

Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und es wird fast jeder Wunsch erfüllt. Ich habe ein Upgrade auf eine Junior Suite erhalten. Die Möbel sehen etwas rustikal aus, aber das Zimmer ist groß und auch das Bad mit Extra-WC Zimmerchen sehr einladend. Kosmetikartikel werden von L´Occitane bereitgestellt.

Auf jeden Fall sollte man das Frühstück testen..die Pancakes sind einfach himmlisch locker!

205,miglior hotel di Dublino,"L'hotel si trova leggermente decentrato rispetto al centro città. Ha l'aspetto di un antico castello in una vasta proprietà. Le camere sono di tre livelli e tutte offrono servizi eccellenti. La mia camera executive era enorme con cocktail di benvenuto, balcone, doccia e vasca. Staff eccellente anche se un pò troppo ""rompino"" a causa della presenza del gruppo rock dei Bon Jovi che aveva attirato numerosi fan all'interno. La hall è spettacolare, tutta in marmo e curatissima. Un hotel tra i migliori al mondo che lascia a bocca aperta. Per viaggiatori esigenti che richiedono il meglio.",5,2007,12,25
