127,Good location and service,Good location - short walk to Liverpool tube station which has a few lines. Tesco supermarket is right next to the hotel and thr are a few places to eat. Room was ok sized though found the bed (diagonal) and TV (to the right of bed) orientation a bit odd. Iron and ironing board in the room for ease. Tried room service once and found it average. Menu can hv few more options like Indian food. Service was good overall.,4,2024,09,22
127,Birthday stay,We came here for my birthday and it didn’t disappoint exceptional hotel but what made it for me was how wonderful the staff were always smiling and happy to help the room was stunning and the food and drinks were also top notch absolutely loved our stay,5,2024,09,11
127,Stunning luxury hotel in a fabulous location,"This is a gorgeous hotel in a prime location with amazing service. We arrived from an international flight and as our rooms weren’t ready, the hotel kindly let us use the spa facilities to shower and change so that we could be on our way. The service was like that at every touch point during our stay. The rooms were spotless with every amenity and luxury you can imagine. I would definitely stay here again and being in Shoreditch was fun.",5,2024,09,21
127,Chinese new year afternoon tea,"I went here for the Chinese afternoon tea experience and I love the cakes and sandwiches. I love the set asian plates to match with the dish. I might come again to try out the cocktails only, most likely for after work drinks. It is a nice place to visit.",5,2024,09,16
127,Alex's service and cocktails were superb!,"We had drinks in the Ginger Lily bar and lounge.
The cocktails were absolutely delicious, beautifully presented and Alex the mixologist and bar manager was attentive, friendly and went the extra mile to ensure we loved our drinks and had a brilliant time.
I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this bar. Hotel bars can often be a little sterile but Alex makes you feel special and at home . The bar is relaxing, is styled beautifully and has a lovely ambiance.",5,2024,09,07
127,Exceptionally clean and location is excellent,"Very clean hotel; amazing views and accessible to the Liverpool st train lines. Rooms are spacious.
Amenities in the hotel are also a treat as well.

Hotel Restaurants: excellent
Proximity to things to do: excellent 
Food near by: ton of places to eat at all price points.",5,2024,08,28
127,As a five star hotel ought to be - highly recommend!,"This review is long overdue . The hotel is beautiful. Service excellent , some of the best I've ever encountered. The staff genuinely seem to want to go out of their way to make your stay as enjoyable as possible . 

We had booked ""a deluxe city view ""I think it was called , but were told on check -in we had been upgraded . This was a lovely and welcome surprise as we were both celebrating our ""big"" birthdays. 

Breakfast was excellent and we also enjoyed the cocktails in the Silver bar (I could only manage two - they are strong!) . 

I wouldn't hesitate to return .",5,2024,08,20
127,Superb City hotel,"Located within easy walking distance of Liverpool Street, the Pan Pacific has quickly become our favourite place to stay in London. From initial welcome to departure all staff were welcoming, friendly and diligent. The hotel is suitable for those who wish to stay out of the chaos of Central London - both business and leisure travellers, solo, couples or families. Hotel rooms are peaceful, spacious and well appointed. The gym is state of the art and the hotel pool is a relaxing haven for all. The hotel is showing small signs of wear, but you have to look really close to notice these things. The only ‘downside’ of this hotel is that the dining options feel very corporate - the bars lack real personality, but this is hard to achieve in a corporate hotel. In all the places it matters this hotel is 5*. It isn’t pretentious like The Londoner. If you’re looking for a quirky charming London hotel then this isn’t the place for you go to The Bloomsbury or Hotel 41, but if like us you like uncomplicated, modern luxury this is the place for you.",5,2024,08,20
127,Excellent modern luxurious hotel ideal for The City and the Liverpool Street Area with excellent rail links to airports,"This is an excellent hotel. 

It is convenient for Liverpool Street (e.g., Elizabeth Line from Heathrow) and The City.

The room have dramtic views and are very well appointed - exuding luxury.

The staff are extremely helpful and friendly.  They are courteous and helpful.

Have stayed around five times in the hotel so well worth returning.

Tip: Eataly nearby is excellent for Italian meals and foods.

Downside: No desk in any room in which I have stayed so if you need to work in the room, check with the hotel in advance.

Otherwise, top class hotel",5,2024,08,17
127,"New modern rooms, great location","New modern hotel rooms, we got a connected two bedroom suite, which was a in U shape, a fun walk for a toddler from one end to the other. Very central location, with many many food options right downstairs and within a few minutes walk. Nice big indoor pool too. Hotel’s own restaurant had some good dishes, some were okay.",5,2024,08,16
127,I'm sorry I had no change for a tip,"The staff are lovely and have a really good sense of humour.
The hotel was amazing I loved it here. The decor was off the chain and despite me being three martinis deep they entertained my nonsense. When I receive my award next week for tractor owner of the year, I will mention them in my acceptance speech. Stay here and have a wonderful experience.",5,2024,08,10
127,"A perfect hotel, but let down by breakfast service. ","

The greeting and check-in experience at the Pan Pacific was exceptional—easily among the best we've encountered. Upon arrival, we were met by a gracious gentleman who offered us a drink, and Kelly Vo from Guest Relations made us feel at home right away. Her service was welcoming, warm, friendly, and informative, setting the perfect tone for our stay. Kelly helped us decide to have our evening meal at the hotel's Straits Kitchen restaurant and left us a handwritten note with fruit and homemade sweets, which was an enchanting touch.

Our suite on the 17th floor was stunning, with wonderful views and a layout that was ideal for three people. Housekeeping was attentive, adding a camp bed in the lounge area for us. The suite’s main bathroom and additional separate toilet provided extra convenience.

We thoroughly enjoyed the well-maintained pool area on both days, and our evening meal was delicious, beautifully presented, and accompanied by excellent service.

However, breakfast was a letdown. I had to wait 8 minutes for a table, and despite ordering coffee, I had to remind the staff before it arrived and it seemed there had been a muddle and it had never been ordered. We also had to flag someone down to take our breakfast order, which then took 40 minutes to be served. The entire breakfast experience stretched to 1 hour and 27 minutes. It was fortunate we had time to spare.

Check-out was smooth, though the gentleman handling it didn't inquire if we had enjoyed our stay. We appreciated the convenience of leaving our bags at the hotel and collecting them later in the day before catching our train home.",4,2024,08,09
127,Setting new standards.,"Where to start, this is one of my new favourite hotels. The suite was amazing and only beaten by our Butler, Jasper couldn’t do enough for us. The breakfast was unusual as I don’t normally eat curry for breakfast, I went back for seconds….. they do have your normal offerings too.",5,2024,08,08
127,Highly recommended 5*+,"Thank you to all staff

I would like to say thank you to all the staff at your Pan Pacific London hotel for their hospitality and service.

I have to say this has been the best London hotel me and my husband has stayed in, you made mine and my husband’s 17th wedding anniversary very special.

Just walking towards the hotel felt great, greeted with a polite manner, amazing customer care at the desk and I know with a great freshness to hotel as you walk in its clean.

The room with a view was stunning, clean and comfortable,  I didn’t want to leave the bed it was so relaxing, the bathroom was very therapeutic, relaxing with great toiletries, that smell amazing, which I have now purchased the body cream from the company due to the smell, stunning @diptyque Highly recommended.

The bars and restaurants are all very well maintained, clean with gorgeous China sets, cutlery, plates is a very big deal for me, strange, I know but it’s the little things that count and makes that experience very special.
I cannot wait to stay at this amazing hotel again my anniversary will be one to remember.

Thank you for a beautiful relaxing weekend, the staff were exceptional and I would highly recommend to everyone.",5,2024,08,06
127,Relaxing weekend in such a stunning hotel,"My girlfriend and I spent such an amazing weekend at this beautiful hotel. From arrival, staff extremely friendly and welcoming. 

Josh at the reception was professional and knowledgeable about the district activities around the hotel, very engaging throughout the stay and did a great rooming showing us around the suite. 

We look forward to returning to this great hotel.",5,2024,08,05
127,Beautiful but not family friendly.,"Beautiful air conditioned hotel in London. At check in the front desk told our kids at least 10 times at check in to go swim in the pool. However when we took our kids to the pool, the pool staff informed us that kids were not allowed to swim. Kids were only allowed for an hour in the morning and an hour in the afternoon. The times kids were  allowed to swim are when a family would be out seeing London. I went and peeked at the pool to find that it was completely EMPTY. Not a single person. We wouldn’t go back to this hotel just because it’s not family friendly. Other than that it was very nice. Great for a couple.",3,2024,08,04
127,Excellent 5-Star Stay!,"Excellent stay at the Pan Pacific London.  Great view, nice amenities such as heated tile bathroom floors, heated towel racks, 24 hour room service and turndown service.  Friendly and helpful staff, location near Liverpool Street very convenient.",5,2024,08,04
127,Beautiful hotel,"Absolutely loved our stay at this hotel. We were only there for 1 night but were able to get into our room at 11am and have a late check out at 1pm so really maximised our time. The stand out aspect of this hotel for me is the staff. Every single member of staff is so genuinely friendly and eager to help. It makes you feel so relaxed and taken care of. The atmosphere is very luxurious and this is a proper 5 star hotel with immaculate decor and every amenity you could ever wish for, but the atmosphere is relaxed not stuffy. 

The children’s pool hours are at good times and as you’d expect the pool facilities are a joy to use with ample towels and seating. You can order drinks and simple children’s meals to eat by the pool which was really handy.  

Breakfast is delicious with a very high standard of ingredients. The fresh fruit and pastries were incredible. 

There are a ton of places to eat and shop nearby and easy access to central London. 

We would love to return here one day.",5,2024,07,31
127,I WISH I COULD LIVE HERE!,Stayed here countless times now but just wanted to put on an updated review.  We just stayed  from Friday 26 to Monday 29 July 2024 and what a treat it was . Seamless check in warm welcome like coming home!  We stayed on floor 17 in a Bishopsgate suite which was amazing with 2 bathrooms - a separate living room with tv and sofa - fabulous refreshment area with well stocked mini bar and drawers  of tea coffee snacks plus a  Dualit kettle and a coffee maker - everything you could want - we had fresh fruit in room also flowers in every room even the bathroom! Love it! The bed was lovely and comfortable and great blackout I sleep better here now than at home! There’s great service regarding in room dining  and delicious food any time you want it (there’s also plenty of places to eat such as straits kitchen and bars too) the housekeeping is brilliant and prompt - I love the pressing and laundry service - it makes getting away so relaxing they literally do everything for you! There’s a fab pool and gym too.  Special mention to Rita and Xinchen and Jasper and the team at the reception for all their assistance always - we look forward to returning again very soon!,5,2024,07,30
127,Amazing 80th birthday celebration staycation,"What an amazing hotel experience to be able to celebrate my 80th birthday. The room was simply stunning with the softest bed - I had my best nights sleep in a long time. The robe was so luxurious I did not want to take it off. The SENSORY well-being floor was an experience on its own and my facial was simple superb - thank you Sara - I feel 10yrs younger. A big shout out to the Guest Relations and Front Office teams, concierge, the doorman and porters, I have never experienced such a warm and welcoming arrival ever before. Thank you so much for my flowers - I absolutely loved the 8 roses, each celebrating every 10 yrs of my amazing life. The cherry on the cake had to be the giant photo birthday card with so many wishes from all. Thank you for spoiling me. Breakfast was another highlight and thank you to the whole team  for the delicious food, great service, cake and bubbles.

Thank you Pan Pacific London for a great stay, I will see you again on my 90th birthday if not before. Best regards Pearl x",5,2024,07,21
127,Lovely modern hotel in The City,"We enjoyed our 3 night stay at this hotel. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The room is very modern and attractive. Once you get used to all of the different buttons to turn on lighting and close curtains it is a well lit bright room with full expanse of floor to ceiling windows. There are lots of plugs around the room particularly at bedside for charging your electronic devices. Linens are nice. Bed is comfortable. The bathroom is well lit and lights come on when you walk into room and there are built in night lights for the bedroom and bathroom. The vanity surface is not large but there is a good shelf below the sink. There is a separate toilet area and a large shower that is three quarters enclosed. There are heated towel racks and numerous hooks. There is a chair and sofa but no desk. There is a complimentary coffee bar on the 2nd floor at breakfast time. There are two nice bars that stay open late. For some reason some Uber drivers do not know where the hotel is located. The hotel is well located to Liverpool Street Station which has the underground, buses and regional trains. The hotel is located in The City which was an area of London we have not previously experienced. We did need to take transportation to many of the areas we were visiting. We enjoyed our stay and I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2024,07,20
127,Good luxury hotel for business,"Tagged along on my partner’s business trip. Lovely hotel service with thoughtful finishings and attentive service. The gym and pool were a highlight. 

The location isn’t great for leisure though, so would not stay if I were going on pure vacation, as the location is very corporate. The view from our room was literally of a bank and could see the cubicles / monitors.",5,2024,07,17
127,Great hotel for all,"The place is close to the tube (convenient) and close to St Paul’s a d major tourist places.  We didn’t have time for their services but the room was exceptional.  Lots of extras, quiet and comfortable.  Highly
Recommend for individuals or families.",5,2024,07,14
127,My new favourite place to be in London,"Dear Pan Pacific Team, it was a great pleasure to stay with you last month for an extended weekend. To say it in short: it was like be at home! From the first step in until the last step out it was just marvelous to be with you. You will be definitely my choice for my regular trips to London and looking very much forward to be back with you!",5,2024,07,14
127,No better Place to stay,"No better Place to stay
We had again an amazing experience with the Pan Pacific London. Kelly Vo and her team had done a wonderful job. The suite was beautiful with a stunning view from the 18. floor and the almond croissant from the breakfast is playing in his own league. Thank you all very much for the nice time and we hope to come back soon!",5,2024,07,11
127,Luxurious Experience,"This hotel has fast become one of our favourite hotels in London. From walking in the front door you get the 5-star experience and all the staff are very welcoming. We were celebrating our anniversary when we visited and the hotel arranged a sweet treat which was a lovely touch. 

The rooms are incredible with everything you could need - likewise the bathrooms are very impressive. We dined out however the restaurant looks very nice. We did have a late-night drink in the Ginger bar which was fantastic. The bartenders really know what they are doing.

We will definitely be returning and I'm already looking forward to it!",5,2024,07,04
127,Beware of Visiting in the summer,"Hotel is new and room is great, EXCEPT when the air conditioning unit thinks no one is in the room, it sets to the default of 23C/74F.  This happened when my family was asleep.  The beds only have thick comforters, and my whole family and I woke up at 2am sweating and super hot, and the room temperature registered 23C (even though I set the temperature as low as possible, 16C, before I went to sleep.).  Groggy from being asleep, needless to say, it took me a while to figure out why the room felt so hot.  When I finally went to reset the temperature at 16C (again), it took an hour to cool down the room.  Obviously my younger children, once awake, did not fall back asleep for many many hours.  This automatic reset when there is no motion in the room is a flaw in the air conditioning system.  You can call the engineering department to set your room default to not do that, but you must specifically request it.",3,2024,06,27
127,"Great hotel, a few small things","A fabulous spot and it has improved since my last stay, a few minor things but overall excellent. I was in the Devonshire Suite for 3 weeks so got to experience most of the hotel.
Pool and gym great, shame the steam was offline for the whole time.
Room service was great but breakfast in the morning was lacking, the poor girl running the restaurant looked out of her depth and after being seated had no service for 40mins. Went back to the room and had room service.
Overall fabulous hotel.",5,2024,06,26
127,Best Hotel in London,"Our stay at the Pan Pacific was exceptional! They were so accommodating to our young children and made us feel so welcome. It was beyond clean, luxurious and overall just a 10/10. The little touches were beyond our expectations. We look forward to returning!",5,2024,06,25
127,Wonderful hotel - can’t fault it in any way!,"Absolutely incredible stay for my husband’s 40th Birthday. The hotel is beautiful throughout and immaculately clean all round. Staff are amazing and very attentive. The location is perfect and a great area to take a stroll.
We stayed in a Premium room and it was beautiful- large with amazing views. Beautiful toiletries, the SOFTEST towels that were huge, the lost luxurious dressing gowns and one of the most comfortable hotel beds I’ve ever slept in! 
The pool area is amazing - so relaxing - and the massages/relaxation area are wonderful. 
Couldn’t recommend this hotel more highly and hope to return. Thank you Pan Pacific!!",5,2024,06,25
127,Fantastic Stay at Pan Pacific Hotel,"I recently stayed at Pan Pacific Hotel and had a fantastic experience. From the moment I checked in, Davide and the staff were incredibly attentive and accommodating.
The room was spacious and clean, with a breathtaking view of the city. The hotel's amenities, including the pool and the Silver Leaf bar, added to the overall luxury of my stay. I highly recommend Pan Pacific hotel to anyone visiting London",5,2024,06,14
127,Comfortable room conveniently located,"The Pan Pacific has a relatively small (and at time crowded) foyer. But once you get past that, you’ll find a very comfortable hotel with good facilities. My room was of good size, with a nice outlook over Bishopgate, but could have done with a desk for those guests travelling for work. Overall, no real complaints but no real ‘wow’ factor either - just a nice comfortable stay close to Liverpool station.",4,2024,06,11
127,Luxury!,"We spent a weekend here recently to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. What a beautiful hotel. Very modern, clean, luxury feeling. The staff are so pleasant. Our room wasn’t available on our arrival as we were a little early but they agreed to text us once it was available. We were kindly upgraded and the room was beautiful - shower, bath, beautiful views from the 13th floor of the gherkin and rest of the skyline. We will definitely return !",5,2024,06,10
127,Unbelievable customer service and hotel,"We have just checked in to this hotel after an  awful two nights at The Mayfair Townhouse for my husband’s birthday weekend and wow the service here is unbelievable. 
It is the best hotel we have ever stayed in. The attention to detail is impeccable the staff are joyful and happy they can not do enough for you in fact i cannot wait to return already.  
Very impressive company we are so happy and pleased with everything even our dog is. 
Will be stay with pan pacific in future at any chance i get. Very very happy customers after a terrible stay elsewhere. 
Many thanks.",5,2024,06,09
127,Beautiful Place!,"Worth every penny spent!  Staff is so welcoming from beginning to end! Concierge service was excellent! Sergio and staff are super attentive!  Location worked well especially after a busy day full of activity.  If you prefer to be in the middle of Central London’s hustle and bustle, then this isn’t for you.  Everything was perfect!",5,2024,06,08
127,Just lovely,"The best place to stay in London.. So convenient to Liverpool street station, with the Elizabeth line straight to and from Heathrow. 
Staff are just wonderful from the check in, door men and the waiters in the Straits Kitchen. 
Cannot recommend this hotel enough, plus don’t forget to pack your swimsuit as the pool is a lovely place to relax after a busy day.",5,2024,06,08
127,Good service at Pan Pacific,"I recently stayed at pan pacific yangon and was thoroughly impressed by their breakfast service. As a Muslim traveler, finding halal options can sometimes be challenging, but the hotel staff went above and beyond to accommodate my dietary preferences. Not only did they provide delicious halal options, but the service was also exceptional. The staff was attentive and made sure that my needs were met. I highly recommend Pan pacific to anyone looking for a hotel that offers both great service and halal food options. And special thanks to Lynn Lei for cooperating with me.",5,2024,06,04
127,Quick trip in London,"i actually stayed in 2022 and forgot to add! I absolutely loved this hotel and i rarely stay in hotels in England! We stayed for my birthday and the staff even had a cake in our room for me! I didnt realise children can stay at this hotel though so using the pool when children were splashing was slightly annoying ( I promise i am not the grinch :D)

Overall nice comfortable stay, room was slightly pricey for what you get.",5,2024,06,04
127,Amazing Hotel in London,"Everything from the beginning to the end of my stay went perfectly. The room had such a nice view , very comfortable and absolutely spotless! My wife is very allergic and usually have problems in hotel
Rooms but not at this time .the housekeeper, Eugenia was so kind and careful . The breakfast was amazing , the staff always helpful and kind . The spa was really nice , clean and beautiful. What else can I say ? When back to London definitely I will stay in the hotel . Another important thing to point out is the location . Steps away from Liverpool Street  station you can get everywhere in London .",5,2024,06,03
127,Best couples night away!,"We had the most incredible experience and stay earlier this month! The staff were so professional but friendly and made any request not too much trouble! The room was unbelievable with an incredible view of the gherkin and the shard, a super comfy large bed, lots of amenities and a super luxurious marble bathroom with bathtub. 
I left wanting to extend my stay!",5,2024,05,23
127,Excellent location and great hospitality with Asian touches,"I enjoyed the welcome we received and the member perks- the room upgrade was much appreciated especially after a 7hour flight. VIEWS! 
Breakfast was fantastic - the cheese selection and quality were impressive. The robe was super comfortable, bath was divine and the fact that you offer a Dyson hairdryer - fabulous! The Chinese tea set was a nice touch as were the chocolates and treats.",5,2024,04,29
127,Top Notch Accommodations in The City,"If you're looking for a luxury hotel in the heart of The City, the Pan Pacific can't be beat.  I've stayed at several other hotels in The City for work and the Pan Pacific was a cut above all of them.  The lobby is quiet and serene, set back from the main road with a nice driveway that allows unhurried pick-ups and drop-offs.  The location is great for seeing the sights - it's easy walk to the Tower of London and Tower Bridge, as well as St. Paul's.  Being across the street from the Liverpool Street train / tube station makes it easy to get around London and beyond.

The service was fantastic all around, from the curbside bell-hops to the check-in desk, to the maid service and the pool / gym complex.  Ah yes, the Pan Pacific is one of the few hotels to have a pool - great for kids after a day of sightseeing (keep in mind that there are set hours for kids to swim, ending at 6pm, be sure to check with the hotel in case you think you're going to be doing a late night swim with little kids).  This was never a problem for us and the pool - located on the 4th floor - was beautiful.  

Our room was big and bright, with two queen beds and plenty of space for luggage and clothes.  The bathroom was very large, with a big tiled walk-in shower and tub area and a separate toilet with a door separating it from the rest of the bathroom.  My family of 4 stayed together in this room, and with the exception of my snoring everyone was very comfortable!  I recommend the Pan Pacific and will look to stay here on my next work trip.",5,2024,04,27
127,Fantastic!,It was an amazing stay. Great location 15 min walk to tower bridge. Breakfast buffet-  was royal! Hotel staff were incredible! Excwlent service!,5,2024,04,24
127,I had a wonderful stay!!,"I had an amazing stay at pan pacific london every staff member was friendly, attentive and professional. I have never been to a hotel with such excellent customer service. The staff was able to accommodate to my needs and my room was sparkling clean. The only let down is the spa facilities as there’s only 1 pool that is shared. I was with my boyfriend and we couldn’t use the sauna or steam room together as they were separated. A part from that i had a wonderful stay and will definitely visit again.",4,2024,04,24
127,Perfect hospitality,"Absolutely excellent, personalised service in every way. Amazingly spacious rooms by London standards. The attention to detail of reception staff as well as housekeeping was outstanding.",5,2024,04,21
127,False advertising,"If you arrive in the hope you may receive a complimentary room upgrade, something advertised as a VIP guest of Expedia, you will never receive one. Either the hotel or Expedia is providing false information and breaking the law but I was unable to determine which one after 3 hours chatting on line with Expedia and with hotel staff.",1,2024,04,17
127,Outstanding hotel,"What a fantastic stay we had at the Pan Pacific, London. All staff were welcoming, friendly, attentive & nothing was too much. From the checkin to checkout our stay was exemplary. The room was nothing short of perfect, spacious, stylish & with all the amenities you could need. Upon checkout we were recommended a visit to Spitalfields market and wow what a fantastic place. The hotel is in a great location & right by the train & tubes.
Cannot wait to return to this hotel & cannot recommend enough.  Thank you for a lovely stay.",5,2024,04,16
127,Fantastic experience,"Everything was above and beyond. We came to celebrate my wife's birthday and you did an excellent job in recognising the special occasion, however you also made my daughter (age 8) feel special as well so she wasn't left out. We were all extremely impressed. Everything was perfect and would love to stay again. Highly recommended for family's with young children as well which is a rarity, and also pet friendly.",5,2024,04,16
127,"Beautiful, perfection. Thank you all! Grazie Davide :)","Amazing! Absolutely beautiful. From the arrival till the departure.
Every single one is friendly and helpful, what a great team. Special mention to Davide, since the moment he welcomed us, we felt home. Such a worm and charismatic italian guy, I love him. I will be there as long he will look after me. But seriously, everyone has been amazing, from lobby to restaurant and housekeeping. Dear Pan Pacific London , you gave us a lovely time, we needed it and we appreciate it. We tried your hotel because it has been recommend to us. And OH GOD, I wish I could never leave it. My new favourite place and I will definitely recommend to every person who wants to visit london. Great location and value.

127,A perfect 1 night anniversary stay,"Booked the Pan Pacific London for our anniversary.  I had arranged activities and dinner so thought why not stay in London for the night.

Check in and check out - Seamless - very friendly staff, made us feel welcome and special.

Room - we were upgraded due to my status with Discovery.  The room was spacious, newly refurbished and comfortable.  The shower and bathtub were great.  Coffee/tea and water were all complementary.

Breakfast - Large variety available for breakfast - Asian and full English.

Afternoon Tea - We opted for the Kopi Tiam afternoon tea and we were not disappointed.  

Special shout out to Kiran at Straits Kitchen for making our anniversary afternoon tea extra special. 

Location - 2 minute walk from Liverpool street station - perfectly located.

Silver Leaf Bar - Cocktails were really good, definitely worth visiting.

Overall - Highly recommend a stay here.  Excellent staff, great rooms and food.",5,2024,04,09
127,Outstanding,"Pan Pacific London is just outstanding, from the moment you are greeted outside by the doormen to the warm greeting from reception and then all of the staff that help you throughout your stay the service couldn't be any better.  The hotel is super comfortable and the facilities are excellent",5,2024,04,09
127,Wonderful suite and infinity pool,"We had a staycation for the Easter holiday this year. As this was also a celebration for two birthdays in the family, we wanted to have the five star hotel suite experience. We were very happy with all the services and facilities during our stay. The highlights of our long complement list are the infinity pool with the city view and the butler service. The kids absolutely loved the infinity pool which they religiously reported to it everyday! And our butler Jasper looked after us well during our stay, nothing is too little or too big to him. Thanks for giving us this unforgettable Easter holiday and double birthdays celebration experience. We will cherish this memory for a long time in the future. 

If I’m being really nitpicking, they wouldn’t give us a good discount for upgrade will be it. Also it would be even better if they can make sure the cleanness of the high chairs is of the same standard to the dining tables and chairs.  But as what we had already exceeded our expectations, these are minors.",5,2024,04,07
127,Had higher expectations due to existing reviews,"It’s a beautiful hotel but I was disappointed. 
I travel often and only stay in 5* hotels, so my expectations were not what I received. 
My partner often pays for my accommodation when I travel and there is no issue with payments. He pays in advance and its sorted. I did the same but it seems you didn’t take the payment although it says no deposit required. I emailed ahead to notice of this and was advised it would be no issue, I arranged balloons and snacks for his arrival only to find he had to check in and to pay the room rate and deposit. I told him not to of course as its his treat!

Honestly I have never experienced this and it was a huge disappointment for the experience of his birthday. 

On my arrival the lady that served me, 10/10 very warm and lovely. 
I paid for the drinks and food my partner purchased at the lounge as of course he had no choice but to wait until I arrived hours later. 

Whilst I was checking in and paying for this, he was approached by a member of staff with a card machine saying he has to pay for the bill. 

At no point did she ask him if he is staying at the hotel and wants to put it on the room tab as ALL hotel would normally give as an option. I then let her know I have paid it but she didn’t believe me, so the lovely lady at reception went over to confirm. 
Again, not used to this type of treatment to feel someway. 

The room was the best part of our stay. It’s beautiful and a great size. 

We were shocked there was no robes, slippers  or hangers in the spa changing room lockers. This was definitely a surprise and disappointment. 
Not enough loungers. Didn't make sense there were 5 chairs instead of loungers. 

Breakfast, never have we been told ordering from the menu is an extra cost although we had breakfast included in our stay. Found this odd. 

Few things floating in the pool.",3,2024,03,31
127,Almost flawless,"I enjoyed nearly everything about my stay. I look forward to returning soon. The staff and facilities are excellent. It was a fantastic experience - except for the scrambled tofu - don't order that - it's not prepared well, and you should pass—otherwise, it's a fantastic place to stay.",5,2024,03,31
127,Poor service,"Had an issue that I reported at 7.00 am but wasn’t resolved till 17.00 after 3 visits to reception before I was  acknowledge that the issue was in hand. There was an electrical fault in the room, meaning the curtains didn’t close fully had light coming in at six in the morning, and the lighting wasn’t working in the bathroom, which means I had to turn on the whole room to use the bathroom and waking my wife up",2,2024,03,31
127,Truly everything as I could have expected,"The hotel is fascinating in many respects, including its sustainability, location, and the staff’s availability. The service met my expectations with a spacious room, although, for my personal taste, it could use a bit of modernization.",4,2024,03,28
127,Great Stay,"We have celebrated the babymoon last weekend and our stay was just perfect, we couldn't ask for more. The room was on the 16th floor, had an amazing view and we have enjoyed every moment spent in your hotel. All staff was very attentive and friendly, the hotel/facilities were great too. Thank you for making our stay so special!",5,2024,03,27
127,Recharge In tranquility,"There are so many accommodation options in London and it is often difficult to choose… this one worked well for us this trip as the location was quite easy to navigate for us 2 families of 7 from Liverpool Street station. New hotel! Everything is fresh, the decor is trendy and modern. The lobby is impressive yet understated. The children approved the heated indoor pool - plus there are separate hours for adult use! I recommend not to miss out on the sauna to warm the tired legs after walking about in London. Loved the dryer to spin your wet clothes in the spa - pool area. Room is big and the bath is EXCELLENT!!! We had a view of the “gherkin” looking building across our room which gave us many laughs. The Singapore influenced breakfast buffet menu is a welcoming touch in London / continental buffets- it was an added touch of nostalgia to us as we have personal memories of the country. My niece was over the moon with the 2 birthday cakes presented to her - thank you for going out of your way for that, Pan pacific. It’s a peaceful retreat from the bustling city and what a great way to recharge.",5,2024,03,24
127,Great for business or tourists.,"I've stayed in London many times, but the first at this hotel. Absolutely amazing experience. And very convenient location. Room was much larger than I expected. Food was excellent. Staff very attentive. Across the street from the Liverpool train and underground stations. Also many restaurants in the area.",5,2024,03,21
127,Simple perfection x,"Lovely stay.  Simple, classy, helpful but not fussy.  Staff wonderful & attentive without being obtrusive.  Didn’t need much as it was all already done, but knew if you needed anything, they’d be there.  Everything you need for a break from the city in the city.",5,2024,03,19
127,Excellent stay,"Exceptional service, luxurious amenities, and impeccable attention to detail. A truly outstanding stay at this excellent hotel. From the moment you step in, elegance envelops you. Stunning decor, sumptuous dining, and unparalleled comfort make every moment unforgettable. A must-visit destination for discerning travelers seeking perfection.""",5,2024,03,19
127,Relaxation getaway in the heart of London,"Pan Pacific London was an amazing hotel and very clean! The staff was very friendly and the spa was just what we needed! The location is perfect and I will be back, hopefully for longer. The concierge handled my dinner reservations and made it a memorable experience with my daughter.  I hope to be back sooner than later.",5,2024,03,13
127,Beyond Expectations,"Our stay at Pan Pacific - London was an absolute delight from start to finish. 
The exceptional service from the friendly and professional staff exceeded our expectations. 
 The room boasted a stunning panoramic view of the London skyline, truly breath-taking!!
The tranquil ambiance of the infinity pool and spa provided the perfect escape for relaxation.",5,2024,03,11
127,Good experience but i still need to get my rest,"I am really well served here, good hospitality from everyone in the hotel.

The room is delightful and I have more water here plus books and notebooks for my personal records

I am also well served with sweets and i would also be happy to come here next with someone as well

Thank you
Kind Regards Cristian Stefan Adam",5,2024,03,07
127,Exceptional and memorable,"Every staff member had a smile and felt genuinely happy to see us. Your overall vibe was absolutely immaculate. It’s an absolute must if you want to stay in the city of London.

The amenities are rare for London and it honestly elevates the experience to a whole new level. Highly recommend.",5,2024,03,05
127,Truly 5 Stars,"Location is great, right opposite Liverpool Street Station, Moorgate Station is under 10 minutes away.  Feels safe walking around the area.  Really spacious room especially in Central London.  Immaculately clean both in the room and all the hotel facilities.  Decent size swimming pool with fantastic view.  Breakfast is adequate, the hot food i.e. sausages, mushrooms not hot, only luke warm, but eggs are made freshly according to your choice.  Friendly staffs, good service.  Overall a really good stay and would definitely return.",5,2024,03,02
127,Amazing,"Probably one of the best hotels that I have stayed in, would highly recommend the team can't do enough for you. Bed was super comfy and the facilities were amazing too
 The food was brilliant and everything was so smooth. We also had a dinner on the bar and the feedback was amazing.",5,2024,02,29
127,Incredible hotel with perfect staff and fabulous housekeeping,"Wow just wow. I had the true pleasure to trying this hotel in May for my partners birthday. On approaching the hotel the door staff approach with the biggest infectious smile and engaging,  friendly and fun manner. Any anticipation of this new 5* deluxe hotel of being formal or stuffy were dashed. We were whisked to the guest services check in where we were chatted to like old friends. Whisked to our room and with a complimentary upgrade as it is was a birthday with cake and bubbles ready in the room the person rooming us seemed genuinely as happy as my girlfriend did. The room was incredible with corner views over London which were breathtaking. Many nice touches in the room which made it more like a discovery of things to be found. We went to the hotel bar on the ground floor where they made the best margarita again with pure happiness and even a little cheeky banter. The tea room was full with lots of people’s laughter drowning out the music. The genuine feel of happiness and joy was so pleasing and made it very special. The next morning I went to the gym which was state of the art and full of cool kit. We then went to the pool which was very cool. Slightly smaller than I thought but was full of beautiful people updating their insta with pool side pouts. The hotel is immaculate, pristine without a piece of furniture out of place - the housekeeping manager Shanhawaz and team are simply superb. The  little touches and the people make this special. This hotel is fabulous and needs to be tried out. Really blown away.",5,2024,02,27
127,Amazing Hotel!,We had a very minor issue with our room when we arrived but the staff at reception were exceptional. We were celebrating a birthday and the hotel made everything so special. I travel a lot and this was my second time staying at this hotel and I recommend it to everyone,5,2024,02,27
127,Stylish hotel in a fab location,"We had such a nice stay for our daughters 16th birthday thank you.  The rooms are quiet and stylish with comfy beds, modern bathrooms, soft robes, Diptyque products– all lovely.  We had the infinity pool to ourselves on Sunday morning.  There are loungers and chairs around the pool and a relaxation room with warm beds if these are busy.  The sauna and steam rooms are in the separate female and male changing rooms which I really like.  Breakfast was tasty, varied and a mix of British and Asian food.  The location is so close to Liverpool Street tube which is on the new Elizabeth line so easy to get to Paddington and the West End.  We had a day in Spitalfields which is a 5 minute walk from the hotel – such a lovely area.  We often stay in the West End but would definitely stay here again.  It is a tall building so ask for a lower down room if you don’t like heights!  We enjoyed the views from up high.",5,2024,02,26
127,Best Hotel in England,Hotel is amazing staff is very friendly Amelia from Reception was very helpful i even got a late check-out at 4pm which I really appreciate can't forget to mention Kelly vo from guest relation she made sure everything was 100% in my room on my arrival i felt like a VIP Thanks for everything I'll definitely return to panpacific hotel London.,5,2024,02,20
127,Excellent wheelchair friendly hotel in a great part of London,"Extremely comfortable stay, excellent services, really good accessible room … only thing missing from wheelchair accessible bathroom were grab rails near the toilet and the shower area. Amazing views with a side view of the ‘Gherkin’! The staff, particularly the Concierge team were most helpful and friendly. We will stay here for sure when we return to London.",5,2024,02,18
127,Absolutely first class,Stayed recently to celebrate my daughter’s 40th birthday.  An exceptional hotel with exceptional staff.  Breakfast is wonderful.  My only complaint is that there is not enough seating around the pool area.  We had to dump our belongings in a pile.  Other guests made the same complaint.  Would definitely return and would definitely recommend.,5,2024,02,17
127,Exceptional,"Every aspect of our stay exceeded expectations! The team, the decor and ambience, the room itself - everything was incredible, we couldn't have asked for anything more. A truly magical experience. Would highly recommend - a haven in the heart of the City",5,2024,02,13
127,Wonderful London experience,Beautiful hotel with amazing staff who go above and beyond to make guests feel welcome.  The coffee and light bits in the lounge area are exceptional.  The rooms are spacious and the bed very comfortable with excellent quality and plentiful toiletries.  Definitely a great experience.,5,2024,02,11
127,Great stay!,Fabulous hotel - the room was perfect and lovely staff! Only criticism was the temperature of the swimming pool was a little on the cold side and there was not much choice of bread at the breakfast buffet - literally brown or white basic sliced.,5,2024,02,06
127,Highly recommend,"Fantastic hotel with fantastic staff. Had a truly wonderful experience. All team members were especially attentive and couldn't be more welcoming. All amenities throughout the hotel and within the room were spot on. 
The location and proximity to London landmarks means that this hotel will be my go-to from now on",5,2024,02,06
127,I doubt this hotel will be in my list again,"The restaurant is poorly staffed and managed, food quality is better from a fast food outlet
They do not understand customer service and are a let down to the brand and wider GHA discovery programme.
Check out is slow and the inexperienced staff do not understand their own systems.25 minutes from reaching the desk to checking out is a joke when you’re heading to the airport. 
They don’t really want to know about any issues just use the bland corporate hotel “oh we are sorry to hear that” while the front office manager just leaves them at the front like cannon fodder",1,2024,02,03
127,Weekend Away,"First time at this hotel and definitely not the last.  From the moment at check in to check out we were given excellent customer service.  The room was clean modern and cosy, the bed was extra comfy and the toiletries were of good quality.  We had breakfast daily and it was a buffet option at the weekend and served to you on a weekday the food was tasty and we had lots of choice.  We spent time at the pool and again everything was spotless.  We have stayed at a few 5 star hotels but this is now my favourite and cannot wait to return.",5,2024,02,03
127,Excellent hotel with thoughtful service and impressive design,"Pan Pacific London is a fantastic hotel. I booked one night as a treat for myself to start off a longer trip. The location was easy to get to from Heathrow on the Elizabeth line. The staff were genuinely welcoming and friendly. The property is expertly designed. The bed was super comfortable. The gym and spa facilities were of the highest quality and were instrumental in my post jet lag recovery. The level of thoughtfulness they put into their design details was impressive. Everything was “in the right place” and also calm to look at. I wish I could have stayed longer. At this price point you will find many hotels in London that don’t care about service, but here I felt genuinely looked after without it being obtrusive. Had great recommendations from the bartenders at Ginger Lily on interesting rums to explore. I look forward to returning for a longer stay and would actively seek out Pan Pacific hotels in other locations based on this one night’s experience. I used to travel for work and have stayed at pricey hotels that don’t put in half the effort. This stay was exactly what I needed to start my trip in London.",5,2024,01,30
127,Fabulous hotel,"The hotel is beautiful.The staff are very professional and friendly,must give a special mention to Hammed,who showed us to our room.What a lovely guy!
Our room was a delux.It was spotlessly clean and very comfortable.
There was plenty of choice at breakfast and the staff were very attentive.
Would certainly recommend this hotel,it was a pleasure to stay there!",5,2024,01,28
127,Always my choice in London!,Beautiful hotel.  Service is exceptional. Multiple dining options and rooms are quiet and comfortable.  The spa is wonderful and staff is friendly and helpful.  Location is excellent - close to dining and shopping.  I have stayed here twice and will continue to stay here as it is my favorite hotel in London!,5,2024,01,21
127,Perfect location,"Warm friendly welcome, the concierge even took me to our room, our room was perfect room service was excellent food was amazing, would highly recommend staying here it great location to most of the sights in London all within walking distance.",5,2024,01,19
127,Family Trip,Very happy with the welcome we received.  The room was big and extremely clean.  The bed and linen are excellent.  The staff and atmosphere between them was very good.  Top service.  The location of the hotel is very good.  Spa area 10/10.  We cannot wait to return.,5,2024,01,12
127,Top experience for accommodations in London,"Great location and very elegant, offering large rooms with fantastic large bathrooms featuring massive walk-in showers with high water pressure. The rooms offer extremely comfortable beds and pillows and are well soundproofed. ",5,2024,01,08
127,perfect experience,"I booked a stay for my partners birthday and everything was faultless from start to finish. When speaking with the reservations team, concierge and also guest relations they couldn’t do enough to accommodate my requests and ensure the room was set up perfectly with all requested balloons etc.

The rooms are beautiful and are probably one of the largest I’ve seen in London and everything was spotlessly clean. The gym and spa area were also very clean and tidy.

The food in the hotel restaurant was cooked perfectly and they had no issues at all catering for my dietary requirements and led me through the menu carefully.

I had a small issue with my car where it was damaged and seemingly thought this had happened with valet parking, but the staff quickly and carefully went through all video footage they’d taken of the car upon arrival and indeed the damage was already there so I’d obviously been unlucky for someone to scrape my car in the days before arrival. I thought it important to note this as it does show the care and attention the hotel provides and they dealt with this very professionally and politely.

I’ve stayed at many of Londons leading hotels and I can truly say Pan Pacific provides one of the best services I’ve experienced and I will definitely be visiting frequently.

Thanks to everyone at the hotel for making the stay so memorable and I look forward to returning very soon.",5,2024,01,06
127,*not* worthy of Forbes 5 Stars,"Booked a 2 night stay just purely based on the Forbes 5 stars that it received. The valet/check in experience was very pleasant!

Totally my mistake, but I scrolled through some pictures as I was booking and saw a soaking tub in one of them, so assumed all rooms had them. I just booked an entry level room, and realized upon entering that it doesn't have that feature. So I called the operator (3 minutes on hold), and this woman picked up and her tone was exceptionally unpleasant. I wasn't even asking for a complimentary upgrade (I'm a Marriott Titanium, and I've learned to never expect upgrades, let alone on my 3rd party booking), but she sounded like she really wanted to let me know that I'm not gonna get what I want without paying up. So I asked about the upgrade fee. She audibly grunted (I gasped lol), and said they'll call back. Waited about half an hour for a response but by then, we had to leave the room. I wouldn't expect that exchange in a Forbes recommended hotel, never mind a Forbes five star.

Also, the breakfast service was quite slow. Maybe 1/3 of the dining area was occupied, but probably for their ease of providing service, they crammed everyone into one area with screaming children and all. When the server took our breakfast order (semi-buffet style) and I requested orange juice, he went on a long winded explanation that I must get my own juice from the buffet area since I have access to the buffet. Sure, getting up to get it won't kill me, But if a server from a 3 star Hilton in the US can hand deliver a side of mustard that I somehow missed in the buffet area without implying that's not her job, the server here could've done that too.

Also, to house keeping staff, I know you all are overworked! But please double check the bedside analog clock for time accuracy. Mine was behind by 15 minutes and we almost missed our matinee show. (It didn't help that we asked the doorman which direction the Elizabeth line station is, and he said ""that way"" and pointed in a general direction with loads of people and too many buildings/entrances/signs to easily decipher which one was the tube entrance.)

I genuinely don't know how this place received Forbes 5 Stars. Ritz Carlton Kyoto deserves it. Capella Bangkok deserves it. But this one? No. It's on par with a faux luxury JW Marriott or an Intercontinental based on the experience I've had so far.

Aside from that, the public areas and the guest room are well designed with neat features. 

We have one more night here, and I'm so thankful I didn't book all of my stay in London at this hotel.",3,2024,01,04
127,Exceptional and Outstanding ,"The hotel was exceptional. The staff were extremely friendly and welcoming. The rooms were clean, both the bed and pillows were comfortable! An absolute pleasure stating here. Definitely will revisit.",5,2024,01,04
127,Lovely to return again.,Another first class stay. One of the best sized bedrooms in London with lovely Asian style service. Always a pleasure to return to after a day out. Highly recommended. Did not visit the restaurant on this occasion but the menu looked interesting.,5,2023,12,31
127,Great Stay at the Pan Pacific London,"We just finished a wonderful 4 night stay at the Pan Pacific Hotel in London and highly recommend the hotel.  The room was great - very modern and quiet.  We also very much enjoyed breakfasts at Straits Kitchen.  The location of the hotel was also ideal with easy access on the Underground to wherever we wanted to go.  Also, we were traveling with our son and we appreciated a hotel that provided two very comfortable true queen sized beds.  But, what really stood out was the exceptional service at the hotel.  Without exception everyone at the Pan Pacific was friendly and helpful — from the front desk to the concierge to the valet to the restaurant.   Special thanks to Hamid who welcomed us when we arrived on Christmas night and gave us valuable advice for our stay and made us feel so welcome.  A true brand ambassador for the Pan Pacific.  We will definitely be recommending the hotel to friends visiting London.",5,2023,12,28
127,Amazing London Experience,"From start to finish, the whole experience was exceptional! The hotel is located within walking distance of Liverpool Street which was ideal to get around London, as well as very convenient to get back to Heathrow Airport on departure day.

Every single staff member I encountered was so pleasant and welcoming, and the rooms were extremely comfortable & spacious. I had a room on the 16th floor with amazing views to wake up to. 

The leisure facilities were a lovely touch, and a great way to unwind and relax after a busy day exploring. 

Big thank you to all of the team at Pan Pacific London, and I will definitely be back!",5,2023,12,28
127,A festive stay with great service marred by certain failures along the way.,"Wonderful service, generally speaking, let down by below average restaurant. The Singaporean restaurant on site was among the weakest Asian restaurants I’ve been to in quite some time. 

The chicken skewers were chewy and appeared to be deep fried rather than grilled, spring rolls were crispy, but lacked filling and flavor, the duck rolls were tasty though. Breakfast was very weak and while a generous spread, the food was not up to Singaporean standards. Service at breakfast time was very weak and slow when ordering off the menu. 

We stayed at this hotel over Christmas so we could take advantage of the hotel pool with our child. We had been told previously that they would have extended family hours for the pool over the Festive Season but they didn’t, which was very disappointing. Furthermore, the pool water temperature was too cold, despite management assurances that it was “in range” everyone else at the pool agreed that it was too cold to be enjoyable. 

The best part of the experience was the cocktail bar Silverleaf which had amazing bar tenders and cocktails. Can highly recommend it for all. 

We had booked a suite and because of GHA
Status we were proactively upgraded which was appreciated. The bishopsgate suite was quite lovely and appropriate for our family of 3 with a rollaway in the living room.",3,2023,12,28
127,Absolutely outstanding in every way,"We stayed here for a total of 11 nights in November. We could not have asked for a better experience from check in to check out. All employees were brilliant and expert in their knowledge. A big thank you to Gabriela especially in housekeeping for her kind and personalised attention to our room.

Accommodation itself is spacious, with very clever storage for all traveller types. Quality finishes, smart design and high attention to detail abounded. The bathroom and shower is second to none and the London and Singapore themed decor was lovely. 

Room service was brilliant and all bars were cosy places to spend a couple of hours catching up with friends. Big shout out especially to the bar staff at Silverleaf- very knowledgeable and welcoming service, in a gorgeously sleek space. 

The pool and gym were lovely facilities to spend time in and please can I say- the pilates reformers in the gym- wow!!! Huge bonus and I loved being able to continue my Pilates practice on holiday. Please never remove them, I have never seen them in any other hotel! 

Thank you to everyone at Pan Pacific London for making it such an exemplary experience for us. We can’t wait to come back.  ",5,2023,12,28
127,Fantastic from start to finish!,"Our stay could not have been any better. The hotel is amazing. Restaurants, lounge and bar were great with a variety of food. Staff were so accommodating and treated us and our 2 year old like royalty. Room was spacious, clean and very comfortable. Only a few minutes walk from the underground which made it easy to get around. Will definitely be back again on our next stay in London.",5,2023,12,20
127,Worth every penny,Highly recommend the Pan Pacific. The hotel and its rooms are as gorgeous as the photos. The bed is comfortable and sheets and linens are new and luxurious. I'm obsessed with the bath robes. Staff is super friendly and makes you feel welcome and cared for - lots of lovely personal touches. We had a great experience here. Highly recommend - worth the money.,5,2023,12,19
127,Fabulous Beds,"This was my second visit to the Pan Pacific and having enjoyed my stay the first time it was the only choice when booking.  I travelled with my daughters and friend to celebrate two birthdays.  The hotel is perfectly situated beside Liverpool St Station for the underground so it is easy to get around London.  The rooms are really lovely and the views of the city of London are amazing.  There is everything you could want in the room and each room has a Dyson hairdryer.  It is amazing that you can stay in some of the best hotels and have to put up with very poor hairdryers.  Not here!!  I have to mention that the housekeeping staff were amazing and each day we came back the room had been tidied to perfection.  They even left my daughters more toothpaste and a note that they thought she might run out. Another thing to mention are the amazing beds, so comfortable.  I wish I could have taken it home!  The staff were so friendly and attentive and we had a lovely stay.  We're travelling to the Pan Pacific Orchard on Christmas Day and know that it will be equally as good.",5,2023,12,19
127,Friendly hotel with great rooms,"Excellent customer service, great room on the 8th floor.  Bed extremely comfortable. We tried the ground floor bar for drinks and some food all of which were first class, the bar staff very attentive and friendly. I would recommend this hotel without doubt.",5,2023,12,19
127,It feels a lot like Christmas at the Pan Pacific,"Checked into the Pan Pacific at the weekend - it was like stepping into Christmas. A warm welcome from the guys on the door from under the light bedecked canopy, twinkling lights and glamorous Christmas trees throughout the foyer and lounges. I also tried the festive set menu in the restaurant - Christmas fare with an Asian twist (in keeping with the hotel's heritage).
The bedroom was large and comfortable and had floor to ceiling windows with impressive views over the urban City landscape - we were right beside the Gherkin. But it's not all soaring skyscrapers in this part of town, at breakfast the next morning I had a perfect view of the 18th century St Botolph's church right opposite the dining room. You can also see it from the spa, with its infinity pool.
Staff were friendly and helpful, it was nice to be looked after.",5,2023,12,18
127,fantastic!,"Stayed at the pan pacific for the first time last night for my boyfriend’s birthday. The room was beautiful, and we especially enjoyed the pool. I couldn’t fault a thing. A special thank to Hamid who went above and beyond for us, he really is an asset to the team. I would highly recommend, and look forward to booking another stay.",5,2023,12,18
127,One of the best hotels in London,"My wife and I had a wonderful stay at the Pan Pacific London over the weekend. We were upgraded to the Devonshire Suite on arrival which was a lovely surprise. The room was just fantastic with views of St Paul’s Cathedral. The service was exemplary from check-in through to breakfast at Straits Kitchen. When my wife needed dental floss, the housekeeping team went out of their way to source it for her. We were really impressed! Special thanks go to Emily Simpson who went above and beyond to look after us. She is an asset to the Pan Pacific London team. We will definitely be back!",5,2023,12,17
127,Excellent stylish central London stay,"We were staying in Central London for our traditional Christmas Party weekend. The Pan Pacific was the latest in a long line of prestigious upscale hotels that we stay in at this time of the year. I’d stayed at Pan Pacific in Singapore and maybe Hong Kong. There is a stylish calming Zen like atmosphere. This Pan Pacific  
hotel in London is quite new, maybe a couple of years old. All good at check in, we got in slightly early avoiding the tiresome 2 or 3pm check ins that are commonplace and rarely is a room ready other than at the appointed later and later hour. We were staying on the 14th floor. I understand the 20th floor and up are private residences and not part of the hotel. Regretably the one thing we found disappointing with the Pan Pacific was the first impression looking out of the windows in our room. They were dirty / filthy even and that first impression ruined the view and the impression. The room was comfortable, fittings new, nicely appointed bathroom. Quiet. We tried the Ginger Lily lounge one night, very nice. Hotel was perfectly situated for our event and otherwise getting round the city, particularly the financial district. We didn’t use many of the facilities but the staff were very good and we would recommend this hotel. It’s very expensive. The windows need cleaning which isn’t much to ask considering the cost. But the Pan Pacific is a five star place to stay in central London",5,2023,12,17
127,A real gem in a perfect location,"This hotel is just amazing in any way. It is stylish, it is squeaky clean, it is the epitome of hospitality and grace. 
So enough with the superlatives, more explanation:
Check in was smooth. Efficient and informative. Room was very clean, not loud in any way, earthy colors and nice details making it very relaxing. Very spacious Bathroom had a spa-feeling to it and all amenities were from Diptyque. 
Towels big and fluffy. Dyson hair dryer (🤩). 
Mini bar was decently stocked. Oriental tea pot and super sweet cups. 
Curtains are controlled electrically so no need to fight 3 layers of heavy fabric before dozing off. 
Room service is quick, efficient and 24 hrs. Menu choices are ample.
Did not try the pool. However the gym is delicate and clean with most things you’d need. 
We had no complaints whatsoever. (Ok, one-toilets were hard to flush. That’s the only thing we could think of :-)) 
We did not try breakfast, because we found it unnecessary expensive and because of reading some bad reviews beforehand. Uber Eats worked great for us, and concierge brought it up quickly.

Perfect stay, unfortunately only 4 nights, but we’ll be back.we loved every minute!",5,2023,12,16
127,Flying visit,"We visited briefly as we wanted to preview the suites - we are getting married in February and we are staying at Pan Pacific for our pre-wedding party. We are holding this at Searcys at the Gherkin so we wanted to see if any room had a view of this/whether it was worth upgrading our room. We were shown around by Hamed who was incredibly friendly, kind and helpful. It was lovely to meet someone so down to earth and genuinely happy to help. We look forward to coming to stay in February!",5,2023,12,09
127,Comfortable room for a family,"We booked the Premier Double room. Bed is wide enough for an adult and a child. Friendly service in general but not pro-active. For example, no one helped us to unload luggage on arrival or load them on departure.

Room is comfortable but the design of the shower area is not good. The water would often spill out onto the rest of the bathroom. The coffee table in the room is also too small to work with a laptop and there is no desk.",3,2023,12,09
127,Excellent hotel albeit expensive,"Good hotel with an excellent location near to Liverpool Street, directly linking to Heathrow via the Elizabeth line. 

Frederico & Nikita from the hotel’s bar Ginger Lily were wonderful people and made the bar experience memorable. Drinks were excellent as well. 

Housekeeping was good, turndown also offered in the evenings.  ",5,2023,12,09
127,An oasis in the hustle and bustle. ,"Beyond the eye-popping ambience, the staff in every role is comprised of highly competent, customer focused, personable professionals. A great choice for anyone, and an absolute must for business travelers!!!",5,2023,12,09
127,Excellent hotel and amazing service .Would definitely stay again.,"This hotel is exceptional and great service.
The staff are amazing humble and efficient too.
I don’t think I could say anything bad about this place .z
The bed we had in the Executive king was the best I’ve ever slept in .
Not only was it huge but it was the most comfortable mattress and pillows .",5,2023,12,07
127,Night out in Town.,"Wonderful views of the City of London, fabulous pool and spa, great service, delicious breakfast. Staff really do go out of their way to make you feel welcome.

Good location, right across the road from Liverpool St Station and 15 walk from Shoreditch shopping & nightlife, plus around  the corner is the historical Spitalfields Market. ",5,2023,12,04
127,Weekend trip to London. Loved the location. ,"Fabulous hotel! Everything 5 star. 
Spa is lovely and facial was excellent. Would stay there again. All staff extremely well trained. Rooms are very well designed and had everything to make our stay comfortable. ",5,2023,12,04
127,Such a delightful experience!,"Pan Pacific delivered an exceptional experience! My go to hotel when I'm in London from now on! Amazing view, super friendly staff, great service! I feel so sorry that I did not discover this hotel earlier...",5,2023,12,04
127,As Close to Perfect as It Gets,"No hotel is perfect, but the Pan Pacific London comes very close. I have stayed several times over the last couple of years (since the pandemic) and each stay is as good, if not better, than the last. The service throughout the hotel is attentive, responsive, and comes with personal recognition of my needs (and they even keep notes that are applied to future visits without having to be asked/reminded). The rooms are well appointed and very comfortable. The service and offerings of the restaurants, bars, and lounge are exceptional and delivered promptly with attention to detail. Some may say that the location is better suited to business travelers, but its proximity to the Liverpool Street station (literally just over the road) provides easy access to all parts of the London metropolitan area for leisure guests just as well. And the local neighbourhood is vibrant with a good variety of dining/socialising venues within easy walk of the hotel.",5,2023,12,01
127,Oasis of calm in a bustling city,"Absolutely amazing. Oasis of calm in a bustling city. Generally one of the best hotel experiences ever. From the room, staff, facilities, pool, bars basically everything we’ve managed to try or experience was great. Oh and the bed, I really need to highlight this. I slept in many many hotels but this was the most comfortable bed ever. I should have checked the what mattress it was. Coctails in Silverleaf Bar were top, especially Verbena Olive Oil. I also need to mention Shiok!, amazing and delicious pastries. 
The hotel will definitely be first on my list when travelling to London somewhere in the future again. ",5,2023,11,29
127,Most comfortable bed ever! ,"Wonderful stay, beautiful room and great hotel. We will be staying again on our next trip to London :) I loved the pool, it's gorgeous. We didn't have the breakfast but we did have lunch in Straits Kitchen and the food was phenomenal. Thank you! ",5,2023,11,29
127,Haven of luxury on Central London,"Great location and access to the City and East end of London. The rooms are fabulous and incredibly well thought out. Had a great night's sleep and a really good breakfast. It's a shame we couldn't stay longer, but we'll definitely be back. ",5,2023,11,28
127,Breakfast - major improvement needed,"The breakfast was v poor. Streaky, not back bacon, anaeminc sausages and liquid scrambled eggs. Also, hash browns were tiny round balls and no beans or black pudding. Really really poor and for a top end hotel not acceptable. Premier Inn know how to provide an excellent breakfast; suggest you send your staff there to see what is required.",3,2023,11,27
127,Easily my favourite hotel in London,"We always try to stay here when we're in London - the hotel is fantastic!

Staff are all warm, friendly and welcoming.  On our most recent trip it was nice to have been recognised by one of the staff whilst waiting for the lift as a returning guest.  We arrived about an hour before check in hoping to be able to drop off our bags and were plesantly surprised when we could check in early.

I really like the pale wood colour palette and decor, so many 5 star hotels have dark wood which I really don't like.

The rooms are really good, a nice size with comfortable beds and a great bathroom.  There's power sockets, all with USB dotted around the place which is a revelation.  Too many hotels lack power sockets, particularly by the side of the bed.",5,2023,11,27
127,Luxury and comfort,"What a lovely hotel.  Staff very attentive. Lovely room with very comfortable bed.  Pool and sauna on 4th floor were a welcome respite. 
Gym well equipped although would benefit from being cooler... I think that's my only complaint
In a good location with plenty of markets , eateries and bars within walking distance
Will definitely return",5,2023,11,26
127,Room for improvement,"Overall the stay was good but the breakfast experience was very disappointing and well below expectations.

Check-in was efficient and friendly, luggage stored and then transported to our room.

The room was very comfortable and nicely arranged/decorated with a luxurious feel. Bathroom was spacious and well appointed. Lots of thoughtful extras in the room were appreciated although we didn’t make use of all.

Straits Kitchen dinner booking was very nice, relaxed atmosphere and friendly/attentive staff. Meal was very good, Christmas set menu. Quite expensive.

Ginger Lily. Cocktails and drinks after dinner, nicely decorated bar but lacking in atmosphere. Seating not particularly comfortable.

Wellness area. Pool has wow factor, plenty of seating loungers, changing rooms clean with lockers, plenty of towels. Steam room out of order, sauna available but didn’t use (located within men’s changing area).

Breakfast. We arrived after 1000, as breakfast was served until 1100. We didn’t book a time but had paid for breakfast with our package. This was a big disappointment to us, and one of the reasons we chose a hotel with these facilities over another hotel which was located closer to the west end. We didn’t get seated until around 1045, there was a lot of people queuing before us although there did appear to be tables available. The staff did their best to help and were obviously under pressure in the situation. We didn’t have any hot food, and ended up with a few Buffet items, and coffee.
It would appear from reading reviews post experience this is an ongoing issue for the hotel, and frankly for a well appointed 5 star hotel the breakfast arrangements fall well short of what was expected. I have travelled extensively and do not ever recall having a similar experience. A buffet is not normally an issue as it is self service, it only takes minutes to clear/set a table.

Check out was ok, a short wait which was expected considering it was close to noon, one of the hotel staff stored our luggage whilst we waited. We explained that we were happy with the stay and our disappointment about breakfast to the front desk staff member at check out. 

Communication with hotel before and during stay was good via email.",3,2023,11,26
127,Stay here! ,"The hotel staff make an effort at every turn. They are beyond helpful and look out for you at all times. Concierge helped us contact Old Trafford for a change in timing and to watch for a parcel. Breakfast staff were understanding and could remember me by the 3rd day, the buffet spread was huge by Europe standards and we enjoyed it thoroughly. The temperature in room was lovely and bathroom was nicely heated so you don't feel cold! They gave plush robes and slippers, which they laid out during turndown service. Even provided ice buckets and lovely calming sachets of tea. I particularly loved the amenities- Diptyque. The hotel is just right across from Liverpool Street Station and it was a straight train from Heathrow. Superb location! We had a wonderful stay and will definitely return! ",5,2023,11,26
127,Extra Charges are Over-the-Top,"The rooms were nice but the little extra charges add up - a bowl of soup via room service is already expensive at £10 and when you add £5 delivery charge and service on top, at £16 it's a total rip-off. The 5% so-called ""discretionary"" service charge on the entire stay can be a substantial amount of money and is automatically added to your bill so not really discretionary at all. I find these things cheeky verging on dishonest. The service certainly didn't warrant any additional fee.",2,2023,11,23
127,Great hotel and the best staff and service ever !,"Great hotel, great location in the city next to Liverpool St station and the best staff and service I've ever experienced from a large London hotel :)

Never previously stayed at a Pan Pacific hotel or brand but we will for sure use this hotel again in the future.",5,2023,11,20
127,Outstanding,"Second time staying here, the hotel is simply outstanding. Very kindly received a room upgrade, large and super comfortable room with everything you could need, meticulously clean and made up twice a day. Pool and gym are also fantastic. Staff are incredibly friendly and helpful without the stuffiness of some five star hotels.  Worth every penny, will be my go to hotel in London.",5,2023,11,19
127,A short break to chill out and a very chilled place to do so . ,"From the moment you arrive the service is friendly and helpful from doorman , receptionist and all staff. Great location , great food , beautiful room . A relaxing break in a wonderful setting with easy access to the rest of London with Liverpool Street so close . ",5,2023,11,19
127,FABULOUS SUITE AND EXPERIENCES ,Returned two more times in September and October 2023 this time we stayed in a suite - what a wonderful experience - everything was seamless from check in to every element of the stay.  Food was delicious I particularly loved the breakfasts in Straits kitchen - room service is also excellent.  We had mocktails for the first time in the bar which were delicious.  We were also celebrating an occasion during our October stay and we were delighted with our birthday flowers and sweet treats and drinks.  The pool is fabulous too brilliant for a quick dip after traveling.  The suite was perfect and so amazing to stay in - The Pan Pacific are back to top form.  We’re seriously considering living there in a Sky Residence! Keep it up! ,5,2023,11,19
127,Beautiful decor rooms v  comfortable great staff service v comfortable after a flight in from Iceland we reach here at 9,"Amazing reception Alex was wonderful

127,Excellent 5 star service,"If you want amazing customer service in the heart of the city this is the place. The individuality of service makes you feel special from the moment you walk in the door. Not stuffy just absolutely ensuring you enjoy your stay. The breakfast is also outstanding, the food quality is off the charts. The rooms are beautiful and have a real wow about them!",5,2023,11,13
127,Best stay in years in London.,"Truly 5* experience. We’ve been looking for a new hotel (to us) as we’ve found since Covid a lot of the hotels we previously stayed in lacked any kind of customer service. So we tried here.  I’m so happy we did. The hotel itself is beautiful. The rooms are well thought out and everything you need (including Dyson hairdryers!) are provided.  
I had a wonderful nights sleep. The only niggle was the curtains didn’t close all the way they are electronic and because of this they finished slightly short of the wall meaning light came through.
The staff were really helpful and friendly.  We felt that our stay mattered to them. We are booked to return as although it’s a bit out the tube is located around the corner meaning easy access to anywhere you need to go.  It’s nice to stay away from the crowds and have some peace!",5,2023,11,13
127,"1000/10, will be staying again ","Absolutely amazing service, the staff were gorgeous and the hotel had an amazing smell throughout. It was STUNNING!!!

",5,2023,11,11
127,Perfect in Every Way,"Everything was outstanding—the room, the toiletries, the service, the facilities, the food, the cocktails… I usually stay at The Connaught when in London with my partner. He couldn’t join me for this trip, so I decided to check out the Pan Pacific due to the stellar reviews. Every aspect of the hotel lived up to my expectations—especially the service. In my jet-lagged state, I had mistakenly booked myself through Amex for a Tuesday arrival; when I arrived on Monday and realized my error, Martin at the front desk went to every effort to make sure that I received a refund, enjoyed a drink while I waited, and was rebooked ASAP into an upgraded room. Also, the service at Straights Café might be some of the best that I’ve ever experienced while dining in London. I’m already looking forward to my next stay. ",5,2023,11,06
127,Wonderful London experience !,"Amazing experience , quite unlike any other London hotel, beautiful facilities, superb food, staff a notch above , service with a smile. Nothing too much trouble .  The room and views were outstanding both in size but also in terms of quality!",5,2023,11,05
127,Great stay,"Overall a lovely hotel in a great location. I wouldn’t hesitate to stay again. The rooms are large , modern and very quiet (we were on a very high floor) and the in room amenities (fluffy robe, Dyson hairdryer, tea and coffee , toiletries) are all very luxurious. The pool area is nice and relaxing and you can even order drinks to have at the side of the pool. 

I’m probably being a bit picky but  I’m knocking off 1 star for a few reasons:

-breakfast needs to be improved. It takes ages to get your tea and coffee (often arriving after you’ve eaten) and by the time it arrives it’s cold. I would also prefer a pot of tea rather than them bringing a cup. Twice we were brought the wrong food order at breakfast which was frustrating. I was pleased that the hotel could provide me with Gf toast and that the buffet items have allergens listed  , however, there weren’t any other gf options at the buffet for me except yoghurt and fruit. Weirdly even the bacon and cheese said it had gluten in it. It would be great to see some GF cereal, pastries (even just shop bought ones) and some gf cooked breakfast options 

-watch out for the discretionary charge per person per night on your bill. No one mentions this to you but it’s just cheekily added on. No one seems quite clear what this is for and you can ask for it to be removed 

- as part of our stay we were given vouchers advising that we could have a free cocktail per person night. On our first night the staff in the bar downstairs made us feel very awkward about using the vouchers and tried to take the vouchers off us so we could only use them once even though it stated on them we could use them each night. The staff went  back and forth with each other discussing this before we eventually got our drinks. The next night we went to the bar upstairs and the barman was much nicer.",4,2023,11,01
127,Luxurious stay,"We stayed at the Pan Pacific Liverpool Street for the first time and had a wonderful stay. We were really impressed by the lovely room with a great view and amazingly spacious bathroom, with every little detail thought of, to the lovely spa with a great size pool and a view over Liverpool Street. Every member of staff we met was very welcoming and attentive, we felt like it was a luxurious stay and definitely want to return one day!",5,2023,10,29
127,Highly recommend!,Everything was top notch from the concierges to the waitstaff in the main dining room. Delicious food. Rooms were meticulous and perfectly maintained during the stay. Excellent fitness center.  Just a 5 star experience all around. ,5,2023,10,24
127,Class on another level.,"Flawless in every way. This is my favourite place in the whole world. I love everything about Pan Pacific from the people to the building, it's perfect from start to finish. I especially enjoy room service and the service one team.",5,2023,10,24
127,One of the best hotels in the world,"This is one of my top 5 hotels in the world now.  The bedding is unbelievably comfortable, the staff is wonderful, and the food here is delicious.

Their various restaurants and bars are perfect choice for if you’re feeling lazy and don’t want to go far, but really I just can’t get over how comfortable their rooms are - very well designed and the textiles are just very high quality - so much so I’m looking to see if I can buy a bathrobe from them and have them ship it home.  Lastly, I’m a huge fan of Diptyque and it’s what they stock so that’s a plus!  They also have some cool arts scattered about which I love.

I was really sick most of this trip and didn’t get to try out some amenities like their pool and spa, so hopefully next time!  Looking forward to be back here.",5,2023,10,22
127,Truly a 5 star hotel. ,"One of the finest hotels I have stayed.  From the design of the physical property , the attention to detail and wonderful service.  We were there only one night and my wife asked if we could stay a few more!  Can't wait to stay at another of the Pan Pacific properties.  Don't miss this one. ",5,2023,10,17
127,Perfect high-end hotel experience.,"I can't recommend it highly enough - every detail was perfect. The room was great; the pool was great; the food was great; and the staff were super-helpful, professional, friendly and courteous at all times. It was a wonderful luxury weekend break.",5,2023,10,17
127,Well located 5* hotel,Great new-ish hotel opposite Liverpool Street Station. Location is great for folks who need accommodation in the City. Tastefully set up and service is impeccable. Breakfast buffet is a little lacking in selection (and slightly pricey) but overall this is a welcome addition to the area.,5,2023,10,16
127,Best hotel I’ve ever stayed in. ,"I can’t think of one thing I disliked about this hotel. It’s the little things I appreciated the most- friendly staff,  complimentary water upon check in and check out, comfortable and clean room, excellent food, Dyson hair dryer, chrome cast tv, automatic curtains, mini bar, and MORE!",5,2023,10,13
127,Wonderful experience at Pan Pacific Hotel London,Excellent 5 star hotel in the Bishopsgate area. Hotel staff extremely accommodating to both business and tourist travelers.

127,JUST WOW!,"I cannot recommend this hotel enough.  Everything was just perfect from the welcoming staff to the amazing rooms and the delicious in room dining.  Location was also perfect, just steps from the tube and in a lovely neighborhood.  This will become my home away from home whenever I am in London.  The hotel exceeded every expectation.",5,2023,10,03
127,Great choice with room for improvement ,Wonderful hotel. Great views. Great facilities. Great service. Only cons are the bed wasn't comfortable and breakfast is expensive. So some of the patisserie from the Cafe were off. Decided to give all stars as they tried their best to keep us happy. The location is also very good with many restaurants nearby such as Sushi Samba and The Ivy. ,5,2023,10,01
127,Amazing hotel. Great service. Nice touches of elegance.,"Incredible service, great layout, 5-Star Housekeeping. 

I like the layout of the king bed. I like how the hotel has it’s separate driveway. The curvature feel of room is nice and always a good sign. Nice cabinet space and nespresso machine.

The bathroom amenities are one of the best I’ve seen for a 5 star in London. 50ml diptyque lotion, shower gel, shampoo and conditioner are provided. Bamboo dental kit & bamboo comb. 

Gym is 24 hours and is has a good set of machines and weights, I was impressed as that is harder to find in London. Great pool too but didn’t get a chance to use it this time. 

The concierge team is very nice too. I will come back for sure.",5,2023,10,01

127,Excellent Stay!,"We were in London in September 2023 to move my daughter into a university residence and looked for a hotel in close proximity.
 Chose the Pan Pacific for five nights based on the reviews and its location. We were not disappointed.
The hotel is new, very clean and very welcoming. The staff were incredibly friendly particularly those at the front desk, concierge and front door.  There was one hostess in the Orchid Lounge who was quite unfriendly but that didn’t change our overall view that this is a hotel with a vibrant and engaging staff who really want to make your stay an outstanding one. 
The location is also excellent. I’ve been to London several times but I have never stayed in the City - opting instead  for Holborn or the West end. 
 The proximity to Liverpool station was great as well as the proximity to Spitalfields. I think you do have to be cognizant of the neighbourhood to the east and just ensure you’re paying attention to where you’re going.
The  room was spacious and clean. The bathroom was just awesome with a huge shower and lots of fluffy white towels And unlike many hotels housekeeping staff did not skimp on bath products and the bath products were outstanding. 
The only complaint we had about the room (that was quickly rectified) was that there was a bizarre musty smell around the bed and pillows.  Sufficiently so that we spoke we spoke to the front desk and were told that housekeeping staff spray the pillows with water after they make the beds to get rid of wrinkles. We found this quite bizarre -  in exchange for wrinkle free pillow linen you were getting mildewy pillows.   I’d suggest the hotel re-consider this practice and if we go back to the Pan Pacific I will actually call ahead of time to make sure that there isn’t going to be an issue with the linens. 
All in all a great stay. 
",5,2023,09,24
127,Fabulous infinity pool,The Pan Pacific is a five star hotel with a fabulous infinity pool. I have stayed many times - always for work - and have an established routine of going for a swim before walking to my office. The staff are fantastic and nothing is too much trouble. I haven’t eaten at any of the restaurants to date but I have had room service for breakfast and the food is great. The bedrooms are super comfortable and despite being in the middle of the city absolutely silent (I have trialled a few City hotels and this is often not the case).,5,2023,09,21
127,"Misleading, Rude, Poor Room quality - need i say more.","Our recent visit to the Pan Pacific London was quite disheartening, to put it mildly. From the moment we set foot on the property, it was evident that this 5-star hotel didn't live up to our expectations. It's really unfortunate because when Anne Golden managed the hotel, it was among London's finest. However, under new management, it's rapidly deteriorating and in my view is no longer a luxury establishment.

Allow me to elaborate - the room assigned to us had an issue with noisy flooring which continually disrupted our young daughter every time we moved around. This made our stay uneasy and anything but restful.

Our dissatisfaction grew as we experienced conflicts over breakfast charges, something one would expect to be a simple task in a high-end hotel. But the most significant disappointment was the false promise of valet parking. Despite advertising this service, we were informed in the early evening upon returning to the hotel that they couldn't accommodate our rental car. As tourists from New Zealand who aren't well-versed in London's parking conditions, this created unwanted stress during our vacation, especially with a young child in tow.

To make matters worse, the staff's demeanor was unpleasant and only added insult to injury. Sadly, our stay took an even more distressing turn when my husband was mugged on his way back to the hotel while searching for parking because they refused to valet our vehicle – so I must extend a heartfelt thank you to the Pan Pacific Team for your exceptional service, or rather your deplorable service.

All things considered, our stay at the Pan Pacific London fell drastically short of the 5-star experience we had hoped for. At best, this hotel is now a 3.5 star, and you should really consider other 5 star London hotels.",1,2023,09,18
127,"Really loved our stay, we´ll be back",Have to mention Emily Gibson - Jones at the reception for her kindness and service. She made our family feel very special. but all of the staff at this hotel are very awere of the costumers and have a high degree of serviceness.,5,2023,09,18
127,Amazing city hotel but DO NOT EXPECT BREAKFAST,"Pan Pacific is a lovely 5 star hotel with excellent facilities and service and I have enjoyed many trips there. HOWEVER… we were unable to have breakfast on two occasions, the facility is far too small and under staffed. We were instructed to come back after 30 mins, to then be told again no space and a queue of 12 people in front of us. We were forced to grab a quick greggs instead which is far from ideal!! Has put me off returning unfortunately",2,2023,09,17
127,Concerns Regarding My Experience at Pan Pacific London,"Review for Pan Pacific Hotel:

I have been a loyal guest of the Pan Pacific Hotel and have stayed multiple times in the past without issue. I am a Platinum member.  However, my most recent experience compels me to share my deep disappointment and frustration.

Firstly, the floor in our room squeaked loudly, causing disruptions and discomfort, especially for my young daughter. It's an oversight I wouldn't expect from a reputed hotel like Pan Pacific. 

Also, the noise tonight (Saturday) from within the Hotel is also very loud, so if you have young kids, it’s not family friendly at all - as I would say that most kids or even adults would struggle to sleep through that racket. We are located on the 15th floor and it’s like it right outside. 

My frustrations were further compounded during breakfast. Despite confirming on two separate occasions prior to our stay that breakfast was included in our room rate, we were rudely informed otherwise. The condescending manner in which this was conveyed was nothing short of shocking, a stark contrast from the courteous service I had previously come to expect from this establishment.

Before voicing my grievances on this platform, I made two attempts to communicate with the hotel through email. Unfortunately, no one deemed it necessary to respond. It's heartbreaking to witness the decline in the standards I once associated with Pan Pacific London. I'm seriously contemplating cutting my stay short and have decided against any future reservations - the Shangri-La The Shard, London, is a much better option for the same price. 

While I understand that no service can be perfect all the time, the lack of acknowledgment and remediation is simply unacceptable. I truly hope the management uses this as an opportunity for improvement. Future guests should never have to face such issues.",1,2023,09,16
127,Amazing hotel!,"I loved everything about this hotel. Wonderful service, beautiful rooms, friendly staff ( must mention Hamid!) , small touches that make a memorable stay. Location is also great for exploring central London, very close to the new and very efficient Elizabeth Line. A lot of amazing restaurants within walking distance. I can't wait to stay there again!",5,2023,09,10
127,Superb 👌🏻,"This was by far the most luxurious stay in the hotel experience. 
Starting from the first step into this hotel, being seen, heard and cared for with the most attentive personnel.
Irina, concierge, is such a warm, delightful, professional and best at listening and addressing any questions in calm, time efficient manner.
Room was just what I needed to enjoy and switch my emotional state… 
Greeting in my room by the most kind, peace emitting girl (I am not sure why I didn’t remember her name…).
The best experience ✨",5,2023,09,05
127,Perfect city stay,"Stayed for my husbands birthday and was very impressed with the hotel, staff and all of its facilities.

Beautiful decor, perfect breakfast buffet and the swimming pool with floor to ceiling windows was breathtaking.

I would definitely return for a special occasion.",5,2023,09,05
127,Absolutely incredible ,"We stayed in room  1909 for 3 nights in September. The bed was super soft but comfortable. The air-conditioning was simple to adjust to get the room to an ideal temperature for sleeping. Good selection in the mini bar and ice was provided very quickly when requested. We ordered room service on the first night, and it was excellent. Room and bathroom were spotless and cleaned every day with turn- down service on an evening also provided. Everything you could possibly need was provided and more. Practical items such as iron and ironing board to things you never thought you needed, such as a velvety soft bathrobe and slippers. The slippers came in 2 sizes and actually fit my husband's size 11 feet, and my size 6 (a rarity in hotel slippers).  The separate shower and bath were a nice surprise,plus the little touches such as the bath salts and loofah. Toiletries provided smelled divine!
The bathrobes were useful for using in the spa area and pool. The pool was pretty quiet for the majority of our stay, so it made for a very relaxing swim. There are set times for kids swimming. We ate fabulous club sandwiches and had a glass of wine whilst enjoying the loungers and views. The pool is a great temperature and a good size for relaxing or swimming lengths. There are good facilities in the changing rooms, including lockers, showers, hairdryers, and deodorant. The steam room and sauna are also in the changing rooms. One great feature is the spinner for your swimwear. Does a good job to get most of the water out your swimwear, which you can then dry on the heated towel rail in your room. 
We ate in Shiok, The Orchid Lounge and Straits Kitchen. All staff members were friendly and attentive, nothing was too much trouble and all service was with a smile and a chat. I recommend the noodles at breakfast, the Kopi tiam afternoon tea, the Rendang Jacob's ladder, hot and sour lobster soup, and mango panna cotta. 
We enjoyed cocktails in Ginger Lily and the Straits Bar on all 3 evenings. Staff are knowledgeable and will recommend which cocktails to choose.

I would like to thank all the staff for their kindness and hospitality. You really make the hotel what it is. A slice of Singapore in the heart of London. We look forward to our next visit. Mr and Mrs Lax.",5,2023,09,04

127,A Hotel that is so Fantastic you Won’t Want to Leave,"We were fortunate to stay at two lovely hotels in London during our recent trip—one in the Bankside neighborhood and the other we chose was the Pan Pacific.  Both our guide book and Tripadvisor highly recommended the first hotel we stayed at but a bit confused since the Pan Pacific for us was a class above the rest and surprised it isn’t ranked higher!  

The check in experience was great and despite us checking in early they were sweetly able to accommodate us and get us a room quickly.   The view from our 14th floor room was fantastic of the area.   

We had booked a deluxe double room.  The pictures on the website don’t do it justice—it was gorgeous and so vibrant.   The room was gigantic for London standards for the four of us with two comfortable double beds with ample spacing between and a low slung couch with a chair which was perfect to sit on and eat breakfast in the morning before starting our day.  I loved that the room had a bit of an entry way so the children could put their shoes their which were quite smelly after a day of traipsing through the city.   

The bathroom was one of the best bathrooms we’ve stayed in for a hotel.  I love that the toilet area was separate and a had a glorious sunken tub which was good to soak in afterwards and the shower was so relaxing.   The Diptyque bath products were such an indulgence!  

We slept so well during our stay that the room was truly a cocoon of relaxation that perfectly allowed us to recharge from our stay.  It was our first time staying in a Pan Pacific hotel and it will definitely not be our last!",5,2023,09,02
127,A mixed experience,"I have stayed in a number of Pan Pacific hotels across Asia, and always had an excellent experience and was expecting the same in London. In the end, I ended up having a mixed experience. The room was fantastic and large for a London hotel with great facilities. We stayed for two nights and breakfast on the first day was excellent. On the second day, breakfast was an extremely frustrating and chaotic experience with us  having to consistently ask two or three times for basics like coffee (with incorrect orders eventually brought to the table), milk for the coffee, water, toast for the table etc. Although the food was good, the overall experience was extremely frustrating and not the relaxing five star breakfast I had expected. In fairness, the duty manager offered us a reduced fee for the breakfast, which I accepted. At checkout we did not receive an itemised bill and found it difficult to ascertain from reception why we had been charged an extra approximately £40. After approximately 10 minutes of reception, trying to work out why, it transpired that we had been charged a ‘discretionary’ service fee for the housekeeping staff. I thought the housekeeping staff were excellent, so I was happy to pay this fee, but found it underhand that this was not communicated in advance, and that it does not appear clearly on any bill. The reception staff appeared to be mystified as to where this extra £40 charge had come from for 10 minutes which would have been instantly solved by presenting an itemised bill either at checkout for the night before, as is common practice in many hotels. Although the facilities are excellent, the stay was somewhat spoiled by aspects of the service, and I would certainly hesitate to return.",3,2023,08,31
127,"Stunning hotel, view and service ","This is one of the best hotels in London that I have stayed in. Relatively new, the hotel is designed for a luxuriously relaxing stay. I received a surprise upgrade to a beautiful suite with stunning views across the city and a bath tub and shower suite unlike any other. Honestly, I would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2023,08,28
127,A Rare Jewel,"This is a good hotel focussing on the people they entertain rather than the profit they make. Very refreshing. They are efficient, polite and most of all caring. Nothing is too much trouble and the staff go to extraordinary lengths to make you welcome.",5,2023,08,28
127,Great facilities and beautiful rooms so what tarred by service,"This is a beautiful hotel. The rooms are clean, well appointed. The swimming pool is a bonus and the location is great. We did have issues with the service though and for a 5* hotel, you don't expect that. Breakfast was chaotic - drinks forgotten, some of our party not receiving items, other parts of the order turning up incorrect or cold. 
I also didn't appreciate the non-itemised bill - they lump all charges together making it impossible to see what you've been charged for during your stay. It took 15 minutes at check out when I queried my account to be told that a 'discretionary service charge' is added per room, per night to the bill, causing the discrepancy. It was that discretionary they had failed to tell me it was going to be added!! I wonder how many customers don't realise?! 
",3,2023,08,27
127,Loved the London Pan Pacific,"One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. What did I love about it?
Everything. 

Quiet. Remote curtains. View over London. Food. Toiletries in the room.

So many hotels (I travel a lot), try and fob you off with a terrible room - or a different room from the type you have booked. 
Necessitating moving.

Not the Pan Pacific.   ",5,2023,08,27
127,Celebration Treat,Stayed one night as birthday treat. Really excellent modern room with great facilities. Warm welcome on arrival and speedy check in. Good service and drinks choices in Ginger Lily bar. Great choice of food and drink venues in the immediate area.,5,2023,08,26

127,"Fabulous stay, a lovely experience.","Fabulous experience, beautiful hotel with exemplary staff. Fantastic with children, provide them with slippers and robes too, truly inclusive.

The rooms gorgeous, more than comfortable, spotless and attention to detail. The staff made me feel special as we were celebrating my birthday and retirement.",5,2023,08,23
127,Excellent sound proof room with great staff for 1 week stay,"Excellent hospitality, great sound proof room with best sleep quality. Staff are very friendly and professional from check-in, house keeping, breakfast, pool, until check out. One of the best hotel in Europe, way better than other International chain that we've stay both US, Europe, and Asia.",5,2023,08,20
127,London Pan Pacific ,Great hotel in an excellent location for business and fun. Price is comparable to other hotels in the area with all the latest amenities. I would suggest adding USB c outlets as that is what many devices now require.,5,2023,08,19
127,Lovely hotel and staff. Food can improve,"Amazing hotel always enjoy my stay here as rooms are really clean, well kept and overall brilliant. Heated floor in the bathroom and electronic blinds really lovely. 

I was sick during my stay and ordered room service of plain pasta, my partner ordered a beef burger. My penne was the same price which I thought was quite unfair and cheeky! 

I was too unwell to complain at check out but wish I was as I would have asked for this to be refunded as the pasta wasn’t cooked properly either! ",4,2023,08,15
127,60th birthday,"Outstanding service and facilities. 3x Rooms were all superb, very comfortable and well equipped. We had a few minor issues at check-in which I would not expect in such a hotel but the duty manager went over and beyond what I would have expected to compensate for this inconvenience. We had a fantastic short stay . ",5,2023,08,14
127,Pan Pacific London,Absolutely dream of place to be! we loved every second that we stayed in! it is our yearly staycasion for our anniversary and never lets us down! People actually recognize us from previous times we have been there and there are all very friendly.,5,2023,08,13

127,Wow!,"Amazing in every way, couldnt recommend this enough. Everyone out of their way to make the experience special and one to remember.

All staff were super attentive, couldn’t do enough for you. The amenities were fab and felt really relaxed and rejuvenated after our stay. 

Can’t wait to return!!",5,2023,08,08
127,Just WOW,"We had an amazing stay. Everything was just perfect. I liked the individual touches for my daughters birthday.  Room was clean, excellent view, amazing food, great service I can just go on and on. Thank you Pan Pacific we will definitely return again.",5,2023,08,07
127,Perfect place,"We popped in here for a drink. We were one 88 year old, one autistic man and 3 fussy people. They looked after us so well even bringing us a cake for our 88 year olds birthday today. 
What a beautiful place to be. We will definitely return here many more times.",5,2023,08,06
127,Pan Pacific Perfection in London!,"Stayed here for two nights with my 13 year old daughter.  Our stay was faultless.  We were allocated a quiet room, as requested, on the 16th floor.  Not only was it quiet (literally heard not a single noise inside the hotel) it was a corner room with phenomenal 180 degree views for miles.  Electric drapes and curtains showcase the wonderful cityscape views and feeling of being right in the city. Soundproofing to the outside also excellent.  Location is perfect.  2 mins from Liverpool St station, 15 min walk to Tower of London. 

On arrival we had a fantastically informative room tour from our host, who was a great guy who was very friendly without being intrusive.   He was passionate about the hotel.  Bathroom is exquisite.  Three separate areas make sharing the bathroom so easy and practical (something most hotels don’t think about!).  Standard of finish is perfect, stylish tiling, gorgeous heated floor, diptyque cosmetics, Dyson hairdryer, fluffy towels…it was heaven.  Bedroom is stunning and again the finishing and attention to detail is second to none. Super king bed, luxurious bedding, and the room lighting is effective and has been very well thought out.

Wellbeing floor and infinity swimming pool is beautiful.  Spotlessly clean, fluffy towels, pool at a perfect temperature and great view of the surroundings. 

Every member of staff we came into contact with was very friendly and professional.  The Pan Pacific brand really knows how to do hotels.  This is my new favourite London hotel.  If you like understated luxury, style, design and discreet service you will love it here.  We will definitely be back - thank you for a wonderful stay!",5,2023,08,04
127,Great Jugs,"Very good meal and excellent service, but for me the stand out for this venue is the beer served in really nice pewter tankards, just tastes so good. Very intersting menu choices and lots of choices and a really extensive wine list.",5,2023,08,02
127,Perfect family stay ,"We stayed at Pan Pacific London with our 7 month old daughter Gwen and can safely say this was one of the most outstanding hotel stays we have ever experienced. 

Every single member of staff went out of their way to ensure we had the perfect stay, our preferences passed seamlessly between the teams to ensure our needs were meet at every opportunity. Our daughter particularly loved the lion teddy she was given upon check-in. Our room had been personalised to our preferences with flowers and our favourite drinks and snacks waiting in the room when we arrived.

The pool space is incredible and daughter loved splashing around during the kids hours in the pool.

Finally, we dined in Straits Kitchen, Bruno was a superb host, ensuring our daughter was entertained while recommending some truly fantastic dishes. 

All in all, a perfect stay. Thank you to the whole team at Pan Pacific!",5,2023,07,31
127,Exceptional in every way.,"An exceptional experience from booking to check-out. Every aspect of our stay was perfect. 
I stayed with my son and we booked a double, double room. (With 2 queen beds). 
The rooms are spacious and luxurious. The beds are super comfortable and my son and I slept really well. Every need has been thought of, and if anything else is required, guest services are a phone call away. Within minutes you’ll have what you need. Because what truly sets this hotel apart, is the team. Everyone is so professional and friendly. They genuinely care about your guest experience and you being happy. It makes so much difference. I’ve never been made to feel so welcome at a hotel before. They also really looked after my son which I am so very grateful for. The hotel is perfect for families and children! 
The facilities at the hotel are also excellent. 
My son and I really enjoyed our swim in the beautiful pool (set at the perfect temperature). There are also steam room and saunas in the changing areas. 
Breakfast is also amazing, I would really recommend it. There was so much choice and every taste is catered for. Nothing is too much trouble. 
The excellent location is another plus. The hotel is close to fabulous restaurants and just around the corner from Liverpool St station and underground. We chose to get a taxi from Kings Cross to the hotel though and this was a good option as we had heavy luggage.
We are very much looking forward to returning to our new favourite hotel.",5,2023,07,30
127,Perfect! Will return ,Amazing and just perfect in every way. My wife and I loved the whole experience from the moment we arrived. Our room was incredible and the whole team took care of everything with a smile. The food and drinks we perfect ,5,2023,07,29
127,July 2023 London Tour,"It was a very pleasant stay in Pan Pacific London last week.  The hotel condition, the staff, the services are all excellent.  Special thanks to concierge desk which is extremely helpful and accommodated all special requests including booking transportation at 4:00am.  The hotel location is also great which is only minute walk to Liverpool station and not too far to some sight seeing spots(e.g. 15 - 20 mins walk to London Tower Bridge; Borough Market). Thank you for your great services!

127,The standard of excellence,"This is the standard to which 5 stars truly defines.  Welcomed from the moment you walk in the front doors, every request met (exceeded even!), and dining experiences to remember.  The room, pool, spa, lounge are exceptional, with service to back it all up.  It poured rain in London on our visit - we didn’t care.  We indulged in this fabulous property and all the people who made it worth while.  We have already recommended to friends and intend on visiting again.",5,2023,07,24
127,Wonderful,"Fantastic l, could not fault.
A personable, wonderful experience.
Best hotel in London.

Super cocktails in Ginger Lilly.
Straits kitchen a must.",5,2023,07,18
127,A superb hotel,A beautiful hotel in a great location.  The staff are amazing.  We had a suite and the views and facilities are excellent.  Love the Dyson hairdryer.  The toiletries are Diptique. The coffee in the bar is excellent - important for us! ,5,2023,07,17
127,Great hotel for families,"We got connecting rooms with our teenage sons, which was perfect. The spaces are generous and the beds comfortable, if a little soft.
Housekeeping was fantastic, I've never seen so much care put in, twice a day no less, our sheets had an iron run over them.
Staff throughout was friendly and charming, the breakfast was delightfully generous, and on most days very good. It would be lovely if one of the unused dining rooms could be made available for families without small children.
The location is great and we will stay here again!",5,2023,07,10
127,A slice of sweetness of the street,"We were struggling to work out our evening. We stopped at the St Germaine branded bar on Bishopsgate.

We were greeted by Elpee. From the outset they made us feel welcome and went above and beyond in making sure we were comfortable. They let us choose our seat, and set us up for what we expected to be a brief libation.

My disabled partner and I were really impressed with Elpees attentiveness and quality of service. Being in London and disabled it can be a hard to navigate and aggressive environment.

Our stop refreshed us, and made a it an exciting stop in our brief to the city. ",5,2023,07,09
127,No luxury. Wrong advertisement,Terrible mattress. No luxury element although it advertises as 5-star luxurious hotels with high rates. Sockets in rooms work only for UK devices. Except location everything is terrible. Matresses are probably from victorian times,1,2023,07,09
127,Amazing short stay for family or four,I‘ve stayed at a Pan Pacific in Singapore many years ago and loved it. But unfortunately not all Asian hotel chains provide the same level of service and quality at their Western locations. The Pan Pacific London is a great exception. Stayed with my family of four (incl 2 teenage boys) and we all loved it. Will come back 100%,5,2023,07,06
127,Excellent Experience ,"Great location and service. Convenient to Insurance/Financial District and Liverpool St. Station. Staff is customer focused and delivers excellent service.

127,Fantastic five days in London with family,"Great hotel, with fantastic rooms. Great view. Very clean. Very large bathroom. Very friendly staff. Turndown service on the evening very convenient, replacing towels, if needed. Very good breakfast. Used the hotel transfer from and to Gatwick: very smooth service.",5,2023,07,02
127,Afternoon tea with a Singaporean twist = perfection,"Treated a few of my girl friends to this stunning Singaporean afternoon tea, for my birthday. Benjamin and his team gave us the 5 star service and we had such a luxurious afternoon. Everything was delicious! Sad we didn’t get to meet Cherish Finden but will have to go back !",5,2023,06,28
127,Not the Pan Pacfic Hotel I expected,"Had a great experience with their Singapore location before so i thought we’d try their new london location. Everything went well during check in. Doorman assisted us with our luggage and kind enough to orient us with our room’s features. The room and bathroom were clean, bed was comfotable among other features of a good hotel. However, its during check out when i said to myself that doubletree inn is better than this! We requested to see if we can check out at 2pm because our car service will be picking us up at 2:20 Although they gave us 1 pm check out what is an hour difference? Front desk told us we can relax at their wellness center, thats fine. Upon check out the front desk guy easily checked us out and just gave us a “thumbs up” i was shocked! I mean thats it? Seeing we had 3 huge luggeges he’s not going to offer or call for assistance with our luggage? Or asked if we need help with a car or taxi? Nor did anyone volunteered to assist us locating their wellness center. I observed the front desk staff they were all just chit chatting and laughing not minding there are guests needing help! Doorman was at least nice enough to help store our luggage after we approached him. We ended up just walking around the area to kill time until our car arrived to take us to heathrow.
In a city where there are multitude of other great hotels to choose from i think you only have once chance of impressing a first time guest to see if theyd come stay again. This one is a “no thank you” in my book! Im excited the peninsual is opening in September! Thats all.",3,2023,06,28
127,Amazing experience for a good price,All staff were welcoming and went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our stay. The infinity pool was very relaxing and the amenities were exceptional. Would recommend this hotel for a relaxing time away,5,2023,06,28
127,Outstanding Hotel in every way,Hotel made a special celebration even better by upgrading us to a suite. Staff was very friendly and attentive. Hotel was modern and high tech. Location was very close to Liverpool Street Tube station. Will definitely stay again when in London.,5,2023,06,27
127,"A great hotel with average service, it’s missing the little things ","The hotel physically is lovely, location great, room and decor wonderful. It was just that the staff didn’t meet the same standards. Which was very disappointing, they lack that 5 star attitude of going above and beyond.

Wouldn’t stay again, there are better places in London.",3,2023,06,24
127,"Thank you for putting ""Care and Kindness"" back into travel!","The service was above and beyond, the hotel is very well maintained, the food is amazing, the spa is worth a visit. I can not say enough good things about my experience at this establishment. The staff makes you feel like an individual and truly seem to care about providing you with a relaxing yet entertaining time while abroad. Thank you for putting smiles on peoples faces again. The world could take a lesson from this hotel.",5,2023,06,23
127,A true modern uppscale stay!,"Overall this hotel exceeded my expectations. The location is great, super modern, clean and confortable, quiet and unpretentious.
Let me address upfront the few negatives of this stay:
	- The pool water was not perfectly clean and there was also some dirt on the surrounded floor. I don't mind the children classes in the restricted schedule since the reception staff kindly informed us soo. Nevertheless the pool didn't felt cleaned for a hotel of this class. It should be a open shower directly near the pool and the staff should inform people to take a shower before entering the pool (no one did).
	- The recpetion lobby feels somewhat small and mainly executive style.. they could have done so much more here.. maybe more suitable for the residences entrance than the proper hotel. 
	- Didn't like the reception desk so close to the near guest... it felt wrong. They should be more separated instead of the huge fake plants crowding the reception desks... the complimentary small cake was not good also. Overall not a good check in and first impression.
	- The extra charge prices at breakfast. For the price tag at least toast and different eggs styles should be included.
The remaining aspects of this stay were very good indeed. I really appreciated:
	- The huge bathroom. Modern, beautiful and functional. Clean aesthethic and amazing Diptyque bath products! Very nice indeed. I wish there were a bathtub though. In the first day a slight sewer smell appeared after using the shower but didn't felt any other time.
	- The size, design and confort of the room. Nice appointed mechanical curtains, very unique design, great furniture materials and perfect condition. Didn't like the carpet as some fibers come out easily. Overall a very pleasant room. 
	- Room cleaning was very good.
	- The hotel location was a big plus.
	- The hotel was quiet and relaxed at all times.

So would I return there? Definitely! I got a nice price and overall this stay exceed my expectations. The location was very good and overall I felt safe walking around. I just wish they focus more care in the reception, better cleaning in the pool area and the breakfast should be less expensive (or for this price not restricted to the buffet available).

127,"Hidden Gem & Thank You, Emily ","This hotel is a hidden gem in London, away from the wandering tourists but close enough to join them. The staff is top notch, in particular Emily, who was managing the overnight desk during my few days at the hotel, made my father and I feel so at home. She made the experience feel special.",5,2023,06,18
127,A must stay when in London.,"A must when visiting London.  Absolutely incredible service. Everything about the hotel is top quality. You feel very welcome, and that you are top priority. 
The service IMHO is unparalleled, and I have stayed at fine hotels around the world.",5,2023,06,16
127,"Lovely hotel, quality service and staff.","We stayed here as a couple for the start of my 40th birthday celebrations, usually staying at another similar hotel near Buckingham palace, but we are now wondering if we’ll ever go back to that one as this was the most perfect stay. 

The location is excellent, just minutes from Liverpool Street station, nice quiet area at the front of the hotel to pick up a cab and get dropped off too, so getting about is ideal. 

Hotel staff are a dream to deal with, second to none service, whatever you want, they will help, really great service, all so friendly and warm. 

Hotel itself is so clean and spacious, nice bars, lovely room, comfortable beds, beautiful city views, so quiet, you could hear a pin drop, lovely bathroom, great shower, the very best room service and turn down. 

We had breakfast in our room one morning and there was a little hiccup with an order but rectified quickly and we didn’t complain but were amazed to find on check out that they’d refunded us, very humbling to be looked after so well. 

Overall I can’t imagine anyone being unhappy with the stay here and if you do, I’d say they were the sort of people that are never satisfied and probably innately miserable.  

It’s a beautifully elegant hotel and we will definitely return, possibly for our next Christmas break, or sooner if we can. 

Excellence all the way, and thank you for my birthday cake, very happy to be so spoilt.",5,2023,06,03
127,Pleasant comfort in a world class city.,"Comfortable cool room with convenient modern amenities; also provided toothbrush, toothpaste, comb, shaver kits, amongst other helpful small items.   Great city view, very good room service once you can get a hold of them.  Bed was very comfortable and available drinking water was well appreciated.  Tesco is just around the corner, but ask concierge, as Google maps took us for a much farther Tesco than necessary.",5,2023,05,31
127,Solid stay,"Central hotel easy to get anywhere in london on the tube as Liverpool st station is across the street. Nicely appointed rooms although aircon too warm for this type of year and a lighter duvet  bedding preferable as it was overly warm, even lowering aircon, if in bed it got a bit too hot for a comfortable sleep. Would stay again",4,2023,05,31
127,Nothing else but wonderful,"Excellent ! Sometimes I make the choice for the traditional English style luxury hotel (like The Goring or Red Carnation hotels) but if you want to choose for a modern luxury hotel this should be your choice.
Very very friendly and personal experience. Great and fast check in and check out, wonderful staff all over en superb rooms. Nothing negative to mention.
We will return !",5,2023,05,31
127,A magnificent “home’ in busy London CBD,"When you have travelled for 16 hours to get to a destination, and been awake for the most part of 22 hours, one does not expect to be instantly reenergised and excited to be awake for another 5 hours, which we both did after having checked in to the PanPacific London. We were so thrilled to be no where else but this property for our start to a huge UK road-tripping holiday. We were very kindly and fortunately assigned their corner junior suite with unparalleled views of the Gherkin and Landon’s buzzing business district. To say it has A sense of Arrival to the property is undervaluing it, because it has the added rare feeling of having your own exquisite enclave in the CBD. The leisure facilities are phenomenal and I felt the spa areas as my own place of solitude and recharge. Service was top notch, very warm and genuine, without the starched quality one may expect in a 5 star (both AAA and Forbes!) awarded property. Alex was a standout and thank you for remembering us by name even when we returned 2 weeks later. Breakfast was the same faultless affair with quiet but super efficient service. All in all, a privilege to be a guest and share your beautiful ‘home’",5,2023,05,29
127,5* stay ,"We had a fantastic stay here over the bank holiday weekend for my husband’s 30th birthday celebrations. 
I booked via booking.com, and the reservations team were so helpful via the message chat in the lead up to our arrival. 

We arrived at the hotel 2 hours early, to be told our room was ready, and they’d provided us with a complimentary upgrade! 
As requested, the housekeeping team had left extra pillows, and had even found me a v-shaped pregnancy pillow. 

When we came back to our room after being out for the evening, we found a birthday cake, ice bucket, fresh water, slippers by our bed, and some chamomile tea-bags for bedtime had been left for us. 

We made use of the well-being floor and enjoyed our relaxing time in the pool area. 

All of the staff were really friendly, but we wish to say a special Thankyou to Walter. 
He really went the extra mile to make sure we were comfortable, showed us round our room, and showed a real interest by asking about our pregnancy and how we were feeling. 
We look forward to coming back to say hello once our little one makes her arrival later this year.

127,Nice relaxing stay,"Excellent staff and service, both at the reception and in the restaurant. Breathtaking views out of our suite. Great room facilities, bedding, bathrobes, towels and toiletries. Relaxing lounging by the infinity pool. Sauna and changing facilities in the spa had a very unpleasant stench of drains, tepid water provided in the spa without any lemons/cucumber/ice. The spa was a bit of a let down for us as we are used to really high end facilities and services at Calcott manor in Cotswold and the Pan Pacific spa experience doesn’t reach the same quality and attention to details, for double the price, which is a shame. 
Thank you very much to all the staff at Pan Pacific for making our stay so relaxing.",4,2023,05,24
127,Excellent service and experience overall!,"Amazing service! From the moment we arrived the service was excellent.
Hamid was the best and most welcoming concierge. 

The facilities such as the gym and the spa were also great. Definitely recommend a visit!",5,2023,05,22
127,Our new first choice in London,"Having read the many glowing reviews, we had high expectations of the Pan Pacific which were not only met but comfortably exceeded.
It's still very new, it's beautifully furnished and decorated and the quality of everything you touch is high. There is a real warmth to staying here, right at the heart of everything London has to offer with rapid connections to anywhere in the city, and yet you feel the serenity of the Pan Pacific every time you walk through its doors.
We were very lucky to be upgraded to the Bishopsgate Suite, spacious, bright and with a commanding view from its 19th floor looking west across London. The bed was sumptious, the bathroom luxurious. 
As others have written, the pool at the Pan Pacific is lovely. There are designated children's hours, so everybody's kept happy, and it's nice to have a pool with a view rather than some of London's other luxury hotels where you're down in the basement.
The bars and restaurants are further attractions. It's worth getting a breakfast inclusive rate but, if not, there are plenty of good a la carte options. We'd already arranged to have dinner in Belgravia so we missed out on the Singaporean influenced restaurant but we had a delicious light lunch at the Pan Pacific and the afternoon tea is on our list for next time. The hotel's patisserie Shiok is like an art gallery - exquisite cakes that appear (almost) too beautiful to eat.
Yet aside from all the ""hard product"" of the hotel, it's the service that is truly outstanding here. There are some hotels in London that make you feel like they're doing you a favour by letting you stay there. Not here. Everybody we met at the Pan Pacific was attentive, helpful and informative. Our little girl was very well looked after and now doesn't want to stay anywhere else in London. I know the feeling.

127,Amazing Hotel Experience,"This was one of the best hotels we have stayed at in London. Everything was first class from the amazing staff at check in to the beautifully appointed rooms which are pure luxury. Bedroom and bathroom spaces were immaculate and all the amenities were high end (Plush robes and slippers, Nespresso, Dyson). All the staff we interacted with were so polite and helpful and made the experience that much more enjoyable.

Great location proximity to Liverpool St Station made getting around London a breeze and there are good restaurants within a few minutes walk too. We have the breakfast buffet at the hotel which was 5 star too! Prior to arrival front staff reached out to find out if there was anything we needed or were celebrating something special which was a very nice touch.

Would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone and it will be the go to place to stay when we are next in London.",5,2023,05,21
127,5 Star Hotel,Just fantastic from start to finish. This is up there with one of the best hotels i have ever had the pleasure of staying in. Spotlessly clean modern rooms. Lovely pool area. Great location. Nothing was too much trouble for the friendly staff. Would 100% return.,5,2023,05,20
127,Wonderful Afternoon Tea with an Asian twist!,"We did afternoon tea at the Pan Pacific.  A short walk from the Liverpool street station and Eataly Market place.  Best tea and so amazing.  We did the Kopi Tia Afternoon tea, which included a selection of Asian Savouries, Matcha Scones and regular scones, and a beautiful selection of hand-made pastries.  It was so different and wonderful to do a tea with an Asian twist.  Definitely would recommend for anyone who loves asian food and wants a different type of tea!   ",5,2023,05,18
127,The most amazing hotel ever!,"What an amazing hotel, absolutely the best hotel we ever stay in. This hotel is now our preferred choice when we stay in London. Exceeded our expectation everytime we stay. 

I would highly recommend the hotel, customers service is their top priority and it is super luxurious.  ",5,2023,05,16
127,Perfect in every way.,The whole experience was perfect. The staff were friendly and professional and the food and drink amazing. We had an opportunity to use the infinity pool which was wonderfully relaxing and the complimentary cocktail and then breakfast just added to the perfection of our whole stay.,5,2023,05,15
127,Excellent and will be returning,All round great and amazing place! The staff were so friendly and make you feel important. The room and amenities were perfect. The on site restaurants are fantastic and the valet guys were prompt and polite.,5,2023,05,14
127,Impressive in every way,"Having heard good things about the Pan Pacific, my wife and I decided to stay for a couple of days whilst in London to see a show. 

The first thing you notice is how kind and attentive the staff are.  Emily checked us in and was very friendly and helpful and Len took us up to the room and explained about the hotel facilities on the way.  

Room was large, modern and clean. Well appointed with the comfiest robes, Nespresso, Dyson hairdryer, wet room and large bath.  We were lucky enough to have a corner room with views of the gherkin and the shard and a large chunk of London.   

Everything else in the hotel was superb from restaurants to bars (Inc the ‘secret’ one across the road) to the pool and spa. 

A fantastic first stay at the Pan Pacific and will definitely not be the last.",5,2023,05,13
127,Great Hotel in the City,An exceptional hotel in the City. It's a real taste of the service of the Orient in London. I love staying at this hotel; the facilities are excellent and the staff are exceptionally good at what they do.,5,2023,05,12
127,Fabulous hotel but avoid the in room dining option,"I've stayed here 3 times on business.  The hotel is beautiful and the staff are excellent.  However, the food that is served from the  inroom dining menu is not good at all.  ive now tried it 3 times and had 3 different meals and they were all dreadful.   So a fabulous place to stay as long as you dont have the in room dining",3,2023,05,11
127,Best hotel fine in downtown London,"Outstanding new hotel in downtown London, with fantastic rooms and great views of the city.  The bathrooms some of the best in London, the corner suite was amazing.  The restaurant have good food and service.  The room service have  the best chicken rice outside the food stalls of Singapore. I have stayed at the some of the best hotels in London and this one can compete with them all. ",5,2023,05,10
127,Great Hotel in the City of London,A very nice hotel in the City of London. The staff are very helpful and courteous. The rooms have everything you need (including a great view across the City)  and the beds are very comfy. We will be returning when we visit the City of London again. ,5,2023,05,09
127,Great hotel in a great spot,"Me, my partner and six year old son stayed for 2 nights over the bank holiday weekend. The hotel is great! It’s modern and luxurious, it was also very clean. The staff are brilliant and location of the hotel is ideal. The Straites restaurant is great and the bar serves great cocktails. They offer a set menu for £35, however the portions are small so top up with extras with from the al-a-carte.

My son and partner also tried out the pool and sauna and loved it.",5,2023,05,08
127,Best hotel stay we have ever had!,The best hotel stay we have ever had. Staff are so friendly and helpful. Nothing is too much for them. The room was spacious and luxurious. The comfort was out of this world. Food was exceptional. Honestly don’t have a bad word to say about this hotel. We are already planning our next stay! ,5,2023,05,07
127,BEST EXPERIENCE EVER ❤️,"What an outstanding experience!!!
Absolutely every single detail was just perfect. 
I can honestly say that was the best hotel I have ever been.
Special thanks to: Luis Cesar Rodrigues - Assistant Head Concierge: For his helpfulness and proactivity in booking the Transfer that took us from London Heathrow Airport to the hotel. I cannot forget about the driver that waited us for more than 1 hour, considering that one of the bags did not reach the destination and with that we ended up taking a while to leave the airport.

 Kelly - Guest Relations (Front of House Team): Upon arrival at the PPL, besides the speed and agility of the check-in, I was surprised when I entered the room, receiving free chocolates and a welcome card with phrase alluding to my favorite soccer team, INTERNACIONAL from Porto Alegre (South Brazil) making me extremely EXCITED.

And last but not least…
Rogério Ilha - Safety & Security Manager: 
Mr. Rogério showed us the hotel's facilities, restaurants, relaxation areas and providing us with tips on places and best safety practices regarding travel around the city of London.

Please, do not miss SHIOK Patisserie from Chef Cherish Finden. They have delicious selection of patisserie items with traditional Singapore flavours.",5,2023,05,06
127,Excellent hotel at a reasonable price,"Room and bathroom were very clean and the bed was very comfortable.  Excellent service, and the staff were very friendlly and helpfull.  The hotel is close to the resturants and some attractions in London.  Easy access to metro. 

We enjoyed our stay at Pan Pacific and highly recommend this hotel.",5,2023,05,01
127,5 well-earned stars,"This was my family's first visit to London, and the occasion was my wife running the London Marathon.

To be honest, the Pan Pacific group of properties was never on our radar, but we decided to take a chance. We are so glad that we did - I would stack this particular property against the Four Seasons, the Ritz-Carlton, and other top-tier luxury brands. In a word, our stay was absolutely marvellous.

It's clear that it's a new property, as it is immaculate. No chipping paint or any signs of age. The rooms are wonderfully appointed, including delightfully comfortable beds, automated blackout curtains, and a full-room rain shower.

I also have to commend the housekeeping staff. Even when we ventured out for a quick dinner, they managed to complete a full turndown service that fully refreshed our room for our return.

The location is so convenient as well. Just steps from Liverpool Street station, as well as many restaurants, Eataly, and Spitalfields Market.

Last, the staff were so hospitable and helpful. We were treated with the utmost respect and grace befitting a true 5-star property.

We can't recommend the Pan Pacific strongly enough!",5,2023,04,30
127,Another perfect stay,"Still the best hotel in London.  I visit Pan Pacific London every 6-8 weeks, it's perfect in every way.  Location, quality,  all of the staff. You can read my previous reviews for more detail, but I don't, and never have a single thing I can fault at the Pan Pacific. It's beyond any of its peers at this moment in time, and all at a much more reasonable price.",5,2023,04,28
127,Wonderful Stay,"A brief but wonderful stay at the hotel that made me feel at home. The pleasant and warm staff constantly tended to any of my needs and requests with hospitality and efficiency. They also took their time to get to know me as this was my first stay at the hotel. The staff always went the extra mile to add to my stay such as a complete turndown service for my room while I was away at night, likely after delivering my welcome amenity of chocolates. The service was impeccable, going down to the finer details such as helping to coil my charging cables. Hamid, Irina, Montierre and Xinchen all combined to ensure a memorable stay for me. The hotel is well equipped and the hardware and facilities reflect how recently it was launched, including automated lighting and curtains. A spacious hot tub that accomodated my frame was another boon as well. The convenient location to the rest of London and Heathrow Airport further added to the positive experience I had. I would definitely recommend this hotel for a stay in London.",5,2023,04,24
127,Superb Hotel in the heart of City,"As someone who has lived and worked in London for years I didn’t think I could feel at peace in the City. But this remarkable Hotel ticks all the boxes.

We had a deluxe room with Liverpool stree view. I’m the rooms are immaculate and tempreture controlled. Bathroom amenities Diptique brand from France - my favourite.

We had a drink in the bar Ginger Lily down stairs which produces some outstanding cocktails. Then it was straight upstairs to Straits Kitchen for dinner. The service was a little slow and to compensate they offered us a complimentary drink at the bar whilst we waited. The food was delicious and I must say it presented an authentic experience.

I love the luxurious feel of this hotel and have recommended it to a number of friends/ colleagues and clients. They have swim time for children 9:00 - 11:00 and 15:00 - 17:00 which is great to allow the adults to enjoy outside of that. Nothing seemed too much for the Hotel.

The highlight of the stay is the lap pool on the 4th floor overlooking the City outsides it’s just so tranquil and peaceful. Also worth mentioning that they have a Reformer Pilates bed in the gym which is a complete luxury. I did a few YouTube classes which was brilliant. Staying here is a must. The staff are exceptional, from the door men, reception to the Management and beyond - I felt welcomed and looked after. My husband and Son enjoyed it so much. Thank you team!! 

Constructive feedback: in the early evenings it often takes a while for someone to answer the phone. Not a huge deal but often left having to call back 5 mins later.

127,What a terrific stay we had!,"I must stay, this is by far the hotel in London where our kids were better treated. Everyone is super careful, interested and always eager to help. The treasure hunt was a lovely idea and really entertained our little ones. 
Even though everyone was amazing, I have to single out Fabio, who was out of this world and two weeks after staying there, our kids still talk about him. He effortlessly connected with them, going around with them on the hunt for signatures, being engaging and treating them like they were the stars of the hotel. He really has a talent with kids.
We are so glad to have chosen Pan Pacific and we will definitely come back!",5,2023,04,20
127,Very nice,"The hotel and maintenance were outstanding.  I appreciated the turn down service in the evening with refill of the tea and sugars.  This made for a relaxing evening.  I would have liked to know prior to check out that there was a ""check in"" for children.  This most likely would have provided us with the necessary information for children swimming hours, a robe and slippers for the kids.  Also, the breakfast when checking out at 0300 should not be included in the price, or it should be refunded.",4,2023,04,17
127,Quick Stay - In Town for Concert Event,"Service was impeccable and rooms were very luxuriously laid out.  Breakfast was very good as well. Of particular note was the plastic-free nature of the bathroom amenities, something very important to me.  Will look forward to the next stay here, maybe for a longer stay to take advantage of the pool and spa areas.",5,2023,04,16
127,Great stay,"Great stay at this new modern hotel. Very comfortable room with views on the city, excellent service from reception to the concierge team which advised a very good Italian restaurant nearby. There is also a very nice pool with outside view ( not in a basement as usually in London hotels). A great second stay and not the last.",5,2023,04,10
127,Highly Recommend,"Oh my gosh, what a wonderful experience... I would like to thank the concierge staff (Luis, Jeffery,... )please forgive me for not mentioning other staff members. From the time we arrive (front desk), during our stay (concierge, restaurant staff) Everyone treated me and my family members with such grace. Everyone was helpful, offered suggestions, and the rooms.... yes to the heated bathroom floors, towel racks (smile) and soaking tub. My father who is 83 appreciated all of it.
The location was good, we visited the Spitalfield market which is about 4 blocks away  (a must see )there is also a flee market on Sunday's about 3 blocks.. there are plenty of restaurants as well.
Only a uber or black taxi ride to Big Ben and the Tower of London (had to use those modes because of Dad's age), but there is a tube station near by....
I would highly recommend this hotel",5,2023,04,10
127,Yet another wonderful stay!,"Extremely comfortable stay as always.
Check-in experience is fast, efficient and personable.  I am pleasantly surprised with elite recognition (GHA Platinum) I received upgrade, late check-out, as well as welcome amenity.

The room itself is spacious and quiet. It is fully equipped as expected in the hotel of this caliber. When it comes to actual sleep, there's no hotel in London to compare. It was that comfortable.

There is a significant improvement to Asian food offerings for breakfast compared with my previous stay and I would highly recommend everyone to try.",5,2023,04,10
127,Excellent five star experience,"Our second stay at this lovely hotel and it was an excellent experience. We were upgraded to a city view room on the 16th floor, which was very comfortable and well appointed. Particularly nice dressing gowns and gorgeous Dyptique toiletries.

We didn’t use the pool, but I did take a look at it and it is very impressive. We did enjoy a late night drink in then
Ginger Lily bar and a good breakfast in the Straits Kitchen. All staff we interacted with very good. We will be coming back as this is a truly five star experience at reasonable prices for London.",5,2023,04,09
127,Highly recommend this hotel.,Great location. Very family friendly. Staff is excellent. Very clean and spacious rooms. We loved everything about this hotel. Right next to major tube hub. They did a cute scavenger hunt throughout hotel for Easter.,5,2023,04,08
127,Amazing Experience,"Great service and beautiful facilities. Location was great, close to the underground. Staff was incredibly friendly, specially concierge and front desk. They were incredibly helpful with everything including dinner reservations and buying tickets.",5,2023,04,07
127,Would stay again,"Lovely hotel, little disappointed no bath in our room and the view wasn’t greatest but everything else was lovely until check out when they tried to charge us for room service when we’d already paid. We had to screen print email receipts on our phone and email to them whilst in reception checking out to prove we’d paid, not great when surrounded by lots of other people checking out, something so straight forward should have already been taken care of and updated when we paid the night before. Staff were all very friendly and lovely though. ",4,2023,04,06
127,None,"Very personable and helpful staff people. housekeeping was excellent.  beds were comfortable and linens luxurious. it was quiet. on the downside, breakfast was absurdly expensive. ridiculous cost for a simple omelet and 2 small pancakes. we chose to go elsewhere after our first morning. light switches in the room were impossible to figure out. not at all clearly marked. shower drain did not work well. also internet connection kept going off and i had to rejoin multiple times a day",3,2023,04,05
127,Stay in the Bishopgate Suite at the best hotel in London,"Had booked a Devonshire suite. Upon arrival, we were upgraded to the Bishopgate Suite due to our GHA Titanium status.

We were attended by Xinchen at the Fronk Desk. She was very friendly and helpful with recommendations. The hotel service is comparable to the standards of 5* luxury hotels in Asia. This hotel was easily the best hotel of our trip in Europe. My daughter is already hoping to return to Pan Pacific London soon. Despite being a business hotel, it is very kids-friendly, and the staff were very friendly to my young children.

The suite is spacious and clean. The bathroom is huge by European standards. However, due to the proximity to nearby officer towers, some might be concerned about the privacy of the rooms.

The hotel is located next to Liverpool Street Station. Tesco Express is also located just next door. Being located in the Financial District, there is no lack of food options.

We will definitely be back again when we are coming to London.",5,2023,04,02
127,Magnificent in every way! ,"There are not enough glowing adjectives to describe how over-the-top incredible our stay was at the Pan Pacific London. This hotel is perfection in every way. The service was beyond exceptional -- from the concierges who handled our every request like we were royalty ourselves to the housekeeping who made our room immaculate every day, to the doormen, bartenders, front desk, and every single staff person we encountered. The room itself was HUGE, especially by Europe standards. The beds were so comfortable and the shower was amazing. The location is great, 2 blocks from the Liverpool Tube station and right near multiple bus stops, walking distance to Spitalfields and Brick Lane.  All around the best hotel experience we've ever had!!",5,2023,03,31
127,"Comfortable, friendly hotel in the heart of the City","Stayed for one night on a business trip. Wished I had longer to experience more of the hotel services. Great room, very comfortable bed and I liked the different lighting settings for different moods. Good customer service and very convenient location in the heart of the City. ",5,2023,03,31
127,Better than expected,"Pretty good for London. Rooms were nice although some have very odd configurations. New and clean and nice which stands out in London. The staff are very enthusiastic but not always as well trained as a high end hotel would provide. The in room dining was dismal, zero appeal on the food and service was slow. Outside this staff and service worked hard to be great to their guests. Location pretty ordinary from a tourist perspective.",4,2023,03,29
127,Pan Pacific London,"Pan Pacific London is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a luxurious stay in London. The hotel boasts stunning views of the city and offers top-notch amenities that cater to all your needs. The rooms are spacious, modern, and well-furnished, ensuring a comfortable stay. The staff is friendly, attentive, and always willing to go above and beyond to make your stay memorable. The hotel's location is also ideal, with easy access to major attractions and transportation. Overall, I highly recommend Pan Pacific London for anyone seeking an exceptional hotel experience in London.",4,2023,03,29
127,10/10 - fantastic ,"Familiar with the brand from staying at pan Pacific in Singapore, so was intrigued when I saw the London location open. Glad we booked as the rooms, the staff, the location and the Sunday lunch were absolutely incredible. 10/10 on all levels. Will be making my business stays here in future. ",5,2023,03,28
127,Unsure id visit again,"No writing desk available in the room. Infinity pool looked nice but a huge group of young boys were allowed in who were ridiculously boisterous and the hotel staff did nothing. Really spoiled my time at the pool. I would have expected a bit more from the hotel here, other guests also walked out when this happened.",2,2023,03,25
127,First Class Exceptional Customer Service,Just about to go to a meeting and the heavens opened…..so much rain….no taxis available. One of the amazing Concierge Team went out in the rain to find me a taxi on nearby Bishopsgate and then directed it back to the hotel to pick me up. Thank you. Really appreciate the high quality service. Just exceptional. I thoroughly recommend this hotel for both social get-togethers and business trips. First class service.,5,2023,03,23
127,Excellent 5 star hotel in the center of London,"In the literal heart of London, Pan Pacific was a fantastic oasis and jumping off point to explore the city as it was so close to the major transport hubs, but also within walking distance of so many sights and attractions.  The hotel is immaculate in is presentation and amenities. Truly 5 star experience with the level of personal service, the room fittings, the hotel amenities and quality thereof.  Would recommend to anyone visiting London to take advantage of this hotel!",5,2023,03,21
127,Mother’s Day treat,"I decided to give myself and my mum a well deserved Mother’s Day treat. It was a very expensive treat but the service and room features were exceptional. I called in the morning to enquire if they had a diffuser only to find one in the room waiting for me. I then learnt that Dyson hairdryers are provided in every room 😊. 

The staff were really friendly at check in and we felt very looked after. Our room was on the 8th floor but luckily north facing so we had a nice view. The bathroom was clean, comfortable and just beautiful. The bath salts were a lovely touch. 

The Wellness floor which has the pool and drawing room are located on the 4th floor. The pool overlooks the street while the drawing room was on the other side facing a building.  I think with better planning they could have located this on the top floor so that guests can enjoy a better view? Perhaps there were planning constraints! In any case the pool and drawing room were both enjoyable. 

This was a lovely city treat that I would definitely do again.",5,2023,03,21
127,Comfy beds is the best part,"One of the best hotels I have stayed at . This place is so posh , and things like towel racks that are warmed (so towel is warm when you get out of shower) and heated floors make it feel so cozy. The views are spectacular from any room in the building. 

The service from anyone in the building is 10 starts , all go out of their way to show kindness and friendliness.  Their cleaning service is above par, they folded my clothes and organized my make up and toiletries that I had left strewn about the bathroom. And they have night turn down service too. 

Also one of the most important things for me in hotels is beds. And this one is spectacular! They have extra wide king beds, and they are super plush and comfortable. 

The location is also perfect , smack in the middle of everything. This hotel really has it all. Highly recommend anyone to stay here.",5,2023,03,19
127,A truly amazing stay,The service was amazing. We felt welcomed and taken-care-of. The tea was over-the top delicious. The sweets were almost too gorgeous to eat. Room service was accurate and on time. The views over London were dreamy.,5,2023,03,14
127,Grand,"Excellent new high end hotel steps away from Liverpool street station. It has the Asian luxury feel characteristic of the chain: very attentive service comes across throughout the experience. Spacious, super comfortable and soundproofed room, with a very wide king bed. Bathroom also excellently designed and appointed; I would highlight formidable bathrobes and toiletries. Expensive but for a reason.",5,2023,03,10
127,Good but there are room for improvements.,"This is a great hotel.   Hubby and I stayed here for three nights and I do have some observations. 

Really close to Liverpool Street station.   More like spitting distance so transport is extremely easy 

Chap at front door was really welcoming and so are most of the staff. 

Check in was really efficient and a really nice gentleman took us to our room and explained all the details.  

The view to the city is amazing and our room was extremely spacious.  No issues.  

Housekeeping was not consistent.  We got turn down service but the mat only went on hubby’s side.  I got nothing.  They must have noticed there were two pairs of slippers. 

Our toiletries were changed after one night but not on second or third.  Very strange.  

On second night we got a sleepy tea bag and housekeeping also gave us a small tube of toothpaste.  They obviously noticed ours was running out.  They left a small note which was such a lovely touch.  

Bottles of water were replenished everyday so that was excellent.  Tea pot was really exquisite but not exactly practical.  

I think there are definitely room for improvements.  The inconsistency of housekeeping and friendliness of staff suggest training issues which baffled me for a five star hotel.  Noting that roll rate was over 350 per night and over 400 on the last night.  

I expected more so definitely slightly disappointed",4,2023,03,10
127,"Great service, amazing view of the city","Outstanding customer service, both at the restaurant and in the room. Room was clean, confortable and with a very nice view of the City. Great location. Enjoyed the infinity pool and the sauna. All the staff made us feel welcome.",5,2023,03,08
127,"Modern and comfortable but disappointing, expensive breakfast","Very comfortable, modern bedroom with a good sized bathroom with a great shower and products. Friendly staff, particularly the doorman.  Our disappointment was with breakfast.  We didn’t have a great first impression with the service and the items we chose. Whilst there is a lot of choice it was very mediocre and very overpriced. Maybe have less choice making that better quality.  We did make our feelings known and were apologised to and weren’t charged but we’d rather have had a good breakfast experience.",4,2023,03,05
127,Luxury surroundings & 5 star service,"From check-in, to using the restaurants, bars and swimming pool, the service from all staff was excellent. The hotel was spotless and the finishing and detail was very high end. 

The rooms are luxurious with decadent toiletries and accessories. Views over the City are great.

If you want a faultless night away in London with a really polished experience, I would highly recommend stopping at the Pan Pacific in Liverpool Street.",5,2023,03,02
127,Family tripp to London and hotel Pan Pacific,"We will certainly come back to Pan Pacific. 
All the staff made us feel welcome and the rooms and the hotel's standard were top class.
The Pan Pacific hotel is located right next to Liverpool street station and from here it is easy to reach all the favorite places in London.",5,2023,03,01
127,Most exceptional hotel - Pan Pacific,"Pan Pacific, honestly has become our new home when staying in the city. Having previously travelled and stayed at numerous hotel groups in the past, the stay here was incredible. The service, the hotel, facilities, restaurants and bars was unmatchable. The team ensured they went the extra mile without it being asked of them. Will be using the the hotel reguarly going forward.",5,2023,03,01
127,A true 5 star hotel !,"A true 5 star hotel, everything was perfect. Impeccable customer service and attention to detail.

Our room was spotlessly clean and the views were incredible. (Get at least a city view room if possible). 

Breakfast was of a very good quality and the waiting staff were excellent. We visited Silverleaf bar too and enjoyed that as well !",5,2023,02,27
127,exceptional stay,"Our stay in Pan Pacific London was just amazing, highly recommend this hotel especially for the families. Location of the hotel is perfect. It is very close to Liverpool Street station. Few minutes walk to the Tower of London and Tower Bridge. Family room was very spacious and that amazing bathroom!",5,2023,02,26
127,Exceptional in every way,"Outstanding customer service, panoramic views of London, plush rooms with exquisite linens and all the little touches that make the difference. A breakfast that left us beaming and a location that is convenient for all the attractions - congratulations Pan Pacific this really was exceptional from the management to the charming staff and housekeeping",5,2023,02,25
127,I wouldn’t if I were you,"Stay away! Looks nice but not all that glitters is gold. I booked 5 nights. They gave me a room with a defective sink, could not reach the hotel by phone because the one lady at the switchboard was on her lunch break and calls went to voice mail. Couldn’t  get in touch with my kids while I was out of the room. Was treated horribly and unprofessionally to the point of humiliation. Was like an episode of the white lotus. Couldn’t believe the way I was treated in a 5 star hotel. As i was literally checking out I was offered a night in their suite with breakfast for me and my kids as compensation. They ruined my son’s birthday. Told them to shove it. Never setting foot in this hotel.",1,2023,02,24
127,Not 5 star,"More like 4star 
The small details matter 
The pool was not 30 degrees, barely warm. The mattress very uncomfortable. 

No good resolution from guest relations for a customer spending over £1000 for 2nights.  Instead just get offered a day pass for the spa that has ongoing issues with no working male steam room. Even if it was working, it’s not a solution.",3,2023,02,21
127,Good 5* Hotel,"Went to the Pan Pacific for the first time for a weekend away with my Grandson Alfie, whilst we went to The War of the Worlds. Good room and facilities. Staff were all great and helpful. Alfie (aged 11) was given a treasure hunt for a prize if he found everything. Breakfast was a nice mix of Asian and English. Pool a nice touch, and made to feel welcome. I always look for a good 5* hotel and this was everything you could want in a hotel. Very close to Liverpool Street Station so easy to commute around London.",5,2023,02,19
127,Luxury Hotel in London,"The Pan Pacific London is a luxurious five-star hotel in the heart of London that offers breathtaking views of the city. From the moment you step into the lobby, you are greeted with a warm welcome from the friendly staff, who go above and beyond to ensure that your stay is as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. As a Titanium member I was acknowledged which was great and received all the benefits. 

The rooms at the Pan Pacific London are spacious and elegantly decorated, with modern amenities such as high-speed internet, flat-screen TVs, and luxurious bedding. 

The hotel also boasts an impressive selection of dining options, including the acclaimed SHIOK! a patisserie is the perfect stop-off for those who are looking for elegant and traditional Singaporean flavours. Curated by the talented Cherish Finden and you can also try the Afternoon Tea at Orchard Lounge. Straits Kitchen, which serves authentic Asian cuisine is another great restaurant. 

The hotel's amenities are also top-notch, with a fully equipped fitness centre, a luxurious spa, and an infinity pool that offers panoramic views over Bishopsgate Plaza.

But what really sets Pan Pacific London apart is the impeccable service provided by the staff. From the concierge who can assist you with anything from restaurant recommendations to sightseeing tours, to the housekeeping staff who ensures that your room is always spotless, every member of the team goes above and beyond to make your stay truly unforgettable.

127,"Excellent hotel with great staff, well-being floor can be improved","The rooms at Pan Pacific are very nice, very well connected hotel just next to Liverpool street, excellent service by great staff. 

One thing to improve is the wellbeing floor: 

The floor under the bank of the sauna is dirty; 
There is no cold cool down shower 
The hamman is not functioning and is badly conceived
There are not enough benches next to the swimming pool 
No tea facilities (only water)",4,2023,02,12
127,Great place to stay in the heart of London,"Perfect stay! Very close to Liverpool street, a very modern building with high quality services. Easy check-in; wonderful facilities. Wonderful concierge service. Enjoyed my stay there, will definitely go back again.",5,2023,02,12
127,"Beautiful hotel, but let down by management","The hotel is absolutely beautiful.
We went for our anniversary for two nights in December and the location was perfect as we had booked sushi samba to dine.
Our first impression was the service was outstanding, but by the end of our stay we feel we were let let down.
On one of the nights we had drinks in the ginger lily bar, the service was really slow and we had to ask someone to take our order. We then had to ask numerous times for someone to bring our bill so we could pay. Eventually one of the waiters allowed us to sign for our drinks. As we were leaving the hotel afterwards, we were literally chased through reception by one of the bar staff saying we hadn’t paid even though we had. This was humiliating, especially as the situation drew attention from other guests!
The next morning we had breakfast in the hotel and we waited 25 minutes to be seated then waited 40 minutes for our food. I had ordered steak and eggs and my steak came absolutely swimming in blood, it was disgusting and 
I left without eating. My husband gave feedback to the person on reception about both situations that we were unhappy with. We were told we’d receive a call from the hospitality manager, that call never came.
It’s such a shame because these issues could have been easily avoided, or at least rectified so we feel the hotel didn’t handle our issues at all. And to be promised a call, that never came just added insult to injury.
It’s unlikely we would return.",3,2023,02,07
127,Super hotel with outstanding quality of service!,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay, so much that all the finite touches made it feel like home! I loved the level of cleanliness throughout the hotel, as well as the homely touches of the slippers and bathrobe in my room. The toiletries provided were to a very high standard. My room had a bathtub which I thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated the special touch of providing bath salts. The hotel facilities like pool, sauna, and steam room were excellent. The quality of in-room dining was amazing and there was so many delicious choices. All the staff I encountered during my visit were extremely warm and welcoming and went above and beyond to make sure I had a good stay. The location of Pan Pacific is incredible, a moments walk away from Liverpool St station and walkable distance to Spitafields market and Brick Lane.",5,2023,02,06
127,Amazing,"From the moment we walked in we were made to feel special. All staff we came in contact with were helpful and welcoming. I had mentioned on my booking form that it was my boyfriends birthday and so they kindly upgraded us to a city view room and left a little cake saying happy birthday in the room. We loved the hotel and the attention to detail it pays is immaculate. From having hair bands in the women’s changing room to having a chrome cast in the room!! I love this, something a lot of hotels are missing. Highly recommend!",5,2023,02,06
127,Great Hotel in Central London,"Stayed here in December 2022 for a works function. Hotel was decorated beautifully for Christmas with a huge tree in reception and very modern and clean throughout. 

Staff were all very friendly, professional and helpful. 

We had a function room for our evening event and had pre-chosen our food choices. Food was good and everyone had a lovely evening.

Accommodation was luxurious and 5*. The room was large and came with Diptyque toiletries, a Dyson hairdryer, bath robes, slippers, a safe, ample hangers and a decent mini bar selection.  Bed was large and extremely comfortable with multiple charging points next to the bed both USB or plug and rooms were very quiet - I didn’t hear any noise. There wasn’t a desk if you were looking to work, although there was a chaise lounge and a table so you could use this. 

Great location and not far to Liverpool Street tube station.  I can’t comment on any of the spa facilities or pool as I did not use these. I’d definitely stay here again.",5,2023,02,01
127,None,"The only reason I didn't give a 5/5 is because I didn't realise the steam room and sauna was seperate for men and women; and so I was seperated from my partner during this time, and the whole reason we stayed was to spent time together. There was also a kid in the pool outside of kid hours/during adult only hours; so it wasn't very relaxing hearing them shouting after waiting all day for the kids time to pass. Apart from that, it was amazing, probably one of the best hotels I've stayed in. Service was great from the moment we entered, being shown to our rooms, service at breakfast, etc. and everything was extremely clean. The chocolates for my birthday was a nice touch. Thank you! :) I will definitely be looking into hosting client and internal events here.",4,2023,01,31
127,None,"My first stay, and I was blown away at the standards set by the hotel. The hotel exuded a calm chilled atmosphere throughout, and nothing was too much to ask of the staff who were very attentive. I will definitely be returning.",5,2023,01,31
127,Warm Hospitality,"The warm hospitality from the Pan Pacific London has exceeded my expectations in busy cold London city.

The check-in process was very prompt and efficient. But on some days you could see a long line at the check in area because there are only 2 staff members working. However the staff were always smiling despite the busy times and attended to me with upmost professionalism. 

The bed was unbelievably comfortable. The room has lots of natural light and is equipped with all the necessary equipments like usb charging ports , alarm clock and Dyson hairdryer. I also love the toiletries provided. The TV facing the bed was large and you can cast your phone screen onto the smart TV making it an Absolute pleasure to stay in the room on a bad weather day. 

Hamid escorted me to my room and introduced the room. I can feel his sense of pride working for the hotel as he shows me how to use the functions of the room . He was also there to send me off on my last day of my stay. I only can say that he is an absolute awesome guy, always greeting me with a smile at the lobby and helping me with my luggages. 

Vijay is what true hospitality is about , instead of the usual telling you to Google map your way or showing a map , he walked me to the traffic light and pointed the location so that I won’t miss my train. 

Breakfast and high tea taste as normal as it gets, the price doesn’t justify the quality. The only reason why I ate there was because it was raining and I didn’t want to get wet but after eating , it made me feel that I should have just went out in the rain to find food instead. The hotel is surrounded by so many restaurants and places to eat. I am spoilt with options. 

The pool can get busy with lots of young children during the weekend. But the changing area and sauna are kept very clean and well organized. 

I would definitely go back to the Pan Pacific London given the opportunity.",5,2023,01,28
127,Truly Outstanding,"By far the best hotel room I've  ever stayed in. 

The view was fantastic. The hotel room was huge. The bed was extremely comfortable and everything had been thought of. Fabulous coffee machine and a great choice of different teas. Mini bar if required and snacks. 

The luxurious shower area also included the use of a Dyson hairdryer. 

The cleanliness was to an extremely high standard and the service from the staff was outstanding. 

I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2023,01,23
127,None,"Fantastic time staff are customer focused helpful, the hotel excellent in all aspects!! 
Location close to new Elizabethan line , central to all tourist areas but one can spend the entire time enjoying the various amenities within the hotel",5,2023,01,23
127,Excellent hotel in the heart of the City of London,"Every aspect of our stay was excellent.  The room, the staff, the breakfast.  Everyone we encountered was eager to help. We were upgraded to a suite, but the 'basic' room is roomy and has every amenity imaginable anyway.  
Everyone we encountered was so eager to please...tremendous staff in all parts of the hotel
The pool was a lovely indulgence for me pre-breakfast too",5,2023,01,23
127,Amazing stayy!! Hamed was so lovely,"We stayed for 2 nights a this gorgeous hotel, excellent customer service isnt even enough to describe the lovely experience. 

For my Girlfriends birthday, they went above what was expected to help her have the perfect day.

Hamed helped us with everything we needed, such a warm and welcoming man, so lovely. He made sure we were well looked after throughout our stay and gave us the 5star experience. 

Thank you to him and the staff, our stay was perfect and i would 1000% recommend. Cant wait to come back.",5,2023,01,22
127,None,"We stayed at the Pan Pacific London for 3 nights as our son was getting married there. Everything was perfect. The hotel is beautifully appointed, the staff were helpful and very courteous, the atmosphere was calm but warm. The ballroom looked perfect on the wedding day and the events team and Lara in group reservations were a pleasure to deal with.All in all a great experience!! We had guests staying from abroad and they were also very complimentary of the hotel!!",5,2023,01,21
127,"Stunning hotel, wonderful experience.","Everything was perfect from the moment we walked through the door. The staff were all exceptionally professional and also very friendly. It was very pleasant. The hotel is extremely clean everywhere you go. The quality of the room was outstanding and the temperature was very easy to control with very easy to use air conditioning - not like most hotels where an awful lot of time is wasted fixing the temperature. The pool is lovely. The location of this hotel is highly convenient as it is just a minute away from Liverpool Street station. Overall, a wonderful experience and a truly pleasant stay. This hotel does not miss, at all! A special thank you to Rita at reception who was so warm, friendly and professional. You will definitely have a pleasant time staying here.",5,2023,01,15
127,Unparalleled service and hotel.,"Everything from the check in process to the room, spa facilities and bar staff was second to none. Properly trained staff and impeccable interior makes this one of the finest hotels we have ever stayed in. The panoramic view from the room was incredible and the free upgrade was a very nice touch. A true 5 star
Hotel in the heart of London. 10/10",5,2023,01,15
127,Anniversary,"Wonderful stay Wonderful People and fab food. We will be back for sure. The experience started with Alex on the front, so friendly and warm to the room service staff and the people at the Straits Kitchen. We know the brand from our 30 year stay in Singapore. Made us feel like being home again. All the best to the hotel and it’s people. We will be back soon. Highly recommend this hotel in the Heart Of London.",5,2023,01,14
127,Wonderful birthday experience ,"Thank you so much for such a wonderful stay with my Mum to celebrate her belated birthday. This is the first time we had been able to get together in over a year and I really wanted to make a special experience for my Mum. Literally every member of staff we met throughout the weekend was lovely and went out of their way to make sure my Mum had a great time and she told me it’s the best birthday she’s ever had and she will remember it forever. I don’t think she’s ever had so much birthday cake and she has a huge sweet tooth so she was in heaven. The afternoon tea was amazing and we ended up ordering way too much food on the Sunday evening in Straits Kitchen as everything on the menu just sounded so good, we couldn’t help ourselves and everything was just out of this world. We decided to stay at Pan Pacific because we have travelled quite a bit throughout Asia and wanted a little taste of that experience again and we were not disappointed at all! The food was just amazing and reminded us so much of what we experienced when travelling and the standard of hospitality we experienced was just on another level. There are too many amazing staff to name everyone but in particular George in Straits Kitchen was just amazing and had us laughing several times throughout our meal and my massage and facial with Silwia were perfect. Rachel in the spa was also lovely. And of course, all the chefs as all the food was just faultless. We have stayed in several hotels in London in the past but will definitely return to Pan Pacific when in London again ",5,2023,01,11
127,Stunning hotel with stellar service! Best in London!,"Where do I even start with this hotel?!! Perfection in every way there is. There literally is not one negative comment that I could think of, and I don't think that has ever happened to me. Even my kids, who never pay attention to accomodations commented on how nice our hotel was. 
I was impressed even prior to check in when I emailed the hotel and asked for a higher floor room. They didn't just reply to me, they truly worked on getting that room. And while it was not available for our first night, they made an effort to follow up and move us to another room for the remainder of our trip. 
The concierge and others working downstairs were truly a treat. Every request was met with a friendly response. They helped us book restaurant reservations and bus tour. When I say helped us,  I mean they took care of everything! I felt like I was staying at an all inclusive resort. 

Let's start with the location; don't' think you can find a better one in London! While it's secluded enough from all the touristy hustle and bustle, it was only a 10 min walk to the Tower of London and Tower Bridge. The metro was also a 5 min walk as well as a major city train station that was located right outside (2 min walk) of the hotel. This indeed was so convenient, we ended up taking the train to the airport. Super easy!

The beauty of the hotel is unparalleled. It is modern, yet so charming and sleek. The most gorgeous flower arrangements everywhere. The rooms are actually pretty spacious for a big city European hotel. The bathroom was an absolute dream. They had a dyson hair dryer - like wow! Amenities (diptyque) to dye for. Including bath salts for the enormous soaking tub in the bathroom. I've stayed at my fair share of fancy hotels and don't think I've ever seen that! The bedding was very comfortable. They had coffee and tea station. And our view was pretty spectacular to say the least. 

We unfortunately did not try any of the restaurants on premises. Sadly, we ran around the city like mad tourists and were only in and out to sleep. They had just opened a fancy pastry shop downstairs in the building next door. And also have what looked like a pretty amazing Afternoon Tea (we had to try Claridges though!). 

What can I say, I would 1000% recommend this hotel and cannot wait to stay there again when I am in London. Worth the splurge, except it was not as expensive as similar sub-par hotels in London. We stayed right in the middle of the busiest tourist season and got very lucky to say the least. My advise is book in advance! 

Thank you so very much Pan Pacific for a phenomenal hotel stay.",5,2023,01,06
127,Total Disaster,"Having stayed with PP in Singapore in the past on several occasions, I felt staying with them in London would be a safe bet.  I was wrong.

From the first night with the hotel, the issues started.  When entering their lobby bar, which was 80% empty with several open tables available, I was told that I couldn't be accommodated for a drink and that the bar was 'fully reserved.'  When letting the hostess know I was a hotel guest, she said that 'didn't matter' and that they don't hold back seating for in-house guests.  Not exactly a welcoming or professional way to handle the situation.

The major problem came when the hotel charged me $400 for room damage I didn't cause and they couldn't provide proof of.  They simply slipped a note under my door overnight saying they had found damage and that my credit card had already been charged.  No call.  No discussion.  Just a paid bill.  It felt like they were taking advantage of having my open line of credit at their disposal.  And seeing as I damaged nothing during my stay, it also felt like fraud.

This was a perfect example of someone asking for forgiveness later versus first seeking permission.  It's always the wrong way to handle things when it comes to face-front customer service.  It ruins trust almost immediately.  It ruined mine.

They eventually credited back the amount and apologized for making the mistake, but frankly, I'd never again stay with a hotel who went about doing business in this way.  It was underhanded.

I later relayed this whole experience to a friend who's GM at Mandarin Oriental London and she was flabbergasted.  She also asked me why I even stayed at the property in the first place.  It was a lesson learned for me.  Never again.

I travel for a living and write this as one of my most disappointing experiences at a hotel in a long while.",1,2023,01,04
127,Perfect Ambience,"Been visiting for almost every weekend for jasmine tea. Lovely experience, perfect ambience and lighting. Give Josh a raise for making us all feel welcomed and spoiled every time we visit. Excellent service.",5,2023,01,03

127,Family Celebration,"This is a wonderful hotel in a great location. 

The welcome on arrival was natural and unforced. Hotel room excellent and spacious, which is a rarity in London. 

Amenities fantastic. Infinity pool very relaxing. 

Service very good. No waiting for room requests. Everything was done promptly.

Service at the straits restaurant was exceptional. Nicky is a credit to the hotel. Her willingness to exceed expectation clearly evident. 

Only slight gripe was the food. It was better than average, but nothing outstanding. Vegetarian rolls were tasteless and the beef rib also lacking in flavour. 

Would absolutely stay again.",4,2023,01,01

127,Huge Potential !,"GREAT : You'll get the OOH LAH LAH feel when you first enter the hotel, your room, etc, good amount of money invested in this hotel, that's for sure ••• Connectivity to trains, availability of taxis and uber, so convenient despite the strikes, nice 20 mins stroll to Tower of London, Tower Bridge and the tap in and out river taxi ! ••• For London, I think PPL offers good value ••• Hotel is so generous, providing my family of four so many glass-bottles of complimentary water throughout our stay ••• Housekeeping was so helpful, assisting us with our wet swimming attire too !   

SOME FEEDBACK : Service staff all try really hard, but individual interactions a big hit / miss, some staff give off that amazing genuine ""really happy to assist you"" feel, many others though are just going through the motions, no one was rude or unpleasant though ••• Buffett breakfast certainly has to be improved, none of us could finish our sausages, etc, had to have breakfast out of the hotel from Day 2 onwards, which was quite inconvenient ••• Love the idea of having Singaporean / Asian dishes like laksa, chicken rice, prawn mee soup at Straits Kitchen and on in-room dining menus, but none were remotely authentic, all tasted like completely different dishes to what we were expecting, though PPL's version of lobster laksa at Straits, on one of the many freakishly cold nights during our stay, was the absolute perfect dish to have ••• Shower area in the large double double room (family room ?) is erroneously designed, with a huge amount of water flowing out of the shower area, had to reluctantly use many towels over our 7 night stay to build ""dams"" to contain the water ... 

Overall still definitely a nice place to stay at, that's for sure ... Potential to become excellent is huge ! ... Thank you PPL ...",4,2022,12,28
127,Will definitely be back,"Excellent location. Very near train stations connected to many different lines. Close proximity to many restaurants, attractions and shopping area. Staff were very attentive and welcoming. Check-in was quick and we truly appreciate it that our room was ready for us upon arrival. Hotel room is spacious and housekeeping is prompt. Supplies in the room (eg water, tissue, shower gel, shampoo etc) were sufficiently replenished daily. We especially love the chrome cast feature in the room television. The drinks and desserts available at Shiok! looked divine!",5,2022,12,26
127,Good location,"Poor breakfast. Had buffet breakfast at 9:20. Asked reception said Buffet Finished at 10:30. The food in the tray are not much left. And No more refill. Charged £36 pre personal.

127,Pan Pacific London Dec holiday,"I’m a GHA member. Will always look for it due to familiarity all around the world. Pan Pacific is my go to hotel. Pan pacific London lives up to that standard and beyond. Impeccable standards. Brand new hotel, less than 2 years old. Great staff, housekeeping was good.",5,2022,12,25
127,Wonderful Stay!,"We had an amazing stay at Pan Pacific. Room was modern, clean and exudes a luxurious finishing touch throughout. Amenities were generously supplied and of great quality.  Housekeeping daily was very thorough and room was always fresh when we returned after a day out. We booked the Premier double which came with two full size double bed and it was definitely comfortable for our family of 4.  AC and heater works fine too. Location wise, hotel was just opposite the train station. Easy to navigate around with the tube.  There are also plenty of restaurants just round the corner of the hotel.  Very convenient.  

The only downside was that the fire alarm went off on one of the night . We were all asked to evacuate the room immediately. Upon reaching the lobby only, we were told that it was a false alarm. We thought that this could have been handled more properly before announcing for all to evacuate. My poor 9yrs who is having a fever had to climb all the way down from 12th floor!

Overall, beside the false alarm evacuation, We had a good stay at Pan Pacific.",5,2022,12,24
127,Best hotel in London,"This was my second stay at the Pan Pacific. We had unfortunately encountered some issues with our first stay but the hotel truly couldn’t have done enough to make amends on our second visit.
From the moment of arrival the service was impeccable from the doorman to the reception staff. The hotel was decorated for Christmas and looked absolutely beautiful. Our room was immaculate with fantastic views of the city, almost directly opposite the Gherkin. Clean, fresh, well equipped bathroom, elegant decor and a luxury feel throughout the entire hotel.
The spa area is just stunning, very relaxing with a wonderful infinity pool that looks out onto the bustle of the city. There is also a relaxation lounge with heated beds and weighted blankets, perfect for a moment of calm.
Breakfast in the morning was delicious with plenty of variety and a lovely ambience to the room. After checkout we had a cup of tea in the lounge downstairs and didn’t feel in any way rushed to leave which was good because we didn’t want to go home! 
Surely on its way to becoming the best hotel in London, can’t wait for our next visit.",5,2022,12,23
127,Highly Recommend,"Excellent hotel! Staff extremely professional and polite! Hotel was exceptionally clean and smelt lovely. The room was well equipped, I especially liked the bathroom and this had a Dyson Hairdryer. The only negative, and this is being really picky, our room, although we had a view of the Gherkin we were overlooked by an office block, but this is a hotel in the middle of a city so was to be expected. I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay here again.",5,2022,12,23
127,Quality hotel in the centre of London,"I have had the pleasure of staying  here twice recently . It is close to Liverpool Street station and the team here are totally attentive and lovely. Nothing is too much trouble . The rooms are beautifully and tastefully presented . Really comfortable beds and the best dressing gowns ! I ended up buying one on departure ! Really great breakfast , fresh fruit , salad and Chinese options so it’s a little different to the normal English breakfast ( also on offer ) . Rate this hotel really highly !",5,2022,12,18
127,Perfect hotel,"My daughter and I have just returned from a night here. It’s located close to Liverpool Street station which made it easy for us to get to the Lyceum theatre by Covent Garden (Liverpool Street central line to Holborn then a short walk or the Piccadilly line to Covent Garden). 
Due to train strikes we drove here. There’s an NCP car park nearby at Finsbury Square.
The pool is wonderful, very warm and luxurious. We had room service, good food.
The staff are superb. All of them were so pleasant, friendly and professional.
We had a wonderful stay, it felt like a real treat. I will definitely come back the next time I visit London.",5,2022,12,18
127,6-star Experience - True Asian Hospitality in CBD London - Pan Pacific London,"My family of 6 had an amazing experience at the Pan Pacific London. From the warm welcome by XinChen, to Conceirge Jeffrey and Conor, they were super super helpful with all our needs, even helping me to arrange a car rental on their personal WhatsApps.
Location, just 2 mins walk to Liverpool Street metro station, super convenient and with Tesco express just a stone throw away.
The rooms are really 5 star, everything was well thought through, including a Dyson hair dryer! Beds were super comfortable and the bathroom accessories were First Class.
We are always warmly welcomed at the Straits Kitchen for Breakfast.It has a decent International selection with some Asian plain porridge, curry, dumplings. Fried noodles can be less oily though. We even have Kaya spread.
It’s the staff of Pan Pacific London, one of the best I have experienced in my many travels, that makes a 5-star hotel feels like a 6-star. Thank you Pan Pacific London, I look forward to my next stay which will not be too long away! Thanks once again for the fantastic experience!",5,2022,12,17
127,Attentive and welcoming. Loved that we chose this hotel.,"Attentive and welcoming staff, delicious dinner (the coconut rice pudding desert was A++). I've also enjoyed one of the Christmas cocktails despite not being a cocktail drinker. Clean rooms with good equipment (Dyson hair dryer) and lovely views over the city. The location is great with well connected underground close by and Shoreditch being a walkable distance away.

Unfortunately we ran out of time to also experience their spa, pool and gym. Something for next time perhaps.",5,2022,12,16
127,Very happy with my stay here. Excellent room and service.,"Our family of 5 stayed in a double double and an executive king which was more than enough space for us. In fact the double double was big enough but we had to take 2 rooms due to city’s restrictions. 

Our rooms came with the breakfast buffet which had a wide spread of Asian, English, pastries, salads, and an egg counter. 

We used the pool during the designated children hours. The pool was heated and not too big, but it wasn’t too crowded so it was ok. 

The staff provided excellent service throughout our stay. They were very friendly with our children, and there was even a scavenger hunt for the children to complete for a free lion toy plush.

Good location - accessible and well connected via the Liverpool Street Station. There are also a lot of restaurants, cafes and bars/pubs around.",5,2022,12,14
127,Amazing stay in the heart of London,"The hotel is amazing as is its staff! We had an incredible stay and are looking forward to our next stay with Pan Pacific! Its location is also unbelievably good! If you want to see the city and unwind when coming back to your room, there is no better place.",5,2022,12,13
127,"So welcoming, an amazing stay","Such a wonderful stay, staff were so welcoming and thoughtful with my 8yo - there’s a treasure map to complete and a prize at the end which he loved. Every detail had been thought of, pool was a lovely relaxing area and the rooms were lovely.",5,2022,12,13
127,Exceptional,"Exceptional from start to finish - excellent check in process, with kind and attentive staff. Beautiful rooms finished to a high standard. Lovely bathroom with Diptyque products and the some of the best robes we’ve ever had. The housekeeping team were brilliant. Excellent wellness floor with pool and saunas. Only criticism is that the view was slightly spoilt by the windows that were in need of a good clean (18th floor). Otherwise, couldn’t fault the stay. We will be back without a second thought!",5,2022,12,11
127,Great potential but maybe wait until they’ve figured it out. Too expensive for what it is now!,"The Pan Pacific in the City of London is a hotel with some nicely appointed rooms but which neither works overall nor flows like a great hotel should.  The reception seems cramped and the elevators are tucked away in a dingy corner.   The Orchid Lounge feels like an afterthought or a way through to the Ginger Lilly bar (which may be the hotel’s highlight).  The Strait Bar is poor with little to no ambience at all and scattered mismatched furniture.  There are no bar stools and, hence, no vibe at all.  Only one member of staff and took me 25 minutes to be served. I didn’t try the Strait Kitchen as it looked entirely unappealing. Lighting all wrong and layout off-putting .  The Silverleaf Bar (in another building) is 50% owned by the hotel (they say) but makes no fuss over hotel guests paying up to and over £1,000/night. If you can get in at all then maybe it would be nice. Many of the staff are working hard to make this hotel work but they are struggling with a challenging layout and less than “wow” F&B offerings .  Like most City hotels Pan Pacific seems to struggling with the “new normal” where Wednesday is the new Thursday.  All that said my room was very nice.  Bed was very comfortable and everything from automatic lighting system and curtains to the in room entertainment was good.  However, if they want people to use the in room dining then maybe make it accessible to the guests! It’s a great location and has huge potential but maybe wait until they get their act together . At the £800 per night I paid, you’d want them to have their act together! ",3,2022,12,08
127,Unhelpful and unfriendly staff,"Disappointing stay for the price, mainly due to attitude of staff

Room cleaning was inconsistent

A one hour checkout extension was refused after a stay of 9 days

Some staff not very friendly

Would not use the hotel again",1,2022,12,08
127,Excellent hotel that is not old and musty!,"The best hotel I have stayed in, in a long time. It's not old and musty, decor/furniture is new and the amenities, shower and bathroom are clean and modern. Excellent and attentive service by all staff from front desk to room service and the location from Liverpool Street station is convenient.",5,2022,12,07
127,Lovely hotel & pool,"We stayed at Pan Pacific London for a weekend of relaxing and Christmas shopping. 

As we were driving, we found it hard to actually get to the hotel due nearby roadworks and road closures, but once we did arrive, the Concierge was helpful in taking our car for Valet Park (costs £85 per 24hrs). 

Check in was smooth and our room was ready early, but as we had spa treatments booked, we went straight to the wellness area, whilst our bags were placed in our room. 

The treatments and pool were lovely. Our therapists were very friendly and the massage was good. We found there to be plenty of loungers by the pool and enjoyed relaxing there for a few hours - i must admit, the pool was a little cold, however. 

The room was superb - I believe they've been recently renovated but there really was nothing to fault about the room at all. The bed was huge and very comfortable, the bathroom was large and very nicely done - all in all excellent. 

The following morning we went to Straits Kitchen for Breakfast, which overall was a pretty disappointing experience. The breakfast buffet was £36 p/head, but many items were reserved to the A La Carte menu. 

Despite arriving 40 mins before the breakfast was stopped being served, i was asked to pick from the buffet immediately as it was 'last orders'. I asked if i could wait until my wife's A La Carte order had arrived but was told no i needed to eat right away. 

This meant I had eaten before my wife's breakfast had even arrived. The food was mediocre and the hash browns were stone cold. Definitely not worth £36. I did express my disappointment to the front of house and the A La Carte dish was removed from the bill. 

As we went to leave the hotel, we gave 30 minutes notice to have our car ready for us (they ask for up to 20 mins notice). However, it took just under 1 hour for our car to be with us, which was probably the biggest disappointment of the whole stay. We paid £85 for the convenience of having our car waiting for us, but it ended up with us hanging around in the lobby, meaning we missed an hour of our already busy day!

The receptionist did give us 50% off the price, but even £42.50 would be too much for the service received by the Valet Park team. We just wanted to get on our way otherwise i would've argued this further.

Overall, the hotel is beautiful and we would return. However, i wouldn't bother with Valet Park - unless you have a Lamborghini, in which case they will happily leave it on show right outside the doors. If not, they put it in a secure car park somewhere. 

The bedrooms and spa were brilliant, which were the most important things.",4,2022,12,06
127,Simply lovely !!,"Havings stayed in many london hotels, Pan Pacific was way up there, simple little things made the stay so enjoyable / so comfortable.
Staff pleasant, room great !
Not often i give such a good review, actually never this good !",5,2022,12,06
127,Cheap way of doing business!!,"The breakfast was included, but the surprise was that you should for everything else than the egg!!! So cheap 
The room is overpriced and not worth that much!!
I spoke to them and they said that it is a management decision. In conclusion, the place is not good neither for business or tourism.",3,2022,12,05
127,Stunning Hotel in the City,"My partner and myself stayed following a business conference in the hotel. The rooms are spacious and luxurious, with a fantastic bathroom with both shower and bath facilities. The beds are exceptional, and it's quite possibly the quietest hotel i've ever stayed in. The hotel is brand new, and it feels it. The staff are courteous and friendly and cannot do enough for you. A fantastic stay, and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a five star hotel in the City.",5,2022,11,29
127,None,"Fantastic Experience well done all the staff and services were all on point.
Only issue was advised to leave the car outside rather than valet parking, as only one ticket would be issued but worked out a bit more expensive with two tickets. So please use the valet parking apart from from that enjoyed the stay,",5,2022,11,29
127,Couple and work visit,Service is exceptional and consistent. This hotel everyone is treated the same which is really nice to see. Definitely set themself apart from other hotels I have been. Reliable staff and service. Will always come back. Great location too.,5,2022,11,29
127,The quietest hotel room I’ve ever stayed in,"This is a glossy new hotel in the east of the City. A business hotel rather than a tourist hotel with lots of conference facilities and I stayed as part of a work event. 

Possibly I lucked out and was allocated a luxury room or maybe they’re all like mine, but it was incredibly spacious and filled with lots of thoughtful touches; not at all an out-of-the-box hotel room. The layout was such that I never heard a sound from the corridor outside all night - usually that wakes me when staying in hotels.  And the panoramic views were fabulous - was on the 17th floor. 

The staff were incredibly helpful and friendly.",5,2022,11,23
127,Frequent business traveler left unimpressed,"While a lovely hotel, I found it a poor fit for the business traveler. My 'average' experience began at check-in where I realized I'd booked the wrong arrival date (resulting in a perceived 'no show'). The manager promptly - and abruptly - reminded that they would charge me for the missed night. They then checked me into a suite that looked nothing like the images online and provided a very inefficient layout. As a business traveler, the lack of a desk in the entire suite what inexcusable. 

I also found that the extreme 'minimal esthetic' doesn't work for some travelers. I routinely travel to London for 5-10 nights in just a carryon, but the lack of a closet and furniture with drawers was problematic. The only 'storage' in the suite was a metal 'locker' (an armoire of sorts), which had just two usable drawers since the in-room safe occupied the third drawer). The locker also had just ~8 hangers and only ~24 inches of full-length space, about 1/2 of which was occupied by the bath robes inside. I like to be organized, so the lack of nightstand drawers, a desk and other 'practical' features frustrated me.

My lack-luster experience continued when I dialed the front desk hoping to have some flatware sent to my room. That call went unanswered prompting me to dial the concierge desk and then my suite's 'butler' service... ALL of which went unanswered. I ended up going to the lobby in my lounge wear and socks to determine what was happeneing, where I received an apology and promise that someone would bring me some flatware.

Rounding out my experience was my driver being threatened with a ticket if he did not pull away from the hotel's from door despite the fact that I had just texted him that I was waiting on an elevator and would be right down. The 'officer' told my driver that he was going to ticket the van behind the driver's car, but warned that if he was not gone before the officer finished writing that ticket, my driver too would receive one. 

I certainly understand ticketing an unaccompanied vehicle, but I've never heard for a nice hotel threatening a brand new EV Mercedes with a ticket if they didn't move the vehicle immediately that was blocking nothing and disrupting nothing.

To end on a positive note, I can say that aside from the manager at check-in, the entire staff was incredibly friendly. Even the front desk person who'd ignored my multiple calls while looking for some flatware apologized profusely for being on the other line when I called (though I still don't understand why I couldn't get anyone to answer including two other areas). 

For me... I'll be going back to the Four Seasons next time I'm in London.",2,2022,11,21
127,Another wonderful stay,"One of the best, if not the best hotel in London. I've lost count now of how many times we've stayed, and every time it exceeds the previous.

Modern, quiet and luxurious. The staff are amazing.  A special mention to Emily on the front desk who recognised me as soon as I walked in, and looked after us wonderfully. 

This hotel is consistently perfect - from the room to the spa facilities, they are faultless every time.

The only thing I can add on top of my previous reviews of Pan Pacific London are the Christmas decorations; a beautiful giant tree in reception, a huge twinkling bow on the front of the hotel, and nut crackers dotted everywhere, classy, elegant and stunning.

So good, we're coming back in a couple of weeks!",5,2022,11,21
127,Amazing hotel and wonderful staff,"Pan Pacific Hotel was a fantastic experience for the whole family.  Walter from the concierge desk was excellent. He showed us around and even played games with our kids to make them comfortable. The restaurant staff was friendly as well. Breakfast was delicious, and the one night we dined at Straits Restaurant was good. The hotel is located conveniently close to Liverpool station for underground users. For us, they called cabs as we had kids and preferred cabs. Anyhow, I would recommend anyone on edge to go ahead and book this hotel. You won't be disappointed.",5,2022,11,19
127,"Modern style and newly constructed, located in the central business district","Staff were very helpful and polite.  The room felt fresh and modern, with good design styling, although not large enough to include a desk for business travelers.  Dining options were good although not well explained which option to use for different situations.  And the location is very convenient for business. (Take the new Elizabeth line direct from Heathrow to Liverpool St)",5,2022,11,19
127,Really good hotel,"Excellent hotel, lovely room, fabulous breakfast. The service was a good, or better, than anything I have experienced in London, and on a par with Dubai/Abu Dhabi, etc. It is within 400m of Liverpool Street station, excellent location.",5,2022,11,19
127,One of the best contemporary hotels,"What an amazing hotel in a great and interesting part of the city. We had a city view room and whilst it was super expensive, it was worth it for a special treat. 
We travelled with our old small dog and the staff couldn’t have been kinder or more considerate. 
Food in the main restaurant was creative and super tasty.
We will return! 🤞🏼",5,2022,11,18
127,Top Quality Hotel,"Really well located with Liverpool Street Station nearby. The service at this hotel is top drawer, you couldn't fault the staff at the hotel. The rooms are amazing with great views and amenities. Would definitely stay again.",5,2022,11,15
127,"Amazing hotel, with exceptional staff","I was immediately impressed by the Pan Pacific
upon checking in, all of my requests had been met, we were given an early check in around 11:45am and a Walbrook suite on the 18th floor. We were checked in by the guest relations manager who was extremely friendly, polite and professional. We were then taken up to our room by Alejandro, who once again was very friendly and professional. He showed us around our room and explained how everything worked, he also quickly dealt with our request for additional slippers.
The room was amazing, quite spacious for a London hotel, with a separate sitting room with a large tv, it also had a second toilet as you entered the room. The bathroom was lovely with heated floors and a lovely rainfall shower.
The most impressive thing about the room has to be the view, the room looked directly onto the Gherkin and the other skyscrapers around Bishopsgate.
After checking in we went for afternoon tea in the Orchid Lounge, which was amazing. Cherish Finden is a true artist, who has created a spectacular Asian alternative to the traditional afternoon tea. I was a little worried that it would be pretty but not that filling, which was not the case, especially as we were offered refills on the dumplings or Bao buns.
The dessert portion of the afternoon tea was out of this world, and almost too pretty to eat. All this amazing food was coupled with amazing service from Matthew, who was keen to show his knowledge of the tea selection, and offer advice.
The next morning, after a great nights sleep, we went down for breakfast in Straits kitchen. Once again we were met with friendly staff who  really take pride in their job and the hotel.
The buffet was extensive, offering traditional cooked breakfasts and Asian alternatives, along with pastries, fruit, cold meats, and all the other elements of a great continental breakfast. One thing I was very impressed by, was that you could order from the Al a carte menu, and if you had prepaid breakfast (as we had) the price was heavily reduced, which made it affordable to mix and match between the buffet and Al a carte, something I have not seen in many other hotels.
After a full day out and about we came back to the hotel early evening, and considered going down to the beautiful pool area, but decided against it due to the amount of noisy kids in the hotel, which unfortunately does not match the zen feel of the wellness centre.
We instead relaxed in our beautiful suite before heading down to Straits Kitchen for our evening meal, which again was outstanding. This is an Asian restaurant offering traditional dishes with the added wow factor. Once again the staff in the evening were fantastic, especially George, who was funny, informative and a little sarcastic, which we loved! 
All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Pan Pacific London. We are yet to stay in the same hotel twice in London, but out of all the hotels we have stayed in, the Pan Pacific is definitely going to get a second visit.",5,2022,11,11
127,Perfect hotel in the perfect location . ,"Amazing hotel with incredible attentive staff . 
Our room had a brilliant view and had everything you would expect from a hotel of this quality. The  infinity pool area is superb , we were the only ones there before breakfast .  
Breakfast was plentiful and beautifully displayed . 
The hotel is perfectly situated for transport links to the whole of London . The local area has markets , shops , restaurants and pubs. 
The best hotel we have stayed in for a very long time . ",5,2022,11,07
127,We enjoyed our stay. Location was great and staff very friendly and attentive. Vijay our Butler was a game changer!,We enjoyed our stay. Location was great and staff very friendly and attentive. Vijay our Butler was a game changer! He is the secret sauce for the hotel although everyone was fantastic. I would recommend this hotel that has only been open for one year.,5,2022,11,06
127,Super Pet Friendly Hotel,"Amazing from start to finish. From the moment we got close to the front door the staff had already made sure our puppy had a drink! She was welcomed with open arms from everyone she met. Our room was superb. Very comfortable and finished to the highest standard. And had lots of thoughtful touches. The food was very tasty too. I am a titanium member of discovery, so recognised for my commitment. Great location too. Lots to do in the area. I would recommend this hotel to anyone!",5,2022,11,01
127,Hotel Experience 10/10.,"Hamid and VIjay have been amazing and gave great warm welcoming and made me feel like I was at home , I am truly grateful for their hospitality and service towards me I truly feel they deserve a promotion for their hardwork can’t wait to see them again",5,2022,10,30
127,Wonderful Hotel and Best Service by the Staff in London. Love The Pan Pacific and will definitely return in the future!,"The best hotel experience.  Wonderful staff, beautiful spacious room, impeccable service throughout the hotel. Highly recommend this hotel. It is near The Liverpool Street station.  Lots of pubs, restaurants nearby.  Also lots of sights to see nearby within walking distance.  ",5,2022,10,24
127,Asia in London,This hotel offers world class accommodation and super dining experiences. The location is well placed to get around London. I feel like I am in Asia with the ambience of the place and the staff attention. The pool and spa are amazing and very relaxing.,5,2022,10,19
127,Great Family Room in City of London,"We were looking for a hotel to stay in London for a short city break This was perfect. We had one room for a family of four. 

Room - Large and well appointed for all of us. In contrary to a lot of family rooms we have stayed in, the double beds were a great size and perfect for two adults. Children 21 and 16, so they appreciated the space. Everyone slept very well. Bathroom was very nice and the deco stylish and modern. Separate door to toilet which is great with older children. Stunning view across the city. Lots of wardrobe space, wide corridor so you didn't feel you were tripping over each other.

Restaurant - good. Went for high tea which was ok. Food itself was good, but service very slow and staff not very friendly. They all looked a bit bored and tired. Also not sure about the bird cage either. It looks great but it was so heavy that the staff seemed to be struggling with it, so it didn't look very graceful. Don't think it was worth the money and def have had better. 

Breakfast was very different. Very good spread, a lot of variety and staff incredibly friendly and helpful. Surprised tough that wasn't more Asian food at breakfast though. 

Swimming Pool  - pretty cool to swim with a view over the square and watching the commuters heading to Liverpool Street. Shame they close the pool so early though. And weren't that flexible seeing how many guests still wanted to use the facilities. 

Hotel overall - very good. Contemporary and modern design, easy to get to, great location, quiet in the evenings, generally very attentive and welcoming staff (esp door men and concierge  desk) , great family rooms, great breakfast. Maybe swap toiletries in bathroom to a more eco friendly brand. The metal tubes felt very wasteful and wouldn't be able to be refilled. Felt a bit out of touch.",5,2022,10,19
127,Exceptional Team and Hotel,We absolutely loved our stay at the Pan Pacific. The whole team at the hotel really were exceptional from start to finish. Very warm welcoming and attentive to all of our needs. They all really made our stay a very happy and memorable experience.,5,2022,10,18
127,Excellent Guest Relations Manager and Guest Services Manager,"I am rating this property 5 stars on account of the excellent Guest Relations Manager Ms Xinchen Li and Guest Services Manager Ms Kelly Vo. They looked into every aspect of my stay and ensured that each of my preferences were attended to. No detail was too small for them. They catered to each guest with pride and professionalism. They raised my stay from an anodyne sojourn to an unforgettable experience. They are the reason guests will return to the property. Room wise, those facing the plaza are preferable to those facing the offices. The rooms are comfortable and have the usual mod cons as the property is new. Location wise, it's a minute's walk to the Bishopsgate exit of Liverpool Street Station. This means excellent transport connections as well as riff raff outside the station so one has to look sharp and take care of one's belongings. The ever dependable Polo Bar facing the station exit is still open 24/7 and serves a hearty full English as well as other traditional offerings which makes a pleasant change from the unexceptional F&B offerings in the property.  I would like to thank Ms Li and Ms Vo and their colleagues for my stay.",5,2022,10,17
127,Exceptional attention to detail and level of service,Faultless stay. Very friendly staff. We have a business rate agreement with the hotel and it was my first visit.

127,Perfect!,"Everything was perfect! The staff were welcoming, the hotel was spotless and the bed in the room was like sleeping on a cloud. It is expensive but you get what you pay for. The bar was amazing too, the beer was pretty well priced, £8 for a pint which isn’t bad at all.",5,2022,10,11
127,Wonderful place,"Great new hotel. Everything was wonderful, but I enjoyed my visit to the infinity pool the most. The impeccable service during the wonderful breakfast started my day perfectly.

127,Beautiful suite,"A lovely suite with a lovely view of London, very friendly and professional staff. We did have a few amenities missing but staff were quick to fix the issue, my friend was billed for the mini bar tab even though soft drinks were included with our stay.

127,Lovely escape for a couple of days,"We stayed in a Walbrook Suite for 2 nights. Very modern and comfortable with lots of amenities.

127,Excellent 6 Star hotel,"The front desk service was very attentive and professional. We were greeted by Xinchen Li
Guest Relations Manager whom was so so helpful. Her PR is excellent and took us in with open arms. 
The hotel ambience was warm and welcoming with the right mix of traditional, classic charm with a contemporary feel. 
We enjoyed every minute in your esteem hotel. The doorman remembers our name and welcoming us every time when we returned. Our room was deluxe, clean and fresh, lovely bed and amenities. The bathroom is very clean and fresh and all we need is there. Service staff is friendly and helpful. We had a wonderful stay, location is great too, a short stroll to the tube station. We will definitely come back!",5,2022,10,05
127,What a fab stay,We had a really lovely time at your place. Mrs. Xinchen Li and her team had done a fab job on us. The room and SPA were excellent. Best part of the hotel was the staff - all of them where gone the extra mile for us. We can't wait to come back!,5,2022,10,04
127,Impeccable,"From our initial greeting at the door, I cannot fault Pan Pacific. VJ made my 6yr feel like a princess. Check in was smooth(I didn’t get the ladies name on reception but she was impeccable).
Our room was immaculate and I’d let the hotel know prior that it was both my daughters birthdays and they left some lovely treats in the room to make them feel special. 
The wellness area was beautiful. I was in London to run the marathon, so to relax the day before by the pool was just perfect. And families are allocated certain times so the children loved it too. 
My youngest loved the map she was given on arrival to get signatures from all different areas in the hotel, to then win a gorgeous teddy on completion.
There is no doubt we will return to Pan Pacific (no marathon next time though)!
Thank you Pan Pacific for a wonderful stay",5,2022,10,04
127,Late Summer holidays,"This was our second visit of Pan Pacific in two years, which is also the age of this hotel in London. 
It is a great property with class A facilities, but what made us want to stay there again, even if it wasn’t cheap, is the team at that hotel and the recognition and service we get when we stay there. It is the best I have seen in a hotel across Europe and I have been in many over the years. 
They really make you feel as an important individual and all are happy to attend to your needs and make you feel like home! They really make it feel that good. 
We enjoyed our staying experience very much and would look forward to our next stay in London with them if available.",5,2022,10,02
127,Wonderful stay at the Pan Pacific London,"My family stayed at the Pan Pacific London for a week in September, and we enjoyed our stay thoroughly. It is located in a great area with many eateries nearby. Liverpool Street Station is just a 2-minutes walk away.
The hotel is very new and the facilities are top-rate. 
We had a very early arrival and our room was already ready. The front desk staff, especially Tia and Sandra, were very friendly and checked us in quickly and efficiently. 
A special shout-out to Xin Chen and Vijay for their prompt assistance, as well as enthusiasm, in handling our many queries.",5,2022,10,02

127,Wonderful Asian Hotel in a buzzing city,"What a wonderful weekend in London. Having spent a lot of time in Asia, (and staying in some luxurious hotels) I was excited about the opening of the Pan Pacific. Hospitality and friendliness is always at the forefront of Asian hotels which I find lacks in UK hotels. Pan Pacific did not disappoint. 

Pre-arrival I emailed ahead to see if the hotel could accommodate decaf tea and lactose-free milk to be told that wasn't a problem. Box of decaf tea and bottle of lactose-free milk delivered to our room after arrival. Lovely scents walking into reception, friendly and polite greeting from all staff as we walked in. Check in was quick easy, Emily was super friendly and made sure we had a lovely room. 

The room itself was lush. Really well thought out. Heated floors in the bathroom. All the usual amenities. Love the Asian touches. The bed is super comfy and HUGE. Everything is controlled by button, for example curtains. Different light moods again by button. 

Very quiet, we didn't hear any other guests during our stay. The well being floor is lovely including the pool and other facilities.

We didn't have dinner in-house as we had other plans but we did decide to have breakfast on our last day. Once again, lovely friendly and attentive staff. Food was delicious, and I had far too much coffee (as I was constantly topped up).

Also shout out to Jeff for sorting out my Amazon package (after a nightmare delivery fiasco the say before coming down to London). 

All in all the relaxing calming weekend away we so desperately needed.

Will be coming back here again for sure. 

(Super convenient location across from Liverpool Street Station)",5,2022,09,25
127,Classy hotel through and through,"Absolutely top notch hard and soft product, F&B and staff all on top of their game. 

A true 5 star luxury experience. No issues. Had a wonderful nights stay. 

Designed by same team that recently designed The Londoner, the smell of Diptique hits you as you walk through the door and all around the hotel - gorgeous.  

Immaculate public areas, Spacious well appointed rooms, gorgeous bathroom, wellness floor with pool is amazing. Breakfast a feast. In room dining great watching the massive TV and sparkling lights on the city through the floor to ceiling windows.

This is a fantastic hotel in a great buzzy location in the centre of The City - cant recommend Pan Pacific highly enough. Loved it.",5,2022,09,25
127,Birthday treat,"Overnight stay at Pan Pacific , tea at Shiok and dinner in Straits Kitchen. 
We have had the most amazing relaxing time. The staff are so helpful, polite , cheerful and attentive. 
Momo and his crew looked after us at dinner. Lobster Laksa, spicy heaven. Cherish Finden -worth getting diabetes for! The desserts are heaven:) 
When you factor in the absolute dedication of the staff, the attention to comfort and quality of the food, we felt the price was worth it",5,2022,09,24
127,business trip,"an excellent experience , staff very friendly , rooms innovative, fresh and clean..

silver leaf bar drinks good, but evening snacks/food was very poor - limited choice and what we had tasted awful...............",4,2022,09,23
127,Quality food with a twist,"We had dinner at the Straits Kitchen, lovely service but a strange location. 
Let’s be honest, the “restaurant” doesn’t look like a restaurant - they surely optimised the space above the stairs and put some tables together. 
Food was really good, quality ingredients served on top notch dinnerware. 
Lovely vegan options. A bit in doubt on the bill: £5 for a bottle of still water, plus SVC seems ludicrous. 
The “restaurant” remains coherent with the style of the hotel. 
Value for money? Not too sure. It’s clear the chef put some real effort on the menu, chapeau!",4,2022,09,21
127,Family Trip to London,"The hotel was amazing from start to finish. The service level from every member of staff we cannot fault. From the minute we arrived every member of staff went out of their way to help and accommodate their guests. We had booked 2 rooms as we are a family of 5. We were lucky enough to get upgraded in one of the rooms as we are GHA discovery members. It was nice that this was recognised. Have been to other hotels where this has not been acknowledged and we have to remind them. They acknowledged also our birthday and anniversary celebrations. This was very nice of them. 

Breakfast was really nice everyday. Huge buffet selection as well as a menu where you could pick different items. Huge pastry and fruit selection. Also, the coffee and tea selection was nice. Staff were always on hand to serve you whilst you were there. 

The rooms were big and had beautiful views of The Shard. Amenities were very good. They have Diptyque amenities. 

The hotel was very close to everything. Liverpool Street Station is within walking distance and all the sights were very nearby. 

We would definitely stay here again.",5,2022,09,21
127,London City Gem of a Hotel,"We loved everything about this hotel, but the staff really sets it apart. The caring service provided at Pan Pacific is amazing. We felt so at home and loved everything from the bar, afternoon tea and spa to the beautiful room in the hotel. We will definitely be returning to this city gem.",5,2022,09,20
127,Cannot Wait To Visit Again,"If I could rate my visit at a 15 out of 10 I would. The customer service and overall experience was astounding. I spend a lot of time in luxury venues, the Pan Pacific London stood out head and shoulders above the rest. I am very much looking forward to returning.",5,2022,09,17
127,"2 Deluxe rooms with my adult daughters, excellent stay!","Our stay of 6 nights  was everything I was expecting and more.  I like to walk about, London Bridge is only a 15 minute walk.  Minutes walk to grocery stores, Boots, take out, dinners and/or drinks.  You get what you pay for, and they deliver!  I have stayed at less expensive hotels in London, and I cringe thinking about them.  Here, everything is top notch, staff really do care and are helpful at any time.  I will definitely stay there again on my next visit to London:)",5,2022,09,16
127,Best Anniversary Ever!,"We stayed here for 1 night for our anniversary in a suite with an amazing view, the room also came with a private Butler. 
Our Butler VJ was the nicest attentive person who made our stay the most memorable.
From when we arrived to when we left VJ couldn't of done more for us,  VJ is a massive asset to your Hotel! 
Our room or should I say apartment had everything and more than we needed, the view was exceptional, we didn't hear a sound all night. 
The bed was huge and so comfy.
The pool area was also amazing, with a lovely view from the infinity edge, it was nice and quiet when we went an hour before it closed. 
We ordered breakfast in the morning and VJ came and set up the most romantic setting for us in the room, the food was also excellent, would recommend the avo on toast and the french toast! 
There isnt any parking on site but we parked at the closest place which was a 10 min walk. 
Would highly recommend this hotel as they make you feel so special. 
Thank you Pan Pacific",5,2022,09,14
127,Fresh,"Very impressed with the quality of the interior design and attention to detail, especially the joinery and bathroom design. The hotel feels fresh and modern. Definitely go down for breakfast as the choice on offer and layout was top.

Location isn’t somewhere I usually stay, as I prefer to be in the west-end, however with the recent introduction of the Elizabeth Line (3min walk from hotel), you are able to get into Soho, Oxford St etc in 6 minutes (2 stops to Tottenham Court Road).

Room wise I have stayed in both the deluxe double room and Bishopgate Suite and personally preferred the deluxe room, despite being significantly lower priced and smaller. I felt the layout of the Bishopgate Suite was slightly wasted and you pay for space you won’t probably use (wider hallway, separate TV room sparsely furnished, a second WC, and a larger bathroom with a bathtub that is ridiculously small). Regarding views be sure to ask for a room that doesn’t face the office block opposite reception as you’ll have zero privacy: ask for a room at least facing Bishopgate.

Negatives include having to call 5 times for room service or operator (on both stays no one was answering the phone). Room service staff need some training and shouldn’t just leave the trolley in a random position and walk away. Food on two occasions was disappointing.",5,2022,09,11
127,Thanks London Pan Pacific for a memorable stay,This was the best hotel we have EVER stayed at. The location was so convenient (it’s steps away from London Liverpool Station). The hotel is situated in the heart of the city with the most amazing views. The staff treated us like gold. We felt so taken care of. They made our experience so special and memorable. If you want a unique and really amazing experience I would recommend you come here. We went to London celebrating all the things we missed during 2020 due to covid. Everything exceeded our expectations about this hotel. And we really enjoyed our stay here,5,2022,08,31
127,Anniversary,The whole experience was just so amazing and the staff was excellent. It was an amazing and romantic escape for the two of us. The room was so clean. The bathroom floor heated. The bed and pillows were the best of any hotel I have stayed in.,5,2022,08,30
127,"Wonderful hotel, a few tweaks and it'll be absolutely perfect!","A wonderful, luxurious, very new hotel, with great facilities and friendly staff. We were very happy to be upgraded to a room with a view on arrival, and the woman at the check in desk showed us to our room and showed us around which was a nice touch. The view from the 16th floor was incredible, and the room was beautiful, spacious and had everything we needed - the mini bar offerings were especially great. The Diptyque toiletries were a real treat also! We loved the pool, though we felt it was a little cold in temperature, and the 'no kids' hours were not strictly in place - we headed down at one point during the 'no kids' hours to find multiple kids splashing and shouting and disturbing the ambiance. I loved the drawing room where I was able to do some work in peace, though as I was the only one in there I was surprised no staff came to offer me a menu or ask me if I needed anything - I would have ordered some coffee and maybe a snack whilst I worked. The staff at the door of the hotel who would greet us every morning were especially friendly and kind. Ginger Lily bar was wonderful, we got some tasty cocktails and finger food there. My reason for giving an 8 instead of a 10 is the room service / pool service food - this is where the hotel was let down. We ordered room service a couple of times and found the food to be sub par and often incorrect. For instance, I ordered a 3 egg omelette for breakfast and was sent an omelette made of egg whites only which did not taste nearly as good as it would have if the yolks had been included. We ordered fries on another occasion, and the bowls / portions were absolutely tiny, especially for the high price. We also ordered food to the pool, and I ordered a set menu item of scrambled eggs on toast with smoked salmon. The meal arrived with no salmon included, and the eggs had not been seasoned at all and tasted very bland. Compared to other five star hotels, the room service / poolside meals were not up to standard, but otherwise, the hotel was absolutely wonderful.",4,2022,08,25
127,Highly Recommend the Pan Pacific in London,"Per my normal style for a review.
We stayed at the Pan Pacific Hotel for 5 nights at the end of our 2 week vacation in Europe.
As is our usual style of review:

1. The Room –   We had a Deluxe Room and it was perfect.   We asked to be away from the Elevators which we were given.  The room was whisper quiet - never heard a noise.  We had a king size bed which was very comfortable.  The room has a great AC system so given the unusual warm weather we were extremely comfortable.   As well, they provide turn down service which is great after the end of a hectic day in London.   With the turn down service they would always replenish the bottles of water.   Never ran out of bottle drinking water and it was complimentary.   Our view was amazing and one day we sat on our bed with the drapes opened and watched the planes fly in and my wife said it was like lying on the beach watching the planes.    The planes were some distance away so no noise. 
There was a mini bar in the room with some extra room in it for us to put various items in it.

The closet space is good as we had two weeks of clothing hanging in it.   

They provide shaving kit, sewing kit, toothbrushes, shoe brush, comb  so if you forget anything they have it.  

2. Cleanliness
The cleaning staff did an amazing job.  We would come back and find the room spotless and inviting.   Great work.

3 The Bathroom – is a very good size. The bathroom is split into a separate closet room for the toilet and then the rest of it is for the shower and the sink.  The towels are very large and they provide both slippers and nice robes.   The towel rack is heated so when you get out you have a nice warm towel to dry with.  They provided a Dyson Hair Dryer which was great but the plug in is not in the bathroom.   But from the outlet outside the bathroom the cord is long enough so you can dry your hair in front of the mirror.    The shower is a walk in shower which is very large. It is hard to want to get out as it is so nice to just sit under the water and relax.   

3. The Staff - right from the moment you arrive you are treated with great care. The Staff at the front desk are so helpful.  One night we were going to a play and had hoped to take the Tube but due to strikes the Liverpool Station was closed.   We rushed back to the hotel and the Doorman and his assistant were amazing in getting us a taxi - Taxis were at a premium during the Tube Strike.  

5. The Location – great location - minutes from the Liverpool Street Station.  It was great for getting to events (when the strike was not on).   Down the street there are many places to get a quick breakfast our favourite was Eataly.   As well we were close to a Tesco grocery store which proved helpful for grabbing fruit at the end of the night.    Given its closeness to the Tube we would pick a place to eat and then take the Tube to get to it.

6. Closing Comments – simply a great hotel and great staff.  It is not inexpensive but I think for London it was a good value - the more nights you stay the less expensive for following nights.",5,2022,08,23
127,Spectacular,"Me and my partner have stayed in many 5* hotels and this was one of the best. All of the front of house, especially the uniformed bellhops who were extremely attentive and friendly. The hotel is beautiful and our room was so spacious and pretty, best sleep ever; so comfortable and peaceful. The room phone (on which you press 0) is fantastic, the staff answer straight away and you can request anything and the staff will deliver. The mini bar is lovely and the diptyque products are a bonus. This will be our new ‘go to’ London hotel. Thank you for the most perfect stay, can’t wait to return!",5,2022,08,22
127,Hotel stay,"I was fortunate enough to be invited to the Pan Pacific for my 60th birthday 🎂 it was absolutely amazing!! The food and service was excellent and we had the best time ever. Would recommend this hotel 100% thank you x 

Teresa Waugh",5,2022,08,21
127,A must!,"Gorgeous hotel right in the centre of the city. We decided to go for something different to the usual west end and were not disappointed. There is so much to do on the hotels doorstep. The rooms are luxurious, we had a delux city view that was perfect. You feel truly spoilt here and the staff are exceptional. Nothing is rushed and the atmosphere is calm and welcoming. We would love to return!",5,2022,08,21
127,"Good, but maybe something missing?","We stayed at the Pan Pacific for one night in June.

We are currently researching hotels for our wedding weekend in London so I was excited when the Pan Pacific opened. We are looking for something very special for the weekend and the Pan Pacific seemed to tick all of the boxes. (I’m reading lots of trip advisor reviews for 5* London hotels :) )

Before our stay, the concierge reached out which is always a great touch. They asked if we would be celebrating a special occasion so we mentioned we recently got engaged and the reason for staying at the hotel to investigate it for our wedding weekend when we would look to book 2x suites and ~10+ additional rooms. 

On arrival we met with a representative from the sales team to look at the various room options for the wedding weekend which we appreciated (note that I arranged this myself independent of the contact from the concierge). The tour was comprehensive and we got to see all of the beautiful facilities the hotel offers - the spa and pool being particular highlights.

The Pan Pacific is beautiful. Brand new and spotless. I don’t have much really to say about the stay other than how nice the room was and this is the reason for leaving the review. I’m slightly confused by all of the other reviews raving about the service. We didn’t experience bad service, but I also didn’t notice the service at the hotel which for a five star hotel isn’t great. After our initial tour, throughout the rest of our stay we just sort of breezed through the hotel unnoticed. 

Our special occasion (requested by the concierge before arrival - see above) was not recognised during the stay - I guess it wasn’t enough of a special occasion maybe(?). We were slightly disappointed with this given the rave reviews around service and when various reviews show birthdays being celebrated, sometimes with the gesture of a room upgrade (obviously this can’t be expected and is something offered when available).

We enjoyed cocktails in Ginger Lily which were fantastic with a wide range. I don’t like overly sweet cocktails and there were numerous on the menu I found delicious. 

I suppose as a summary, I’m slightly baffled that we stayed at the hotel ready to book multiple rooms and spend thousands with them but noticed no service. The concierge reaching out beforehand is great. And the tour was good, but I set up the tour and the information we sent to the concierge wasn’t followed through. 

Suggestion for the hotel: one thing I love at high end hotels is the fragrance when you walk in (The Langham has a gorgeous fragrance when you walk in). A beautiful fragrance can be immersive and I feel this is a missed opportunity to take the Pan Pacific to the next level.",4,2022,08,20
127,Good stay except for the restaurant's dinner,"Modern comfortable hotel, good breakfast, very courteous staff. Only complain is the dinner at the Strait restaurant. After ordering, starter came soon, but the main course we ordered never show up. I asked the waiter couple times with no affirmative answer. Then the waiter just evaded from us by not looking at our direction or staying away from our table. After more than 1.5 hours, my kids became so starved they couldn't hold up any more. I went to talk to the manager. Manager apologized profusely and within 5 minutes the dishes were all ready. He also offered a discount to the bill as an apology. Still, we decided to avoid the restaurant for dinner for the rest of our stay. When we checked out the hotel, the manager at the lobby came to us to apologize for the dinner experience as well. I appreciate the nice gestures. 

I would put the blame on the waiter for our bad experience, for being too passive in dealing with situations like this. Had I not complained to the manager, I am not sure how much longer we would have waited.",4,2022,08,18
127,"Lovely stay, was expecting more of a business located Hotel but also wonderful for families!","We loved Pan Pacific London, a new hotel in Central London and definitely one to try if your looking for fantastic service and central based, we arrived from Dubai and needed to book somewhere central, close to Liverpool Street due to appointments, we are discovery titanium members so chose Pan Pacific due to the highest reviews, the hotel is great and equally great with families, lovely pool/gym, close to everything, all new, treasure hunt idea for the kiddies to gather stamps, loved it!! The icing on the cake is Ajay, he is their senior Concierge and he really does go above and beyond to make your stay wonderful, especially for the kiddies, our children loved him, he brought them gifts and treats and always had a welcome happy persona, a rare find that we needed to comment on, 

We had a very comfortable stay here and will stay again for sure!",5,2022,08,18
127,Amazing staff in an amazing hotel,"We stay in London 4-5 times a year for long weekends but this was the first time we stayed at the Pan Pacific and all I can say is wow!

From the moment we arrived we were made to feel special and appreciated. We were shown around the hotel and our room by Veejay who was an amazing host and everyone we spoke to or even just passed by spoke a kind word and was amazingly polite and caring.

We were given a free upgrade to the Walbrook suite and the view was outstanding and well worth the money in my opinion.

This is our new favourite hotel and we will definitely be staying again. 100% recommended",5,2022,08,16
127,Wonderful!,Everything was outstanding from check in to check out.  Highly recommend their afternoon tea!  The bathroom is amazing and well laid out.  Couldn't beat the view of the Gherkin right outside the floor to ceiling windows.  Very friendly staff was always extremely helpful.,5,2022,08,16
127,Great hotel for all the family,We were so well looked after from the second we walked into the hotel. The kids were made to feel just as important and loved the treasure hunt. Gorgeous room with one of the best bathrooms I have experienced.,5,2022,08,15
127,Fantastic brand new hotel,"Fantastic from start to finish. An address to remember in central London/The City

Pros:
- brand new
- great sized room with views
- great service
- great wellness area including a pool
- centrally located, easy commute to anywhere in London

Cons:
- service at The Straits restaurant was rather slow however the staff was really nice",5,2022,08,14
127,5* service,"The service was absolutely amazing from all members of staff. I really enjoyed my stay here, and it was surely a memorable birthday. 

From the welcoming by the doorman, to the wonderfully refreshing customer service provided by the receptionist, this experience was wonderful. 

Thank you.",5,2022,08,11
127,Great stay!,"Top notch service. A very accommodating hotel. Note that you are in the business district, not West End; but if you don't mind a long walk, hopping on the subway, or taking a taxi to the tourist areas, then it's a great option.",5,2022,08,09
127,Once again - Perfect,"Once again a fabulous stay, we love everything about this wonderful hotel, the facilities, the food, the ambience and the wonderful staff who are friendly, go out of their way to help and are a real credit to the hotel. we can't wait to come back.",5,2022,08,09
127,A true 5* hotel in London and 5* service,"Had an amazing spa treat at this 5* hotel, right from entering into the hotel it felt special, we were warmly greeted by Vijay who was so helpful in directing us to the restaurant, Vijay was very professional and so polite he deserves 5* alone! My husband booked a suprise treatment for me while he looked after our 2 boys. This lovely lady named Rachel from the spa came to collect me, explained the treatment and got me to relax, which I always find hard to do! Sylvia was my spa therapist, I was booked in for a lymphatic drainage massage with mud clay and she was so professional and so friendly. I felt so refreshed, I was then able to relax in a private relaxation area with a heated lounger and weighted blanket. I wad given a refreshing fruit tea by Rachel and had some nice quiet time. The staff here are amazing, the hotel and services do not disappoint and best if all its a lovely family friendly hotel. Thank you Robbie for being a great host, we look forward to booking our staycataion at this hotel and look forward to the afternoon tea, cannot wait to try it!",5,2022,08,05
127,35th Birthday ,"10/10 would highly recommend! Great location - right next to Liverpool street station, 5 minutes from London Bridge in a car. Perfect for couples, girls/boys night out or even familes. The facilities were great! The pool was lovely, not too cold and the changing room facilities were A1! A big thank you to Florence who made sure everything will be set up for me ahead of my birthday stay! She was so friendly, bubbly and kind on the phone. I am sooo gutted we never got to meet. Then a very special thank you to Vijay!! He was the icing on the cake. He knew what I needed before I needed it. Explained everything so throughly and made so excellent recommendations.. honestly the highlight to my birthday 🥰 I need to go back and try out the restaurant. P.s - when you book, just get a suite! Trust me and thank me later! 😁",5,2022,08,04
127,First Class All the way,I’ve stayed at numerous top class hotels around the world for both business and pleasure and this was the best of them all. Couldn’t fault anything and that’s very very strange situation for me as normally I can always pick something where things could be improved.,5,2022,08,02
127,Amazing Hotel with outstanding service.,"We visited the Pan Pacific this weekend and will not stay at another hotel now. We have stayed at all the major 5stars in the city and the service here blows the others away. From the second we pulled up the valet car service right through to the maids bent over backwards for us, they were so polite and attentive and excellent with our children.
The hotel itself is gorgeous, modern and luxurious.
The only slight comment would be the child times for the pool were not ideal (7-10am and 4-7pm), this is largely when children are eating breakfast or dinner.  
Excellent stay, food excellent and service outstanding, looking forward to our return.",5,2022,07,31
127,Warm & friendly team in top class LON hotel,"Friendly, warm & professional service by the Pan Pacific LON team - particularly Cyril the Head Doorman and Callum the Front Desk Manager. Great food at Straits Restaurant - authentic Asian dishes served by friendly staff. 
Comfy bed & snuggly bathrobes.",5,2022,07,29
127,Superb hotel in great location,I took my partner here for a birthday treat. The hotel enjoys a great location with lots of things nearby. The pool is fantastic and the food excellent. This is a great hotel with exceptionally attentive staff. Highly recommend.,5,2022,07,25
127,Great all round,"I've never been a huge fan of hotels in the UK - but i'll make an exception for the Pan Pacific.

The hotel itself has great ammenities and the rooms are comfotable and well sound proofed - a very rare find in the UK.

The staff are all excellent and go above and beyond.

We ate in the straits restaurant and the food and staff there were also excellent.

This hotel reminds me more of the high standards you'd receive in a hotel in Asia, so to find this in the UK is a real treat, and we'll definitely return next time we need to stay in central London.",5,2022,07,25
127,A Great experience,"I Spent 3 days for business in Pan Pacific Hotel in London
The Meeting rooms were beautiful 
We had a Seamless organisation 
A service with attention to details from all staff 
Only inconvenience is the temperature in Meeting Rooms that was too low.",5,2022,07,24
127,Gem in London City,First time guest. Service and quality reminded me of my experiences in Asia in similar hotels. The atmosphere is one of understated elegance.  All employees went of their way to be helpful.  After a long flight was able to check in early.  The tranquility in the hotel gave the impression there were few guests but it was busy in the lobby and restaurants.  I had the impression that each guest was considered special.  It is obvious that the staff is well trained.  Will stay here again on a future visit.,5,2022,07,23
127,Tranquility in the middle of London,"The Pan Pacific has suceeded in creating, for its guests an emmersive temple like experience of the magic of asia at it's best in the middle of bustling London. 
I highly recommend staying at this hotel  if you wish your bed to be comfortable your senses to be soothed and your views to be magnificent, this hotel is for you.",5,2022,07,23
127,A perfect stay,"My husband and I came here for a birthday celebration.  This was our first visit and leading up to our stay, we received an email from the hotel checking what time we were arriving and if they could help us with anything. On arrival we were made to feel very welcome. Our room had been upgraded and ready for us three hours early. Throughout the whole stay, we couldn’t fault anything. The room was incredible with amazing views. The thing that stood out to us were the staff - they all were polite, attentive and most of all, sincere. The wellness suite and infinity pool was incredible and the pool not at all busy. The location was great - away from the tourist hustle and bustle of the West End but easy enough to get there on the tube or taxi. All in all a perfect stay and we most definitely will be back. Thank you.",5,2022,07,21
127,Amazing concierge service!,"This is a review of Pan Pacific London's concierge service, for an upcoming stay in August 2022. I have had the pleasure of working with Mr. Rodrigues to coordinate pick-ups, drop-offs, and sightseeing tours and I must say it's been THE BEST experience. Through all of the correspondence and many changes, Mr. Rodrigues has been patient, friendly but also very professional, and helpful in making suggestions - ensuring that we would have a great time in London. Judging from this service alone, I have no doubt that we'll have an amazing stay at Pan Pacific London!",5,2022,07,20
127,"If you like clean, square footage, and great service…","The good:
1. People - porters who greet and make eye-contact and promptly help, hostesses who ask where we’d like to sit when there are choices, bar tender who tried to be accommodating with drinks, front desk that arranged for my sunglasses to be taken to the room, concierges (especially Jack and Conor sp?!? Sry) who aren’t allergic to work and answered emails prior to arrival.  Basically everyone we met makes me feel like they must like their job and aren’t indifferent.  International-quality 5 star service on par with the best.  Manager is clearly winning on hiring.
2. The rooms are new and roomy. Heated bathroom floor. Heated towel rack.  Diptyque amenities are a treat.  AC works.  We got the rooms down to super cold - which we loved.  Comfy beds and large pillows.  Hot water is truly hot. Automatic window curtains.  Basically, it’s got all all the plugs and buttons of a new Four Seasons or something.  The rooms are super super quiet.
3. Thoughtful freebies - ok.  LOVE LOVE the ice cold bottles of water at the entrance. Free bottle of wine and chocolates are nice, but other hotels do it too.  But the water is so thoughtful and appropriate for current heatwave.  Super smart.
4. Food. Yum. We had room service and breakfast buffet and Straits Bar and restaurant.  There are 5 of us, so we got to try a bunch of stuff.  If you’re curious about Singaporean cuisine, eat here.

The meh:
1. Couldn’t seem to figure out that there are 3 of us in the room.  We have a 9yo kid.  Missing bath towels (everyday).  We just gave up on asking for a third towel by third night. Both a rollaway and a crib were brought in, which made my kid giggle.
2. Sometimes the turn down service would only put out one pair of slippers by bedside.  Sometimes, they’ll put out 2 pairs.  Like I said, they can’t seem to figure out how many people are actually staying in the room.
3. Location.  Not much around here.  It’s a long walk to most major tourist destinations and West End.  Prepare for cab and Uber rides.  It’s not in the middle of nowhere, but it’s not where you can walk-back-in-the-middle-of-the-day-and-take-a-nap-then-leave-again kind of location.
4. Lobby. It’s not going to be comparable to the old-school charm of some iconic London hotels.

So as comparison, we were at Rosewood London immediately before.  Pan Pacific is a much much better deal.   Equivalent service.  Pan Pacific has much better rooms (not even close).  Location matters though, and we love to stroll back to the hotel from dinner or theater. And it’s hard to get into the restaurants/bars last minute at Rosewood without staying at the hotel. But we prefer the more relaxed, newer, and roomier Pan Pacific.  It’s a winner.  We’ll definitely recommend it and will be going back.",5,2022,07,19
127,"Fantastic property, outstanding service","We stayed here for 4 nights  on a family visit to London.   The hotel is a beautiful and well maintained property that feels at once luxurious and practical. It is an understated high end hotel that doesn’t feel pretentious or overly opulent.  

The rooms are spacious with nice touches throughout. USB plugs on every outlet make charging a family’s worth of devices a breeze. Beds and pillows are comfortable and what you would expect for a hotel in this price range. The bathrooms are well appointed, as well.  Overall, as a family of 4 with 2 kids under 10, we found a 2x double room to be very comfortable with enough room to spread out, even with 4 pieces of luggage. 

What really makes the hotel stand out for me is the service. Before our trip even started, I received an email from the concierge welcoming us, offering dinner reservations, and asking if we needed any assistance with transportation to the hotel. They arranged airport transfers for us and made sure we had a table at the restaurant for dinner on the night of our arrival. 

When our car arrived at the hotel, we were greeted by name, including our children. We were made to feel like VIPs and the kids felt very important. They were offered a children’s activity package with scavenger hunt that sent them around the hotel seeking signatures from staff at different locations - reception, concierge, lounge, spa, etc. Upon completion, the kids were awarded stuffed animals.  Throughout our stay the staff were among the most polite, helpful, and engaging of any hotel we’ve visited. 

Without a doubt I would recommend this property to both business and pleasure travelers. 

Although close to the Tower of London  and only about 2 mi from Buckingham Palace and London Eye, it is not a touristy hotel or area.  This is nice for avoiding the crush of visitors in other parts of town, but you will need to use cabs, underground, or buses to get to most tourist destinations. Not a problem, though, since Liverpool Street station is only a 2 minutes walk from the the hotel. Also, be advised that you won’t have the plethora of tourist dining options you might find elsewhere, especially on weekends when many of the local establishments are closed.",5,2022,07,19
127,Amazing Birthday Weekend,"We had a wonderful stay at the Pan Pacific, the staff made us feel welcome and went out of their way. We had a suite on the 10th floor, which was amazing, the decor was brilliant. We had cocktails in Ginger Lily and ate dinner and breakfast at The Straits Kitchen. I really enjoyed my experience, the food was unique and delicious.

I also had the opportunity to get a pregnancy massage, which made me feel relaxed the masseur was very knowledge and professional and offered me help and guidance for when by pregnancy progresses. We used the pool and amenities which were superior. 

If you get the opportunity to stay here I would highly recommend it. The best hotel I have stayed in, in London.",5,2022,07,18

127,Fab new stylish hotel with great facilities,Stylish and new hotel in the city  -  some quality touches including the fabulous gym and pool which had a nice ambiance in the evening. First hotel stay with a Dyson hairdryer and diptqyue amenities. Bed was super comfy. We had drinks and nibbles in sunny and quiet space outside the hotel. The only criticism was that the Service One promise was extremely slow and uncoordinated …. Everything else was just right at the pan pacific London,5,2022,07,13
127,Promises a lot and could be exceptional,"Booked a suite here for a birthday celebration with girlfriend. Inside the service from front desk and the butler/front of house VJ was fantastic - were made to feel welcome and shown the property and the room. 

You really can’t fault the premises - they are exceptional. Brand new less than a year old. The Devonshire suite itself was lovely with an exceptional view. Spacious inside and lovely marble bathroom - everything you’d expect from a 5* luxury hotel which cost around £600 for the night.

What let’s this down is the service. My main problem which would have transformed this from 3 to 5 star are unforgivable for a luxury hotel of this calibre. 

1. Ordered champagne on the Saturday evening of our arrival via the telephone butler service in the room which was advertised to us as a perk of the room. Around 5/6pm. I was told this should be with us in around half an hour as I had a dinner reservation at a restaurant nearby for half 7 so checked that this would be feasible for them. Told ‘around half hour’ so we ordered.  Nothing arrived by 7pm at which point I rang back down and the same lady sounded shocked that it hadn’t been sent yet and apologised profusely - saying they must be busy. I’m sure they were but really an hour to wack a bottle in a bucket with some ice and 2 glasses takes an hour plus? 

I raised this at checkout from the property at which point I was offered complimentary use of spa for the day which was of little use as we were travelling back. 

2.At checkout I was asked given the above situation if I had used minibar. We hadn’t but had bought a couple drinks from the bar in the lobby  - which I then paid at checkout. Everything was settled. I returned home and noticed another £40 charge had been taken saying ‘minibar use’ later that day. Emailed and told it was concerning the use of ‘intimacy kit’ and ‘mobile phone charge kit’ in the room. We hadn’t used either of these and at no point even seen these items in the room - must’ve been a mistake from housekeeping from a prior departure from the room. In all fairness this email was acknowledged and advised a refund would be issued.

All in all the overall experience of this property would be a 5* here had the 2 points above not occurred - I think a hotel aiming itself in the luxury market should prioritise on customer service which was lacking here - these charges after leaving the property for sure left a sour taste in the mouth!",3,2022,07,11
127,Afternoon tea celebration,"Fantastic. The afternoon tea was sublime and could not be faulted. The staff are top-notch, friendly, professional, knowledgeable.  A friendly and relaxed atmosphere.  We felt most welcome.  We will be back soon (I hope!)",5,2022,07,10
127,Another wonderful stay at Pan Pacific London,"My Wife and I have stayed a couple of times before.  It's our current 'go to' London hotel.  We've stayed at the likes of the Corinthia, The Ned and other high end hotels, but the Pan Pacific's modern interior, faultless service and excellent facilities far exceed the competition.  

As with other high end London hotels, you get what you pay for. Pan Pacific London provides a quality of service and facilities at a price point which is excellent value for money, and sets it apart from the rest.

The staff are genuinely happy, always with a smile.  The infinity pool is sublime, and the rooms are spotless, silent and comfortable with views of the Gherkin and The Shard - everything we look for in a hotel.  

My Wife forgot her hair straighteners, and to our amazement not only did guest services provide a pair, but GHD Platinum none the less!  This doesn't mean much to me, but my wife was incredibly happy!

Our thanks again to Xinchen and the team.  We're already booked to come back next month with family.",5,2022,07,07
127,"Great Hotel in the City, poor Food&Beverage","Opened during the pandemic, this is a new hotel in the heart of the City, steps from Liverpool St station. With a south East Asian origin and a long way from the Pacific, they have accentuated this as an exotic differentiator - names of bars, restaurants and cocktails evoke balmy Singapore in austere London. The rooms are supremely comfortable and beautifully decorated, and every staff member is exceedingly friendly and helpful. The Food & Beverage is the negative for this wonderful establishment: they are mostly empty anyway as other guests must have figured this out too and patronised the dozens of options nearby. As an example, Avocado on toast with crispy bacon from the ala carte breakfast menu arrived as avocado from an electric blender on soggy bread with barely cooked bacon - all 3 elements poorly executed (chef should walk across the road to the Drift Bar who served this simple dish perfectly). We also disputed the charge of £15 for two club sodas in Straits Bar - more than the cost of beer and wine - multiple managers became involved and reduced this by £5! (Note we were spending over £400 per night). 
Enjoy the hotel, have breakfast across the road and enjoy all the bars and restaurants elsewhere.",4,2022,07,06
127,Pleased as Peas!,"Absolutely delightful stay at the London Pan Pacific.  Relatively new hotel - everything is modern and functional and CLEAN.  Biggest asset though is the staff.  Terrific at every single level, from the front desk who helped us with an early check in and complex arrangements for the three rooms we needed, to the doormen who remembered our names and offered helpful directions whenever we went out, to the service staff who cleaned our rooms twice a day spotlessly.  Everyone had genuine smiles in their faces and seemed to take pride in their craft.  Kudos on training and talent selection!  And on top of it all, the restaurant was great.  Wonderful sunday brunch and a cooking team that was visible and happy to talk about their craft.  The wine list is exceptional, especially the champagne and sparkling options, and the head somm really knows his stuff with great recs at reasonable prices.  Highly highly recommend.",5,2022,07,05
127,Excellent hotel experience!,"First and foremost, the service was excellent! Friendly and most welcoming reception, brilliant service in the dining areas, helpful concierge and amazing cleaning service!
The Pan Pacific hotel exceeded our expections and we will definately be back again in the future. Thank you!",5,2022,06,27
127,Top notch hotel,"Everything from the beauty and cleanliness of the rooms to the outstanding service… This hotel is at the top of my list of favorites!

127,An oasis in London,"If you would like to come to London and stay at a brand new hotel, with a staff that is so pleasant, so helpful, and willing to make your stay special, this is your place. From the front desk, to the concierge, to the excellent support staff, we have had nothing but a delightful experience. 

Just this week with a transit strike, the staff helped us secure a ride with little to no transportation options. They have helped us secure restaurant reservations, and have just been the haven you need when you come back to the hotel in the evening. 

Being in the east end with so many excellent food options, close to so many sights, and a property with an amazing indoor infinity pool, an excellent gym, and a cozy bar, you will not regret it. 

There is nothing more that I could wish for in a hotel on a family vacation.",5,2022,06,22
127,Amazing,"The hotel and the staff are AMAZING!
Everything is great in this hotel, the service, the food, the ambiance everthing is clean.
They treated me like a QUEEN!

I will come back.",5,2022,06,21
127,Superb,"My husband booked the hotel as a surprise for my 30th. Wow it is truly superb, we were very warmly greeted by Christoper in reception, the process was smooth, quick and they very kindly upgraded our room. Alex from the Concierge team was very helpful in assisting with our luggage and showing us the bedroom. The bedroom was beautiful - immaculate, bed was massive and very comfy. The bathroom was stunning. 
We did not use the gym but it looked great. The swimming pool area was very tranquil and we spent a good few hours there.
We enjoyed a number of cocktails in the bar, Antonio was fab and made us some custom made cocktails - ""pear pressure"". 
We will defintely be returning and already looking forward to our next stay!",5,2022,06,13
127,Unforgettable Stay,"I had a great experience at Pan Pacific London. The room was huge and immaculately clean. The service and the facilities were all undeniably wonderful. The Kopi Tiam afternoon tea we enjoyed at the Orchid Lounge was just lovely. They, especially the Guest Relations Team, were so nice to have accomodated my requests since I wanted to make it special as I was celebrating my birthday. It was also good that they offered out of hours/overnight in room dining. The only issue I had was that the phone inside our room wasn't functional that I had to call the reception with my own phone. Overall, it was an unforgettable stay.",5,2022,06,10
127,Amazing,"Recently had a staycation to celebrate the Jubilee weekend and what an incredible stay we had. Not only is the hotel oozing with luxury, the staff are so friendly & helpful . Kelly checked us in and was really engaging, she even offered to get me tissues for my running hay fever nose!! The rooms are stunning and very well thought out, my teenage daughters, loved the Dyson hair dryer. 2 big standouts for us The Wellness floor is a real wow, the pool area is beautiful and relaxing with views of The City. The other wow was the welcome our Dog received. A toy on arrival, a Paws book, showing everything available within the hotel and to do in the area , but also in the room he had waiting a dog bed, 2 bowls, poo bags and some gorgeous treats, he was a very happy dog to say the least.  Thank you to all for a fab stay.",5,2022,06,06

127,Luxury and the kind staff.,"A longtime friend treated me on a weekend Londen in a luxury hotel as this was on my bucketlist. Bless him

The hotel was fantastic. A huge room with marble bath and shower. A bed which you do not want to get out of.
Tv, temp controlled, amazing view and two tomes a day cleaning.
There is a sauna and steam room, a large pool, massages.
Delicious foods and drinks (special thanks to the lily bartenders)
Everything I wished and more. 

But the best part was the staff. 
They welcome you as a friend and throughout our stay they made us feel real special. 
And those little extras. For instance, they booked us great restaurants and upon arrival we received a complimentary drink of the hotel.

All request where taken care off. 
And everything with a big warm smile.
I really feld welcome and appreciated.

For me this luxury and kind staff has been a once in a lifetime experience which I will always cherish. Thank you.",5,2022,06,01
127,Fantastic hotel in great location ,"The hotel was perfect, calm and quiet Situated opposite Liverpool St Station, it is easy to get around on the tube and only 10 mins walk from the Tower of London. Service is excellent, the staff are friendly and attentive and the hotel is spotless.",5,2022,06,01
127,The most amazing experience,"Loved our stay at Pan Pacific! They made it so special for my girlfriends birthday, down to the little details.

127,Glorious  memories made,Wonderful hotel with beautiful amenities in a superb location and the staff are friendly and efficient making our stay memorable. We occupied several rooms and each beautiful with everything you could need,5,2022,05,30
127,Amazing hotel but skip the hotel breakfast,"We went here for my 30th birthday celebration and stayed for one night. The hotel is very new and staff was amazing. 

The location is great, a few mins from Liverpool street station. The room was amazing. Fairly spacious with a separate seating area. Bathroom is very big with separate shower and bath. Bathroom is fully stocked including bath salts and all the small amenities you might need. I loved the design of the room too. Perfect mix of oriental details and Scandinavian cosines. 

The hotel has a lovely pool that looks out onto the street. We can also recommend the afternoon tea. We ordered room service which again was lovely and served by a lovely gentleman. 

The breakfast was a bit of a let down, I expected more from a hotel of this standard. The selection of the continental was average. No fresh pastries, they all tasted quite stale. My partner wanted one of the breakfast dishes of the menu and this meant that he could not have any of the continental buffet breakfast. If he wanted that, he had to pay the full price of the continental. Bit weird. I would personally skip the hotel breakfast and find one of the great breakfast places somewhere in London, there are plenty for much cheaper.",4,2022,05,29
127,Fabulous new hotel in the city,This is a really smart new hotel right opposite Liverpool Street station. Love the modern vibe. The room was huge and very stylish. I guess the only issue is there was no desk which is surprising considering it’s in the heart of the financial district of London. Other than that I have zero complaints.,5,2022,05,29
127,The epitome of service,"My husband and I have traveled to London for business and pleasure often over the years and have stayed at a number of hotels throughout the city. Without question, the service at the Pan Pacific is top tier. From the welcome to the goodbye, we never wanted for anything. In addition, the rooms are spacious with no noise transfer between rooms, the beds are comfortable, and the hotel is about a three minute walk to the Liverpool Street tube station. We hated to leave! Thank you to all of the staff who made our stay relaxing and comfortable.",5,2022,05,26
127,Possibly the best service!,"We stayed here as a couple in May 22 and were extremely impressed. Our first stay at a Pan Pacific property and it won't be the last. The hotel itself is lovely, the views exceptional and zero noise transfer from adjacent rooms but what really makes it is the staff. 

From checking in to checking out everyone we met said hello, was courteous and kind and seem genuinely engaged with us. VJ was EXCEPTIONAL. A real asset and credit to the hotel and possibly the most engaging and warm person we've met in many stays across many hotels. VJ, if you ever get to read this then you are a superstar! And so dapper you made the rest of us look bad!

The pool was an excellent length and spotlessly clean. We didn't eat or drink within the hotel but would recommend Duck and Waffle in the building next door (but be sure to book). 

We will be back!",5,2022,05,25
127,Beautiful hotel inside and out!,"Our stay was perfect. The staff are priceless, going above and beyond to make sure we was comfortable. Every detail felt both beautiful and stylish. I would highly recommend this hotel. We can’t wait to visit again!",5,2022,05,24
127,The new pinnacle in London hospitality,"I am quite fortunate. I stay in a lot of hotels around the world. Most are outstanding some are even perhaps considered world-class.

London has always been a challenge for hotels because while there is abundant quality, the value has been relatively low. That is no longer the case with the debut of Pan Pacific London. Also, the best properties are generally in absolutely dreadful locations for me (Hotel Cafe Royal, looking at you here).

This hotel gets everything right. The physical plant is truly stunning, the suites are thoughtfully laid out. The construction was clearly a ""spare no expense"" program. The location ticks all of my boxes.

Where the hotel really shines is service quality and delivery. They have clearly hired from the best in London and it shows. I would describe the overall service as Asian formality meets London effortless upscale casual. The staff is also highly conscious of feedback and personal preferences--a key differentiator between excellent and best.

The concierge and housekeeping staffs are notably wonderful. VJ the head butler and Conor at the concierge have both truly gone above and beyond for me.

Nothing in the realm of humanity is perfect, so the one point where I think the hotel can improve is the breakfast service. It's very good but could be outstanding--I got bored of it after a few consecutive days.",5,2022,05,24
127,Perfect!,Beautiful hotel. The rooms and public spaces were luxurious.  Loved the cocktails in the Ginger Lily. Food excellent. The staff were amazing. Friendly and helpful but never intrusive. This is our second stay in a Pan Pacific hotel and it won’t be our last!,5,2022,05,24
127,Just the best hotel in London,"Outstanding welcome and a really luxurious hotel a short walk from Liverpool Street. 
The hotel treated us like old friends and made us feel spoilt. 
We went to celebrate a birthday and without prompting the hotel provided a complimentary cake and bottle of wine. 
One of the hotel butlers (Vj) was very attentive and went out of his way to look after us. ",5,2022,05,24
127,Would highly recommend this hotel for luxury experience for rather reasonable price,"Extremely nice and helpful service. Overall great hotel everything is new, nicely furnished, well equipped. Luxury feel en small details all over the room - starting with bathroom, amenities furniture and design elements.",5,2022,05,23
127,My new favourite hotel!,"What a beautiful hotel! Loved everything about it, from the cool stylish bars to the luxurious room. Lunch in Straits was delicious and the service was second to none.

127,Pan pacífic london,"In the age of quality of service, customer experience, they must find a new expression to define the stay in their Hotel (home), since their team leaves these expressions very short. Starting with Mr. Said, an exceptional professional, who transfers to his work the sensitivity and proximity that he possesses as a person, reaching a total connection with the client, and the excellent service provided by Mr. Tom and the rest of his team, having made us decide to return to London, for having made these days an indelible memory of our lives. Simply, thank you very much.",5,2022,05,18
127,Excellent experience,"Before stepping foot inside I was greeted so pleasantly. The Ladies at check-in were lovely and my odd request to help with a dress faux par was no issue at all. The room was stunning, everything is thought of, including the introduction given of all the modern features of the room. Have no fear of forgetting anything! If you do though, the team here are so accommodating, it feels as though there isn’t anything that is too much bother. I had a wonderful sleep and woke up with an amazing view from my floor to ceiling window. I will most definitely recommend to friends and family, and will stay again.",5,2022,05,16
127,Flawless from start to finish!,"We just celebrated our 10 year anniversary with Pan Pacific London, and it was absolutely flawless from start to finish! The staff and service were absolutely incredible, we were so well looked after and no request was too big for the wonderful team.

We'll definitely be back, thank you for a perfect stay!",5,2022,05,16
127,Couldn’t recommend more!,"Fantastic hotel, the decor is beautiful and the rooms are stunning with great views. Bathrooms are finished to a very high standard, with great touches like Dyson hairdryers, a bath and a shower. The pool is a lovely way to relax. Can’t wait to come back!",5,2022,05,16

127,Best hotel in London,"We have stayed in many hotels in London! But this hotel really was exceptional! I’m so glad I read all the reviews and went here! It’s a real hidden gem it doesn’t look like a hotel from outside. The location is on point right at Liverpool Street station (yet you don’t hear any noise at all which is rare for London so that was great) We had a Friendly and warm welcome, everyone smiling was lovely! Room was beautiful lovely size crystal glasses great tv dyson hairdryer etc. super comfy bed an pillows! We ordered room service which was lovely again staff great. We headed down to the pool which was beautiful (wouldn’t mind the temp being a touch warmer) but wasn’t cold. Used all facilities including gym which had 5* equipment. 
Breakfast the next day was great what a great selection again lovely staff this hotel should pride themselves on what great staff they have hired! Everything about this hotel was 5* and so would highly recommend x",5,2022,05,16
127,Chic City Luxury,"The hotel is beautiful from the moment you walk in.  Reception large and tea and water offered as you check in.

The room was wonderful - floor to ceiling windows formed our outer walls so the view from our room on the 18th floor was stunning looking over Heron Tower and The Gherkin.  Very large comfortable bed, all amenities were high end and everything you can need has been thought of.  Large bathroom with brilliant shower too.

Pool and fitness area also very beautiful, and staff are attentive without being intrusive throughout the hotel.  We were only there the 1 night for an event which felt like we had wasted an opportunity to really make thr most of the hotel and it's wonderful food and drink offerings.  So we will be back!!!",5,2022,05,15

127,Fabulous place to stay,"Spent one night at the hotel, service and facilities were great as were the staff who were very welcoming. Very clean and modern both around the hotel and the rooms. Location was ideal also for getting around London. Highly recommend",5,2022,05,11
127,Re : Service Problems Galore but Good Service Recovery,"I decided to try this hotel due to the favourable reviews in Tripadvisor. Initially I booked a standard room for 4 nights, then decided to upgrade to a suite, but have reservations for how good it is to stay for 4 nights and I decided to amend to 1 night just to try out. 

Arrival

I arrived by hotel car from St Pancreas train station. The hotel lobby is tucked away in part of an office tower + hotel known as the Bishopgate tower. There is no bell hop present at the entrance when I arrive so I simply carried my luggage in. I read somewhere there is sit down reception check-in but obviously this was not the case, I checked in at the reception counter. Not much of a welcome or pleasantries and the check-in process was very formal but quick, kind of like check-in to a 5 star business hotel. The reception staff took my credit card as deposit and I was given my card key. 

Well, the “warm welcome” I thought I can expect only started after check-in formalities. I was warmly greeted by Guest Relationship Manager Ms XinChen.  She escorted me to my room and asked me to contact her if I need any assistance. Well, that was really needed as you can read later on. 

The Room 

I booked a Devonshire suite, which is rather spacious but sparsely decorated. It is modern contemporary décor that can be found about anywhere in a city hotel. The suite has modern convenience like automated curtains, two large Samsung LED Tvs and a well stocked minibar. I was upgraded later on to a Walbrook suite due to problems encountered in my 1st suite. It just slightly bigger with a separately guest toilet near entrance. The later suite has a view of the rather eye-catching Gerken tower which is quite nicer, esp at night with the lights on. 

In both suites, the bathroom is ensuite but the bathtub is very small and narrow and I am average size and can barely fit in. Water pressure is low and could have been better. The lighting system in the room has a sensor which turns the lights in the room on or off depending if it can detect movement. Frankly it’s annoying as it turns on and off for no reason. The curtains automatically opened when one enters the room which is not a good idea as the hotel rooms have an east-west orientation and with many tall glass towers nearby, the sun’s reflection back into the room can be rather glaring without the curtains closed. There is also no working desk in both suites. 

Common Areas and Location

The hotel has a restaurant called straits kitchen which served “Singapore” dishes. Being Singaporean, it feels kind of strange to see a menu with Singapore hawker’s favorites like laksa, chicken rice in London, but with markup pricing. I did not try eating here as I only stayed for one day but I did had breakfast and it was standard breakfast fare in traditional 5 star hotels. Good quality but nothing particularly outstanding. 

The hotel is located in Bishogate area and near Liverpool station. Some interesting restaurants around the hotel and a nearby convenience store like Tesco. A few steps further there’s a flea market. The immediate area other than the Bishogate tower is rather run down, with a lot of beggers on the street, certainly not as upscale as Knightsbridge and Mayfair. 

Service

This is the area that the hotel falls flat on it’s face. After I checked in to my suite, I was trying to relax and watch some youtube videos before I sleep only to discover that I was not able to do so. I tried to use the hotel’s comcast feature built into the TV but it didn’t worked. I called “Service One”, the hotel’s service hotline and after a few merry go rounds, a staff called me back to inform that Comcast software no longer works with youtube. 

So I requested to connect my AppleTV which I had with me. The staff sent a technician to me and declare to me that it is not possible to connect any 3rd party device like my Apple TV due to “Hotel’s policy” which is ludicrous. I then asked if he can provide me with Samsung’s original remote and I will do it myself and he said it’s not possible also, the only remote is the custom remote in the room. So I had to call again to reception which said they will check but then never get back to me. The telephone in the room was faulty and it was difficult to speak clearly to the person on the line. Worse, everytime someone different will answer the phone and I had to repeat my request again. And this is for the simple matter of trying to watch youtube on the TV. If the Pan Pacific Hotel is a 20 year old hotel with old hardware, that’s understandable, but the hotel is barely one year old. What’s the point of having the latest TV and gadgets when guests are not able to utilize?

I decided to take a bath after all these hassle. I turned on the rainforest shower and instead of water coming down, I was caught by surprise when the water was shooting sideways, one directly at my face! So it was not possible to use. I had to use the handshower. By now, I was fuming and almost went ballistic. I called “Service One” and this time demanded to see Ms Xichen immediately as I felt only she can possibly address my problems. The staff promised to contact her for me. 

10 mins later, 2 guest relationship staff and Ms Xichen turned up as well. After hearing and understanding my problems and also the issue with the shower, she was very apologetic and suggested a room change, an upgrade to the Walbroke suite with a Gerken tower view. I accepted and she and another guest relationship staff started to attempt to connect my AppleTV in the new suite. After about an hour later the connection was a success and I moved to my new suite, with my AppleTV hooked up. Ms Xichen also offered a complimentary dinner via room service as her gesture to make amends. I accepted. Soon I was relaxing and resting in my suite. Credit where it is due to the hotel’s service recovery and especially the effort of Ms Xinchen. 

The following day, I had breakfast at the Straits kitchen and service was quite decent. I also used the gym which looks rather well equipped. No service or gym attendant around. 

I did not used the hotel services again until check out. Unfortunately, Ms Xinchen was off during my check out date so I asked the staff to arrange a bell hop to pick up my luggage. After waiting for like 15 mins, the bell hop didn’t turned up so I carried my own luggage down ( 4 pieces ). Check out was smooth thankfully without any long wait. 

One point to note, booking suites I am supposed to have Butler service but I did not see the Butler for the entire duration of the stay. If Butler service doesn’t come with the room, the hotel should not advertise on the website as such. 

Conclusion

This is a standard 5 star business hotel but nothing more. It cannot aspire to be ranked among top class London luxury hotels with services like this. Staff all seems to be poorly trained and they lacked co-ordination with each other, forcing guests to repeat and explain the request everytime a different person picked up the phone.  Especially those answering Service One hotline. If Ms Xinchen was not on hand to resolve the issues and perform the service recovery, I am quite sure my problems won’t be resolved. However, these problems like the TV connection problems and the showerhead issue should not have happened in the first place. Someone should check the room especially suites before a guests checked in. For the service recovery, I give the hotel a 3/5. Otherwise, it would be 2/5. Much improvement is needed before I will consider to return.",3,2022,05,08
127,Another great stay at this wonderful hotel!!,"I spent two night at the hotel and had a wonderful stay. From the initial welcome, to the dinner, through to the breakfast and check out, the staff were very helpful. 

One small, minor observation was the breakfast team. They were great but seemed stretched so service was a little slow. I wasn’t in a rush so it didn’t matter but if I needed to head off for a meeting it may have been an issue. 

The Ginger Lilly Bar staff didn’t seem as friendly or knowledgeable as my last visit. Maybe they were new? The cocktails were delicious though and will certainly return. 

I am actually booked in to return again next week! 

The hotel itself has to be one of, if not the best in London if you want something different from a quintessential English feeling hotel.",5,2022,05,08
127,Excellent City Break in London,"Outstanding hotel in the heart of London. Will get a feeling of being a valued and distinguished guest.

127,"Great, relaxing and comfortable 5 star hotel.","I want to praise the concierge, they went above and beyond on every request we had. The room was big compared to other 5 star hotels in London, the shower was great and the bed comfortable. Ofcourse the spa area was fantastic. The only thing could be better is the food at the restaurant.",5,2022,05,04
127,Technically excellent,"The service, rooms, drinks, dining, Spa … all 5stars and above … just the staff, although trying to be friendly and welcoming, were a little intrusive, kept referring to my friend as my wife, asking why we had so many suitcases (3 small travel cases) for an overnight stay etc. Not everyone wants to make small talk.",5,2022,05,03
127,Birthday celebrations,"From the moment we arrived, everything was taken care of. The staff were so attentive and made both of us feel very welcome and relaxed. It's probably the best service we have experienced and we have both travelled extensively. Absolutely superb and very much because of the attitude of the staff - Heaven in London!",5,2022,05,03
127,Understated luxury,"Wonderful stay from start to finish.   Understated luxury,  polite and efficient staff, nothing is too much trouble. 
We stayed two nights in a double, double on the 17th floor. Spa was quiet and childrens hours are restricted although my only negative would be that  there were two children in the pool Sunday at 12 o’clock - they were reasonably quiet and staff were keeping an eye on them but it would be nice to adhere to that rule .   Staff are constantly on hand everywhere to assist you and make your stay as relaxing as possible and feel well
and truly looked after.   Diptyque toiletries are a lovely luxury touch, luxury bathrobes,  remote curtains and any lighting at your fingertips. 
This is a very peaceful haven in a busy area.",5,2022,05,02
127,Below high expectations. Tremendous potential.,"This is a great looking, modern, well specced hotel which does many things right:

To help distract us from the sometimes unavoidable long queues at the check-in desk we were presented with some chocolate and green tea. This attentiveness was immediately noticed and filled me with hope.

Professionalism of most staff - We felt in safe, reassuring hands during our stay and staffing levels meant that you weren't waiting around to speak to someone (with the exception of at check-in).

The facilities were excellent. It's a brand new hotel and we were in a ""Premier Room"" (no upgrades on this occasion) so everything looked and felt permium. The main difference between the Premier Rooms and the standard Deluxe Rooms (from what I gather) is the Premier has a bath which is fantastic. Some would say a bath should be standard in a 5-star new-build hotel, especially as indulgence is actively encouraged in the marketing.

The gym, swimming pool, sauna/steam room were truly exemplary. First class facilities and a joy to use.

The mini-bar actually had snacks/drinks that one would want to consume. We refreshed the mini bar a couple of times during our stay.

The Straits Kitchen restaurant is excellent and a real focal point for the hotel. Very well executed dishes and the atmosphere well refined.

We also went for afternoon tea at the Orchid Lounge which was another highlight. They provide a traditional British afternoon tea and a Singaporean Kopi Tiam. Excellent, generous service and the pastries provided by Head chef Cherish Finden were works of art.

Where this hotel dropped marks:

On two occasions when calling down to reception to be put through to the Room Service team I was transferred onto what was a dead line. No answer for a couple of minutes which meant I had to redial to be put through correctly

Housekeeping is promised twice daily and we only received this once (on my prompting) over a two night stay

There was an issue with the TV (streaming) late on the first which we were promised that they will organise for engineer (who was not on duty that day) to return the following day to our room to fix it. Again we had to prompt the front desk the next afternoon for the engineer to visit the room.

The breakfast is overpriced but satisfactory. What wasn't acceptable was a 15 minute wait for two teas.

These issues were raised with the hotel staff upon check-out and I was again promised that I would be contacted by one of the managers to discuss my concerns. Without trying to sound like a broken record, obviously this contact never materialised.

All in all the stay was enjoyable but in the upper tier of hotels (with matching price point) that this hotel quite proudly places itself, the stay and service should be flawless. The gym and swimming pool are fantastic but in all honesty the key attractions of the hotel (the restaurant and afternoon tea) do not require to you to book a room to enjoy.",3,2022,04,30
127,Excellent,"Excellent stay!! Very helpful staff, very nice room and perfect location. I did not have breakfast but we had a good dinner at the asian restaurant.

To improve: the pillows are too big. I could not use them. Provide a different choice of pillow to the customer

Thank you for a great stay!",5,2022,04,28
127,Beautiful food and service,Dined at the Straits Kitchen and the food was fantastic. The Hainanese chicken for main was delicious. The best starter was the Beijing Aromatic duck rolls. Very professional service from all staff. Chef Nas came out to tell me about the food the kitchen had prepared. I was very well taken care of on my visit.,5,2022,04,26
127,Lovely Peaceful Relaxing Stay,"Had a lovely stay at this hotel. The staff were all amazing and helpful - particularly Ben. When there were a few small issues - he was able to deal with very professionally. 

We had a beautiful room with fantastic views over the city. Highly recommend. Hopefully we will be back soon.

We visited both bars and they were both very good - delicious cocktails and attentive staff.",5,2022,04,25
127,My absolute favourite hotel in London,"My absolute favourite hotel is London, it’s faultless and so clean and beautiful, leave every time feeling completely refreshed and zen! 
And always looking to book my next stay!
It’s a absolute must if you want a luxury spa hotel in a perfect London location.",5,2022,04,24
127,Pleasurable experience,"We stayed for 3 days in this beautiful hotel.  Everything was up to 10.  The staff at the reception were especially helpful and wanted to do everything for us. The spa and pool are absolutely great, good to come there and relax after the day.  It surprised us how interesting this area is around this hotel, lots of good restaurants and a few markets.  We will definitely stay at this hotel again.",5,2022,04,24
127,None,"This is my second time staying at this hotel and I have to say, the experience remains above and beyond. No words can describe nor pay back for such excellent hospitality and customer service. I want to seize the opportunity to thank Conor and Luis for helping me have the greatest experience in London thus far; they accommodated all of our stay and they nailed it.

Finally, I'd like to mention that we used to frequent Rosewood Hotel until our last stay back in January 2022. We split our stay between Pan Pacific and Rosewood as a result. Now, we can say with full confidence that Pan Pacific is exponentially better in every aspect from service to overall experience. We definitely plan to go back to Pan in the near future, and will recommend it to all of our friends and family.",5,2022,04,22
127,Exceptional,Beautiful stay here. Staff are so friendly and welcoming. Great with the children too. Very clean and luxurious. Will stay again. Infinity pool was amazing and the service around the pool is spectacular. Can’t wait to return!,5,2022,04,21
127,Amazing Birthday weekend,"The hotel is amazing!! When we first arrived we were greeted by the friendly doormen and reception checked us in straight away even though we were 4 hours early. It was my birthday so they upgraded us to an better room which was incredible. We were shown to our room and we fell in love with it straight away. The hotel has literally thought of everything!! We headed down to the spa which was a little busy with kids, but this was not a surprise as it was school holidays. We found it strange as a couple that the steam room and sauna facilities were separate but it didn’t take away from our time there. In room dining was a little pricey for the portion size but the food was fresh, arrived on time and tasted delicious. The next day at checkout the concierge kindly offered to hold our bags whilst we walked around London and the check out process was smooth. We would definitely come back again. This hotel was 5 stars in every way.",5,2022,04,18
127,40th at Pan Pacific,"Stayed for a few nights and couldn't fault our time here. Staff were all helpful and courteous. It was my  husbands 40th, and so they kindly upgraded us to a larger room. The room was spotless and spacious. We also booked the afternoon tea by Cherish L. Absolutely delicious. Surprising tastes and flavours. Breakfast was also delicious. Lots of choice. 

I'll definitely be staying  here again

127,Fantastic hotel,"Lovely new hotel, clean and tidy. Rooms have everything you could need. Nespresso coffee was nice in the morning. We were at the back of the hotel on floor 7, which had views of london but at the back so not great however I felt this helped as we had no noise at all affecting our stay from the busy London streets and with a child sleep was needed.
Location was fine as close to train and subway. Loads of places to eat around the hotel. 
Swimming pool was lovely, they had swim times allocated for children which is when we used it. Sauna and steam is in the changing rooms so we didnt use these as wanted to go in together. 
Reception gave our son an Easter quest to complete which he loved doing and they gave him a prize when completed which we thought was lovely. 
I would definitely stay at this hotel again when I visit London.",5,2022,04,16
127,One of the Best Hotels I have ever stayed in. Truly Luxurious and Highly Recommend this Hotel If Traveling to London!,"This is truly a luxurious hotel. The staff were nice, professional and go above and beyond for you with any request or needs. Our room was spectacular.  We were in a premier room on the ninth floor.  The view was amazing.  The bed, bedding was wonderful.  The room was spacious and had a wonderful couch. The amenities were high end. Loved this hotel and will definitely return and recommend to all my family and friends!",5,2022,04,13
127,"great location, amazing rooms!","The hotel staff were really friendly and amazing! I liked being offered Tea and a biscuit on arrival. The use of the spa facilities was really good like that they are complimentary with your room booking. as well and they moved us to a room with a better view. Unfortunately, as the systems were down I think that threw the staff off a little bit and they forgot to mention all the facilities in the hotel, I had to go back downstairs to ask where everything was. There were also wifi connectivity issues due to their wifi being down.  and I The fan in the room can be very temperamental at times, but everything was great.",4,2022,04,12
127,Flawless,"This is our 2nd visit to the Pan Pacific, London - the 1st for 2 nights and this stay for 4. Both times, we have found all the staff to be exceptional at their various jobs (though an extra nod to Mars as he always has something interesting to say). 

Rooms are spacious and light; the pool is adorable and  rarely busy; breakfast plentiful and high-quality (even for a  fussy vegetarian, and Iuas’ beaming smile and attention to detail makes your morning);  bathrobes so cute we had to buy one, and a new partner bar, Silverleaf which is quite simply slick and stunning (thanks Jack for playing such a good playlist). 

We stay regularly in London hotels and consider this to be our new favourite. We are already planning our return. We don’t often write reviews, but if we do there is normally one suggestion that we can make; however, with regards to the PP it is not possible - a flawless, stress free staycation.",5,2022,04,12
127,Superlative!,"We were blown away by this hotel.  The staff are polite and amiable; they're very welcoming and helpful.  The food in this hotel from breakfast, afternoon tea and dinner are at masterpiece level and superbly delicious!!!",5,2022,04,12
127,Close to perfection!,"Excellent new five star hotel in London with the flair of Asian hospitality.  Nice room & bathroom.  Stunning swimming pool.  Steam bath, sauna and fitness all up to the 5-star standards.  Breakfast ok.  And most of all very friendly and helpful staff.",5,2022,04,12
127,Stunning,"We stayed for two nights for a friends birthday. Hotel was stunning, the room was beautiful, spacious and clean. 
We spent time in the spa, which was also great. 
Throughout the whole hotel the staff couldn’t do enough for you. Would highly recommend and will be back soon!",5,2022,04,12
127,Luxury,"Absolutely stunning hotel. The room was spotless and the bed extremely comfortable. All the common areas smell divine and the place just oozes luxury. My only single criticism is the bar, where the service was below par (hard to get attention of staff, and they were not very professional). All the other staff were fantastic, and offered a genuinely warm welcome. I will certainly be back, and unfortunately for the other hotels in london, the Pan Pacific is the one by which they will now all be judged!",5,2022,04,10
127,Wonderful first trip as family to London,"We had excellent service from even before checking in with the concierge team giving us great advice about our trip, to the wonderful service during our stay.  The room was really nice for us with a great view and we enjoyed swimming in the pool at the end of some of our days there.",5,2022,04,10
127,"Lovely stay, amazing service","The service at this hotel is absolutely amazing. They put a lot of effort in to how they treat you as a guest, and felt very welcomed. I also travelled with my child, who was equally treated like a superstar - he absolutely loved it. It was also incredibly clean wherever you went. Will definitely return to stay here, lovely place and lovely people.",5,2022,04,09
127,Breakfast needs sorting,"Hotel is beautiful and staff are amazing however. 

The breakfast plates where small and the price was steep in comparison. The bacon was not cooked properly it tasted stale. If we return we will not have the breakfast again and will visit another establishment for food. When paying £35 a head I’d expect much better food for breakfast",3,2022,04,05
127,Exceptional stay,"Fabulous stay!  Standards and service exceptional, faultless presentation throughout. F&B offerings were flawless. Room on the 11th floor offered a great view with every conceivable in-room add-on. Team provided excellent service in all areas. Shall return!",5,2022,04,01
127,My second visit still as good.,"First visited soon after opening and the hotel was very quiet. Quite a different story this time round it seemed really busy. But happy to say it was still a wonderful stay. A few things could be improved, slightly later turndown service rather than before 6pm, our lighting control panel at the door in 1001 seems weird and I am not sure it worked correctly. But having said that the rooms are fabulous as well as being very quiet with amazing beds. Not to be missed we will be back.",5,2022,03,31
127,Haven in the city but not without issues.,"Pan Pacific London is a beautiful hotel. The rooms are fantastic. Modern design with ingenious features including a small seat in the hallway to remove shoes. Game changer! The bathroom design is also great including a door giving privacy to the toilet. I am really not a fan of “bath in bedroom” design so this for us was perfect. 

We had a wonderful time using the gorgeous infinity pool on many occasions, it really is a major selling point for this property. It was never crowded and really an oasis of calm in a busy city. 

The room service in this hotel though was TERRIBLE, service  wise and quality of food wise. I don’t know why so many properties don’t see the importance of providing quality food, especially when charging such high prices for it. I have to say though, as soon as I had an issue, the staff went above and beyond to compensate us and to make sure we had everything we required. Callum was an absolutely wonderful member of staff who was attentive, kind and professional. If only the service in this hotel had been this good from everyone from the beginning of our stay and not just because we had an issue. Felt like many staff were under trained.",4,2022,03,30
127,Best Weekend Break,"Absolutely wonderful experience, from the moment we were checked in until we had to leave. The upgrade was a fantastic surprise which made the stay and my Daughters Birthday extra special. 

Your staff are exemplary and the hotel beautiful. My Grandson (age 6) described it as luxury and his best days ever. We can't wait to return.

Thank you",5,2022,03,29
127,"Luxurious, yet not pretentious ","Just back from a super relaxing weekend stay at the Pan Pacific, which must be one of the greatest city hotels I’ve ever been too. The staff do an amazing job at being both professional and down to earth. A special shoutout to Walter who showed us to our room, however, all staff were extremely amiable. 

Location is perfect if you’re working in the city, however, Liverpool Street station is 2 mins away so getting pretty much anywhere in zone 1 is super easy. 

The room was surprisingly large, one of the largest standard rooms I’ve seen in Europe, and very well equipped. Very high tech - but also very functional and easy to use. No desk however, so if you need to work perhaps a different room would be more suitable. 

The housekeeping team also do an excellent job - the room was immaculate, they even folded our clothes and hung up our jackets. The evening turndowns were also top tier, putting slippers next to the bed, bringing us ice without even asking. The attention to detail was incredible. 

All the food we ate at the hotel was excellent, 80 pounds for breakfast for two is definitely on the expensive side, but probably the market rate for a London hotel so can’t complain really. 

The pool and spa are great, we personally found the temperature of the pool ideal - cool enough for lengths and warm enough for lounging. You can order food and drinks to the pool too if you’re feeling lazy. 

Would definitely recommend getting pan Pacific membership - it’s free and you get some free perks such as room upgrades and late check out, was also cheaper than all the big sites (agoda ect). Don’t think we got a room upgrade but we were able to check out at 3pm for free. 

We will definitely be returning at some point and will recommend this hotel to all our friends - for both work and staycations. ",5,2022,03,28
127,Beautiful hotel,"Beautiful hotel with dreamy spacious rooms and super comfortable beds! All staff members were really welcoming and helpful, especially towards my 2 year old daughter. The location is perfect too! Will definitely be returning!",5,2022,03,27
127,NOT FOR FAMILIES - AVOID,I have received harassing emails from staff every single day saying I must upgrade my rokm because it will not accommodate my 2 month old infant.  This is absolutely ridiculous.  What kind of customer service and staff is this?? I have stayed at many 5 star hotels and never been harassed like this before.  Paying over $500 per night and we haven’t even arrived yet and already this has been the biggest nightmare ever thanks to the hotel staff.,1,2022,03,22
127,"Stunning, state-of-the-art hotel with excellent front desk staff and concierge","Excellent experience at the brand new Pan Pacific. This is sleek, stylish luxury hotel in the City (London’s financial district). The location is both good and bad due to that, depending on why you are in town. The hotel takes up the bottom half of a new skyscraper topped by residences. A lot of people aren’t familiar with the Pan Pacific chain… it’s more of an Asian and West Coast chain. The last one I stayed at was in Seattle, when it had just opened 15 years ago. This one is much better. 
As far as ambience and decor, it is on par with a Ritz-Carlton or St. Regis and maybe even a Four Seasons. (If I didn’t see the PP signage, I would guessed any of those three). ‘
I was traveling during Omicron so it was challenging to actually just get into the UK. My arrival was made much easier by Tom at the Concierge Desk. He arranged an excellent (though not cheap) airport transfer. When I managed to get tested at Heathrow much faster than anticipated, I called Tom and he got my driver there a lot quicker than scheduled. It changed my first night from exhausting to enjoyable. That is what I call excellent service (and money well spent).
At check-in, another Tom at the front desk was excellent, too. Friendly, welcoming and very helpful. The first room I got was nice but faced north and away from all the interesting buildings in the city. This was my first trip since Covid… anywhere… and I wanted a more memorable view. Front desk Tom made that happen. From the second room, I got to see the Gherkin and the Shard (if just a sliver of it) through my wall of windows. I loved it every moment of my stay.
The lobby is elegant and nicely appointed but kind of small. Due to Covid, I avoided all public spaces except for the elevators so I have no idea about the quality of the restaurants or the gym but I would guess they’re as good as the rest of the hotel.
My room was stunning and modern, with an extremely comfortable bed (somehow both hard yet soft). It made for a great night’s sleep. The room was also very quiet. The bathroom was beautiful and large. There’s a separate marble-tiled room with a giant shower adjacent to a huge soaking tub. I usually avoid tubs in hotels (how clean are they really?) but this one was too shiny and inviting to pass up. I had an amazing bath with my view of the Shard that was one of my best hotel tub experiences ever. 
The location is ideal for business and okay for touristy things near the Tower of London but not much else. I would not recommend this hotel for someone’s first visit to London unless you love modern architecture or just want to stay in a state-of-the-art hotel. 
The PP is convenient to the Underground, the Liverpool Street train station (which is just across the street) and an outpost of Eataly right next to the station. All the usual conveniences (drugstores, Marks & Spencer grocery stores, Starbucks) are nearby and there’s a large, new outdoor mall attached.
I had a memorable stay, in large part due to the hospitality and friendliness of the two Toms. (Btw, everyone else working at the hotel that I encountered was very nice, too). 
I would definitely recommend the Pan Pacific if you’re good with the location. It is brand new and beautiful and the people who work here went the extra mile to make my stay the best it could be.",5,2022,03,21
127,The finest hotel I’ve been to,"Every thing in this hotel is outstanding, by far one of the nicest hotels I’ve been in. Starting from arrival the concierge team are so welcoming and helpful. The amenities in this hotel are from the top line ( dyson hair dryer etc ) the room is extremely specious and the bathroom is luxurious.
Complementary high end snacks and treats. 
Beyond my expectations!",5,2022,03,19
127,Very pleasantly impressed,"I didn't know a Pan Pacific Hotel had opened in London until someone mentioned it to me last week.  Booked to stay for 1 night last night.  Very friendly staff, lovely room, great pool.   I had previously stayed in the Pan Pacific Hotel in Vancouver over 25 years ago.  I will definitely return to this lovely new addition in London.",5,2022,03,18
127,50th weekend treat,"Amazing visit from the moment we walked trough the entrance. we felt very welcome, the hotel is stunning and the staff are amazing. nothing was to much trouble. 
we could sit in the lounge with  glass of something and just watch the world go by.
the restaurant's, food, rooms are truly stunning.
we saved for this weekend for a big birthday treat, but treated like we came to stay every weekend,

Amazing!!",5,2022,03,16
127,A perfect stay,"The most helpful, polite and caring staff ever.
The room was stunning, clean and comfortable, anything you could have asked for was ready and waiting for you in your room, from the Dyson hairdryer to the Nespresso coffee machine.
Food, drinks and atmosphere were all also perfect. I could not find a fault in my stay, I just wish i'd had longer there!",5,2022,03,14
127,World-class hotel,Pan Pacific London is a world-class hotel. The rooms are incredible and beautifully appointed. Also the pool area is incredible. The team are amazing: particular shout out to Conor in the Concierge team. Cannot recommend this hotel enough as one of the best hotels in London.,5,2022,03,08
127,Exceptional,From checking the service was outstanding. Even managing to book a reservation for breakfast externally going the extra mile to do so. The doormen was so helpful with showing the room utilities and assisting with bags.  The location is great - two mins walk to Liverpool st station giving access to west end via central line. Pool slightly cold in temperature but super clean and plenty of towels. Just hopeful they can get a car park closer to the hotel. Have already recommended to many and would book again without hesitation.,5,2022,03,08
127,Little family trip to London,"Great hotel, the concierge and butler could not do enough, providing us with a brand new buggy for our Site seeing tour. Receipt gave us a treasure hunt for our son to complete with a little prize at the end, 

Margaritas at the bar were exceptional (love margs ) 

Room was spotless, nice clean decorated very well, loved the electric blinds. 

only downsides is being charged £8 for a glass of warm milk for our babies bottle, and the electric blackout curtains automatically opening at 8 am, without prior knowledge or the option to change the time, but hotel was perfect in every other way.",5,2022,03,03
127,A thoroughly enjoyable stay,"A thoroughly enjoyable stay. Lovely room, very good food, and a superb team at reception. We particularly appreciated the escort service to and from the car park. The service at breakfast  stopped us giving you a 10. 
BUT The piped music is grotesquely offensive and for this reason we may well not come again!",4,2022,03,01
127,None,"This hotel has everything you need. very friendly and professional staff plus amazing leisure facilities. 

The rooms are amazing. The products they use from body cream to hairdryer top

127,Fantastic hotel,"Fantastic hotel, lovely and clean, staff amazing helpful in everyday. Room very spacious with great view. Had gone swimming at the pool which was Devine, really romantic sitting there with my partner drinking champagne and swimming. Evening meal at straits kitchen was good, ordered room service in the evening and had breakfast in bed which was excellent.",5,2022,03,01
127,Already Booked Another Stay Next Month!,"Wow. What a hotel. 

I’ve already booked for next month (March), so you can probably tell I’m pretty crazy about this place, given the number of alternatives I could’ve gone for. 

The main thing that sets Pan Pacific London apart is the staff. Every member of staff is friendly and courteous - they make every guest feel like a special member of an extended family. 

Another incredible element is the quality of the food - Lorraine Sinclair and Cherish Finden really know how to put together a memorable and special meal! Whether that’s afternoon tea, Straits Kitchen, or room service. Everything we had was simply delicious. 

We both enjoyed massages with Beatrice in the spa, and her skill was really second to none. I’ve paid more for massages in the past that were nowhere near as good, targeted, relaxing and effective. Cannot wait for another appointment with Beatrice!

The rooms are also incredible - clean, fresh, decadent. And gorgeous Diptyque toiletries too! Also, small things, like having a Nespresso machine in the room really made a difference. 

We had a few niggly issues, so why the 5 stars? Quite simply because the team here LISTENS. I got to meet the General Manager and her assistant - both are so committed to making things right and making every guest’s experience enjoyable. I will always give 5 stars when I feel listened to - niggles happen, that’s life, but how problems are handled is what really shows the calibre of a hotel. 

Overall, I cannot wait to stay again. This is an incredible addition to the London hotel scene.",5,2022,02,28
127,Wow!,"Stayed for the weekend to celebrate my Husband's birthday and was blown away by how amazing the team at the Pan Pacific is. A special mention to Tom on Front Desk, and Concierge Vijay, both of whom are definite flag bearers for the exceptional service experience delivered by all the team at the Pan Pacific London! 
Our room was an oasis of luxury and comfort, also thoroughly enjoyed Afternoon Tea at the Orchid Lounge, cocktails at Ginger Lily, and the outstanding new Silverleaf bar was a great recommendation too.
Thank you to all the team for making our stay a memorable one, we will certainly be back!",5,2022,02,28
127,Outstanding!,"I don’t normally set out to find fault with a hotel but I have to say that there was nothing, absolutely nothing about the Pan Pacific that I could fault or would even want tweaked in any way. Our whole stay was just fantastic. We had taken our four daughters with us for a two night stay to celebrate our twentieth wedding anniversary! The Dyson hairdryers were a real selling point with four teenagers! We also appreciated all the Diptyque products in the bathrooms! We had three double double rooms (two double beds in each) so we had plenty of space. Absolutely everything we could have needed was in the rooms. They were incredibly well stocked. We also used the swimming pool, sauna, steam room which was all just lovely, really relaxing, perfectly clean and the pool has great views over the streets in the City. We were really close to restaurants, shops, Liverpool St Station (for transport options) and Spitalfields Market where we ate a couple of times. 

We also enjoyed evening drinks in the bar and the service was impeccable. We didn’t eat breakfast in the hotel but we were able to find plenty of places to eat close by.

What I loved most about the Pan Pacific was how quiet it was. I have stayed in many lovely hotels where noise has been an issue. I heard nothing at nights! That made for a perfect stay.

Well done Pan Pacific!",5,2022,02,27
127,Amazing Stay with Exceptional Service,"Just leaving London after a week staying at the Pan Pacific London, we visited with two children aged 7 and 11. The service in the hotel is exceptional and the staff are personable and friendly, the room was airy and clean with great amenities. The pool facilities are some of the best in central London and this was a lovely haven after busy days sight seeing. Bravo Pan Pacific!",5,2022,02,26
127,None,"I had a wondeful stay and what a delight to be in such a beautifully designed hotel and SO central to everything.

The staff were amazing and super helpful at every moment throughout my stay. The food was exceptional, espeically afternoon tea in the orchard lounge. Also the rooms are modern and comfortable, plus you have view across the city, which is really special. The infinity pool was relaxing and quiet, with comfortable loungers, and the state of the art the gym is well worth a try.

It was first stay with Pan Pacific and I came away feeling rejuvenate, so I would highly recommend it to everyone.",5,2022,02,25
127,Pan Pacific London,"Lots of really good points about the pan pacific London - new, modern, immaculate, great facilities. 
Good location for business areas.

127,A definite 5 star experience,"The hotel was fabulous, the staff were amazing and the facilities, food and drink were incredible. Definitely looking at when I can book my next trip. Was made to feel special from the moment I arrived.",5,2022,02,22
127,great stay in best new 5 star hotel,"Stayed for 3 nights over the weekend on our first visit to this new hotel.

Excellent stay - service was great from every staff member.  Rooms are beautiful and comfortable and received a complimentary upgrade to a Deluxe View room on the 15th floor. really comfortable, best sleep in a hotel in ages, very quiet and no disturbances.
We ate and had cocktails in Ginger Lily the first evening, small bar and very dark which made reading menus a little difficult.  The food we ordered came quickly and was incredibly fresh and tasty. Cocktails were good.

we also had tea one morning in Orchid Lounge - beautiful space and tea set up but disappointingly the breakfast tea itself didn't really taste of anything which was a shame - maybe need to work on this to improve as the complimentary tea in the room was really superior.",5,2022,02,22
127,Only one tiny issue during the whole stay.,In 30 years of travelling and staying at many 5 AND 6 star hotels in a variety of locations this was probably one of the best I’ve ever stayed at. Food was very good. Drinks were good. Service was extremely good and quick. The staff couldn’t do enough for you. The only tiny thing that marred an otherwise perfect trip was the room temp. It took 24 hours to get the room to COOL and the room service team then turned it back to warm 21C again. I can’t sleep unless the room is COOL/COLD and I think a lot of people are like that. I think next time i will phone ahead and ask them to turn the temp in the room right down.,5,2022,02,22
127,Excellent luxury hotel experience,"We loved our first stay at the Pan Pacific. We were celebrating a birthday and this was acknowledged by the hotel upon check in and with a complimentary bottle of wine in the room. We also received complimentary drinks in both Silverleaf and Ginger Lily.

Even without these extras (which were much appreciated), we found the hotel to be very modern with great staff and a real five star experience. We had a deluxe room which is their entry level standard, on the eighth floor (there are 19 floors). The room was very smart, quite spacious and had a good view of the gherkin from the floor to ceiling windows. Great shower room and amenities throughout. Very comfortable super king size bed.

We had drinks in Silverleaf before heading elsewhere for dinner. The bar is in a separate building to the hotel and we met friends there. Although it was very quiet as it was only 6pm, all staff were very friendly and helpful - explaining the quite high-concept cocktail experience. But it was all fun and an interesting start to the evening.

We returned to the hotel after dinner for drinks in Ginger Lily, which again we enjoyed. I would say I preferred the ambience and setting of Silverleaf overall - more spacious.

Breakfast was fine - we had the continental buffet. There was a long delay in our coffee arriving. But this was acknowledged by the staff and apologised for. 

Check out was very quick and smooth with a taxi arriving a couple of minutes after our request. 

We will definitely stay here again, it was an excellent experience overall and we have been lucky enough to stay in a number of five star London hotels,",5,2022,02,22
127,Amazing staff in a beautiful hotel,"Superb staff and beautiful hotel 
Cannot rate our experience highly enough
Highly recommend and would say probably best experience we have had in a London hotel.
The staff make this hotel what it is and cannot do enough for you. The room was beautiful and finished to a top standard.
If you get the chance go and try it you will not be disappointed",5,2022,02,22
127,Business Trip,"I felt very special during my visit! all the special requirements I had asked for upfront (regarding luggage storage and possible late check out) were remembered, followed up with and confirmed upon check in. Also when I unexpectedly had to extend my stay due to the storm this was no problem at all and staff was super helpful and friendly. It almost made me wish for the storm to last longer:)

Nicola gave us a tour of the building and he was so committed and had such great energy I could totally share his excitement and I could 100% relate to the passion he feels towards the hotel. Also the great amount of detail in so many aspects made me appreciate the hotel even more. I will definitely make time to check out the remaining services and facilities the hotel has to offer next time I visit.",5,2022,02,21

127,The best place to sleep  in London,"We had such a great experience with Pan Pacific. The staff is absolutely professional, kind and helpful. The food - delicious. The room and toiletries were complete. The pool is amazing also the view, but the only thing we did not liked it was that the pool was a not heated. Overall this place is heaven.",5,2022,02,16
127,Amazing night away - Wish we stayed longer,I surprised my boyfriend for his birthday with a stay at the Pan Pacific. Upon arrival we was immediately upgraded. Our room was excellent and the service 5*! I had arranged balloons for the room which was perfect and the Spa facilities are wonderful. I highly recommend staying here. The staff always have a smile upon their face and are so happy to help with any request you may have.,5,2022,02,16
127,Fantastic !,"This doesn’t need a long review, the Pan Pacific London in simply amazing from start to finish ! It’s a beautiful hotel, amazing staff, amazing service ! Beautiful place ! The highlight for us was the welcome we received, Callum at the front desk has been amazing for the two days we spent here! We will be returning ! (The wife also loves that the hairdryer in the room was one of the awesome Dyson ones … apparently lol ! )
Thank you Pan Pacific and thank you again to Callum",5,2022,02,15
127,"A great stay, highly recommended","A lovely weekend celebrating my partners birthday. Staying in a Premium room, the views were great and the room itself was very well appointed and spotless. 2 mins from Liverpool Street Station despite being a little further out than other luxury hotels it is well worth a stay. The staff were friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. Special mention to Tom who is a true asset to the hotel. We had our room upgraded, had a personal note awaiting us in the room to welcome us and felt well looked after.",5,2022,02,14
127,A dreamy experience in the city!,"Just home from a wonderful stay in Pan Pacific, London. From the minute you arrive, tranquillity awaits. The swimming pool, room decor and service, including in room dining, was flawless. 

Thank you Rita and the rest of the Front Office Team for ensuring our stay was more than we wished for. 

We will be back!",5,2022,02,14
127,The best stay,"This hotel is incredible! Just a 1 minute walk from Liverpool Street tube, it’s brand new and we had the best time. We arrived early so they took our luggage for us whilst we went to Tower of London, we came back around 1:30 and they let us into our room early. They’d arranged balloons, cookies and an activity back for our little ones, as well as organising a treasure hunt for them to get a prize. So lovely !!! Everyone at reception was so friendly and welcoming. Thanks to Tom. 

The room was immaculate, we had 2 doubles… it was gorgeous, we didn’t have much of a view on the 14th floor but also we didn’t pay the most expensive rate. Bathroom and shower, diptyque products all fantastic. Rooms were cleaned to the highest standard with lovely water, teas coffees, robes etc. And the shower one of the best I’ve ever had.

The children’s swimming times were from 4pm in the afternoon so we went down and all the staff were very friendly. The pool was well kept, lots of towels, a lady handing out water. If it was busy I’m not sure there would be enough beds but it is London. The only gross thing is one child spat out their chewing gum and left it on the side. The pool is quite nippy too! A lovely steam/sauna in the changing rooms though

The staff were incredible here, everyone is so friendly and nothing is too much trouble.

Ok the actual area isn’t the best in London for us as it’s quite corporate with all the banks around, but it’s near spitalifields and lots of good cafes, restaurants. The weather was awful so we ate in Straits for dinner. Singaporean food, absolutely delicious and catered for children. Expensive though so we opted for a coffee shop for breakfast. 

Thanks for a great time",5,2022,02,14
127,Incredible stay and I can't wait to return,"The hotel is new-I think it opened towards the end of 2021. The decor is stunning with beautiful clean lines and warm colour schemes, creating a calming atmosphere. The bed was so comfortable and our room was spotlessly clean. The Diptyque toiletries were a lovely touch too. The staff are what really make this hotel special. They are warm, welcoming and approachable, and not what you expect for a 5 star London hotel where some staff members can occasionally be a little stuffy and cold. I really appreciated the extra effort made to interact with guests. We even had 2 lovely members of staff deliver my husband a slice of cake for his birthday whilst singing 'Happy Birthday' to him. This was such an entertaining and thoughtful touch. We can't wait to return. Thank you to the entire wonderful team. You really are special and in turn, made us feel really special.",5,2022,02,14
127,So amazing we stayed an extra night.,"My Wife and I often have a night or two as a getaway in The City every couple of months.  We've stayed in a lot of hotels over the years in the area, mostly high end, including the likes of The Ned and The Vintry and Mercer. The Pan Pacific is the best yet, and our new favourite.  We booked two nights but added a third.

The style of the hotel is stunning, modern, light and uplifting.  The Spa is fantastic; the swimming pool is ideal.  Plenty of room to grab a bed; never too busy, and a long pool for some lengths.  The air temperature is kept warm so when you get out you never feel cold.  The steam room is very.... steamy, as opposed to the ones that are more like lukewarm wet rooms

The room was also stunning, a big shower, bath, modern, perfectly clean.  Electric curtains, large TV that could be angled as you needed.  The bed was huge and comfortable.

Connectivity is great, with Liverpool Street just over the road providing quick access to the Central line (a s well as others), and loads of great, local choices to eat or shop just a stones throw away.  Everything from the Duck and Waffle and Ivy, to a Tesco Express and McDonalds, all within a couple of minutes walk.

Best of all, the staff.  The service is impeccable;  Every member without fail were always smiling, happy, and interesting to talk to.  You can feel the difference; it's a genuine happiness and interest, and not fake because they are told to do so.

Of course, this all comes at a price and it's far from the cheapest hotel you'll find, but compared to competitors it's great value for money given the experience and well worth it.  Our previous favourite, The Ned, has become extortionate in price.  Pan Pacific sits just below it in price but in our opinion exceeds it in every aspect.  We would love to see some multi night offers at some point to keep it affordable so we can visit more often. 

It goes without saying, of course we'll be back.",5,2022,02,14
127,Thank you Walter,"Walter was so lovely to us on arrival and took his time explaining all the amenities to us even though we were only there for the night, super friendly and cheerful, all of the staff at pan pacific were amazing.",5,2022,02,12
127,Amazing experience,"everything was more than perfect. love everything, every small details of this amazing hotel. it's newly opened. just in September. away from Central London but that's what I was looking for. but still with the underground you will be there within minutes. the hotel has a great friendly team.  I am gonna call them that because they do work as a team to make sure that the guest is more than  comfortable at their hotel. WOLTER he is the first Guy I noticed when I left the car even before entering the hotel. he has a good sense of humor, very welcoming and friendly he was with us until we entered our room and told us great information about the hotel and explained everything  to us. then my experience begin when I entered the hotel. everyone was welcoming us and ask if we had a good trip to the hotel. and trying to help. TOM at reception, he is very friendly. tried his best to make sure that we are happy and comfortable with our room. and he recommended us with a room that has a great view. and I am a glad that I took that room. it has a great view which I enjoyed day and night. ( thank you TOM for being a part of our lovely experience at pan pacific .  And also CHRISTOPHER at the reception. honestly the reception team are just ( great ). also TOM at the Concierge, he helped me with everything and arranged for my PCR test so I wasn't worry about anything and just enjoying my time over there. ( in general the Concierge team are really great and trying their best to make you happy). CYRIL ( the man with the smile  that you can feel even behind the face mask) was always there. asking if we need anything. and if we are enjoying our time. HE is always checking when we passed by him.  every  name that I mentioned above they always ask and check.THANK YOU  pan pacific team for every moment that I enjoyed. definitely will come again next year.",5,2022,02,11
127,Family staycation,"Excellent service from the moment we arrived. Check in was friendly and efficient and Walter was really kind to our daughter and enthusiastically showed us around our room. Food is top notch - breakfast in straits kitchen is varied and high quality and we also ended up dining there on all 3 nights as we enjoyed it so much. Viola and Gyula provided perfect service at breakfast and dinner - they are great at their jobs.
Pool is lovely, but can get busy. Spa treatments were absolutely first class - best facial and massage treatment I've experienced.",5,2022,02,08
127,Heavenly,"Short but sweet stay at one of the best hotels in London.  Tom was on reception again and treated me like royalty. He is a real star and such an amazing brand ambassador.

Tom kindly put me in a dual aspect room on the 16th floor which was spectacular.  I slept soundly and only regret not being able to stay longer the next morning.

I will be back as soon as I can.",5,2022,02,05
127,Truly Exceptional Service,"We stayed here for 2 nights and had to leave early due to a family emergency. Pan Pacific kindly refunded us our 3rd night, no quibbles.

Our stay itself was thoroughly enjoyable; rooms cleaned twice per day, beautiful swimming pool and exceptional afternoon tea. I have to thank the team for their effort and flexibility.",5,2022,01,29
127,Magical stay in the centre of the city. A definite must stay at this new property.,We stayed here with my young family for the second time and nothing was too much trouble. The guest relations manager greeted us warmly and looked after everything for us. The luxury and comfort alongside the warm and friendly team really make this property a must stay in central London. I highly recommend the afternoon tea which really was the highlight of our second stay so much we are already looking forward to returning in on our next visit.,5,2022,01,28
127,A lovely stay in Bishopsgate,"On arrival staff were warm and welcoming.  Cyril took us to our room and kindly talked us through the amenities there.  He took an interest in what we had planned and maintained this interest throughout our stay.  We liked the room and location for what we were doing this time in London.  Clean bright and spacious.  On our return after our first trip out there was a beautiful message and delicious dessert plates with a ‘Happy Birthday’ and this really added to our experience at the hotel.  We had booked the pool for between 5pm and 6pm and this also was a lovely experience.  The water, ambience and restricted numbers helped to ensure that everyone felt comfortable and could get a seat around the pool. Our only slight disappointment was when turn down service arrived as we were getting ready to go out before 7pm and so only gave us ice and water.  On return after our night out it was a slight disappointment to return to our room as we had left it.  However, we understand that Covid may have had a part to play in this as perhaps housekeeping staff were a little ‘thin on the ground’.
Checkout was easy and our luggage was stored so that we could collect it later.  What made our stay was the non intrusive but attentive service.  I often travel to Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia and this felt like service we receive over there.
I should also mention that we returned for test in the afternoon and this was a delight in the downstairs lounge. Your staff there were attentive, calm and welcoming and the ambience was just perfect.  Tranquil and relaxing.  We usually stay in Kensington but our experience will mean that we shall return.
Once again, thank you for making our stay a positive one.
Best wishes to you all",5,2022,01,25
127,Weekend stsy,"The best hotel in london from the staff to in room entertainment this is 6 star plus

127,Wonderful anniversary spent staying in a fantastic hotel,"We stayed at the Pan Pacific London on our anniversary. We were lucky to get an upgrade to a beautiful suite with a lovely view of the Dome of St Paul’s Cathedral. Careful attention to detail of the amenities needed by guests was impressive and those provided were of high quality.  We have stayed previously in a deluxe room and were equally impressed with the beautiful decor and amenities then. 
The Hotel itself is stunning and thoughtfully designed. The Orchid Lounge is very elegant with a beautiful fire to entice you in when it’s cold outside.  The Wellness Floor offers a calming retreat from the stresses of everyday. Swimming in the infinity pool is the perfect place to relax and watch the world go by outside the window. We found it hard to drag ourselves from the heated loungers with weighted blankets in the relaxation lounge and although we didn’t use it, the gym looked very impressive. 
We decided to dine in Straits Kitchen which we were so pleased about because the food was amazing.  
The hotel has two bars. On our previous visit we had pre-dinner cocktails in Ginger Lily’s which had a lively atmosphere with people enjoying drinks and snacks. This time we visited Silverleaf which was a larger bar, both elegant and sophisticated with tasty cocktails. Recently opened it is certain to become a very popular bar to have drinks with friends. 
Finally all the staff we have met and communicated with either by phone or email have been extremely friendly and seem generally eager to make sure that you have a wonderful experience whilst staying there. We want to thank them all for helping to make our anniversary so special.",5,2022,01,21
127,Did not disappoint,This place is nothing short of perfection. The attention to detail is superb. The staff are so incredibly nice it’s like you’re talking to friends. The cocktails in Ginger Lily were incredible. I could go on and on and on about how amazing our stay here was. One night was not enough and we can not wait to come back!,5,2022,01,21
127,What 5* service is supposed to be!,"We had the most welcoming and comfortable visit despite my partner feeling unwell. The staff were so attentive to our needs, checking in on several occasions to make sure we had what we needed as well as making suggestions. 
Allowing us to check out a little later also made a huge difference as we checked-in quite late the day before.
Room service was also brilliant, great staff and the hotpot chicken tasted amazing.
We will 100% be back as soon as we can! Thank you!",5,2022,01,18
127,My new favourite London hotel!,"Our stay was fantastic, one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in in London. The facilities and staff were outstanding and we will definitely be a returning customer in the future. We were made to feel so welcome and looked after from the minute we stepped through the door, until the minute we were leaving.",5,2022,01,17
127,"Excellent  Staff , very welcoming","The Pan Pacific is an excellent Hotel with very attentive staff. Its a new Hotel so the staff are keen to please. The pool is excellent with great views . The spa is superb but overpriced. Our room 1504 had fabulous view and was certainly sufficient in size and layout. 
All in all , we will return soon .loved it.",5,2022,01,15
127,The very best Hotel,"I recently stayed three times from December 2021 to January 2022, a total of 16 nights. I could not have had a better stay from the very first night until the last morning when I was given champagne for breakfast! The rooms are fantastic, I stayed on the 10th, 19th & 7th floor & had both deluxe & executive rooms. I was initially greeted by Les when I checked in at 8am in the morning first time round & taken straight to the room. It really is the staff who are just fantastic, Nicole on reception was magnificent when I arranged a wedding night for my cousin. Louis at concierge was just amazing from my first contact via email to arrange car pick up at Heathrow to managing my laundry! However, it was Viola & Desi in the restaurant at breakfast every day who made my time so memorable, as a solo traveler, albeit with visiting friends & family, it was great being greeted by them each day, not to forget Karolina who checked me in at my favourite table every day. When friends & family joined me for breakfast the service was just as friendly. We even had a family dinner on my last night & the food & service impeccable. I’m going to also mention Robbie & Magda on Wellness floor for every time I used the incredible pool, & the drawing room. As for Conner (x2) Tom, Wesley, Cameron & VJ all were friendly & professional. I’m going back in June & July and I can’t recommend Pan Pacific London enough, it’s the best & I have been everywhere including Raffles in Singapore. Oh, I forgot Anne the general manger who left me lovely hand written cards for every stay with chocolates! Thank you.",5,2022,01,13
127,"One of my favourite london hotels, will be back soon!","Spectacular hotel with beautiful viewsmatched with top tier service. Swimming pool area is lovely and works on a time slot basis so there is no overcrowding. Also had a massage booked which was extremely relaxing. Special mention for Tom our concierge who even took me to the local decoration store to get some balloons.  Also gave us a tour of our room and explaining all key information. Very helpful, polite and super professional.",5,2022,01,11
127,Best Hotel in London by far,"I booked our stay at Pan Pacific for my fiancé's 30th Birthday treat and we now have the 'holiday blues' as it was so amazing; being the best hotel experience we've ever had and wish we could have stayed longer than one night! 

The whole hotel is beautifully designed, relaxing and very clean. 
The staff were all very personable, attentive and truly made our stay. 

My fiancé had the best birthday stay with Pan Pacific and we would love to come back around our honeymoon this year, as well as other occasions. 

We've never been to a hotel where we wanted to spend all day inside rather than heading out to other plans! 

Thank you for our stay, we can't thank you enough for all making it so special and it's officially our favourite hotel which we couldn't recommend enough since. From start to finish, it was perfect and the relaxing break we also needed.",5,2022,01,11
127,Best hotel in london,"The staff from the minute we arrived were amazing. That’s what made the difference from other hotels 
The hotel is new fresh & modern.
Myself & our young girls were referred to my name each time we had contact with any of the members of staff. This makes the stay special",5,2022,01,11
127,New Year’s Eve in Covid times,"So we weren’t sure we’d be able to go on this trip until we actually got on the train, so to find ourselves checking in was quite the treat. It was a trip planned to remind ourselves of Singaporean hospitality and great food, booked in the new sister hotel of somewhere we love to stay when in SIN.

The staff in this hotel are superlative, they have found the people they want from all over the city and it shows. Discreet, friendly service is the benchmark here.

There were some excellent points: Afternoon tea is a highlight and chatting with Cherish was lovely. Cocktails were another, when we were unsure of our order we were met with a comprehensive and relaxed explanation of the interesting menu.

The wellness floor is spectacular. Be aware that as a ‘family friendly’ hotel they only allow children in the pool for two hours a day. You also have to pay full price for 12+ but they’re not treated as adults and allowed to swim out of kids hour until 16+. Irritating for us but probably great for others.

Housekeeping was on point except for on New Years Day, when we came home to find our room hadn’t been made up at 4.00. A quick call down to reception remedied it, but it’s not what I expect at this price point.

The only real disappointment for me was the food offering. The hotel was running a slimmed down menu for the holidays. By slimmed down, I mean there was no SE Asian food. Nothing on the room menu bar CKT noodles, nothing for breakfast except Congee. I love both, but the menu online made my heart sing. No Laksa, no crab,  no exciting breakfast, nothing that wasn’t good old English hotel food. Meh. I want to go to Singapore in London, please don’t reduce your menu to bacon, I can eat that at home!

We had a fantastic stay, and a thoroughly enjoyable NYE. This is a hotel that will get better and better. Superb staff, a beautiful setting, just make sure I can get a decent Laksa, Lah?",5,2022,01,09
127,Top new Hotel in London,"Excellent service and room. We stayed in the Deluxe City View room over NYE and   would definitely stay again and recommend to friends and family. Fantastic views, quality of room and service throughout. Great location too.",5,2022,01,03
127,"Great new luxury hotel in London. Possibly the best, too","This is a wonderful hotel!

The location is very convenient, not far from Liverpool Street station and on foot, you're not far from other buildings and attractions as well.

I'm pleased to say that the stay at Pan Pacific London is on par with other luxury hotel brands like WA or Capella. The staffs are pleasant and professional throughout my stay. My loyalty status and details were recognized and confirmed.

The room is spacious, brand-new, and well-appointed. Diptyque amenities and Dyson hairdryer, that is quite a pampering. The breakfast was delicious and the Kopi tiam afternoon tea is something you should try. The Ginger Lily bar is also very pleasant and the cocktails are reasonably priced (for London standard).

The gym is 24-hours and they have a pair of pilates reformer machines! This is very rare in a hotel and I'm glad they offer it.

Overall, a pleasant stay and if I had a chance, I would definitely return to the hotel.",5,2022,01,02
127,The very best hotel in London right now,"I have been fortunate enough to stay three times since this hotel
opened in September 2021. What this hotel has achieved is just phenomenal. It surpasses even the best five star hotels in Singapore and elevates hospitality in London to a very different level. I have found this
rarely in London where there’s many 5 star hotels but most are ‘average’ or ‘good’ but not truly memorable or easily positively differentiated.

This hotel is all about service. It’s brilliant. The opening team assembled is from the great and good of the London luxury hotel scene. It’s personable, engaging, friendly, never stuffy and lives up to Pan Pacific’s values of sincerity.

The Wellness floor is excellent. It’s not the biggest in London but it’s big and bigger than most other hotels. The gym has very high quality equipment and the 18.5m lap pool is great to swim in and/or watch the city go by on Bishopsgate. 

The food here is of course sensational. Lots of authentic and delicious Asian cuisine but also some western food available, particularly through room service. The Ginger Lily Bar is wonderful for a drink or two. They are constantly improving the drinks menu and there’s so much passion in what they are making. More bars to open in 2022!  One highlight for many will be that Cherish Finden works here, so you will have a top notch afternoon tea experience! 

The room is very comfortable, large by London standards and very clean. Full credit to the housekeeping team who keep the place immaculate. No desks in the room, if that’s important to you, but there are small tables that you could place a laptop on. Premier Rooms and above feature baths.  

I have a couple of stays booked for 2022 and really look forward to returning.",5,2021,12,31
127,Stunning hotel with exceptional staff…,"Wonderful new hotel with fantastic facilities including a stunning infinity pool which we had to ourselves! 
The gym has everything you need plus more, the spa area is very well laid out.
The bar is snazzy & cool, unfortunately we didn’t dine in the hotel as we had pre organised plans but from what I seen of the afternoon tea it looked fabulous. Rooms were big as we had a double double, special shout-out to the concierge staff who went beyond to acquire me some theatre tickets at short notice as my original show was cancelled due to covid, bravo….",5,2021,12,30
127,Luxury experience,What a stunning hotel! Went for a couple of days in London and wished I could have stayed longer- will be coming back soon- especially for the food. The Straits kitchen restaurant is delicious (food is a 10 out of 10)- but the ambiance and atmosphere was missing. Overall the staff was very helpful and it was a very luxurious experience.,5,2021,12,29
127,What a hotel!,"We just had a wonderful nights stay at the Pan Pacific for my birthday, it was so luxurious and it had everything we needed before we realised we needed it! The rooms are stunning, the bathrooms are generous sized and overall we had the best nights sleep, it was so quiet! We went to the bar on the ground floor which serves some great cocktails and also used the pool and sauna in the wellness suite. The hotel has such a comforting and welcoming approach it is worth every penny, please do not hesitate to book this hotel you will not be disappointed! 
Thank you all the staff who made my birthday special, and to Flavia at the front desk!
Rebecca",5,2021,12,24
127,Outstanding customer service and beautiful hotel,"We booked a couple of nights here at short notice. The level of customer service was the best we’ve experienced in some time (possibly the only hotel I could rate at the same level is the Four Seasons). From emailing to ask for any requests ahead of our stay, to the welcome from every single member of staff and any requests being dealt with immediately.

The hotel itself is immaculate and just across from Liverpool Street station. We were in a Premier Double Double on the 16th floor with lovely views. We stayed with 2 teenagers and there was plenty of room and a huge bathroom.

It’s the little things that make the difference. We often book a family room but there’s only 2 robes, towels, toiletries etc. Here we had 4 of everything (and the robes were so nice that we contemplated buying one to take home). Nespresso machine, diptyque toiletries, electronic curtains, very comfortable beds. We had an early check in and late check out which was much appreciated (many hotels have charged us extra for this).
 
Breakfast was fantastic, with cooked options to order and a great buffet of fruit, bread, pastries, meats etc. Freshly squeezed juices were delicious.

Our one small niggle was the temperature of the pool which didn’t feel like the advertised 30 degrees. We did mention this to this spa and reception staff. The pool itself had great views and nice loungers to sit round in. The gym was possibly one of the nicest hotel gyms we’ve been in.

Overall, we loved the hotel and will definitely return. A big thank you to the staff who all went the extra mile for their guests.",5,2021,12,23
127,5 star visit to this wonderful hotel,"My daughter had found this hotel online. I wasn’t certain about booking purely because of the money but I decided life is short and she had waited a long time to celebrate due to Covid so I booked it.

I didn’t regret a penny. 

From the moment we met Walter he made us feel at ease and although we turned up very early expecting to just leave luggage, our room was ready and they allowed us to check in. We were delighted. 

Everything here is luxurious. Customer service is obviously paramount and they tended to greet me by name. Throughout our short stay they bent over backwards to be warm, friendly and professional. Always going the extra mile.

The food was excellent. The pool was spotless. It all felt like a 5 star hotel should. My daughter loved every second too! Thank you to all. We’d love to return one day",5,2021,12,22
127,Wonderful celebratory stay,"We received a seamless and warm welcome on arrival. Our room was very well appointed and had the comfiest bed. I do t generally sleep well in hotels, but I felt well-rested in the morning. It’s sleek without being impersonal, and has an exclusive feel without making you feel uncomfortable. We had a fab stay and hope to be back again soon.",5,2021,12,21
127,EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE,"I am an independent travel agent so have stayed in many hotels and this hotel is hands down one of the BEST I have visited! 
The service that was given to me was exceptional, they cater for every one of your needs! Before I had arrived I had been exchanging emails with Andrea, Lara and Rosheen who I got to meet on arrival. They personally took me up to my room and showed me all the amenities. It was my partners birthday so they had placed balloons in the room, a bottle of wine and arranged fresh rose petals to be delivered as well as a birthday dessert made by a famous pastry chef! Just incredible. 
The food was sublime as well as the room service. The hotel room was beautiful and included underfloor heating in the bathroom as well as a great view of London. If you like taking photos this hotel is also a great location for this, especially in the spa / pool area and reception! Walter the door man is an amazing photographer and very helpful and friendly so definitely pay him a visit. 
I will be recommending this hotel to all my future clients and could not have been happier with all the staff, and that I visited when I did. Everything was perfect and I will definitely be back to stay again very soon!",5,2021,12,21
127,Delicious food,"I stayed at Pan Pacific for the weekend, the hotel is beautiful! The best part of the trip was the food in the hotel- Room service, buffet and the Asian dishes are just amazing! Can’t wait to come back with my family.",5,2021,12,20
127,Pan pacific,"Get some new pillows! But other then that fantastic ! 
And there is no parking , nearest car park is about 8/10 mins walk. Also I required a fan but the hotel didn't have one in store hopefully they will by next time !",5,2021,12,20
127,Amazing chef and food,"Amazing hotel, beautiful and great service. The rooms are great, and the food is the highlight. Best food I’ve had in many trips to London. Also thank you to Chef Nas who was always helpful and with a smile on his face. Will definitely be coming back.",5,2021,12,19
127,Just Perfect.,"Stayed here for one night with family. Modern and sophisticated are two words to describe this hotel. Staff were super friendly. A big shout out to Connor for taking on the world. Good recommendations and organisational skills from him and the team. Great location as right opposite Liverpool Street station. 15 mins into central London. Great facilities especially the infinity pool on 4th floor. Great overall experience and one to recommend. 

Avy and Family",5,2021,12,19
127,Wow wow,"What an amazing hotel, from the minute you enter you are looked after by the wonderful warm and friendly staff. Everything from the room through to room service and breakfast is 5 star. It was faultless. I work in hospitality and travel a great deal and I cannot think of a better city centre hotel. So did not want to leave! Already finding excuses to return after Christmas.",5,2021,12,17
127,None,Our stay was simply outstanding! From the moment we were greeted so beautifully & with such sincere warmth from staff to the point of our departure when staff couldn’t make enough suggestions as to where we visit inLondon. The hotel is stunning & I greatly appreciated the Asian meets British ‘fusion’ & contemporary interior design. The attention to detail is impeccable & staff can’t do enough to please. I can’t wait to return with my family: a hard act to follow!,5,2021,12,16
127,Fab really fab,"What a fab stay, lovely room. The hotel being newly opened is wonderfully bright and fresh and really pristine. A lot of attention to detail.

I was already impressed with the level of care before I arrived but super impressed by the time we left. Everybody and I mean everybody was smiley, polite and very efficient.

I felt all the staff were invested in our stay and enthused with a pride I rarely see outside of high end hospitality venues. Congratulations to you all and I wish you Merry Christmas and hope you trade well in the new year.",5,2021,12,16

Unfortunately we did not get the names of every member of the Team who made our stay so memorable but just a few were, Kelly, Vangelis, Bilal, and the charming Reena (Straits Kitchen).  
This hotel is right at the top with other hotels such as The Ritz, St. Regis, Shangri la at The Shard, and The Four Seasons in terms of guest experience.",5,2021,12,14

Made to feel so welcome, had a 16th floor & room well equipped with high quality interiors. Breakfast had great choice & we eat at Straits Restaurant one evening - highly recommended.

127,Luxurious birthday weekend,Wow! Thank you to the wonderful Pan Pacific team for an amazing birthday weekend. The room was fantastic with panoramic views of London- luxurious bathroom and comfortable bed. The pool was a real treat and an ideal place to relax after a busy day around London. The breakfast selection was the best I have experienced and as always the service was impeccable.,5,2021,12,12
127,Excellent City Notel.,"Excellent hotel. It was my first stay and I know it will absolutely not be the last. I choose Pan Pacific on the recommendation of my daughter who is an events organiser. She had stayed a couple of times and loved it, I can fully understand why.",5,2021,12,10
127,Visit with 2 year old - WOW,Visited for for two nights with our two year old son. Wow wow wow. Absolutely loved everything about this hotel. Everyone so friendly and couldn’t do enough whilst also feeling very relaxed. I was anxious taking our young son to such a smart hotel but honestly cannot wait to come and visit again. Thankyou,5,2021,12,08
127,An outstanding experience,"Wow, wow, wow.
From the moment we stepped into the hotel to when we left, the experience was second to none. 
The attention showed to us by all staff whom we even came into close proximity to, was just a pleasure. The hotel decor is of outstanding quality and so understated. Attention to details is unbelievable. Cherish Finden, whom was the main reason I personally booked this stay, to try her much acclaimed pastry and confectionary products, was introduced to me and she took the time to say hello and spend a few minutes, which was really nice.
This review may seem totally over the top, but we really cannot praise the staff, the surrounding and the whole experience enough.
We have booked to return in February and am sure, there will be many more booked in the future. 
Thank you to everyone who made our stay so very special.",5,2021,12,08
127,Lux Hotel With Great Rooms,"I had a great stay at the recently opened Pan Pacific. It is a slick, global operation & the fit out is to a very high standard. My room was fantastic & as a Gold member I was upgraded to an amazing 11th floor corner executive room which was incredibly spacious & had several floor to ceiling windows. The views are fabulous, mine looked onto the Gherkin & Can of Ham on one side, out over the city skyline from the other windows. Rooms are beautifully appointed & decorated, beds huge & uber comfy, curtains remote controlled & bathrooms top to bottom marble. Very generously stocked with lovely Diptyque products too. Reception staff were professional & polished, as were staff throughout the hotel. I didn’t dine in-house but had cocktails in the chic Ginger Lily bar. Breakfast was the only slight let down, food was absolutely fine, service polite & willing, but it was just … ordinary, in contrast to the wonderful rooms... a bit noisy, tables too packed in, the buffet small & unthrilling.
I want to end on a high note though, as the Pan Pacific is a fantastic hotel, another great addition to the luxury hotel offer in London, it’s rooms particularly outstanding. I would definitely both recommend, & return.",5,2021,12,07
127,Exceptional staff and hotel,"Exceptional service from the staff. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming. They were also able to accommodate my requests for a slightly better room due to celebrating my girlfriends birthday and left us a lovely birthday cake and message in the room. They also gave us a bottle of wine upon leaving. Really went the extra mile to make us feel special even though we were only staying one night! 

The hotel decor was fantastic as was the room.  Incredible bathroom and really nice finishes and touches around the room. 

Couldn’t fault anything!",5,2021,12,06

127,"A perfect, luxurious hidden gem in London","Could not say better things about this hotel. It is modern, contemporary, and luxurious in every way. It has some of the most high-tech amenities I have ever seen in a hotel such as heated marble bathroom floors, heated towel racks, a VR-based HIIT workout system in the gym, a full infinity pool, saunas, spas, and much more. 

The Straits restaurant was absolutely lovely and had the best meal we had in London. Anne, the General Manager, even stopped by and hand-delivered a bottle of champagne and a handwritten note. 

Please reserve your booking already. You will NOT be disappointed. Trust.",5,2021,11,30
127,Perfect hotel stay!,"This hotel is incredible. The service is attentive and faultless, the rooms are beautiful, the relaxation facilities on the 4th floor are just wonderful. I would definitely revisit this hotel and recommend highly to others.",5,2021,11,29

127,A spectacular hidden gem in London. THE BEST!!,"What an incredible hotel. From the first greeting by the friendly door staff, a smooth an welcoming check in and then on to an uber luxurious room. 

I spent one night in a Devonshire suite which provided fantastic city views, notably The Gherkin which at night was spectacular.

The room was modern yet luxurious and extremely comfortable. I got to experience all aspects of the hotel.

Room service - super prompt and efficient
The Straits Kitchen - delicious food, a wonderful Singaporean adventure was had. The staff were attentive, friendly and such fun characters.
Ginger Lily - A great cocktail bar full of devious options.

I cannot fault this hotel, if has to be the best hotel in London.  I will certainly visit again. 

Thank you for a wonderful experience.",5,2021,11,25
127,Perfect in every way!,"Perfect in every way, from the moment we walked in the door to the moment we walked out! We were treated with the upmost respect.

127,A wonderful dining experience ,"I was so excited to see Pan Pacific   Hotels in London. We have stayed at Pan Pacific, Singapore frequently. We knew the service would be exceptional and we're not disappointed. We came for Kopi Tiam afternoon tea on Remembrance Sunday and were absolutely overwhelmed with the service and food. Raul and Benjamin made us feel so special and guided us through the courses with knowledge and great enthusiasm. True Asian hospitality at its finest. This was our first afternoon tea and I think we may have started with the very best! Beautifully presented and expertly balanced flavours, I couldn't have asked for a finer experience. Thanks you to Cherish and all the team, you must be so proud. A special mention to Walter for the fabulous tour of the hotel, you really are a credit to the brand. We will definitely be booking a room in the near future.",5,2021,11,15

Thank you for an amazing stay for my best friends special birthday. Can’t wait to come for another visit soon.",5,2021,11,15
127,Very Stylish,"Went for a weekend break with friends. Whilst the hotel is classed as being in the City, it is on the Eastern edge so well located for Shoreditch, Clerkenwell and Hoxton, so good spot for leisure aswell as business.

The hotel is new so everything is pristine, the room s are beautiful and very well furnished. Service standards are very high and each staff member greets you with a smile and is very keen to assist.

Leisure facilities are good with infinity lap pool aswell as steam and sauna with bookable treatments.

Good value for money for a weekend break given its 5 star status and will certainly return.",5,2021,11,09
127,Beautiful hotel with amazing staff,"This hotel is brand new, and you can tell the staff are proud the of the product they are offering. their happiness of being able to welcome guests the the new hotel, the heartfelt welcome and ambience made us feel right at home from the start. 
The rooms are beautiful with subtle luxury, great amenities, and an amazing view! Will miss the plush bathrobe and high quality toiletries.
The swimming pool area can get a bit crowded in the afternoon/weekends. But was quiet and relaxed in the morning. 
Remember to make a reservation in advance if you want to experience their afternoon tea on a Saturday. Picture bellow is from a quick tea break on a Sunday. 
Well worth the visit!",5,2021,11,09
127,Anniversary Night Away,"An excellent stay service was exceptional, we were lucky we had our room upgraded and I was able to check in early.  Nothing was too much trouble.  

The room was very well equipped and had a great view. The bed was big and comfortable with great linen.

Breakfast was also great with swift not over baring service.

Would recommend highly especially if you want to be close to Liverpool Street Station",5,2021,11,09
127,"Amazing stay deserves  5*, great staff and service. Book it.","I looked at many of the top hotels in London for my husbands 50th. Great staff from check in, the infinity pool, to dinner at Straits Kitchen (desserts are a must like artwork) and topped off with afternoon tea, an experience to remember. Thank you.",5,2021,11,08
127,Exceptional Hotel,"What an incredible hotel. The attention to detail is impeccable and it really is a five star experience. The team and so Friendly, attentive and thoughtful. We stayed for my friends birthday and they made it special with a chocolate treat in the room and a personalised card. Everything is luxe, the bathrooms are stunning with diptyque toiletries and a Dyson hair dryer. Beds super comfortable and all the finishings and textiles have a quality feel to them. The breakfast was incredible with lots of choice, great coffee and cooked options. Thank you for this unforgettable stay, we will definitely be back.",5,2021,11,08
127,Luxurious London,"Uber chicken  ultra luxurious stay in the heart of the city. The Pan Pacific is a fabulous modern hotel only a few months since it opened we stayed in 1901 with stunning views of the city. 

Plush, comfortable and well appointed with a Dyson hairdryer.",5,2021,11,06
127,Perfect afternoon tea/Stunning Standards of Service,"Pan Pacific is London's newest quality hotel.

The hotel's décor is a blend of Asian and European, and afternoon tea is the same. On offer is a traditional English afternoon tea and Kopi Tiam, which is a Singaporean inspired “celebration”

We had one of each – it's a good way to mix and match, try out the new, but still have the well loved elements of the traditional afternoon tea.

The food itself was excellent, sandwiches, scones all perfect, and the Kopi Tiam was a revelation (perfect dim sum, mushroom bao etc).

Cherish Finden is well known from TV cookery/travel programmes and as Executive Pastry Chef has created something original and brilliant (which given how congested the afternoon tea scene is in top London hotels is a real achievement).

The “house blend” tea matches the food perfectly.

BUT what stands out more than the food is the level of service – it's simply stunning. Everyone we came across was friendly, professional, welcoming and very, very knowledgeable/enthusiastic about the food/hotel.

A totally different and very good afternoon tea offering in a very congested market.",5,2021,11,06
127,Fantastic Stay Overnight,"I have stayed many times in the Singapore PP, and wanted to experience the new PP once opened in London.
Early check in was provided. I stayed in a Executive room, which was a wonderful room with great views. The Diptyque products were a huge personal plus for me, the room service was excellent and I had possibly the best nights sleep Ive had in a very long time (had to wake at 3.30am to get to Luton - but the sleep I did have was great)
Stand out for me was the personal touch from (possibly) head of guest services Connor (I think that was his name) I mentioned I was travelling to fuerteventura the following day to meet my family, and he slipped under my door a full hand typed personal letter - with all the best beaches and spots to check out over there during my stay.
I was super impressed by this - I will absolutley be staying again will in town on business, thankyou so much for the great stay :)",5,2021,11,05
127,Best stay in London,"My friend and I stayed for one night at the newly opened Pan Pacific, and it did not disappoint. On arrival, we were greeted by the excellent concierge team who looked after us very well during our stay. The decor is sublime, the room totally gorgeous but it’s the staff who made our stay truly unforgettable. Thank you Pan Pacific London!!",5,2021,11,04
127,Anniversary Celebration,"We would just like to express how wonderful it was to celebrate our Anniversary at your hotel over the weekend. 

Thank you for accommodating all our needs and for making our celebration extra special. Our complimentary upgraded room was very lovely and the views were amazing. The staff we came across were so welcoming and friendly, our welcome cocktail at Ginger Lily and dinner at Straits Kitchen was absolutely delicious! We had a fantastic package and could not have had a better time.

We look forward to staying with you soon.",5,2021,11,02
127,New 5 star hotel - exceptional high quality delivered with great team work,"Stayed 3 nights and the hotel was busy in spite of only being opened 2 months ago. The quality of the new building is exceptional and ultra contemporary and there is a strong focus on staff team spirit to welcome you. The location is perfect for visiting couples like ourselves but families  (and their pets!) are also well catered for. It is close to the Tower of London and the West End but we enjoyed the markets (Brick lane, Columbia st flower and Spitalfields). The area has a real buzz.

The room was was state of the art from the electric curtains, televisions and air-conditioning all controlled from switches conveniently located. Views from the rooms are excellent in the heart of the city with its high rise buildings. Our bathroom had both a rain shower and a bath. The beds were super comfortable and wide.

Pan Pacific has a wellness centre with an infinity swimming pool overlooking the square and the gym is equipped with the latest fitness equipment.

Quality of the food in the restaurant was outstanding and the cocktail bar must be one of the best in London.

 Unfortunately we did not have time for the afternoon tea but speaking to fellow guests they said that was faultless. Something for us to look forward to next time! We will return.",5,2021,11,01
127,Wonderful Hotel,"Simply can't fault this hotel. It's beautiful, a great location, the beds are amazingly comfy, rooms are totally quiet, and the interiors are lovely. However, the best thing about this hotel was the staff, they are all just wonderful. My son couldn't wait to get back from the science museum to show his space rocket to the doormen! I would thoroughly recommend the family room for a family trip to London.",5,2021,11,01
127,Beautiful hotel and staff.,"My wife and I stayed here for our 16th wedding anniversary, from booking the hotel until checkout the experience was truly amazing. 

I asked guest relations to help me make our room special for when we arrive as a surprise for my wife, when we arrived this was not mentioned at checkin which is great as my wife wasn’t to know, and when we entered the room we both cried with how beautiful it was.

All staff in the hotel were amazing but I had more interaction with guest relations due to the surprise for my wife and I couldn’t thank them enough. 

We will be returning very soon.",5,2021,11,01
127,Pretty Perfect Pan Pacific,"We decided to book into the new Pan Pacific London hotel for a one night treat stay. The whole stay was wonderful from beginning to end (only wish we were staying for more than 1 night!)

We arrived to a friendly & professional welcome from the door staff, check in was smooth & we were shown up to our executive room on the 14th floor. Being a brand new hotel everything was in immaculate condition - the finish around the hotel & in our room was to a very high standard - we loved the curved lines in the room & bathroom. The corner dual aspect view from our room was great (looking out north-easterly up Bishopsgate with the Truman brewery in view on one-side & to the east on the other side). 

It was great to have teas & coffees in the room (with milk) but unfortunately there did not appear to be any wine/champagne glasses in the room. Also, if you're not careful you may inadvertently flash neighbouring guests as it was possible to see into neighbouring rooms and for them to see into our room.

Would not hesitate to stay again and looking forward to trying other Pan Pacific properties around the world once travel restrictions are fully eased!",5,2021,10,31
127,20th Wedding anniversary celebration back at a Pan Pacific hotel.,"A special visit to celebrate our 20th Wedding anniversary after staying in the Pan Pacific Singapore on our honeymoon back in 2001. The London Hotel fully respected this and really helped us enjoy ourselves and create a special atmosphere for us. The room we were given was outstanding and all staff were so friendly and accommodating. We had a lovely time at the Bar one evening before dinner and the Pool area was incredibly relaxing - not to mention the Steam and Sauna rooms too. Everything in the hotel was brand new, clean and well-presented. With all the smiles from the staff it's impossible not to enjoy oneself from arrival to departure. We also loved the location of the hotel with an enjoyable walk to local restaurants, cafes and the Spitalfields market. Thank you PanPacificLondon for helping us celebrate our special occasion in style. Looking forward to returning one day.",5,2021,10,30
127,Pool with a view…felt like I was in Skyfall,"Great hotel near to Spitalfields and Liverpool Street. Visited as a family of four and stayed in a Premier double double room. Excellent amenities in the room with lovely toiletries and bath robes. Breakfast was included in the rate and was very varied and high quality. Complementary cocktail was also much included in the package.

Pool and well-being areas are lovely. Had a night swim, only one in the infinity pool, felt like the scene from the Skyfall movie. Sauna was also great.

Staff are very welcoming and seem genuinely interested in where you are from and what you are doing. 

Would definitely recommend for a family option.",5,2021,10,29
127,Outstanding hotel,"I just want to say a massive thank you to this wonderful hotel.  I booked a night with my 2 daughters to celebrate her 30th birthday.  The service we received was truly amazing from start to finish.  From booking the room to decorating it with baloons.  A special delivery from Veejay our Butler ..He sang Happy Birthday to my daughter.. this kind gentleman is  a true gem for the Pan Pacific Hotel.   He went above and beyond to make our stay special.  
We used the spa facilities.   Pool is beautiful.  My daughter had a pregnancy massage with a lovely lady..
This is 5 star service all the way. Thank you to all the staff for your kind care during our stay ",5,2021,10,28
127,Just perfect,"Everything about this hotel is amazing. I travelled with my daughter on a much needed weekend getaway and we couldn't have dreamed that Pan Pacific would be as fantastic as it was. Before we travelled I remarked to a friend that I just needed the hotel doors to open and feel like we were being wrapped up in a hug, and basically that's exactly how we felt. The facilities, the service, cleanliness...everything was beyond our expectations. But the staff - we have never met such friendly wonderful people who will go above and beyond to make sure you have everything you need and make you feel special. We had a small problem with our first room, but the way Callum the Duty Manager handled it was simply fantastic - thank you! The infinity pool on the 3rd floor is just WOW! We took a sunset dip on our first evening and to watch the lights of London shine was very special. From the bottom of our hearts we would like to thank all of the staff who took care of our every need and made sure that we had a weekend to remember. Thank you for being so kind to myself and my daughter and we hope to return again soon.",5,2021,10,26
127,Amazing Hotel,"I have stayed in many of London's top hotels but the newly opened Pan Pacific opposite Liverpool Street Station is a real gem. Excellent amenities including a pool and a 24 hour gym. Fantastic breakfast, and Ginger Lily is a great cocktail bar. Rooms are superb. Very spacious and well appointed. What stands out though are the staff and service which were second to none. Very highly recommended and will definitely be back.",5,2021,10,25
127,Best place to unwind,"We cannot say enough good things about the staff, they're absolutely amazing. The interiors are gorgeous, everything is of the highest quality. The one thing we'd have liked is for the pool water to be warmer, it was rather cold so we didn't enjoy it very much. Everything else, amazing.",5,2021,10,25
127,Absolute Perfection.,"Attentive and exceptional staff. Amazing Service! They went over and above my expectations in every aspect from the moment we arrived, to the bar staff, the wellness staff and room service/ kitchen staff. 

The hotel is just stunning.

Not a single bad thing to say. Amazing hotel. Will be retuning in December!",5,2021,10,24

Breakfast offers wonderful choices could not fault any food
Rooms also very spacious auto blinds and curtains
Heated floor in bathroom nice to have a dyson for blow drying 
Tea coffee ample in room.",5,2021,10,23
127,Perfect way to celebrate a birthday,"Excellent stay with a beautiful room (we were upgraded). The staff were exceptional from start to finish in their attention. Food and drinks were delicious. The view from our bedroom was partly obscured by an office building opposite, we were on the 17th floor but down the side of the hotel, hence the score of 4 rather than a 5.",4,2021,10,22
127,Anniversary celebrations,"We spent a glorious weekend at the newly opened Pan Pacific London to kick off celebrating our wedding anniversary.

When we found out it was opening, we jumped at the opportunity to have an authentic Singaporean foodie weekend given the pandemic prevented our travel back to Singapore (I’m Singaporean) in 2020 and 2021. 

The Ginger Lily cocktail bar and Straits Kitchen were brilliant, but the highlight was our afternoon tea at the Orchid Lounge. Every member of the service team from front of house to our tea sommelier Matthew and amazing pastry chef Cherish Finden ensured our experience was second to none. While each item was superb, my personal favourite was the curry puff, and chef Cherish had a piping hot fresh out of the oven one sent to our table when she found out how much I liked it. 

All in all probably one of the best London staycations we have had, and without a doubt one of the best afternoon teas in town. Highly recommended, and we will definitely be back.",5,2021,10,17

Fantastic hotel with world class ameneties only made better by extremely caring and dedicated members of staff.",5,2021,10,13

127,Great hotel. Amazing staff,Fantastic hotel with world class ameneties only made better by extremely caring and dedicated members of staff.

127,Excellent service and experience.,"From the moment we entered the hotel, to the moment we left, the experience was sublime. The staff are so friendly, the food and drink options are extensive and delicious. The rooms are spacious, clean and beautifully designed. I can't wait to go back.",5,2021,10,12
127,New hotel with plenty of class,"Just stayed overnight here and had afternoon tea. A high end immaculate hotel. Rooms beautifully apportioned with good quality amenities. All staff from front door to room are very welcoming and radiate their pride in the hotel. Included nice touches such as offering us an umbrella, unprompted, to take with us as we left, as it had just started to rain. However, it was afternoon tea that stole the show. Cherish Finden’s Kopi Tiam provides a Singaporean take on afternoon tea and blows the traditional version out of the water. The sublime dim sum, bao and puffs build towards the patisserie stars of the show with the matcha, yuzu and black sesame tower being my favourite. Being able to discuss it all with Cherish when she came to our table was an unexpected bonus. The array of teas we were able to try and the advice from the knowledgable sommelier was also a highlight. The whole experience was facilitated by the excellent staff seating and serving us. Can’t recommend this place enough.",5,2021,10,10
127,Romantic stay with proposal,"Went for my partners birthday with the intent to propose in the room comsidering the amazing views it provides. Overall experience was good. The room was amazing, the bed super comfortable, and the staff was very helpful and nice. The infinity pool and the area around it are 5 stars too! Breakfast at Strats kitchen was delicious and the cocktails at ginger Lily were carefully prepared and served with snacks. 
Asked for a romantic setting beforehand and got a call from their customer relations team which I was very satisfied with, just a few details were agreed like a surprise birthday cake that was forgotten unfortunately but did not make a big deal out of it. Romantic set up for the room was beautiful with the petals but the smart candles used would just not lit up so kind of lost the pretended effect. Again not a big deal, went through with the proposal and she said yes 😀
Can only thank all the staff for the amazing experience, really made these 2 days unforgettable.",4,2021,10,09
127,Most amazing wedding anniversary treat we had!,"Best hotel experience, they upgraded our room to Deluxe since it’s our anniversary and gave us a sweet treat! The room is so big, overlooking on the city of London, my first time swimming in London and its amazing how cold outside and you are in the pool 😅

They have dyson hair dryer and hair straighteners,
Amazing service and they treat you like a VIP, gym that is so modern and i love the virtual augmented! I spent most of my time there hahaha, they have sauna and steam room that is also amazing! The breakfast is also good! Not so singaporean but definitely delicious! 

They also have relaxation lounge which is really over the top! Even when you checkout already you can still use their amenities (yep we went to the gym and pool again hahaha) oh and their Dyptique toiletries is very luxurious, the only hotel shampoo and conditioner that acceptable for my fuzzy hair!",5,2021,10,06
127,The best hotel experience I have encountered.,"10/10. No complains. It was just perfect. Can't wait to go back!

The room and bathroom were very clean and beautiful, very comfortable bed, the view was breathtaking and the staff was amazing. They went over and beyond to help make our stay enjoyable. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting London.

The best part? The infinity pool :)",5,2021,10,05
127,A fusion of London and Asia in the City,"It's not often that I give a 10-star rating but this deserves it. I have never stayed in a five-star hotel, let alone one that had recently opened as it didn’t come up in my initial search back in August. 

From the beginning of booking the room, it was great to register on their website as you get a discount and the price was much better than the other comparison websites, plus you get that little bit extra. As this was a surprise birthday present there were many back-and-forth emails with the hotel and they were so accommodating to all of my needs.

 Location was the key and this was right in the heart of the city and a two-minute walk to the restaurant I'd booked. From the moment I step through those doors I was welcomed with open arms and smiles and even though there was a little mixup with the booking the staff reassured me that everything was going to be fine which made me not get upset, it was better than I ever imagined. 

The interior of the hotel made me feel that I was on a destination holiday, the interior colouring blended with eachother well and gave a hint of tropics. My room or shall I say the suite was amazing, so spacious, have everything I needed with a great view of the city above ground level, I couldn’t want for anything more. 

I wanted to do a quick round of the hotel before but I needed to get ready and unfortunately, time wasn't on my side. When my partner finally got to see the place after dinner the word Mamma Mia got used alot which was very good! 

We both got to explore the relaxation/spa area the following day and that's what it was, an area to relax in and mostly all to ourselves. That infinity pool which overlooked Liverpool Street and the heat in the steam and sauna, it was a shame not to be able to enjoy together but it's this is the best spa area I have been to within a hotel in London.

I just wish we had more time to stay in our suite, enjoy the bath, the minibar, having breakfast and treatments.

Would I stay here again, even though I live in London, it's a definite YES!",5,2021,10,04
127,A fantastic break!,"From the moment we walked in to the minute we sadly departed, everything about our stay was beyond expectation.  Check in was a breeze, full of smiles and this immediately put us at ease. We were given a personal tour of the amazing well-being floor with its infinity pool and state of the art gym. Then up to our room on the 18th floor with fantastic views of London. The room is perfectly appointed, the bed is incredible, what more can I say, you have to visit! We booked afternoon tea which was a fantastic experience, brilliant service, we could have stayed there all day. The bar is another delight with friendly and highly experienced staff. Again, we were made to feel at ease and very welcome. Dinner was again another triumph, try the chilli crab but take your own bib! I could go on, every member of staff was a delight to speak to, every part of the hotel was stunning. We will return. Thanks Xinchen and everyone else we met. You are all a credit to the hotel.",5,2021,10,04
127,Best Hotel in London,"Stayed at this hotel last weekend and it was the most fabulous hotel experience we ever had. The hotel just opened a few weeks ago and everything is shinny brand new and the interior design of this hotel and public  was mind blowing. The staff at the welcoming desk were extremely polite and helpful and also very proactive by anticipating our needs, We went for dinner at Straits restaurant and it was the most amazing dining experience ever and the best asian food we ever had. The service was impeccable. I have been to many asian restaurants such as Park Chinois, Hakassan, China Tang etc.... but Straits was well above them all in terms of the quality of it's cuisine, service, restaurant design and ambience. Also went to Ginger the cocktail bar after dinner and it was very good and also very warn and cozy.  The hotel public spaces and our bedroom was spotless clean and felt very safe. Can't wait be back again !!",5,2021,10,04
127,Outstanding service,"Beautiful place and absolutely outstanding service! We booked in at the restaurant and were greeted in our native language, by both our servers..which was such a special, warm welcome. The staff noticed we were celebrating 2 special occasions of an engagement and also baby to come and they went the extra mile to gift us 2 stunning memorable desserts! Ilyas looked after us and was so thoughtful and helpful. Truly, the food and decore was lovely, but what this place truly unforgettable for the most amazing service!  5 * can't recommend enough and the set menu was delicious. ",5,2021,10,03
127,Brilliant service with a smile. Wonderful with my little granddaughter. Will definitely be back.,"Wonderful service.
Extremely helpful staff who went above and beyond. Relaxing break. Restaurant was impeccable. Unfortunately did not get a chance to use the spa/pool but had a look round and will definitely use the facilities next time. Thank you to all the staff.",5,2021,10,01
127,"Fantastic hotel, amazing staff and brilliant location","Amazing stay, the staff were all outstanding! We stayed for a special birthday and the staff had left a delicious cake and lovely hand written card in the room. 
The ‘signature’ hunt for children is a lovely touch, our daughter loved her prize.

The hotel is in a great location, a few minutes walk from Liverpool Street Station, and very close to Spitalfields market and shopping area.",5,2021,09,29
127,Beautiful Hotel!,"We stayed here for my fiancé’s birthday, the hotel was so beautiful, the staff did everything they could to make the stay special for us and even upgraded our room as well as helping me to organise birthday balloons in the room upon arrival. The rooms are gorgeous with automatic curtains, high quality bedding towels and robes etc and an amazing view!! The location was amazing right near the train and tube station and lots of gorgeous restaurants and bars, if you struggle to get into any bars, go to the reception concierge and they will sort it, the staff are FAB! The infinity pool area is just divine also, the hotel is amazing for relaxing! We will 100% be back!!",5,2021,09,29
127,Utterly remarkable all the way,"Utterly remarkable all the way
10/10
Liked  · A wonderful 5-star experience so very, very close to Liverpool Street Station. - From the moment I approached the doormen I was taken care of in the nicest possible, elegant and inobsequious way I remember of any 5-star anywhere. From Alex (?) the concierge, to Kelly the receptionist who was kind enough to show me to my room personally and give me a charming induction to the tech involved. Although this was mostly work, my wife and I managed to get a lovely later-evening out of it. I think the best recommendation one may afford a place is to return, and we’re returning very soon for a non-work related, full three-night weekend in the City and beyond.

Disliked  · Room for minor improvement: 1) At breakfast it would be really nice to have your own pot of coffee on the table, or at least having it served a little more quickly (this is my darling wife) … 2) I think being able to get a ‘proper’ English breakfast tea at appropriate strength in one’s teapot at breakfast might be nice, i.e. two to three teabags of the ‘Pan Pacific House English Breakfast Tea’ per pot might be a good idea, and not just the one. I know, I could have asked for it but didn’t, so as just to see what they might do. The blend of the breakfast tea however was very good indeed … 3) It would also be nice to have the breakfast-included bits of the menu - in my case poached egg on toast - be displayed a little less ‘coldly & basic’, e.g. maybe a little decoration like dried parsley sprinkled over the plate, etc.",5,2021,09,27
127,Outstanding Stay in Pan Pacific London hotel,"As a frequent traveler who enjoys staying in hotels, I thought I have seen and tried most types and experienced the various management teams. 
So when I was offered to stay in a brand new hotel that opened only a week before my arrival named Pan Pacific London, I thought why not try it, especially that it’s location was very accessible and close to my daughter university in East London. 
The Pan Pacific London exceeded my expectations at all levels for a London hotel, starting from the facilities quality and premises, to the more important hotel team, at all levels. 
You will always be greeted with your name, and recognized whenever you call for any service. They have a diverse team that is United in their service standard and professionalism. 
You will always be made to feel at home through your use of the facilities, which are brand new and of the highest quality that you may find in London. 
The food variety and quality, are of the highest standards. Whether in their buffet breakfast or in-room dining, you will taste the best quality of items offered. Special dietary requirements like Gluten free bread and types of non-dairy milks are easily available and provided upon your request. Their service and team at the various departments all share a smile on their face and a will to provide you, their client, with what you need or request . They are really special. 
My family and I spent an amazing time in the Pan Pacific London in September, felt like we were at home away from home, and enjoyed our time immensely while in the hotel. 
We found our home during our London Visits.",5,2021,09,26
127,Kopitiam Afternoon Tea,"Absolutely delicious. We had an amazing wedding anniversary celebration in the Orchid Lounge, sharing an afternoon tea away from the bustle of Liverpool Street. Every mouthful was delicious and Cherish's eye for beauty and textures was in each savoury and sweet treat. We felt so well looked after and are already planning our return trip 🥂",5,2021,09,25
127,Exceptional hotel,"Exceptional hotel, staff were excellent, hotel was beautifully decorated and rooms were immaculate. Real luxury in the city. I particularly liked the infinity pool! Great location so I’ll definitely be back as long as rates don’t increase too much.",5,2021,09,25
127,Luxury in London,"Great hotel and very attentive staff. Rooms were luxurious and the pool was very relaxing. Easy location, close to the Liverpool Street Tube station. I would certainly recommend and will be looking to stay at this hotel again in the future",5,2021,09,24
127,Amazing stay,"From the moment we stepped into the beautiful reception area we were warmly greeted by the reception area staff and the concierge (Mars/Lars)? was super efficient and assisted us with our luggage.  He also made sure we knew how to use the facilities in the room (light switches and curtain functions etc).  Everything was impeccable, attention to detail was obvious and the chamomile tea in the Japanese tea pot was a lovely touch.  We had breakfast and the variety of food was amazing. We visited the pool and gym area, but didn't use it as unfortunately we had to get to work but would love to come back to use the facilities.  Every staff member we met were extremely polite, professional and a credit to the hotel.",5,2021,09,24
127,A fantastic hotel with polite friendly staff that make your stay special.,"A fantastic hotel with polite friendly staff that make your stay special, in a great location this hotel is luxury at it's best. The hotel is very new having only opened this month. This trip was for business but I will return for a stay with my wife",5,2021,09,24
127,Beautiful afternoon tea!,"My parents and I had the most beautiful afternoon tea here. The menu was curated by Cherish Finden and she stopped by and talked to us about it for ten minutes! Starstruck!

Every single part of the experience was luxurious. The Orchid Lounge was beautiful. Special mention to Giuseppe who put up with my Dad’s broken Italian while we were there!! His service was fantastic. 

I would heartily recommend anyone to come and visit.",5,2021,09,22
127,Afternoon Tea at The Orchid Lounge,"As huge fans of Cherish Finden we were very excited to try her brand new afternoon, to celebrate my mother's birthday. We knew of Pan Pacific's reputation, but was hesitant on booking on the third weekend of opening - well, there was absolutely nothing to be hesitant about!

Everything was spectacular. The Kopi Tiam afternoon tea is a unique experience of sweet and savoury bites, full of delicious flavours, all of which are completely different from each other, but somehow work harmoniously.

The Orchard Lounge is a beautiful setting, with plush sofas, stunning decor, and wonderful big windows with views of everyone getting rained on whilst you enjoyed your hot tea. The rest of the hotel looked incredible, if we didn't live in the area we'd want to stay overnight!

The staff are truly wonderful, professional, and warm - special thanks to Benjamin, Augustine, and Matthew.

Overall a fabulous experience, can't wait to return!",5,2021,09,22
127,Impeccable service and exquisite comfort,"My husband and I stayed for our anniversary and the staff made it really special for us and were super friendly — really can’t thank them enough. In particular, Alex who showed us our room, and Rita and Flavia at the front desk, though honestly everyone we met was lovely and made the stay so relaxing and enjoyable. The room is unbelievably comfortable and the view is magnificent. Great location to relax and escape in the middle of the city.",5,2021,09,21
127,Oasis in the city,"Having stayed in Pan Pacific Hotels in Asia we were very excited to experience the  new London Hotel. It did not disappoint! The overall ambiance and decor made it truly feel like an oasis of calm in the heart of the busy city.
The staff all of whom could not not have been more friendly and attentive made the service exceptional.
We took full use of all the hotel facilities with an excellent meal in Straits  Restaurant and an exceptional experience with Cherish Findens Afternoon Tea - not to be missed- made even more special by meeting the Chef herself who took time to chat to each group 
Before we checked out on Sunday morning we visited the infinity pool and spa 
Overall a truly luxury five star experience",5,2021,09,20
127,Perfect in every way,"We were treated to an overnight stay here by our children to celebrate our golden wedding anniversary. It was a most wonderful experience from the moment we arrived in the foyer and were greeted by Calum and Tom and all  the staff and then shown to our room after having delicious drinks in the bar and greeted by V J our butler for our stay.  Our room on the 19th floor had beautiful views west across the city  and was very  luxurious perfectly decorated and some lovely features ie the most comfortable bed lovely towels and Diptque toiletries in the bathroom and a Dyson hairdryer. The infinity pool on the 4th floor is an oasis of calm and was a lovely way to end our evening
But it is the staff that make this hotel stand out from all the rest. They were truly wonderful kept our surprise a secret until we knew we were staying the night. The biggest thank you to you all",5,2021,09,19
127,Great service/room with some minor teething problems,"This is a really lovely hotel. All the staff are incredibly welcoming and attentive (perhaps a little too attentive, if you prefer more anonymity in your hotel stays!)—going above-and-beyond to make sure guests feel valued and well-looked after. 

We arrived just after midday & the reception staff didn’t hesitate in checking us in early. 

Ours was a double room on the 16th floor which was immaculate and spacious with super comfortable furnishings, great amenities (especially the very generous Diptyque toiletry offerings) and excellent views of the City. 

My partner had work to do, so I made a beeline for the infinity pool on the 4th Floor which was a surreal treat—swimming with views over Devonshire House/Square. The water temp was nicely cool but it was still pretty chlorinated (disappointing for those of us with reactive/sensitive skin) so I couldn’t stay in for too long and didn’t return for the rest of our one-night stay. 

I was looking forward to having a Steam Room after my swim, but this was still being fitted and wouldn’t be opening for a week or so … which leads me to the rationale behind my lower rating for Pan Pacific. 

The Pan Pacific London is an exceptional hotel, or at least it will be once all of its amenities finally open. 

Like the Steam Room, its café (Patisserie) hadn’t finished being built/fitted yet, nor had another of its restaurants. On top of this, there were a few technical teething problems that impacted our stay: room keys that didn’t work; lifts that wouldn’t move on four occasions (apparently, due to some security system migration); and a TV issue when trying to work the ChromeCast that led to a white menu panel superimposing itself onto the screen for about an hour. I’ve no doubt the wonderful staff would have attended to this problem if we had made mention of it, but these are the sort of minor things that one doesn’t want to have to deal with when you’re only away for one night. 

If I hadn’t paid for our stay with Avios points, then I might have been more disappointed by these hiccups and the lack of the full Pan Pacific experience, but despite all of this—I do highly recommend this hotel & would be happy to return to avail of its full suite of offerings at a later date.",4,2021,09,18
127,Amazing staff!! Great location and stay.,"The staff at this hotel are wonderful. Special mention to Tom/Calum on front desk, Daisy/Ilyas at Straits kitchen and Cecilia at the bar. 
The infinity pool overlooking the city is a unique and great feature of the hotel. The rooms were spacious and I particularly liked the dyson hairdryer that I could use away from home. 
We combined a work/couples trip and location worked well (walking distance to museums, Shoreditch etc) Fab start for this new hotel…",5,2021,09,15
127,surprising find in the city,"Even with the hotel being open a few weeks, as this is their first opening outside of APAC, they have provided a truly relaxing affair from the moment you walk in from the street. The whole atmosphere has a different sense to it, from the downstairs area, including the Ginger Bar, to the spa area and pool on the 4th floor, everything hits the mark. I even fell asleep for the 1st time ever in the pool area even though I had not intended to, that in itself shows how relaxing the building is here. The food in the restaurant is wow, the chilli lobster we had with the buttered steak and copious amounts of wine was excellent... If you fancy something different with a pool with a view, then this is the hotel for you.",5,2021,09,14
127,Overnight stay,"As other reviews have mentioned the staff are polite, attentive and make your stay feel very special. The rooms are sleek, modern and the attention to detail is second to none with fabulous view of the city. The atmosphere throughout the hotel is one of calm and tranquility and you really do feel like you're getting away from it all, even though Liverpool Street station is only a few yards away. The food is excellent – make sure you try a dessert! We will be returning in the future. Thanks to all the team for a fabulous stay.",5,2021,09,14
127,Film,"Amazing service, staff was smiling and so polite. 
From the moment I walked in to checkout I felt like they treated me like a queen. 
I would definitely recommend this place to all. 
Thank you for an amazing stay 🥰",5,2021,09,14
127,Unbeatable,"If you are looking for a secret gem in the city the Pan Pacific cannot be beaten. A brand new hotel with incredible views, great location and sublime staff.
The whole team although only open for a couple of weeks make your stay incredible.
The attention to detail is amazing. The spa has an amazing infinity pool and luxurious places to shake off your stress. Our son though the robe in the spa the most luxurious thing he had ever worn, actually both our children thought it the most beautiful and luxurious hotel they had stayed in and we have travelled extensively.

The food is fabulous and has some really wonderful Asian dishes.
 The rooms are out of this world with wet room showers, Diptique toiletries and incredibly good quality amenities. The bed dominated a massive room but in the best way possible. The offering is nothing like we have experienced before. Unique, impressive. A major thank you to Anne, Stephen and Victor and all of the team for making our stay incredible. The boys want to go back at half term. I may have to see what their availability is......",5,2021,09,13
127,Special Anniversary Treat,"It was our 38th wedding anniversary and from the moment we arrived we were made to feel special. All the staff were amazing and the attention to detail throughout the hotel was superb. Unfortunately our visit had to to be cut short due to back problems, but we were able to enjoy the room and the spa with Veejay in attendance :). We want to return to finish our anniversary celebration part II.",5,2021,09,13

127,Highly Reccommended,"I celebrated my 40th Birthday at the new Pan Pacific Hotel and I was completely blown away! From my arrival at the hotel till I checked out, I received a seamless experience.  The room was very comfortable and spacious with a great city view, the service was exceptional. Its normal for new hotels have a few teething problems but my stay was absolutely perfect with no issues at all!  Tow of my highlights was the chilli lobster in Straits Kitchen, and the Infinity Pool.  The hotel followed COVID Safety procedures and I felt safe!  Its a luxurious property and I would definitely recommend.",5,2021,09,13
127,Fantastic service and beautiful hotel,"The staff bent over backward to help us, the room was amazing and the wellness centre so relaxing.  The infinity pool overlooking London was a particular highlight of the stay. Rooms from the 13th floor up have the best views. The breakfast had a nice selection and included in the room price is an extensive buffet and also a nice selection al a carte. The location is a 1 minute walk from Liverpool Street station",5,2021,09,11
127,Outstanding service and a deluxe experience,"What a brilliant stay, from entry to exit everything was perfect!!

127,Want a luxurious relaxing haven in London? THIS is it :-),"Wow! This hotel has quickly become my new favourite hotel in London … whilst I know it’s brand new so everything should feel crisp, fresh and faultless I really can imagine that they will work hard to keep it looking and feeling spot on. 

Great location close to the tube, next to Heron/Salesforce Tower it’s in a cracking spot. Right from the greeting from lovely reception staff I knew it was going to be special. My room was HUGE, and so well appointed. Ridiculously comfy bed, amazing bathroom, and wonderful amenities. The bar staff at Ginger Lily are top class. They truly go above and beyond to look after you, super friendly and wizards at making delicious cocktails. Wonderful breakfast. Then of course we have the pool … seriously a decent size, and a real relaxing haven area around it. I felt like I was on holiday whilst there. 

There’s honestly not enough superlatives to describe my weekend at the Pan Pacific. I will be back!",5,2021,09,05
127,A truly 5 star stay with 5 star staff 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟,"We had an overnight stay for the opening week on their first weekend. The welcome on arrival was amazing, the staff are just absolutely fantastic! 

We loved the infinite pool and the loungers etc are so relaxing, we cannot wait to re-visit and try the relaxation pods! 

Every member of staff we encountered was lovely! They remembered our names the following day and nothing was too much trouble. Cecelia (hopefully I have spelt her name correctly) in Ginger Lily was superb. She even recognised us the following day when we were walking around the area and came over to say Hi which was lovely. 

The beds are so comfy and the robes are so soft! I did actually look to see if they were able to be purchased but I couldn’t see anything on the website to say so and I didn’t want to ask 😂! They are so so soft! 

Turn down service is a lovely touch. The room we had 1711 had a gorgeous view of The Gherkin. The bathroom and toiletries are amazing too! 

We were staying for my husbands Birthday and we had a lovely card and choccy treat left for him as well as one with dinner. 

We can’t wait to come back and visit again! Thank you to all the staff. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟",5,2021,09,05
127,Wonderful stay! Truly 5*,"My children and I spent a night at Pan Pacific London during its first opening week.   We were treated like royalty - firstly, an upgraded and very spacious room and then a lovely birthday treat was left in our room for my daughter by Tom (reception) including a choccy nut mousse ball and a mini tower of sweets. 

The pool was lively, decent sized and not too busy. We relaxed there with drinks.

Breakfast was a delicious mix of buffet and hot choices - the only time we noticed that the hotel was still finding its feet.  I got offered other people's breakfasts twice and the waiting staff appeared to be a little confused and not totally in rhythm.  Fans of Bake Off: The Professionals might be disappointed by the croissants - decidedly 3* hotel affairs which cannot have been made or chosen by Ms Finden.  I strongly suspect they are brought in frozen and cooked onsite.  A shame given the high quality of the other food available.

Special mentions also to Mars (luggage/room assistance) and Valter (doorman), both of whom have stellar customer service skills.

But actually all the staff (and guests) we met were a delight and we will be back for more visits very soon.",5,2021,09,05
127,I wish I could give more than 5 stars!,"This hotel is absolutely sensational. I cannot believe how accommodating & attentive the staff are! I have never stayed anywhere where the staff have been so lovely. Also we were lucky enough to visit on their opening week! So they upgraded our standard room to a premium suite at no extra charge.

Kelly and another gentleman greeted us on arrival (didn’t catch his name- sorry!), and the welcoming was so warm. They gave us the grand tour whilst someone else took our bags to our room. The wellness floor including pool & gym were fab, and it’s so refreshing to stay at a hotel where the pool is open for long hours (6am-10pm!), normally the pool opening times for other hotels are very restrictive. 

My other half brought his PS5 and one of the technicians came to the room to show him how to connect it to their amazing TV. Very accommodating! 

Unfortunately the next morning he was feeling really unwell (absolutely no fault of the hotel- he was a tad unwell before we visited) and they were so kind, the gentleman on reception arranged for a bacon roll, fruit & pastry selection to be brought to the room so we could both enjoy breakfast in our own space. That evening we got a takeaway from Spitalfield’s and the doorman even asked if he could send ice, glasses, cutlery & plates to the room for us. Throughout the duration of our stay the staff were checking on him to ensure he was okay, and was asking if there was anything they could do to make him feel better. They truly care so much about their guests well-being!

The room itself was stunning, the bathroom was out of this world and a luxury I could only dream of at home. Also the in-room inclusive extras were beyond what you would get in any other hotel: luxury shampoo & conditioner, complimentary hair brush, bamboo toothbrushes. And mini tubes of toothpaste- such a handy thought as it is something I often forget when travelling! 

On our final day we visiting the breakfast buffet which was extensive, you could choose a cooked option such as poached eggs & toast or bacon & eggs, as well as the luxurious continental selection. 

If one day I win the lottery, I would be staying at this hotel every weekend! We have both said we cannot wait to return for our anniversary. What a truly magical hotel to stay at.",5,2021,09,05
127,Amazing hotel,"Stayed in the hotel overnight and was lucky enough to be there for the opening party.
From start to finish the stay was perfect. The staff are exceptional. So friendly and helpful. The hotel and the amenities are amazing. Careful consideration has been taken when making sure guests have everything they need. A must place to visit or stay when in London. Can't wait to return. Thank you for an amazing stay.",5,2021,09,04
127,Luxury!,"We booked two rooms for a one night stay at this beautiful hotel on its first day of opening.  

On arrival, we were greeted with a personalised warm welcome from the doormen and concierge who could not have been more helpful.  

This warm welcome was followed through, throughout our stay by all the staff in the hotel.

Our rooms were state of the art, beautifully appointed with everything we needed. 

Despite our stay being short we wanted as much as possible, to utilise and enjoy the hotel facilities.  

We dined in the hotel, enjoying breakfast and a special evening dinner in Straits Kitchen. 

Two standouts for us:

1.	We travelled with two small children (3 years and the other 4 months).  All the staff went out of their way to accommodate them and make their stay extra special. 

2.	Afternoon Tea – This was a highlight, having all looked forward to the experience, the service, care and attention to detail was exceptional.

As they say ‘the difference between something good and something great is the attention to detail’.  ‘The detail’ was in abundance here, we all loved the experience and we can’t wait to return.",5,2021,09,04
127,Five star luxury in the heart of the city!,"This brand new hotel is everything you expect, and more from a city hotel. With a personalised welcome from the door staff and concierge, to a genuine welcome by the front desk who ensure you get the most out of your stay. 

Rooms are large with wonderful views across London. Beds are huge enough to get lost in and certainly encourage a great nights sleep, so much so they’re difficult to emerge from, but a welcome breakfast from the hotel restaurant is more than enough to get you going. 

Service in all of the restaurants and bars is superb, with all staff taking a great understanding  of what’s on offer! Definitely grab a cocktail from the knowledgeable guys behind the bar! 

If you must check out, make sure you hit the wellness centre first! As there’s a pool like no other. 

We didn’t want to leave…",5,2021,08,31

Luis Rodriguez and his entire concierge team are incredible! They have the best disposition to help make your stay in the hotel and the city the best. I would not hesitate twice to recommend it and return when I am in the city. A pleasure to find such high-class hotels.
Its location is a luxury and its facilities are impeccable!",5,2024,05,23
127,Perfection in the heart of London.,"In the heart of the City, a perfect hotel in every element, from the doorman at the reception, to the reception staff, to the furnishings of the entrance, to the well-structured, well-furnished and spotless room, from which to enjoy an extraordinary view of the skyscrapers of the City and in detail on the ""Gherkin"" designed by architect Norman Foster.
In addition to the perfect services inside the hotel, it guaranteed us excellent transport services, to and from the airport, for a tour of London.",5,2024,05,07
127,Marvelous,Awesome. Everything in its place. Iodine a hotel luxury. Super well located. Too bad time to have enjoyed their services.,5,2024,04,24
127,Spectacular,"Beautiful hotel, in an excellent location, large, spacious and spotlessly clean room, complete bathroom set, Nespresso coffee machine, large shower. Attentive and kind service, breakfast perhaps a little too expensive. Heated swimming pool, sauna",5,2024,01,22

127,Fabulous!!!,"Excellent location, very close to Liverpool Station.
Beautiful hotel, common areas with attention to the smallest details.
The room, a Premier Room, very spacious, really beautiful and well-kept.
The breakfast was fabulous, plentiful and above all delicious",5,2023,10,17
127,Spectacular Hotel,"Best location, fantastic hotel. We stayed at the hotel with our two children. The room was excellent, the staff was great, the infinity pool was fantastic (unfortunately only available to children between 7am and 9am and 4pm and 6pm)",5,2023,10,09
127,A wonderful stay,"The hotel facilities are splendid: cleanliness, services, comfortable beds and wonderful staff, among whom I would like to highlight David in the hall and Luis in the pool, two people who went out of their way to make our stay even better. The staff is 10 in the hotel according to him",5,2023,09,12
127,"Stylish hotel, very good service","Very stylish hotel, 300 m from Liverpool St. Station, from where you have good connections everywhere. Very good service, beautiful rooms, super friendly and helpful staff. Various pubs, restaurants and shops in the immediate vicinity. Distance to the Tower about 10 - 15 minutes, to Covent Garden about 45 minutes on foot.",4,2023,08,30
127,Ottimo soggiorno,"Ottimo albergo, vicino alla metro, il personale è gentilissimo, le camere molto belle. Hanno molta attenzione ai bambini a cui propongono una sorta di caccia al tesoro in cambio di un premio.
L'unica critiche sono che le regole della colazione non sono chiarissime  ",5,2023,06,30
127,Sehr guter entspannender Aufenthalt,"Sehr gutes und zentrales Hotel.Vor allem sehr sauber und sehr höfliche Mitarbeiter ,insbesondere Mrs Rita aus Protugal am Front Desk beim Ankommen. Ich empfehle dieses Hotel am meisten wegen der Höflichkeit und Sauberkeit",5,2023,05,31
127,Ottimo,"Ottimo hotel, a 200m dalla metro (liverpool street). Vicinissimo al tower bridge, tower of london, st Paul Cathedral e millenium bridge.
Camere silenziose, pulite ed accoglienti.
Colazione discreta, abbastanza varia ma non eccezionale.
Personale super.  Tutti, dal primo all'ultimo, sono stati attentissmi al cliente, sempre gentili e sorridenti oltre che disponibilissimi.
Abbiamo fatto un afternoon tea eccezionale e che consiglio assolutamente. La nostra cameriera gentilissima ed attenta al dettaglio. Qualità e presentazione dei piatti ottimi. Vasta scelta di the.

Concierge disponibile e preparato. Luis ci ha consigliato bene ed è riuscito a trovarci un tavolo in un ristorante che non aveva disponibilità per l'orario da noi richiesto.

Piscina bella, dalle 17 alle 18 è utilizzata dai bambini. Dopo le 18 forse un po'affollata per riuscire a nuotare bene. Struttura pulita e con vista sulla piazza.

In generale un ottimo hotel, che consiglio e dove tornerei.",5,2023,05,31
127,Fantastico,"Un hotel nuovo, con tutti i confort, comodo e posizionato in Liverpool Street, pulito, cortesi, un po’ troppo servizievoli, un hotel essenziale e comodo.
La camera molto bella, silenziosa soprattutto una vista magnifica",5,2023,01,29
127,"Kinder sind nicht willkommen, nicht als Familie buchen.","Die positiven Bewertungen des Hotels sind nur schwer nachvollziehbar. Wir haben zwar ein schönes Zimmer im 18. Stock aber die sind extrem hellhörig zum Nachbarn.
Die Betten sind schlimm (kurz, extrem weich).
Das Frühstück ist mäßig, eher asiatisch orientiert. Man versucht hier zusätzlich zum regulären Preis die ganzen interessanten gegen Gebühr zu verkaufen.
Die Bar ist für Kinder verboten…also geht es in die Lobby oder zum Restaurant, wo man dann aber jemanden suche muss, der noch etwas auftischt.

Noch schlimmer: der vielbeworbene Poolist für Familien praktisch nicht nutzbar. Entweder nur morgens ein kleines 2h Zeitfenster oder mitten am Nachmittag 2h. Nichts also mit Stadtour und dann um 17 Uhr mal noch schnell mit der Family relaxen. Absolut unverschämt: am Wochenende wird damit geworben, dass man ja jetzt 2x3 Stunden Zeitfenster hat. Aber: dafür muss man schon um 10 statt um 11 den Pool räumen. Also muss man sich zwischen Frühstück oder Pool entscheiden? Frechheit.

Die Lage ist O.K., gibt sicher bessere für einen Städtetrip.
Wir werden nicht wieder kommen.

127,Poco adatto alle famiglie,"Hotel situato nella zona della City, degli uffici, banche, assicurazioni.
La vista dalla camera era molto suggestiva e la camera quadrupla stessa presentava buone dimensioni, un solo bagno e ottime dotazioni.
Personale veramente veramente ottimo, anche con i bambini sono stati gentilissimi.
Per la visita della città non è sicuramente comodo con i bambini viaggiare avanti e indietro. La piscina non è fruibile, l'acqua è ghiacciata.
Colazione buona ma nulla di memorabile, in room service anche. 
La fermata di Liverpool Street dista 3 minuti a piedi. Il target dell'hotel sono le persone che lavorano in trasferta.",4,2022,12,19
127,Muy bueno,"El hotel es muy moderno, es prácticamente nuevo, cuenta con cafetera Nespresso, variedades de tes, agua, algunas amenidades como papas y chocolate se bienvenida. El baño es bastante cómodo, grande, separado la ducha y tina, la cual es espaciosa y te dejan sales de baño.
Tiene plancha lo que es muy útil
Hay algunas cosas mejorables:
La cama si bien es muy cómoda, es muy calurosa a pesar del aire, quizás dos capas seria mas cómodo.
Tiene un pequeña mesita por si quieres comer, pero solo tiene una silla.
En general excelente, cero ruido externo y lo demás es super mejorable.",4,2022,09,29
127,Estupendo hotel en la City,"Hotel de cinco estrellas en la City de Londres, a un minuto de Liverpool Station.

Instalaciones: el hotel es grande y muy alto, creo que 18 plantas. Es muy nuevo, lo que es un gustazo.

Habitación: buen tamaño. Se respira lujo, acorde a la categoría del hotel y al precio. La decoración es muy cálida.

Cama: muy grande. King size, de unos 2.15 metros de ancho. Sábanas de máxima calidad.

Baño: grande, con una gran ducha sin mampara ni cortina. La pega es que no hay mucha presión de agua, y al menos en mi habitación el agua no salía muy caliente.

Toallas: máxima calidad, al igual que el albornoz

Amenities: muy buenos, gel y champú estupendos. Te dejan un par de botellas de agua en la habitación y una cubitera con hielo. También hay una Nespresso con cápsulas gratuitas. El minibar es entero de pago.

Climatización: la habitación cuando llegué estaba congelada. No es muy intuitivo regular el clima y ponerlo caliente.

TV: muy grande, diría que 55 pulgadas

Desayuno: muy bueno, es buffet y también puedes pedir carta.

Personal: muy amable y dispuesto.

",4,2022,09,21
127,Absolut perfekt.,"Wir waren schon in vielen sehr guten Hotels, aber dieses gehört definitiv zu den Top5. Es stimmte einfach alles, vom Anfang bis zum Ende. 

Super Lage, zuvorkommender und herzlicher Service und wunderschöne Zimmer. Einzig ein Kosmetikspiegel im Bad wäre großartig gewesen. 

Ab sofort unser Hotel der Wahl für London.",5,2022,08,07
127,Mi favorito en La City,Pan Pacific tiene las ventajas de un hotel recién construido y el servicio de un hotel de primera clase.  Habitaciones de buen tamaño y muy iluminadas y un servicio que destaca por su amabilidad y eficiencia.   Estuve por períodos largos en tres ocasiones y siempre fue muy consistente.,5,2022,06,25
